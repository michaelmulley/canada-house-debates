have the honour to present, in English and in French, the report of 
the 6th annual meeting of the Canada-Japan Interparliamentary 
Group, held in Tokyo and Osaka from September 9 to 16, 1995.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Japan is Canada's largest trading partner after the United States. 
The volume of trade has more than doubled since 1985 and is 
increasingly diversified in composition.
<P>
	In 1994 Canada's exports to Japan rose 13 per cent to $9.5 
billion, resulting in an increase of over $1 billion for the second 
year in a row.
<P>
	Ignoring the impact of liberalized Japanese markets and 
increased Canadian competitiveness, projected exports from 
Canada to Japan will climb to $14 billion in the year 2002, which is 
80 per cent greater than 1993 levels.
<P>
<B>(1005 )</B>
<P>
	While in Japan, members of the delegation were able to express 
Canadian concerns and promote Canadian excellence with our 
Japanese counterparts. This will help ensure a growing Canadian 
presence in the Japanese market and allow us to work with our 
business  communities in encouraging increased commercial 
activity with Japan.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTEQUITYACT">EMPLOYMENT EQUITY ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 16 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-64, an act respecting employment equity, be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
millions of Canadian workers experience barriers preventing them 
from participating as fully as possible in the labour market. For 
example, many women continue to be ghettoized in low paying and 
part time work. In spite of that fact, in 1990 women obtained 55 per 
cent of university bachelor degrees.
<P>
	Unjust hiring criteria, attitudinal barriers and uneven training 
and promotion practices still prevent women, as well as persons 
with disabilities, aboriginal people and members of visible 
minorities, from achieving equality in the workplace.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	In light of these facts there can be no doubt in anyone's mind that 
employment equity is not only a good thing, it is a necessary thing. 
Good business practice would require that companies do something 
to improve access to world markets. Members of ethnocultural  
communities, with insider cultural linguistic knowledge as well as 
contacts with their country of origin, can play a key role in 
penetrating new markets. They are a rich resource in the workplace 
environment.
<P>
	It is puzzling to me how the Reform Party can fail to see the 
desirability of the bill now before the House. My colleagues on the 
opposite side of the Chamber seem frozen in time. I have news for 
them, the past cannot be resuscitated. The 1950s are over.
<P>
	We live in a radically restructured working world, different from 
anything that has gone before. Rapidly changing technologies and 
failing trade barriers are globalizing the economy, challenging us 
to become more competitive.
<P>
	Canada's export driven economy is heavily dependent on foreign 
sales. Expansion into emerging markets, most notably in Latin 
America and Asia, will change even further our economic reality.
<P>
	This greater interdependence poses new challenges. It means 
that our business organizations must be able to understand the 
culture and outlook of our new consumers.
<P>
	Another fact of Canadian life is Canada's evolution as a 
technology based society. Knowledge is key to Canada's future 
prosperity and our human resources are our greatest asset.
<P>
	Consequently, policies that develop our human capital are 
pivotal to our ability to compete. As everyone can see, employment 
equity is nothing to be feared or shunned. It is a policy that permits 
our society to move forward and to take into account the talents and 
potential of all our citizens.
<P>
	It is no surprise that Canadian companies with experience in 
employment equity are often the strongest supporters of this 
legislation. They have seen firsthand how employment equity 
programs bring them numerous benefits. By having a fair and 
efficient human resources development strategy and a very 
efficient environment, employers have a chance to access a broader 
set of skills, a base of skills that makes their companies more 
productive. By improving the workplace they stabilize their 
workforce, boost employer's morale and increase productivity. 
They also enhance their corporate image in the community at large.
<P>
	Employers cannot afford to exclude a wide segment of qualified 
individuals if they want to survive and succeed in the global 
economy. Private sector companies, and among them most 
progressive business leaders, have long appreciated the added 
value of employment equity.
<P>
	Our challenge in the workplace is to accommodate the different 
needs of our diverse workforce and to demonstrate flexibility. 
These initiatives are in no way a threat to other Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15445"> 15445 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-64 is not about hurting the chances of white males to 
earn a living and pursue a career. It is about creating real equality 
of opportunity in the federal government, in the federally 
regulated private sector and among federal contractors. It 
recognizes that making overt discrimination illegal and 
unacceptable in society was a critical step to that goal.
<P>
	The next step is for employers and society to find and break 
down the hidden barriers that discourage people from applying for 
jobs or that keep them in certain occupational ghettos.
<P>
	Bill C-64 ensures that employers look at their workforce and 
their employment practices thoroughly in order to identify and 
remove barriers. They then set targets for hiring and promotion that 
create greater access for qualified people. With the proper tools and 
strategy they will achieve these results.
<P>
	Far from taking anything away from anyone, employment equity 
offers something of value to everyone. It permits employers to 
build greater trust and dialogue with all their employees and unions 
moving forward from awareness to action.
<P>
	The Reform minority report shows little appreciation of this 
potential for creating a more level playing field for all Canadians. 
Instead, it offers a narrow view of discrimination and exotic 
examples of university admission policies, most of which are not 
even Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	The existence of systemic discrimination does not seem to 
trouble the Reform Party. It boldly proclaims that Canadian 
employers do not discriminate on a systemic basis. Contrary to 
what the Reform Party members say with their usual confidence, 
systemic discrimination unfortunately is still very much part of our 
daily life. It continues to exist because organizations hold on to 
workplace practices that place barriers in front of certain people.
<P>
	Many companies and organizations inspired by the act have 
chosen to eliminate barriers. The Royal Bank worked with 
aboriginal Canadians to improve the interviewing process. In a 
report issued by the Royal Bank it shared some of its philosophy 
with regard to its activities: ``With a labour shortage predicted in 
the future and a more diverse population, it is very important to get 
off the mark quickly, before the labour crunch hits. Serving a 
diverse group of clients well means having a representative 
workforce''.
<P>
	The Royal Bank's example and that of other organizations is 
precisely the approach taken by the federal government with Bill 
C-64. Far from dividing people, employment equity helps us to 
forge a fairer future and build a better country. It is not about guilt 
and punishment, nor is it about tearing down merit based hiring 
systems so as to hire the unqualified. The bill actually forbids 
quotas. It states specifically that  employers do not have to hire 
unqualified workers. The merit principle is only enhanced by this 
legislation.
<P>
	When we eliminate irrelevant criteria for hiring, does that not 
strengthen the merit principle even further? When we ensure that 
more people have more chances to apply for a job or get suitable 
training, does that not strengthen the merit principle even further?
<P>
	Bill C-64 makes merit work. It opens doors to opportunity that 
have been closed for far too long. The fact that designated groups 
are under-represented and concentrated in lower paying jobs is a 
reality the Reform Party just does not understand. These groups 
have historically had higher unemployment rates and lower 
average salaries. They have also tended to be concentrated in a few 
occupational groups.
<P>
	If Canadians were to accept the Reform Party's stand on this 
issue, they would also have to accept the fact that somehow 
women, aboriginal Canadians, visible minorities and disabled 
Canadians choose lower salaries and higher unemployment rates. 
We know and Canadians know that aboriginal Canadians, visible 
minorities and designated groups want good jobs and good salaries 
like the rest of Canadians. The Reform Party wants us to believe 
that those individuals love to be ghettoized in low paying jobs, that 
they love high unemployment. That is not the fact.
<P>
	The reality is quite simple. We can look at our society in a very 
simple way or we can try to break down the barriers that have left 
some people unfortunately in situations Reform Party members 
certainly would not want to be in themselves. That shows the 
hypocrisy of the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on Bill 
C-64 today.
<P>
	The government likes to talk about Bill C-64 in terms of 
employment equity and it shudders when the terms affirmative 
action or quotas are used. The reality is the bill is exactly about 
quotas and affirmative action. What else can it be when numerical 
targets are provided, employers are required by law to attain those 
targets, and those who fail to do so are subject to significant fines? 
This legislation is about quotas, pure and simple, and it is wrong, 
pure and simple.
<P>
	The entire premise of Bill C-64 is built on the concept of 
correcting historical wrongs. There was discrimination in Canada's 
past. I will use women in the RCMP as an example. Women were 
not allowed to join the RCMP as regular employees until 1974. 
That was discriminatory. Women who were born prior to the 1940s 
were discriminated against because they were denied the 
opportunity to apply to become regular members of the RCMP. 
However, for the past 21 years women have had the opportunity to 
apply for positions. There have been  successes and failures. Now 
we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15446"> 15446 </A></B>
<P>
starting to see women cracking the commissioned officer ranks of 
the force.
<P>
	If nature were allowed to take its course, over time we would see 
the numbers in the RCMP change dramatically, as all those males 
retire who were hired under a men only policy. This is not good 
enough for the government, as it wants to legislate the ratios 
immediately. It does not take into consideration the fact that fewer 
women than men are likely to see police work as a desirable 
occupation.
<P>
	The reality of police work is that it is a dangerous job. People 
shoot at you, punch you in the face and fight you when you try to 
arrest them. For some strange reason this does not have a lot of 
appeal for many women. I do not know why that is. The way I look 
at it, if you are going to spend your Friday nights fighting drunks 
you might as well get paid for it, but that is another matter.
<P>
	The reality is that since the pool of male applicants for police 
work is significantly larger than the pool of female applicants, it is 
not surprising there are more qualified men than women applying 
for those jobs. That is not to say there will not be a significant 
female presence on any police force that hires solely on the merit 
principle. I have absolutely no doubt that the top female recruits 
compare favourably with the top male recruits. However, this bill 
ignores the principle of hiring based on merit. We will have a 
situation where the RCMP will be hiring some female applicants 
who are less qualified than some male applicants, who will not be 
hired because of this legislation.
<P>
	The government says that this discrimination is justified. When 
we look carefully, we will have a system whereby females will 
receive a special advantage because their mothers were 
discriminated against. At the same time, the government will 
endorse state sponsored discrimination against males because their 
fathers had an unfair advantage over 20 years ago. I guess this all 
makes sense to the government, but it sure does not give me any 
positive feeling. The convoluted logic behind this argument is 
surprising, to say the least.
<P>
	I ask the government, when has one form of discrimination ever 
righted any wrongs created by a different form of discrimination? 
People are already being hurt by employment equity programs, and 
this bill is going to make it worse. I have met a number of young 
men who want to become police officers. They have degrees in 
criminology and they meet all the other criteria. However, when 
they happen to be white males not only can they not get hired, but 
they have been told they should not even waste their time applying 
for the position. These men have never received any specific 
advantages because they are white males, yet this government 
believes they must be punished because at some point in time white 
males did receive unfair advantage.
<P>
	Perhaps these young men should be instructed to turn their 
career sights to the nursing profession. Here is an occupation that 
has been traditionally staffed by a disproportionate number of 
females, so with the new employment equity legislation many 
more men will be hired for this profession because of their 
under-representation. Right? Wrong. Since men do not qualify as 
one of the designated groups, they do not rate protection under Bill 
C-64. Despite the fact that men have traditionally been 
under-represented in the nursing profession, just as females have 
traditionally been under-represented in the policing profession, this 
bill works only in one direction, and that is in itself discriminatory.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Is that not what Bill C-64 is all about, the creation of state 
sponsored discrimination? Let us treat people differently because 
of their gender or their race. Let us punish young white males today 
because their fathers may have received special and unfair 
advantages decades ago.
<P>
	We all know that it is easy to pass legislation due to which other 
people are expected to make sacrifices but not the lawmakers. That 
was quite apparent when the government dealt with MP pensions 
and it is quite apparent here. The government has no problem 
imposing these quotas on others but is it prepared to live up to the 
spirit of the legislation itself?
<P>
	When one looks at the cabinet one sees an extreme 
over-representation of white males. Of the 23 cabinet ministers in 
the House, excluding the secretaries of state, only four are female. 
If we were to make the cabinet demographically correct there 
would be more females.
<P>
	Once the government passes Bill C-64, I am very curious to 
know which eight white males will resign their cabinet positions 
and give up their spaces for females. Which eight are prepared to 
sacrifice the additional $46,645 of the cabinet salary? Which eight 
are prepared to sacrifice their jobs, just as they expect others to do 
in the name of employment equity?
<P>
	I am proud to belong to a party that believes that the only 
criterion in hiring or promoting is that the best qualified person 
should be given the job. If this principle were followed I am sure 
we would have a workforce that is truly reflective of the Canadian 
mosaic.
<P>
	As a female I find it extremely insulting to suggest that I need 
special legislation to compete with a man. I believe the things I 
have accomplished have been because of my abilities, not my 
gender. I am proud that when I won the Reform Party nomination 
for my constituency I competed on an equal basis with five males 
and I won a first ballot victory, not because of my gender but 
because of my abilities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15447"> 15447 </A></B>
<P>
	During the election campaign the Liberal, Conservative and 
NDP candidates were all male. While I certainly do not believe 
I won just because of my gender, it obviously was not a detriment 
to my campaign.
<P>
	There are a number of people in this country who are sexist and 
racist and who engage in other forms of discrimination. They will 
not disappear just because Bill C-64 is passed. If the government 
wanted to deal with discrimination in hiring or in promotion 
practices in the public service all it had to do was make it clear that 
anyone who engages in such a practice will be immediately fired. If 
this approach had been taken we would have obtained the same 
results without instituting the state sponsored discrimination that 
Bill C-64 brings.
<P>
	I cannot support any legislation that is discriminatory and racist 
in content and institutionalizes the concept that individuals in 
Canada will be treated differently because of their gender or race.
<P>
	I will not ask government members to vote against Bill C-64 
because I look forward to going into the next federal election with 
them having to defend it, just like Lyn McLeod had to defend her 
support for employment equity in the recent Ontario election. As 
the old saying goes, those who forget the past are doomed to repeat 
it. I take it the Liberals are saying they are intent on following the 
footsteps of the Ontario Liberals in the next federal election. That 
is just fine with me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was intending to ask the member a 
question. I have immense respect for the member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley. In her opening remarks she 
said the bill was enshrining quotas and numerical targets and I 
immediately became concerned and consulted with my colleague, 
the parliamentary secretary to the minister of human resources.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	It is very important that the House and the people of Canada 
specifically understand clause 6 of Bill C-64 because it basically 
abolishes the entire premise of the member's speech:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>6. The obligation to implement employment equity does not require an 
employer</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) to take a particular measure to implement employment equity where the 
taking of that measure would cause undue hardship to the employer;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) to hire or promote unqualified persons;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) with respect to the public sector, to hire or promote persons without basing 
the hiring or promotion on selection according to merit in cases where the 
Public Service Employment Act requires that hiring or promotion be based on 
selection according to merit; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) to create new positions in its workforce.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	With respect to the member for Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley, the premise of her entire speech goes right down the chute 
when we read the exact wording. It is not a written speech where 
people want to take partisan, political gimmick shots. They know 
there is a current in the community right now which thinks that a 
bill like this is designed to tell the senior management of business 
that it must hire 15 people from this country or that country, that it 
must hire 20 per cent of people of this colour or that colour, or this 
language or that language, or with this disability or that disability.
<P>
	That is what the Reform Party is trying to spin on this bill. Quite 
frankly I find it distasteful. I find it distasteful because the very 
first day the leader of the Reform Party stood in the House of 
Commons he said they would not come into the House and take 
cheap, political, partisan shots. If they saw something good coming 
from the government, they would not get into political gimmickry, 
they would support the government. What we have today is a 
beautiful example of Reform Party gimmickry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Strong principles.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> This has nothing to do 
with principles. I want to repeat clause 6 for Canadians from coast 
to coast. I will even go to the person who hates me most in my 
riding, the biggest Reform Party supporter in my riding who will 
never vote for me. I will look him in the eye and hold up clause 6 of 
this bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>6. The obligation to implement employment equity does not require an 
employer</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) to take a particular measure to implement employment equity where the 
taking of that measure would cause undue hardship to the employer;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am a businessman; my background is in business. That is all I 
need as a business person. If I can prove for my small business that 
it will cause undue hardship, then I am fine.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	I am a passionate believer in the government's policy on 
multiculturalism. I am also one of the few believers in the vision 
for the country that Pierre Trudeau put forth. He was so far ahead of 
his time as a Prime Minister that the Reform Party does not even 
understand it. In 1971 Pierre Trudeau stood in the House and said: 
``We will have a policy on multiculturalism in which no culture is 
less than or greater than another culture''. I know the member 
supports that.
<P>
	We have spent taxpayers' money to encourage people who came 
here, whether they were from Germany, Italy or Austria, to keep 
their language and culture of origin. We have become a globally 
trading nation. Today the greatest trading advantage this country 
has is that there are Canadians who have preserved their language 
and culture of origin. They can go back to their country or that of 
their parents and talk about doing deals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15448"> 15448 </A></B>
<P>
	I will give a concrete example. Last week during our recess I 
spent four days in Austria with my former employer, Frank 
Stronach, chairman of Magna International. In the last 18 months 
he has returned to spend a lot of time in his country of origin. 
Part of this was because of our rotten tax system; the government 
has to get up to speed on changing the tax system.
<P>
	I will go back to the notion of multiculturalism. Last week I saw 
Frank Stronach doing deals in Canadian technology in the 
automotive industry. He was selling that Canadian technology in 
Austria. We all think that the Europeans are far ahead of us but they 
are not. Canadian automobile manufacturing technology is much 
further advanced than in many parts of Europe. He was over there 
with Canadians doing deals. Because he has preserved his language 
and feels comfortable with his country of origin, he is doing deals 
left, right and centre. Is he doing this just for the Austrian 
community? No, he is exporting Canadian jobs and Canadian 
manufacturing.
<P>
	That is why I am so passionately committed to the notion of 
multiculturalism. It is the greatest trading strength our country has. 
I do not give a darn what anybody says about Pierre Trudeau's 
being a centralist. I am a centralist. People knock him for building 
a strong national government. I think our government is 
dismantling too much too fast.
<P>
	I call this multiculturalism, phase two. With this bill on 
employment equity we are further sensitizing our communities, 
especially our business communities which build on the policy of 
multiculturalism. Wake up people, because if we can have a 
business organization that is sensitive to all cultures, all 
communities of the world, then the chances for our survival will be 
far greater than if we lived in a cocoon.
<P>
	There may be one or two minor flaws in the bill but I have 
absolutely no problem supporting the bill. I will have even less 
problem going door to door selling it. I will take on any Reformer 
who wants to go with me, street to street. In the end the Liberal 
policy will win, if it is properly explained by the words in the act 
and not by spinning little aspects of it that make it look as if we are 
trying to punish white Anglo Saxon males. This bill is not about 
that.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the 
words of the hon. member. He defended Pierre Trudeau by saying 
that Mr. Trudeau was far ahead of his time. Not that long ago I was 
up on the sixth floor of this building looking at a series of 
photographs which started with Lester Bowles Pearson and went 
right through to Kim Campbell. I thought that if one wanted to 
graphically illustrate the trouble with Canada, one could use those 
five pictures of those Prime Ministers starting with Lester Bowles 
Pearson, with Mr. Trudeau's picture being the pre-eminent one in 
the whole lot. That is the problem with Canada.
<P>
	I come from a business background. The reason I am here in the 
House of Commons is not that I ever wanted to be a politician. It is 
not that I wanted to come to Ottawa and be part of this. It is that the 
policies and the actions of this government over a period of 25 to 
30 years annoyed me to the point where I could no longer sit at 
home and watch what was going on without becoming actively 
involved.
<P>
	What we have here is an elitist group of people who believe they 
know better than anyone else how the country should run. They 
want to dictate from the top down how we are to organize our lives 
and run our affairs. That is what the member is talking about.
<P>
	The whole idea of employment equity is repugnant. Anywhere in 
the world where this has been tried it has not worked. The 
employment equity philosophy is that we somehow have to help 
people because they cannot make it on their own. I cannot think of 
anything more patronizing. If I were part of one of the minority 
groups being targeted to be helped by this legislation I would find it 
extremely offensive. Not only that, this kind of legislation creates 
divisions in our society that we do not need. It creates an us versus 
them mentality.
<P>
	I do not know how many times I have listened to people saying: 
``I feel like a second class citizen in my own country''. That is the 
kind of feeling this type of legislation generates in people. They 
feel they can no longer walk around this country and feel they are 
part of a nation.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member and the members of the 
government that if they think this legislation would ever be 
supported by the Canadian people, then put it to a referendum. Find 
out whether the Canadian people would accept this kind of top 
down management, this kind of elitist attitude that we somehow 
can control society and make it better.
<P>
	These people have the attitude that government has solutions. 
The attitude of the people on this side, certainly people from the 
Reform Party, is that government in most instances is the creator of 
problems not the solver of problems. That is why I am here. The 
government made so many problems for me in my business that I 
eventually got tired of being in business and sold it. The 
government does not create solutions; it creates problems. It is this 
kind of attitude and this kind of legislation that creates more 
problems for Canadian businesses and industry.
<P>
	After this bill is passed the quota police will be going into small 
and large businesses looking over their shoulders to see who they 
hire. The whole idea of hiring and elevating people on the basis of 
merit is going out the window. We will be looking at what kind of 
disadvantaged group people come from or what kind of 
multicultural aspect they have to offer to a business rather than 
whether they have something to contribute in terms of ability, 
effort and merit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15449"> 15449 </A></B>
<P>
	I find the bill absolutely repugnant. I find the philosophy of the 
bill absolutely repugnant. I cannot believe that grown men and 
women would support it. I certainly do not believe that a vast 
majority of Canadians from coast to coast would support it. 
Therefore I will be voting against it. I am sure any thinking person 
in the House will be voting against it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour 
to join in the debate on Bill C-64 not only as a legislator but as a 
practitioner who in the private sector has applied this legislation 
very effectively. I reiterate what my colleague from 
Broadview-Greenwood has pointed out. This act when utilized to 
its fullest potential allows Canadian businesses to be more 
competitive than any other businesses in the world.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	Let us look at the act and figure out what it really asks employers 
to do. First the act says that employers should look at the 
demographics of the labour force around their businesses. They 
should look at the percentages of white able bodied men, women, 
the disabled, visible minorities and aboriginals, and then look 
inside at the representation of their employee bases. In almost 
every case companies look inside and find that they are not 
representative, not even close to being representative.
<P>
	When they see that displayed in front of them so clearly very 
often they ask how they can possibly be serving their customers or 
clients effectively when they do not have members in their 
employee bases that come from those communities, that have those 
ethnic backgrounds or that have that gender understanding.
<P>
	They then say there is something to the legislation, that there is 
something they have to do. They begin to ask themselves how they 
have let this happen. How have they allowed their employee bases 
to become so homogeneous? What is it about the way they do 
business that has encouraged this?
<P>
	In the bill the government requests employers to take a look at 
the numbers, at the representation, and build targets for 
themselves, targets and not quotas to give themselves a time line so 
that they can make shifts and their employed population is more 
representative of the surrounding society, their customers, their 
clients. The recommendation in the regulations is that they look at 
the employment systems that exist within companies: how people 
hire, how people promote, how they recruit, how they fire and how 
they retire.
<P>
	When we actually start to look at the internal mechanisms of 
how these activities occur it is fascinating to find, unfortunately 
very often, aspects of systemic discrimination. This is not to 
suggest that we want to be discriminatory. People do not want to 
discriminate. However over time things have become systemic or 
part of the way we do things.
<P>
	The value of the legislation is that it says that we should stop and 
think about what we are doing. Is this really what we want to be 
doing? Every time the answer is no.
<P>
	For purposes of illustration let us look at some examples. When 
people decide they want to hire a new employee they think about 
the skills, the abilities and the qualities that need to be filled by the 
person who is going to take the job. They may take a lot of time. 
Some companies take no time to do it; other companies take time. 
When they get into the interviewing process natural human 
characteristics sometimes take over and we tend to hire people who 
are most like us.
<P>
	Even though we may say we need someone with a particular 
education, with particular life and job experiences to fill the job 
effectively, sometimes in the course of interviewing we find 
somebody who looks like us, likes to play golf, perhaps goes to the 
same church, and we know he or she will fit in. All of a sudden that 
is the person who is selected for the job.
<P>
	We need to recognize we want to make employment decisions 
based on skills, based on qualifications and based quite frankly on 
merit. We do not want to mix in things that are not bona fide 
requirements. When companies sit down and think about how this 
happens, they prepare for the interview and recruitment process 
more effectively and as such get better results.
<P>
	We can think about how jobs are advertised. For example, large 
companies typically advertise in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. They know a 
certain kind of person reads that newspaper. Do they think about 
advertising in the ethnic newspapers, in the <I>Teka</I> in my local 
community that goes to the Six Nations, to broaden the base and 
increase the numbers of people who are on the slate for 
consideration?
<P>
	There is nothing in the legislation that says companies have to 
select anyone but the most qualified, but they have to create a 
situation so that the slate is broad enough to include all members of 
society.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	When people start to see the impact of the decisions they make 
in terms of the recruiting process they say that they do not mean to 
be but they are being selective. The system has generated itself to 
be this way and we need to change it. We can think of how jobs 
become available through word of mouth: the president says to the 
vice-president who says to his sister or whomever. That is a very 
selective source of candidates.
<P>
	Companies need to use different strategies to broaden the slate, 
but there is nothing in the legislation which says once a slate is 
determined they have to pick someone from a particular designated 
group.
<P>
	We start by going through the employment systems analysis at 
the hiring stage and at the recruitment stage.  Then we start looking 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15450"> 15450 </A></B>
<P>
at what happens with the day to day norms in the company, the 
activities and the way employees interact. One important matter 
that has come from the legislation is an understanding of the 
importance of having policies that support a harassment free 
workplace so that once people come together in a workplace 
community they can work effectively together. They understand 
each other's differences. They know they have to treat each other 
with respect and dignity.
<P>
	One important learning as a result of the legislation which has 
not been developed very quickly but with patience, understanding 
and education over 20 years is that harassment free workplace 
programs are vitally important.
<P>
	Another thing which I have seen magically take hold in 
communities is the value of cultural diversity training where we sit 
down and understand social, economic and ethnic differences 
among Canadians. When we sit down, talk about them and 
understand them suddenly the barriers that stopped people from 
working together are gone and the value of being able to enjoy 
differences, celebrate diversity and understand different ways of 
getting to the same end makes a company a thriving, competitive 
organization.
<P>
	First they have to take a look at the demographics. Then they 
have to take a look at their companies to see if there are processes 
that are systemically stopping them from engaging all Canadians in 
the workplace. This is not a bill that revokes the merit principle but 
quite the opposite. It says to use the merit principle but use it fairly 
and equitably. Their decisions should be based on skill, bona fide 
job requirements, qualifications and characteristics; not on a 
person's social history.
<P>
	I can tell a personal story about working for a company. After I 
had been there for a couple of years and had been identified as 
perhaps being someone who could progress through the system, I 
was given a test to write. It had nothing to do with whether I could 
do mathematics or whether I could relate to people. It asked me 
about the history of my parents. Did my father belong to the Moose 
Lodge? Did my mother belong to the UCW? How many children 
were in my family?
<P>
	This was not very long ago. I sat back and thought these were the 
measures they used to determine success in the organization. They 
were building a homogeneous population of white able bodied men 
at the top, typically from the same university and with the same 
graduating degree. Thanks to this legislation that company looked 
inside and discovered it was a detriment to its capability and its 
competitiveness and it is no longer there.
<P>
	The bill is not about revoking the merit principle. It is not about 
reverse discrimination. It is about reversing discrimination and 
making sure we have a level playing field for all Canadians to 
participate. It is an important piece of legislation.
<P>
	As a human resources practitioner I can say that if they follow 
the model presented through regulations they will effectively 
create for their companies a very good, strong working human 
resources plan and process. It is all there in the bill. Quite frankly it 
is all about treating individuals with dignity and with respect.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Like my colleague from Broadview-Greenwood I am proud to 
stand in the House in support of Bill C-64 as we continue very 
slowly but very effectively with the changes we need to make the 
country's workplace the engine of our future: competitive, fair and 
equitable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel very 
privileged to be able to stand in the House to enter in this important 
debate.
<P>
	When I was first elected as a member of Parliament in 1993 I 
came here with very high ideals. I have grown to like this place. We 
have here, for the most part, freedom to debate ideas and concepts 
which profoundly affect society and have a huge impact on our 
well-being as a country.
<P>
	I begin my intervention by clearly stating that I do not question 
or judge the high motives of some hon. members opposite. Those 
who have spoken favourably with respect to Bill C-64 for the most 
part are sincere. I accept that. I also invite them to consider that I 
believe sincerely in the views I will put forward in the next while.
<P>
	It is important not to reduce ourselves to name calling but rather 
very honestly and openly question the bills before us. We should 
have the freedom to amend bills so that the end product is the 
absolute best for the people of Canada.
<P>
	I believe very strongly that I am not only fulfilling a role as a 
member of the opposition by being against these things. Certainly 
there are elements in all bills which bear reason for support. I say 
as a member of Parliament-and I think I would do this if I were a 
government member-that if I identified a flaw in a bill I would as 
forcefully as possible bring it to the attention of the House and urge 
the House to amend the bill or defeat it. Unfortunately in the way 
Parliament works that is not an option. I regret that. It is 
unfortunate that government members opposed to the bill lack the 
freedom to effectively influence change.
<P>
	I agree with the premise that people ought to be treated equally. 
Members opposite have said quite often that this is a bill about 
equality. The word equity comes from the same root word meaning 
equal or equality. We cannot tell a book by its cover. In this 
instance the bill labelled a bill about employment equity, implying 
employment equality, just does not deliver. It so happens that while 
the bill speaks of equality it actually entrenches inequality. I say 
that with all due respect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15451"> 15451 </A></B>
<P>
	Members opposite are correct when they say that we have a 
history in which some people have been discriminated against on 
invalid grounds: grounds of race and grounds of gender. When I 
was a young man we were discouraged from entering the nursing 
profession because it was a job largely filled by females. There 
was a prior bias in the different ways of hiring.
<P>
	Every time there is a position to be filled certain discriminatory 
principles will be applied. I was for a long time in charge of hiring 
in the place where I worked. It is true. Sometimes we had 200 
applications for three positions. We had to apply criteria to decide 
who would get the jobs. I believe I did this with honesty and 
integrity throughout. I always asked the question who is best able 
to do the job?
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	I did not ask the gender of the person. I did not ask what was 
their racial background. I did not look at the colour of their skin. 
My records will show, if anyone would like to check, that as a 
private businessman and a supervisor in a technical institute there 
was no evidence of discrimination. All I asked was that this person 
be the best qualified to do the job. That is to me an overriding 
principle.
<P>
	The intrusion of these various elements into evaluating a 
candidate for a position is totally unrelated to the ability to do the 
job. They are entrenchments of inequity and inequality. I urge 
members of the government to think very carefully about this. Do 
not pass it off. Do not get emotional about a bill that you have come 
to love, but ask yourself whether it really does the job.
<P>
	At the beginning of this bill it states that the purpose of the act is 
to correct disadvantages in employment experienced by women, 
aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities and members of 
visible minorities.
<P>
	I would be the first one to get up and scream if someone were 
denied a position because she was a woman and for that reason 
only, or because he or she was native and for that reason only. I 
would object strenuously. As I said before, my policies in my past 
and even as a member of the House of Commons are that I do not 
look at those things, I look past and beyond.
<P>
	We have heard quite a bit of talk, especially from the member for 
Greenwood, about the fact that this bill does not require quotas, 
that there are exemptions for employers. The bill says ``where there 
is undue hardship to the employer''. I beg to ask what is the 
definition of undue? It is so loose it does not mean anything. There 
is no reason for people to obey this bill if it means that they would 
have to hire or promote unqualified persons.
<P>
	This is a good reason to vote against this bill in its entirety. It 
gives two conflicting messages. One says that you must hire these 
people based on their numbers in these groups. On the other hand, 
it says that you do not  have to because you should test them based 
on their abilities. You should not have to hire unqualified persons.
<P>
	In that case, the bill presents a real conundrum. There is no 
solution to this problem because you have two conflicting sets of 
criteria.
<P>
	I also challenge the member's statement that this is not about 
quotas. Liberal members talk over and over again about the fact 
that business practice is going to be enhanced by this bill. I beg to 
differ and I differ strongly because right now, to my knowledge, no 
legislation in Canada says you cannot hire the best people if they 
are in one of these groups. The absence of this bill does not present 
any difficulty to business at all.
<P>
	We have had examples mentioned of different businesses that are 
working toward providing more equality in the hiring place and 
eliminating barriers. They have done it because it is good practice.
<P>
	If they are doing it because it is good business practice, then the 
legislation is redundant. The only thing that this legislation is going 
to do is develop a huge bog of bureaucracy that will once again 
slow down the efficiency of business and of our economic 
well-being. What am I talking about? I am talking about what the 
employer is required to do because of this act. ``Every employer 
shall collect information and conduct analysis of the workforce. 
With respect to whether or not there is a degree of 
under-representation of persons in these designated groups, he or 
she is to conduct a review to identify employment barriers. Only 
those employees who identify themselves are to be counted''.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	I digress for a moment but there is a flaw in this bill right there 
that gives me a reason to vote against it. I beg the members on the 
government side to consider what they are voting for when they 
follow their party leadership later today and all dutifully, one after 
the other, stand up and say, yes, we are in favour of this bill. Listen 
to what it says: ``if employees choose to identify themselves they 
are to be counted''. Otherwise they are not counted.
<P>
	Let us say one of the groups in the area represents 20 per cent of 
the population. Let us say a business actually has 20 per cent in this 
group. Let us say they exercise their constitutional right not to 
identify themselves. The reason the disclaimer is in the bill is 
because it is so close to being unconstitutional, it requires 
identification of oneself.
<P>
	Let us say that the 20 per cent of people working for this 
business exercise that right and do not identify themselves. They 
cannot be counted. Though in truth they occupy one-fifth of the 
positions in this business, they are not counted. When a position 
becomes open, they are under-represented according to the books. 
Therefore there is an obligation to hire another one of them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15452"> 15452 </A></B>
<P>
	They could by simply not identifying themselves keep that ball 
rolling until that workplace is entirely filled with people in that 
group, discriminating against everyone who is not in the group. 
That is a major flaw in this bill.
<P>
	We tried to amend it. Reformers moved amendments in 
committee and the Liberals dutifully voted them down. I guess they 
did not want to think for themselves. The people who were telling 
them how to vote were not thinking very clearly either. That is what 
happened.
<P>
	I urge all Canadians to ask themselves if this is such a wonderful 
bill and if it reflects what Canadians are truly about and if the 
members of the government truly believe this-I ask again in this 
context, why is the bill necessary if that is really true-why these 
draconian enforcement measures?
<P>
	Why do we have enforcement that says that every employer shall 
make all reasonable efforts to implement its employment equity 
plan and to monitor it? Why is it that the government requires that 
employers maintain these employment equity records and that they 
file with the government, annually, a report respecting how they are 
fulfilling their quota.
<P>
	Government members do not like to use the word quota because 
quota unfortunately is a word that means force. It means big 
government. While they want to do the same thing, they do not like 
to use the word quota.
<P>
	They will say that nowhere in the bill is the word quota 
mentioned. Proportions are mentioned. The numbers are there. If 
that is the case and each business has to report, it has to report the 
salary ranges of people in these different groups. It has to report the 
number of employees hired in each group. After it has reported and 
only those employees, by the way, who have agreed to identify 
themselves are counted, in fact the employer could be doing it and 
it does not even hit the record.
<P>
	In all instances we find it is just big brother. In the end-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am very sorry to interrupt the member 
but through an error on the Chair's part he has had five minutes 
more than he should have had.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak on this bill.
<P>
	I like to call the bill respecting employment equity an act 
without respect for the abilities and sensibilities of Canadians. I put 
forward that the act perpetuates several myths: there is systemic 
discrimination that will be cured by systemic remedial measures; 
the myth of righting the historical wrongs of the past by proactive 
reverse discrimination in the present; the myth of addressing the 
problem of racism with a far more dangerous version of the same; 
and the myth that government mandated  crutches to groups when 
those groups only desire to compete in that race from the same 
starting line.
<P>
	I speak in opposition to the bill and its policy of affirmative 
action in all matters related to government operations that is 
dressed in the guise of the euphemism of employment equity.
<P>
	I noticed the member for Brant mentioned that in making an 
application for a job the government is asking about membership in 
a club or background or whatever. She took offence to that and I 
agree with her offence to that kind of thing.
<P>
	This weekend I was looking at an application for a university for 
my daughter. That application was for a post graduate position in 
the university and included a page to ask her if perhaps she was 
disabled, or if she was from the aboriginal community. She was 
asked to identify herself presumably to gain entry to a program that 
should be equally available by academic achievement and by 
ability in one of our public institutions. As she takes offence at the 
questions asked of her, I take offence that my daughter should be 
asked certain questions that are outside her academic ability to 
enter an academic institution in the public realm.
<P>
	That is very much the case in many of the areas in our society. 
We have taken one situation and given it another solution which is 
going to create a larger problem.
<P>
	I speak not just as a Reformer but for the vast majority of 
Canadians who I know feel as I do, that people desire to be 
recognized for their ability-my daughter, myself and members of 
the House included-for their personal qualities and not for the 
colour of their skin or for their personal characteristics.
<P>
	Along with a colleague from this side of the House I served on 
the committee on human rights and the status of disabled persons. I 
took part in the examination and hearings on this bill. We 
submitted over 40 names to be considered as witnesses to come 
before that committee. Those witnesses' names were submitted to 
offer balance to the discussion and what we felt was a majority 
perspective, the public perspective on many of these issues. Of the 
40 names we submitted, only four were brought before that 
committee. From what I see in the report which the government 
produced, of those four none were heard.
<P>
	When the Liberals came to power they trumpeted a new and 
open process of government. They chose to refer this bill to our 
committee before second reading. In reality what that did, and 
certainly at the end of our sessions in the spring, was remove that 
bill from public scrutiny and then allowed this orchestrated 
affirmation of the broad concepts of the bill.
<P>
	I was interested in many of the witnesses who did come from 
across Canada through the choice of government. When we asked 
trade union representatives for instance how their experience of 
employment equity came about,  they were very pro this bill. They 
supported what the government had to say. When questioned 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15453"> 15453 </A></B>
<P>
concerning their own advancement or achievement of the goals of 
this bill, their own structures denied the fact that they took it 
seriously. They were very willing to apply it to companies or to 
businesses but not to its own administrative structure, where there 
was an obvious lack of representation from the disabled 
community and the aboriginal community. Generally speaking, 
women were not doing too badly in most of these situations.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I get the feeling that some of these programs put forward by the 
government are simply vehicles for certain groups to put forward 
their agenda. The groups that perhaps need government 
consideration for programs the most are denied or shunted aside 
while the more vocal groups take the stage.
<P>
	I want to comment on an aspect in this bill that has not yet been 
addressed. It is in terms of my recent experience at the fourth world 
conference in Beijing. This applies very much to the concept of 
employment equity. Our government signed the document to that 
conference, which was very much in support of affirmative action. 
It becomes very plain after reading the document that it is an 
affirmative action program our government signed in the name of 
the Canadian people on the platform for action.
<P>
	The platform for action from the Beijing conference commits all 
signatory nations to implement over 500 actions by the year 2000. 
In the next five years we are supposed to put in place 500 things 
that nobody really knows about here. They were signed on to half a 
world away.
<P>
	I question our government's accountability in that process. 
Certainly around the world and across Canada employment equity 
has been denied by the public-certainly not by this government, 
because it has not been listening to the public. It has now extended 
that, again completely unaccountably half a world away.
<P>
	Let me read one section into the record. This is part of the 
platform for action: ``Implement and monitor positive public and 
private sector employment equity and positive action programs to 
address systemic discrimination against women in the labour force, 
in particular women with disabilities and women belonging to 
disadvantaged groups, with respect to employment, hiring, 
retention, promotion and vocational training of women in all 
sectors''.
<P>
	We are working on a bill here that I believe does not have the 
support of the Canadian people. Our government has put this not 
only in the public sector but in a private sector agreement in an 
international document it has signed on to. I am not even sure if 
Canadians know that. It has done that without resolution of debate 
on this issue in this House and certainly no  debate on its signing on 
to the documents from the United Nations.
<P>
	Will this document from Beijing ever come to the House? Here 
we have positive public and private sector employment equity 
agreed to elsewhere, but will we be able to discuss it here? We have 
signed on to something with no accountability coming through 
from the status of women people or anybody telling us what they 
have done, let alone the fact that they should not have done it 
without accountability. I question whether they will even admit it 
when they get back here.
<P>
	We are committed to an aggressive program of affirmative 
action. It is an umbrella program that covers all federal 
departments. This is not simply the status of women people who 
are going to work with special interest groups. The program that 
has been defined in our signing on to this document encompasses 
all federal departments in all areas, looking through what is called a 
gender lens, which would reflect public and private sector 
employment equity and positive action programs.
<P>
	I am amazed to hear the government saying it is open and 
available to Canadian opinion when it goes behind closed doors or 
behind the globe and signs on to documents that are not only 
against public sentiment but have no accountability in the House. I 
object strongly to the denial of open government and of the wishes 
of the Canadian public.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to stand and speak to the bill. In the last session this bill 
was kind of my baby. It was something I was supposed to shepherd 
through the committee process, through the amendment process, 
and so on. I think it is only proper that I spend a few moments 
talking about the bill and why the Reform Party feels it must 
oppose the bill in its current form.
<P>
	I should mention a little bit about the whole process. This was 
one of the bills that was referred to committee after first reading. 
Supposedly at that time it was to encourage debate and 
amendments and the creation of the bill at first reading stage in 
committee.
<P>
	I remind the House that during that session things happened in 
committee that I think are almost unprecedented in the history of 
the House. We had limited debate of only five minutes per clause. 
We were not allowed to submit amendments because they were not 
in both official languages, only in English. Certain portions of the 
bill were passed without a vote. It was a real travesty.
<P>
	The ironic part is that it was on the human rights committee that 
this all occurred. It was a very souring experience. I did report it to 
the House at the time. I re-emphasize that it is a very poor way to 
draft what is very controversial legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15454"> 15454 </A></B>
<P>
	I will speak on a few points about the bill and then I will talk 
briefly about the Reform Party's alternative. Contrary to some of 
the bafflegab that has been coming from across the way, the 
Reform Party does have a solution to what the bill is supposed 
to be addressing. We do have some ideas on hiring practices and 
how to encourage employers to make sure their workplaces are 
without discrimination. I will put those on the record as well.
<P>
	I find it interesting that in the bill the Prime Minister's office is 
not included as being covered under employment equity. It is 
interesting that the top office in the land will not be subject to 
employment equity. Why is that? Why are private enterprises that 
do business with the federal government, the federal government 
itself, crown corporations, the armed forces and so on all covered 
but the Prime Minister's office does not want to be covered under 
the legislation?
<P>
	I remember making that proposal in committee and it was 
rejected by the Liberals. I find it interesting that when it comes to 
their own significant offices they are not prepared to allow 
themselves to be covered under this employment equity legislation. 
It is an interesting thought. I wonder if sometime the Prime 
Minister could expand on why he and his office should not be 
covered.
<P>
	There has been recent controversy about the statistical base this 
whole thing is predicated on and the problems with the statistical 
base. In the last census 10 per cent of aboriginals refused to even be 
enumerated in the census. That is just one example of how the 
statistical base is often skewed. When supposedly the workforce is 
to be exactly representational, sometimes it is not possible to know 
because of the skewing of the statistics.
<P>
	Another thing that was brought out in question period a little 
while ago is that in the last census almost a million people refused 
to designate themselves by ethnicity and background. They said ``I 
want to be called a Canadian, please. Just call me a Canadian. Treat 
me the same as everybody else and I will be happy''. Of course the 
Liberals will not allow that. The next census will make sure all 
people have to indicate which category they fit into. They will not 
be allowed to call themselves just Canadian; they will have to 
indicate they have some form of ethnicity. That is a shame. We 
should be working toward commonality but instead we are driving 
in a wedge, trying to drive people apart.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	I have heard a lot of talk today that this legislation is not about 
quotas, that this does not force people to hire a certain percentage 
of people of certain gender, minority status, and so on. That is 
simply not true. For example, say we had witnesses from the 
RCMP who said that in the RCMP in the coming year there will be 
the following people hired: 238 females, 238 people of visible 
minority status, so many people from aboriginal groups. In other 
words, they would be providing exact numbers. When we  start 
quoting numbers like that, what is the difference between that and a 
quota? There is no difference. We are talking about exact numbers 
to meet numerical goals arbitrarily set by the government. That is a 
shame. The government can say that it does not include quotas, but 
the numbers and the proof are there, which again is why we oppose 
this legislation.
<P>
	This legislation is opposed by the Canadian people. In British 
Columbia, the area I am most familiar with, only 11 per cent of 
people say they are supportive of this legislation. This includes 
almost exactly the same proportion of people from any of the 
so-called designated groups, who do not want to be patronized, do 
not want to be told the only way they can get a job is because the 
government is going to somehow pave the way for them. Most 
people from all groups say: ``Just give me a chance, just let me 
have an opportunity. I will get a job and I will be able to hang on to 
it because of my abilities, not because the government has said so''.
<P>
	Self-designation is supposed to be a voluntary process. In other 
words, you do not have to self-designate yourself into any group if 
you do not want to. At least that is what the government would 
have you believe. The problem is the lines are already being 
blurred on that. The Department of National Defence put forward a 
questionnaire for employment equity purposes. The top part of the 
form is compulsory, including your name, your rank, your serial 
number, your whatever from the military. In the fine print it says 
that you do not have to fill out the second part if you do not want to.
<P>
	Already there is a record of everyone in the military who is 
willing to co-operate with the government and those who are not. 
They already have that information. If you have been a good boy or 
a good girl and you have done what you have been asked to do, then 
you get that in your file. If you did not fill out the form, that is also 
there. In other words, you are not co-operative if you did not fill out 
the form. You did not help them do what they think is their job.
<P>
	The lines are very blurry between this voluntary 
self-identification and the compulsory self-identification that 
characterized stricter forms of apartheid such as happened in South 
Africa. It becomes a very blurry line when we force people or even 
ask people to indicate on an application form whether or not they 
are a visible minority. To think that this is possible in Canada.
<P>
	Taking this same attitude to an extreme, during the committee 
hearings we heard about what happened at the University of 
Guelph, for example. They put a line down the middle of the 
student lounge and one side of the lounge was for visible minorities 
and the other side of the lounge was for whoever was not a visible 
minority. This is the attitude this sort of legislation promotes: think 
of yourself not as Canadian; think not as an employer or an 
employee; think not as a person with equal rights and worth in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15455"> 15455 </A></B>
<P>
world; think of yourself first and foremost  as members of groups, 
divide yourselves up, divide the workforce. If you are working 
beside someone, do they have the job because they are the most 
qualified? That is to be hoped, but is it the case? Is it like the 
student lounge at the University of Guelph where it was said: ``Let 
us separate the people. We will put all the coloured people on this 
side and all the white people on that side''? Is that where we are 
heading? This type of legislation promotes that.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	This legislation was designed in Ottawa. I wonder if these people 
have ever been to the west coast of Canada. I wonder if they have 
ever been to the greater Vancouver area. Have they been to 
Richmond? Have they been to Abbotsford? When Mr. Spicer 
appeared before the committee I put it to him that if he were to say 
he would not hire visible minorities he would go broke. He would 
have to hire visible minorities in order to hire the most qualified 
people or he would go broke. The marketplace would determine 
that. In British Columbia that is a fact.
<P>
	I told Mr. Spicer there is a Hindi language radio station in the 
lower mainland. Under CRTC rules, compounded with these rules, 
more hoops and more bureaucracy, the radio station will have to 
show in its designated groups how many people are visible 
minority status, their gender and all the rest of it. This is a radio 
station which is addressing the needs of the Hindi speaking people 
of the lower mainland of which there are quite a few, over 100,000. 
To say to that station we would encourage it to have so many 
aboriginal people in its workforce is ridiculous.
<P>
	The employment opportunities will come and will be determined 
by the marketplace. We have said that the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission is there to protect individuals from discrimination. 
That is its job and I encourage it to do that. The Canadian 
government could serve a role by advertising jobs properly and 
extensively; by implementing a comprehensive system of student 
loans; by making post-secondary education responsive and 
accessible to local people, in other words not denying people 
educational opportunities; by performing objective job testing; and 
also by being a model employer in the area of access and 
reasonable accommodation for the disabled.
<P>
	We can deal with the problems in Canada without this 
legislation. This legislation is bad for Canada. It is unnecessary, it 
is coercive and I believe it should be dropped.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-64. I had prepared a speech for this bill 
some time ago but a lot of what I had intended to say has been said. 
However, there are some things about the legislation which I must 
present to the House today.
<P>
	The stated purpose of the legislation is to put equality in the 
workplace and to correct some conditions which are in the work
<P>
place or had been in the workplace in the past and are unfair. That is 
the stated purpose of the legislation. Who could speak out against 
that as a goal? All of us in the House would like to correct the 
unfair situations in our society, particularly those concerning 
employment. None of us wants discrimination and none of us is 
willing to tolerate in any way discrimination in the workplace 
based on race, gender, or any other factor. The stated intent of the 
legislation in terms of the problem which it is meant to fix I do not 
believe is a problem for any of us.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is oppressive legislation which is not only unnecessary 
in today's society but is very damaging. What is in the legislation 
disturbs me and many of my constituents and others across the 
country to whom I have spoken about the legislation. It bothers a 
lot of people. Polls have shown of course that people across the 
country do not support the concept of employment equity or 
affirmative action, call it what you like.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	There are two schools of thought when it comes to employment 
equity. The first is that legislated programs are necessary to fix a 
wrong, especially wrongs that were in the workforce in the past. 
The second is that employment equity is flawed because it 
advocates hiring of individuals based on personal characteristics, 
not on merit. Those are two opposing schools of thought.
<P>
	A third view I have heard expressed is that possibly sometime in 
the past there was the need for some type of affirmative action or 
employment equity legislation. It was necessary sometime in the 
past because of discrimination in the workplace. That position is 
tolerated by a lot more people than the position of bringing this 
piece of legislation forward today, where conditions are not nearly 
as they were in the past. Empirical evidence and good information 
has shown that there is much less discrimination in the workplace 
now than there was in the past.
<P>
	I repeat that there should be no tolerance of discrimination in the 
workplace, period. I do not and will not tolerate it and I do not 
believe any member of the House will tolerate it.
<P>
	I will read five points to lay out the Reform position briefly. 
First, all Canadians are equal before and under the law and all 
workers have the right to be free of discrimination in the 
workplace. Again, I do not think anyone in the House and hopefully 
no one across the country would argue with that point.
<P>
	Second, the market will provide solutions to a representative 
workplace in the private sector. The hon. member from Fraser 
Valley West who spoke before me and others of my colleagues have 
spoken to this issue. Business which is practising good business 
will hire  people who can best relate to the customers. That in itself 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15456"> 15456 </A></B>
<P>
should mean there will be people from all visible minorities hired 
in the workplace in a way that makes sense, not because of quotas.
<P>
	Third, the role of government is to ensure equality of 
opportunity rather than to determine equality of employment 
outcomes in the public sector or beyond the public sector. Equality 
of opportunity, that is a role of government, but a government 
cannot ensure equality of outcome, nor should it try.
<P>
	The fourth point Reform puts forth with regard to employment 
equity is that the workplace should be free from arbitrary 
obstructions to hiring and promotion. Merit must be the sole hiring 
criteria. I believe this and evidence has shown that a majority of 
Canadians believe in this. That would mean that Canadians do not 
support Bill C-64, the employment equity bill.
<P>
	The fifth point is that employment equity legislation is coercive, 
discriminatory in itself, unnecessary and costly and it should be 
discontinued. Bill C-64 should be thrown out. The vote this 
afternoon should throw this legislation out because it is bad 
legislation. Not only that, employment equity legislation from the 
past should also be thrown out.
<P>
	I congratulate the Mike Harris government in Ontario for 
promising to do exactly that. I sincerely hope the Ontario 
government will carry through on that promise. I believe it will.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	What do various groups involved in the workplace have to say 
about employment equity? First, when it is known that 
employment equity is involved in the hiring practice, employees 
going about and working in the workplace look across the room. 
They see another employee from one of the groups designated in 
the employment equity legislation and they have to wonder was 
that person hired because they were the best and most qualified for 
the job, or was that person hired to fill a quota under an 
employment equity program?
<P>
	What kind of a work environment is that? It is not a healthy work 
environment at all. Fellow employees would always have that 
doubt in their minds that members of visible minorities and so on 
were hired based on quotas rather than merit. It is not fair to them 
and it does not make for a healthy environment.
<P>
	What about the very groups that are targeted to fill these quotas 
in this employment equity legislation? What about the visible 
minorities, women and others who are targeted in these quotas? 
How do they feel about legislation like this? Although I cannot say 
how many, I can say that many people from these designated 
groups this legislation is intended to help have said to me they want 
no part of it for two reasons.
<P>
	The first reason is that they have doubts as to whether they were 
hired because they were the best qualified or whether they were 
hired to fill a quota. Imagine what it would do to a person in the 
workplace, feeling that they were well qualified for a job but 
always having that doubt, wondering whether they were hired to 
fill a quota rather than because they were the best qualified. That is 
not a healthy work environment for those people either.
<P>
	What about that other group, the people excluded from jobs 
because they do not fill one of those categories set out to be filled 
by quota? For example, I have had several people say to me that 
they do not like not even being eligible to apply to the RCMP. 
Employment equity has been in the RCMP for some time. White 
males simply are wasting their time if they apply to the RCMP and 
this is one example.
<P>
	How do those people feel? They feel resentment against not only 
the body that has put these rules in place but against the groups 
targeted through quotas. That is sad and unacceptable. This kind of 
thing must end. It is not a healthy environment for that type of 
person. They can never find their way into that working 
environment.
<P>
	There are a couple of people I have come to know well since I 
have been involved in politics. It is only because they talk to me 
about being part of the excluded group. They are indeed upset. 
Both of these people whom I have talked with many times on this 
issue have been excluded from what they want to do with their 
lives. They are young males, 25 years old. They want to join the 
RCMP but have been excluded because of these quotas. It is sad. It 
is wrong and it is unacceptable.
<P>
	Another group in the workplace affected in a negative way by 
these quotas is the employers. Other members from my party have 
made it clear these are quotas we are talking about. The companies 
will be affected by this legislation. They have been affected in the 
past by previous employment equity legislation. How do they feel 
about this?
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	I have talked with a couple of companies in my constituency that 
depend to some extent on government contracts. They have been 
excluded in the past, before the new legislation, because they 
simply could not get the proper mix required under the quota 
system to qualify for jobs from the federal government. They could 
not fill the quotas.
<P>
	These companies are upset not only about the fact that they could 
not get the contracts but because it costs them money. These are not 
extremely large corporations but they are large for the area. It cost 
them money to hire someone to see how they were doing with 
regard to quotas, to keep track and to hire people to fill the quotas. 
It is damaging to the employers as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15457"> 15457 </A></B>
<P>
	I have gone through the list. I think everyone in the workplace 
falls into these four groups. I ask members of  the governing party 
in the House and members of the not so loyal opposition why they 
would support this piece of legislation when none of the groups 
think it is good legislation. There is not a good answer.
<P>
	It is sad that we will pass the legislation. Because of the 
dictatorial style government across the Chamber I know it will 
pass. Those members will not dare vote against the government 
position so legislation will pass that very few people want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I read Bill C-64 for 
the first time I could not help but wonder if George Orwell might 
have had something to do with its drafting. Most people have read 
the book <I>Animal Farm</I> and would remember the pig who made the 
famous statement so often quoted: ``All animals are equal but some 
are more equal than others''.
<P>
	That is the sort of thing the bill will create in Canada. The bill is 
not about equality. It is not about putting people on an equal 
footing. It is quite the contrary. It is about creating divisions among 
us. It is about creating different classifications of Canadians. That 
is wrong.
<P>
	We have long had a public policy of hiring and promoting by 
merit. It is also generally the policy in private industry. A speaker 
earlier said if we do not hire by merit we will very quickly go 
broke. When we hire by merit and if the meritorious person 
happens to be within one of the designated groups in the 
legislation, obviously the person should and would get the job.
<P>
	Rather than being about the equality of persons the legislation is 
about the Liberal propensity for regulating, controlling, creating 
bureaucracy and in general getting in people's faces. Why do we 
not leave people alone? Canada is working very well. Canadians 
are basically good people, people of goodwill. We are friends. We 
have a multiracial society. It is working. Why do we have to poke 
our finger in a wound that the government will create by itself? It is 
nonsense.
<P>
	I worked overseas both in a private capacity and for several years 
with the United Nations on a large number of highly motivated, 
highly skilled technical teams. They were multiracial. They were 
not multiracial because somebody wanted them to be. They were 
multiracial because applicants had been selected from all over the 
world for these jobs and they took the best. We were the best and 
we were proud of it. If they had been created by affirmative action 
programs I would not have had anything to do with those groups. I 
would have slunk away and hid.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	This will happen in Canadian society if affirmative action is 
enforced. We will see very good, capable people belonging to 
minority groups that have jobs either in private industry or in 
government but feel self-conscious, demeaned and patronized. 
There will always be a  question hanging over their heads about 
whether they got their jobs because of qualifications and ability or 
a bit of tokenism. Were they hired because of colour, race, 
language, gender, or whatever? Government has no place getting 
involved in telling people who they can or should not hire. It is 
offensive. It is wrong.
<P>
	I was probably campaigning for equality of races before most 
members of the House were born. I recall when I was a young 
teenager collecting the occasional lump because of my curious 
attitude on the matter. I find it terribly offensive that some 
members opposite who spoke earlier had a self-righteous and smug 
attitude toward me and my fellow party members. They inferred 
that because we opposed their racist legislation we were racists. 
They are turning sociology on its head.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Liberal logic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> This is Liberal logic. When I came to the House 
today I did not intend to speak to the bill. However I had to get up 
because I was so incensed by the remarks of some people opposite. 
I do not have a long, prepared speech and therefore having made 
my case I will return to my seat.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
should like to add something to the debate. I had not intended to do 
so but I cannot believe the government is rushing through the 
legislation in a self-serving and smug manner. It is pretending that 
it is only concerned about fairness and giving everyone a fair 
chance when the legislation is so incredibly flawed that no 
intelligent, sensible person could possibly support it.
<P>
	Anyone who does not support the bill, however, is branded 
racist, sexist or lacking in compassion and fairness. It is a sad 
commentary of the debates of the House of Commons when people 
cannot attack bad, flawed, unworkable legislation. Instead of being 
met with logic, reason and persuasion, they are met with labels, 
brands, sneers and distortions of their motives.
<P>
	I appeal to members of the House to serve Canadians better by 
looking at the issues, at logic and at what is good for the country 
instead of hurling epithets and questioning motives. We know that 
is not the way to get good legislation for the country.
<P>
	There are seven reasons why the legislation should not be 
supported. I will go through them quickly because I think 
Canadians watching the debate need to know about this piece of 
legislation. Not only their elected members should not be 
supporting it, but the public should not be supporting it and should 
be extremely concerned that the legislation will be foisted upon 
them by a Liberal government looking at doctrinaire and running 
ahead to say that it has done something rather than doing what is 
right and best and proper for the country.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15458"> 15458 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	The first reason, which should be enough of a reason in itself, is 
that it institutionalizes discrimination. How can anyone possibly 
support a piece of legislation that discriminates against people in 
the marketplace on the basis of race, sex or skin colour?
<P>
	We have built Canada by being open and fair minded to 
everyone. Why on earth would we institutionalize a terrible process 
whereby we would not be Canadians or people with skills, abilities, 
knowledge and services to offer other people? We would be hired 
because of the pigment of our skin. Surely we can do better than 
that.
<P>
	We should not encourage or institutionalize discrimination in 
any way, shape or form, and that is exactly what we are being asked 
to vote for. I cannot believe members opposite would do such a 
thing to our country.
<P>
	The second reason out of the seven is that the legislation 
demeans designated groups as not having equal ability. Why would 
we put into place legislation that says since certain people cannot 
cut it on their own employers will be forced to give them extra 
breaks? It is an insult to tell people in certain groups that they do 
not have the guts, the brains, the ability, the competence and the 
merit to make a life on their own without other people being forced 
to give them special and extra consideration. That is not what we 
should be doing. It will not be any kind of help to people in the 
designated groups.
<P>
	The third reason is this kind of legislation divides rather than 
unifies the country. A number of other speakers have mentioned 
this point with great eloquence, but Canadians need to think about 
it. Instead of being a Canadian, being someone who has particular 
skills, being a good employee, being someone with initiative, drive 
and ability, we will now be in little groups. We will be women in 
the workplace. We will be persons of colour in the workplace. We 
will be aboriginals in the workplace instead of employees who are 
damn good. This is not the way to build strong businesses and it is 
not the way to build a strong country.
<P>
	The fourth reason is the legislation places unfair and unwise 
restrictions on job creation. What does it say to employees who 
know they do not have to show a lot of merit in the job because the 
employer needs them to fulfil the quotas under the legislation? The 
businesses cannot do without them; they need them. They need 
these token people in the workplace so it does not matter if they do 
not strive to do the best job possible. They have to be there anyway.
<P>
	It will mean all kinds of bureaucracy, legislation and regulations 
on businesses already completely overburdened by the economic 
tinkering of governments that think they know better than anybody 
else how to run an economy. Instead they are just burdening them 
with  the weight of unreasonable demands and economic and social 
tinkering.
<P>
	It is time to stop that. It is time to let businesses create jobs for 
our young people. It is time to let businesses get on with running 
efficient and effective service oriented businesses. It is time to quit 
letting governments that pretend they are helping everybody do it 
on the backs of business. That is one of the reasons we are in 
trouble.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> The member opposite is making a lot of noise. 
He knows that very well. He has been talking about how to get 
businesses economically viable again. He might give some thought 
to how we can do that. It certainly is not by another big, fat, thick 
layer of red tape for businesses.
<P>
	The fifth reason is the legislation places undesirable coercion on 
businesses to be good co-operators with bureaucrats. Surely we 
have seen enough in other countries where bureaucrats make life 
miserable for people who are working and running businesses.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	Here we have another instance in which if you are not a good 
little business person you will be punished, harassed, hassled. You 
will be given all kinds of requirements and restrictions and will 
have to fill out more forms and have some pointy headed 
bureaucrat breathing down your neck before you can even do your 
job of running your business. Why would we have this kind of 
coercion and interference to the people of our country?
<P>
	The sixth reason is it violates the principles of natural justice. To 
me this is a huge area. It says we are not all equal before the law, 
that some of us are more equal than others. It contravenes the basic 
democratic principle that everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Instead 
we have an employment equity tribunal, which is like a kangaroo 
court from which there is no appeal at all and which does not even 
have fixed rules of law under which to operate. Incredibly enough, 
it also entitles search and seizure of business records and business 
premises in order to ensure compliance.
<P>
	Last, I point to the undue haste with which this legislation has 
been put in place. Other speakers have mentioned this but even in 
committee it was not properly looked at. It was not properly 
debated. This is not the way to put good legislation in place for our 
country.
<P>
	I am afraid it is a futile effort because we know the top echelons 
of the Liberal Party have told their backbenchers that everyone has 
to vote for this legislation. I urge us to look at what is best for the 
country for a change instead of having a knee-jerk vote, putting in 
bad legislation and having all the problems I have just mentioned 
down on the heads of a country that is already struggling.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will have to cram into 10 minutes the 
substance of two things, an enormous tax break of 50 per cent for 
American companies operating in Canada on their profits, a 50 per 
cent tax cut-
<P>

to this?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I thank the hon. members of the House. That 
relieves me somewhat. I will calm down and try to explain to 
members and the Canadian people and members of the Liberal 
caucus why I make such strong objection.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	This Senate bill is supported by the Reform Party and it is 
supported by the Bloc in the House. They are the official opposition 
and they are the back-up for the official opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> It is supported by the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The hon. member from the Reform Party says it is 
supported by the government.
<P>
	The Bloc as well stood up in the chamber on second reading and 
in the committee of the House when this bill was being dealt with 
and said ``We love this bill. Give us more bills like this that give 
huge tax breaks to American companies operating in Canada''.
<P>
	However, that is not all the bill does. The bill gives a tax credit to 
anybody who has property is the United States valued at over 
$600,000 and who happens to die and is subjected to the estate tax 
in the United States. Now the Canadian public will have to make 
the payment on behalf of that person to the U.S. government.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you know, if you die in the United States, in 
come the people from the Internal Revenue Service and they assess 
the value of the paintings on the wall, the value of your car, your 
garage, your backyard, your orange trees and your grapefruit 
trees-they look at everything. If it comes to over $600,000, they 
sock it to you with what is called the estate tax. We had it in Canada 
prior to 1971, but not on the scale it is in the United States. The 
normal grab is about 54 per cent of everything you have over 
$600,000, which includes stocks and bonds, even if they have been 
obtained through a Canadian broker, if you have that property in 
the United States.
<P>
	In Canada we have unrealized gains upon death, capital gains, 
but that is a different story from the estate tax. Nobody comes in 
and looks at your home. If it is valued at $20 million it is not taken 
into account because that is your residence. Nobody looks to see if 
you have a $100,000 Rolls Royce in the driveway. That is not 
counted in Canada because that is your personal property for 
personal use. It is a different form of taxation. This Senate bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15460"> 15460 </A></B>
<P>
gives you a tax credit, which is paid for not  just by the Canadian 
treasury; this is out of the pockets of Canadian citizens. That is a 
tax expenditure. That is what is wrong today.
<P>
	People wonder where the money has gone over the years. Why 
could we afford health care and education transfers to the provinces 
and a big public service 20 years ago and we cannot today? 
Auditors general since 1985 have identified the main culprit as 
being tax expenditures. This tax expenditure will mean the 
Canadian people will pay for your estate tax in the United States of 
America. The Canadian people will pay for a 50 per cent reduction 
on the tax on profits to American multinationals operating in this 
country, on dividends. The Canadian people will pay for the 33.33 
per cent tax decrease on interest that travels over the border into the 
United States. The Canadian people will pay for the elimination of 
royalties on practically everything, down to trademarks, which 
have been bifurcated. It will be divided. They will be examined 
each part separately.
<P>
	Let me give the House some idea of how much this will cost the 
federal treasury.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	The person in charge, the chief of corporate and international tax 
in the Department of Finance, testified before the Senate 
committee. He was asked: ``Why do you need to have a 5 per cent 
tax? Under this bill we are reducing it by 50 per cent. Why not 
reduce it by 100 per cent on the withholding tax? Why not give the 
American corporations their entire profit tax free?'' The person in 
charge of corporate taxes in Canada stated: ``The principal reason 
is money. I have not looked recently, but I believe that our annual 
withholding tax take is approximately $1.5 billion. Certainly it 
would be difficult to sustain completely walking away from that''.
<P>
	What are we doing? We are cutting by 50 per cent the 
withholding tax on dividends from American corporations 
operating in Canada and sending their profits back across the 
border to the United States. What does that do to a Canadian 
business that is trying to compete? It is fine to give Wal-Mart a 50 
per cent tax break, but what about the Canadian company that is 
competing against the American company?
<P>
	It is interesting to look at the flow. I have the evidence given 
before the committee on foreign relations in the United States 
Senate. It is the Jesse Helms committee. It talked about the treaty 
with Canada. It did not like it last year. After the Minister of 
Finance signed it in Washington the American Senate changed it. 
The Minister of Finance had to return in March of this year to 
re-sign the amended protocol.
<P>
	I will read a couple of things into the record. Here is the 
Secretary of the Treasury for tax policy for the Government of the 
United States: ``The protocol reduces the rate of withholding on 
cross-border flows of  interest from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. This 
reduction will provide a substantial benefit to many U.S. recipients 
of Canadian source interest payments. It will have a lesser effect on 
U.S. outflows of interest to Canada because much of this flow is 
already exempt from U.S. tax under the portfolio interest 
provisions of the code''. In other words, we are giving the 
Americans a 33.3 per cent tax cut when Canadians will not benefit 
from that interest provision because the Secretary of the Treasury 
in the United States says that it is already exempt under the code.
<P>
	The other provision is on royalties. Here is the assistant treasurer 
for tax policy, the Hon. Cynthia Beerbower: ``Being freed of tax on 
royalties is cash in hand. Now we pay royalties to Canada. With a 
zero rate in effect in this protocol, I cannot imagine that anyone 
would sit on this''.
<P>
	Then we go to the big one, the $1.5 billion the treasury is getting 
today in this Senate bill, which is supported by the Reform Party 
and by the Bloc.
<P>
	The vice-president of tax policy, Robert Green, for the National 
Foreign Trade Council Inc., 1914, which represents 500 American 
multinationals doing business in Canada, said in his evidence: 
``The investment flow between the two countries is substantial and 
favours the United States. We have substantially more investment 
there than they do here. The dividend withholding rate reductions, 
which are phased into five per cent over three years, are a 
tremendous benefit to the United States, to U.S. multinational 
companies doing business there. And because of the reduced 
withholding rates the amount of net repatriated earnings to the 
United States for investment will be substantially increased''.
<P>
	Then he goes on to talk about the reductions in the withholding 
rates on royalties: ``The additional amount of repatriated earnings 
will substantially benefit the United States''.
<P>
	Let there be no guessing about this. The United States business 
community says it will take that from Canada and repatriate it right 
back to the United States of America.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	It is funny, Mr. Speaker, you stand here in the House and hear 
some Liberal backbenchers objecting to this, and you have the 
Reform Party and the Bloc in total agreement. How did it start? In 
1988 the U.S. made a tax change. It was a change to the estate tax 
rules for foreigners. It stated that any foreigner with property in the 
United States would have to pay estate tax on everything above 
$60,000, not $600,000. That was in 1988.
<P>
	The record shows that the Canadian government in 1988 took a 
week to respond. It sent people down to Washington. It said: ``We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15461"> 15461 </A></B>
<P>
want to relieve Canadians of  this tax that is being imposed on them 
in the United States''. That is where it started.
<P>
	The United States said: ``In order for us to give you a break for 
wealthy Canadians, you will have to give us something in return''. 
It went back and forth. The negotiations started in 1988. It has gone 
on since then. It has gone on to include huge tax expenditures that 
nobody has an estimate on. Revenue Canada and the Department of 
Finance say they do not know-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. We have now been 
listening to the hon. member for the last 10 minutes and so far I do 
not see the relevance to the two motions he has before him. We 
gave him 20 minutes to speak on them. I do not see where there is a 
tie-in to either one of the motions and why he represents and 
recommends these motion be adopted.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sure the hon. member will bring it 
around to those motions very quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is what I was building up to. Under 
our laws in the Chamber we are not allowed to amend a tax treaty. 
It states that clearly in our standing orders. We can amend the 
legislation that brings in the tax treaty. However in introducing an 
amendment to that legislation we cannot negate the principle of a 
clause in the tax treaty.
<P>
	Just imagine the power of the U.S. committees. They actual 
change treaties. The Minister of Finance had to go back to 
Washington twice. He signed one, they changed it and he had to go 
back again.
<P>
	According to our standing orders our House of Commons is not 
allowed to change anything in a treaty. The amendments I put 
forward are amendments that do not negate a clause. The first 
amendment is that all of these huge tax decreases to American 
multinationals operating in Canada come to an end in the year 
2000. That is amendment number one. We cannot afford giveaways 
any more.
<P>
	We are cutting public servants. We have got to. We are cutting 
back on UI. We are cutting back on this and cutting back on that 
and at the same time we are introducing this whole new set of tax 
expenditures, gifts.
<P>
	That leads me to the second amendment, the gift part. Motion 
No. 2 relates to the dating back of the tax credit on the estate tax to 
people who had died since November 10, 1988. Do you get the 
significance of the date, Mr. Speaker? Perhaps somebody of great 
wealth did die on November 11, 1988, I do not know. The very date 
is the date the protocol came into effect in the United States that 
decreased the maximum from $600,000 to $60,000.
<P>
	Under this bill there are estates today in Canada verified by 
Revenue Canada to me and to the committee that are just waiting to 
put in their bill. Now the Canadian government has to pay for the 
amount of estate  tax that they pay in the United States that was 
taxed as U.S. source revenue.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	The Canadian people have to cough up the money now out of the 
treasury. I am told that one chap who died had $20 million in the 
United States. He really got hit with the estate tax, almost $8 
million of it had to be paid to the U.S. treasury. He has a nice rebate 
coming to him from the U.S. government but he has a much bigger 
rebate coming to him from the Government of Canada. Only $12 
million went to the family. Now the people concerned who 
received the benefits from the estate will be able to bill the 
Canadian government for an additional $5 million or $6 million in 
that one year.
<P>
	The second amendment, seconded by the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood, is that since the Canadian delegation and 
the U.S. delegation said this is reciprocity, this is to eliminate 
double taxation, that if there is not double taxation then there will 
be no money granted. That does not negate the clause at all. It just 
says if no taxes were paid no rebate will be given as far as the 
Canadian government is concerned.
<P>
	The auditor general in 1985 said the Canadian Parliament 
reminded him of a group of automobile engineers trying to build an 
automobile that was more efficient, that burned less gas but had the 
same energy. He said that Parliament is like that because we are 
trying to find ways of cutting while still maintaining our services to 
the Canadian people. He said the problem is this.
<P>
	When the engineers changed the engine of the automobile from 
eight cylinders to six cylinders to four cylinders and brought in all 
those modifications to save energy, at the end of the day they 
discovered they were burning just as much gas as they were before. 
They did not know what the problem was until they looked under 
the car and saw all these little holes in the gas tank. Those, the 
auditor general said, are the tax expenditures of the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	The government cuts and slices and chucks. It lays people off 
who have children going to school and to university who do not 
know where their next dollar is going to come from. It changes the 
system of unemployment insurance. When a primary producer 
working in this country has as a part of his income unemployment 
insurance, it says: ``Oh no, we are going to take that away because 
that was not intended for that''. That person is worried to death 
today.
<P>
	While we do all of that, we turn around and take a Senate bill that 
will give enormous returns to very wealthy people, very rich 
people, and we say to the multinationals we are going to cut your 
taxes by 50 per cent.
<P>
	We are not going to do anything for the very poor. We are not 
going to do anything for Canadian corporations operating in 
Canada. That is why I think, after looking at  the bills we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15462"> 15462 </A></B>
<P>
discussing, what is really happening in real terms of tax 
expenditure is that we take from the poor and give to the rich.
<P>
	It is Robin Hood in reverse. He is now working for the great 
companies that represent those very multinationals in the United 
States that are working so well in this country, a country that 
according to the World Bank is the second wealthiest country in the 
world because we have resources.
<P>
	The House of Commons today, with the Bloc and the Reform 
Party supporting this legislation wholeheartedly, is not working. 
The Canadian people are saying that we need a change in the rules 
of procedure or we need to get rid of the two opposition parties.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I found 
the Liberal member's grandstanding amusing. His closing 
reasoning was obviously somewhat illogical. He was more critical 
of the opposition parties than of the government. I would gently 
remind him that, if he does not agree, he need only settle his 
differences with his own colleagues. This bill comes from the 
government, which is made up of people from his own party. So 
they will have to talk among themselves and try to reach an 
agreement. It was even a bit sad to see them in such disagreement 
this morning. However, I agree with my colleague on some points, 
on others, I do not, but I will get to that.
<P>
	Obviously, we share his concern for society's disadvantaged. We 
agree on this, and I hope, when the time comes to adopt the 
unemployment insurance reform and other such things, he will 
again rise, as he did today. It seems to me that only one member 
was opposed last time. I am not sure I heard him. I am not sure he 
was present. Next time, we will watch to see where he stands in the 
upcoming debate on cuts to the transfer payments, in particular, 
and on social programs. We will see where he stands and whether 
his concern is real or whether he is just giving a political 
performance here, once in awhile, to please his constituents and 
ensure his re-election.
<P>
	I want to point out that we have have to consider both the 
substance and the form of this bill. We agree with what the auditor 
general said about tax conventions, which is that there is going to 
have to be a code of conduct for signing such conventions with 
other countries. There can be major differences in taxation levels 
between Canada and the other country signing the convention. In 
such cases, there is clearly a problem, and we must ensure that we 
are not threatening economic transactions and running the risk of 
losing revenues here in signing such agreements.
<P>
	Before us we have a tax convention with the United States. 
Obviously, a person can oppose it if they like, but they have to say 
so directly. They cannot, in our view  anyway, oppose something 
that aims to maximize economic exchange between Canada and the 
United States.
<P>
	For a long time it was believed that our markets in Canada were 
east-west and now increasingly we see that they are north-south. 
There is a great deal of potential for development there. I can 
understand that there are still some pockets of resistance among 
those who are opposed to free trade and everything that goes with 
it, but we must think of where we are headed in the next century. 
And this is where we are headed. Consistency and logic is required. 
When one agrees to get involved in something like free trade, one 
has to live with what that implies. One has to live with reciprocity 
as well. Now, I want to get on to the content of these amendments, 
which strike me as suffering either from bad drafting, technically 
speaking, or from a fundamental problem.
<P>
	Of course, there is the first amendment. I have heard what the 
Liberal member has had to say, waxing so eloquent in his attack on 
the tax rate cut from 10 per cent down to 5 per cent. Yet his 
amendment is aimed at ensuring that this will not apply after the 
year 2000. Why before that date? Why not after that date? Why 
2000? Why not 2001? Why not 2002? It is very hard to grasp the 
reasoning behind his first amendment and I have not found anyone 
able to explain the real meaning and scope of his first amendment 
to me.
<P>
	Obviously, one cannot agree with something that is poorly 
written. You have to be for something or against it. You cannot be 
against something for a few years and then in favour of it after that. 
There comes a time for logic.
<P>
	The second amendment reminds me of those who are in favour 
of free trade but only one way free trade, with others opening up 
their borders to us, but our borders being closed to them. But this is 
in the area of taxation. We are told that we must not allow this 
retroactive refund, as one might call it, not allow it if there has been 
income taxable in Canada during that period. There is another side 
to that coin also. What reasoning applies to the reverse situation, 
American residents whose assets were in Canada or Quebec?
<P>
	But the amendment does not address the opposite situation. 
Accepting the second amendment means asking the Americans to 
follow suit and to reopen the tax convention. This is, I suppose, 
what they had in mind, because consistency is required with what is 
proposed. I shall be surprised if they do so, because these are the 
same people who tell us sovereignists in the speeches they make 
here: ``It will be just dreadful if you vote yes. Perhaps NAFTA 
would have to be reopened''. Yet they want to reopen tax 
conventions. And they spoke of their desire to reopen NAFTA 
during the election campaign.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15463"> 15463 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	I sense a strong desire on their part to reopen the whole 
discussion about relations between Canada and the United States. 
Of course, that is their right, but I do not think this desire is shared 
by the majority of the House or by the majority of the public.
<P>
	Of course we are concerned about the most vulnerable in our 
society. And as far as the future of our social programs is 
concerned, I think we can all agree that some serious debate is in 
order regarding the approach suggested by this government.
<P>
	However, we must not exaggerate, and the figures quoted by the 
hon. member to indicate the economic impact of these amendments 
or these motions are clearly exaggerated. There was a reference to 
hundreds of millions of dollars. I read what happened in 
committee, I followed the proceedings, and no one could 
extrapolate the same figures as the hon. member and say that 
hundreds of millions of dollars were involved in this particular 
case.
<P>
	It is easy to quote figures out of the blue, but you have to support 
those figures, justify them and provide documentation. We cannot 
afford to keep throwing figures at the public and say: Yes, that is 
the way it is, without further ado. We have to be more serious, more 
credible than that.
<P>
	And that is why we cannot support these amendments, and this 
applies both to Motion No. 1 and Motion No. 2. Motion No. 1 is 
poorly drafted, complicated and not consistent with what the hon. 
member said, in my opinion. The second amendment makes no 
provision for compensation or reciprocity. After all, this is a 
two-way street. When we sign tax treaties, there must be 
reciprocity. We cannot get away from that. However, there is 
nothing in the second motion that refers to this.
<P>
	If they want to renegotiate the whole tax treaty, that is their 
problem. What we would prefer and what we always suggested is 
to go along with what was said by the auditor general. We now have 
a certain number of tax treaties that cause problems because of the 
differences in tax rates. In such cases we will need certain 
guidelines for adopting tax treaties, because this is going to 
escalate in the next few years, considering current economic 
trends.
<P>
	So we will have to get much stricter guidelines when we send 
people to sign this kind of tax treaty, to avoid being faced with a 
situation that will be difficult to change subsequently.
<P>
	In concluding, and I do not intend to speak at greater length on 
this matter, we agree with the tax convention. I must admit, 
however, that the retroactive aspect bothers us too. It bothers us 
that compensation is given retroactively.
<P>
	That being said, these two amendments will not correct that, 
neither the first nor the second motion-they will  not correct that 
because, as I said earlier, the amendments make no provision for 
compensation or reciprocity. When the time comes to vote on the 
tax convention on third reading, we will have to evaluate Bill S-9 
as such. On the whole, we think it is important to pursue this 
approach.
<P>
	I repeat, the retroactive aspect bothers us. But in any case, what 
the hon. member suggested does nothing to correct this particular 
aspect. We will vote against both amendments and we will vote in 
favour of Bill S-9 on third reading. I am sure the hon. member will 
listen to his colleague, the parliamentary secretary, who will 
explain what amounts are involved with this bill and tell him they 
are nowhere near what he suggested.
<P>
	I find it amusing to hear him attack the Bloc Quebecois in this 
debate. He should be more concerned about ensuring that his party, 
the government party, has certain guidelines for adopting tax 
conventions. He should get that message across to his supporters 
and eventually to the government, and then we will get somewhere. 
We cannot backtrack and change things that have been signed and 
that arise from the whole North American free trade context. Any 
action that is taken should be logical and consistent, and that is why 
the Bloc Quebecois will support this bill and will reject, as the 
government and also the Reform Party have done on many 
occasions, the two motions proposed by the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me pleasure to speak on the 
amendments being presented by the member for Gander-Grand 
Falls. I would like to make a few comments on the specifics of the 
amendments. These questions were addressed not only in the 
Senate but also in the House of Commons finance committee by 
witnesses who appeared from the department, including myself, to 
go through each of these points.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	For people trying to follow the logic of the bill, the protocol was 
required as a result of changes in American tax law in 1988. Once 
those were put into place it became incumbent upon the Canadian 
government to revise the tax arrangements between the two 
countries.
<P>
	The member for Gander-Grand Falls was quite keen to point 
out there were witnesses in the American Senate and the House of 
Representatives who found this bill to be very helpful. It does not 
surprise me that a bill should come out to be win-win and that there 
should be supporters in the United States who think this is of 
benefit to them. That is why the country adopted it. Also on the 
public record, our department has been very strong and this is also 
of benefit to Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15464"> 15464 </A></B>
<P>
	It does not only help the wealthy Canadians who certainly are 
helped by this, but it also helps a number of ordinary Canadians 
who have second properties in the United States under relatively 
moderate circumstances. It also helps a number of corporations 
operating in the United States.
<P>
	The United States is the largest trading partner we have, not only 
in the corporate sense but in the personal sense. It is the largest 
travelling relationship we have. It is the largest second investment 
for a lot of families. We have to be very careful not to develop a tax 
regime in isolation while totally not thinking of what happens to 
people in other regimes. What happens to many Canadians in the 
United States is a major tax consideration. It is incumbent upon this 
government to make sure those conditions are matched and that we 
do the best for Canadians.
<P>
	As with any treaty and protocol, there are conditions that are 
more satisfactory to the opposite side. Either we do things to 
accommodate them or we have no agreement. To think that none of 
the American interests were reached in this protocol would be a 
silly assumption. It would also be equally silly to think that none of 
the objectives of the Canadian government were reached in this 
bill.
<P>
	Dealing with the first motion, the 5 per cent withholding rate on 
direct dividends has been adopted by many of our major trading 
partners. Zero withholding is the standard among EEC countries. 
We are perfectly within our legal rights to insist upon higher rates 
as is suggested in the amendment, but we must recognize in doing 
so that our ability to attract additional investment and to retain 
existing investment would weaken with adverse revenue effects.
<P>
	If we are concerned about the cash flow of the federal 
government, we must be cognizant of what we do in tax policy 
which aggravates taxpayers and causes them to engage in tax 
avoidance. Canadian firms attempting to enter or expand in foreign 
markets would be at a competitive disadvantage.
<P>
	A second point on this is that a temporary reduction in the 
withholding tax rate, as proposed in this amendment by the 
member for Gander-Grand Falls, would be the least favourable 
option. First, it would allow corporations to withdraw past earnings 
from Canadian operations at the reduced rate. The guarantee of 
higher future rates would create a positive incentive to do so. 
Second, it would eliminate the value of the rate reduction 
encouraging U.S. corporations to make any long term investments 
in their Canadian operations. In other words, it would be better not 
to go to 5 per cent at all rather than apply the reduced rate for only a 
few years.
<P>
	Finally, on the first motion and concerning a point already made 
by the mover, any change to the protocol will necessarily endanger 
if not scuttle it inasmuch as it represents an agreement between two 
parties that can  only be changed with the agreement of both 
parties. If we make changes on our side we have to understand that 
part of our obligation is to allow parties on the other side who may 
be dissatisfied with one part or another to make additional changes 
they would like. We cannot pick and choose among the pieces.
<P>
	The second motion presented by the member is also opposed by 
the government. By way of background, most of the benefits of the 
article dealing with taxes on debt are required to be provided by the 
United States. Specifically, the U.S. must grant to Canadian 
residents an estate tax exemption based on the same $600,000 
exemption that U.S. citizens receive, rather than the $60,000 
exemption currently provided. The U.S. must credit capital gains 
tax paid by U.S. citizens on properties situated in Canada against 
the U.S. tax payable by those citizens in respect of that Canadian 
property.
<P>
	The only real obligation imposed on Canada by this article is to 
provide a reciprocal credit for its own residence. That is, Canadians 
who die owning U.S. property will be entitled to credit any U.S. 
estate tax owing on that property against their Canadian income tax 
payable on U.S. properties and income from U.S. sources.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	Accordingly, if there is no Canadian tax payable at the outset, 
there does not seem to be any sort of benefit that Canada would be 
required to provide under this article. If that reasoning holds, and I 
do allow for the possibility that what the motion literally provides 
may not be what the member was looking to accomplish, then the 
motion makes no substantive change and should be voted down on 
that basis. If on the other hand members believe the motion does 
have substantive effect, I would refer to the argument set out in the 
third point concerning this first motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to address the amendments put forward by the member for 
Gander-Grand Falls. Before I comment on them, he took a heck 
of a long time during his 20-minute oration to point out in a very 
partisan and grandstanding fashion how the Reform Party and the 
Bloc Quebecois support this bill. However, he conveniently 
ignored the fact that his very own government supports this bill. In 
every comment the member made about the opposition parties 
supporting this bill, he conveniently and purposely left out 
mentioning that his government is in favour of this bill.
<P>
	I respect the member's right to disagree with his own party. We 
believe in that on this side of the House. We believe it is an 
advantage to allow members of a party to speak out on the 
negatives of a bill, especially if members so passionately feel there 
is something wrong with it. However, to carry the game to the 
degree the hon. member has in terms of giving the general 
impression that his party was not a part of it disappoints me. I  
respect the hon. member, but I must put on the record that in this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15465"> 15465 </A></B>
<P>
case the way he presented his comments is taking political 
partisanship one dramatic step too far.
<P>
	Let us get to the crux of the matter which are two amendments to 
the bill. I agree with the member for Témiscamingue. He is right. 
These two amendments are poorly written and poorly thought out. 
They have been served up to circumvent the bill itself so that this 
gentleman could have one more opportunity, one more platform to 
give his speech and to hear himself talk.
<P>
	What the member accomplished in the process was to show us 
the typical Liberal attitude that where there are tax breaks available 
for Canadians, where there are advantages for Canadian citizens in 
the form of reduced taxes or where it eliminates double taxation to 
help solve a problem in our tax system, the Liberal government is 
against it. The Liberal government and this member are against it.
<P>
	The hon. member wants to generate as much revenue for the 
government as possible on the backs of what he calls the so-called 
rich. The mythology that the rich somehow or other get a 
disproportionate share of the advantages and benefits of 
infrastructure is crap. That kind of philosophy and attitude has to 
stop, which is why Liberalism is slowly coming to an end as well.
<P>
	For the member to give a speech one way and to ignore the 
benefits of the bill, never once addressing the advantages and the 
good aspects of the bill, is terribly one sided. It is the Liberal way 
of arguing. I believe the only way government members can defend 
themselves is by presenting a biased and prejudicial point of view 
without looking at it from both sides.
<P>
	The reality and the weaknesses of these two amendments to Bill 
S-9 are that by trying to strike the bill down, the member is not 
accepting the realities of today's economic climate. The global 
economy requires that everybody, as closely and as much as 
possible, deals under the same rules and rates of taxation so that 
there is no unfair competition and the flow of capital is not more 
advantageous in one country or another. If Canada does not keep in 
step with globalization and with the same rates of taxation by 
convention with all other countries, we are at a great and serious 
disadvantage.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	In light of the personal crusade of the member for 
Gander-Grand Falls to strike down Bill S-9 on technical grounds, 
that it did not originate in the House, he is ignoring the wonderful 
advantages and benefits of the bill.
<P>
	I was being taunted by the other side to say what those 
advantages were. It offers relief for Canadians residents from the 
application of U.S. estate taxes. It has tremendous advantages for 
all people in eastern Canada who have residences in Florida. If they 
happened to sell them they would have to pay estate taxes on 
anything  over $60,000. It raises the limit to $600,000. Is that not 
an advantage to Canadian residents?
<P>
	Yet when we listened to this member's speech he made it sound 
like it is a tax expenditure we are giving up that will cost Canadian 
taxpayers. It is not costing Canadian taxpayers. It is costing U.S. 
taxpayers. That is the other side of the story the member failed to 
point out.
<P>
	That is what I mean by balanced and representative argument 
and presentation when we are discussing bills. We will be 
discussing complete fundamental tax reform in the country very 
shortly. It is a burning issue; it is an issue that will come up. It 
includes issues like taxation and rates across borders nation to 
nation. We will have debate on various forms of flat tax. The 
member for Broadview-Greenwood has a proposal for a flat tax 
that his party members conveniently choose to ignore, which is 
typically Liberal. It offers a wonderful solution to our complicated 
system but they ignore the member. I do not know why but they do.
<P>
	When the debate takes place we will have people speaking for it 
and against it. No tax reform and no taxation system, no matter 
how much it is simplified, has all the answers and has all the 
solutions. It requires debate; it requires looking at both sides of the 
story. That is what I would like to see happen when we discuss 
taxation bills especially and bills that affect our pocketbooks as this 
bill does.
<P>
	As critic of this topic and this bill on behalf of our party I will be 
making a recommendation to our caucus. We on this side of the 
House have the right to accept my recommendation or not. We will 
see what happens on that side of the House when the amendments 
are voted on. I will recommend to our party that we oppose the two 
amendments because they are strictly for grandstanding purpose. 
They are very poorly written. They are extremely hard to 
understand except for Motion No. 1 which I can understand.
<P>
	As the Bloc member said, how can they be for it for a few years 
and then against it after? As the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance pointed out very well, the member probably 
does not understand the implications of his motion. As soon as I 
heard that, it verified the fact even the Liberal government felt it 
was very poorly written.
<P>
	Therefore on those two grounds I will be recommending that we 
oppose them. However, when it comes to Bill S-9 itself, I will be 
recommending to our party that we support the bill. That is where 
my comments end on the matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my responsibility to speak on 
these amendments because for seven years in the House I have 
been trying to generate debate on behalf of my constituents and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15466"> 15466 </A></B>
<P>
others across  Canada who believe the current tax system is not fair, 
not efficient and complex.
<P>
	For years we have been amending the tax act of Canada. We have 
made amendments to amendments that have generated a 
complexity. Most tax lawyers and most tax accountants when 
speaking privately say that the current tax act is an unmitigated 
disaster.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	After the last election when the Reform Party came to the House 
I was hopeful we could generate real solid debate on 
comprehensive tax reform. Granted it takes a couple of years to get 
our feet wet in this place. Most Reform Party members would 
admit that governance of a country like ours is complex. We cannot 
come here on day one and expect our ideas to be totally understood. 
There are all kinds of variables and difficulties that make 
implementing legislation difficult in comparison with the view we 
had in the private sector. I have certainly learned the hard way that 
it is difficult. I respect the fact that the Reform Party took a couple 
of years before it began the debate on total tax reform.
<P>
	I will support my government on the bill. I would never vote 
against a money bill because it is a confidence bill. The hon. 
member for Gander-Grand Falls and I are not saying that we want 
an election over the bill. However we are trying to illustrate what I 
have been saying in the House for seven years. The bill is another 
example of how amendments to amendments of the tax act can be 
brought forward.
<P>
	I do not mean to be disrespectful but probably 85 per cent to 90 
per cent of the members of the House do not know the full 
ramifications of the bill. We expect the opposition to challenge 
bills like this one. If I were in opposition right now, quite frankly as 
I forced debate on the bill, I probably would have put a lot more 
heat on the government and asked when we would move the debate 
forward on total tax reform. But no, they wanted to let it go 
through.
<P>
	The difficulty I have with the bill is that we are giving tax 
reform. We are harmonizing with the United States. The bill 
harmonizes Canada with certain aspects of U.S. tax law. The one 
great feature about the bill is that when the United States of 
America wants to amend its tax act we move quickly to be in 
harmony with it.
<P>
	We can reflect on the ongoing debate in the United States in 
terms of single tax, flat tax and all the various democrats, 
republicans and independents who are talking about total tax 
reform. If it gets to the front burner of their agenda hopefully 
Canada will not be far behind. Obviously we will move in a micro 
second. Part of the reason we are moving in the bill is that the 
Americans want it to be done quickly.
<P>
	One positive feature is that we move quickly to harmonize, but 
the difficulty is that it only gives tax reform to the elite in Canada. I 
have immense respect for  my colleague from Winnipeg, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, and I will 
support him in the bill. However I would not call people who have 
residences in Florida ordinary Canadians. They are wealthy. I 
consider someone who has $600,000 worth of property in Florida 
or in some other place in the United States to be fairly wealthy.
<P>
	I also have great concerns about article XI. Essentially once the 
bill is passed, and it will be passed, it will affect Canadians who 
want to send their children to an ivy league school such as Harvard, 
Yale, Cornell or Rice. I have nothing against ivy league schools in 
the United States. I am proud of Canadian universities but I would 
have liked to have gone to UCLA or one of those big ivy league 
universities. It costs $25,000 or $30,000 a year for four or five 
years. Under the bill Canadians who can afford to send their 
children to the ivy league schools will get a tax credit. I have great 
difficulty when essentially the bill will create a market for wealthy 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	If I were the president of Notre Dame or one of those places I 
would take out an ad in all Canadian universities. I would go to 
Upper Canada College in my community in Toronto, go to Bishop 
Strachan or take out a flyer telling parents about the tax credit they 
would get for all the money they spend sending their son or 
daughter there.
<P>
	We listened to the member for Yukon last night give her closing 
remarks. I have had immense respect for the member for Yukon 
since I came here seven years ago. She said that we were here for 
people who cannot always speak for themselves. It is obvious the 
people who can afford to speak for themselves certainly have the 
ability to get the bill through the agenda in the first two years of our 
mandate. Quite frankly I think it is a question of priorities, but in 
this bill we are forgetting a bit of our Liberal tradition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> So stand up and be counted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> You are voting for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I will not vote against 
the government on a bill that could bring the government down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> It won't bring it down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Yes, it will. It is a 
principle. It is a money bill and on anything to do with confidence 
in the government I would resign from the party. That is what the 
opposition does not understand.
<P>
	I suspect, and this is not partisan, members of Her Majesty's 
Loyal Opposition are feeling a bit guilty as part of their 
responsibility is to challenge us from time to time and they were 
totally asleep at the switch and could not generate a debate in the 
House on a bill which essentially in my judgment caters to the elite.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15467"> 15467 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy today to rise in support of the motions of the member for 
Gander-Grand Falls. I have always been impressed by him. He 
is one of those rare individuals who inevitably speaks his mind. 
He does his homework, analyses legislation and makes up his own 
mind about whether it is good or bad. For some members that 
seems to be a rare piece of behaviour.
<P>
	What is the bill all about? What are the motions all about? I have 
to go back to Kamloops at the end of this week. Whenever I do that 
I go to Main Street and have coffee with a few of the folks who ask 
what has been going on in Ottawa. What has the government been 
up to? What legislation is before the House? What is the 
government dealing with? What are the priorities of Parliament and 
so on and so forth? Part of my responsibility is to reflect as 
accurately as I can what the priority is. They will be perplexed 
when I tell them about all of the challenges that confront us as a 
great nation.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Here we are almost on the eve of a major referendum about the 
future of the country and there are horrendous economic, social, 
cultural and environmental problems confronting us from coast to 
coast. I have to tell my constituents the government's priority at 
this time is to bring forth a piece of legislation that will benefit only 
the very wealthiest families in the country in terms of their tax 
returns.
<P>
	Just the other day a major report in newspapers across Canada 
indicated that 75 per cent of Canadians willfully carry out their 
business transactions in cash to avoid paying income tax or sales 
tax or whatever. In other words, 75 per cent of Canadians are 
participating knowingly and up front in the underground economy. 
Are they doing that because they are tax cheats and because they 
participate in illegal and unethical activities? No. They have lost 
faith in the integrity of the tax system of the country. They see all 
kinds of people who do not pay their fair share.
<P>
	There are small business investors and small business 
entrepreneurs who are struggling and who see all kinds of tax 
breaks going to large corporations but none to them. They are 
working 60 and 70 hours a week and are struggling to get by, and 
they see tax breaks going to certain firms, not to small firms, and to 
certain Canadians but not to the ordinary Canadian.
<P>
	What does this tax provision do? Let anybody in the House stand 
up and argue after I sit down, but this is designed for the wealthiest 
families in the country.
<P>
	I wish my friend for Broadview-Greenwood were going to vote 
differently, but at least he is speaking up for what he believes in, 
which is more than most people in the House are doing on this 
particular occasion. Why are Canadian taxpayers being now asked 
to subsidize those families that want to educate their sons and  
daughters and family members in the United States? That is what 
this does. That is what the member for Gander-Grand Falls is 
saying. That is what the provision is.
<P>
	Those people who are sending their sons, daughters and other 
family members to American universities will not even have to be 
on the short list any more. For any college or any university in the 
United States, tax credits are available for any donations made to 
the foreign university or college.
<P>
	Why should struggling Canadian taxpayers and small business 
operators in the country be subsidizing American colleges and 
universities? Why should hard working men and women be 
subsidizing American colleges and universities? It does not even 
matter what their credentials are. They could be colleges that 
simply hand out PhDs or masters degrees for the price of a few 
dollars. Any American college or university is eligible to receive 
donations from Canadians and they will receive a tax credit for 
that.
<P>
	How can my friends in the Reform Party support this kind of 
provision, which is so unbalanced in terms of fairness? This will 
cost us money. It will cost the taxpayers of Canada hundreds of 
millions of dollars every year from now on. If we were a wealthy 
nation and had all kinds of extra coinage, perhaps we could 
consider this. I ask my friends in the Reform Party, who remind us 
regularly about their concern for the deficit and debt of the country, 
why they are supporting a piece of legislation that will drain 
hundreds of millions of dollars out of the treasury every single 
year.
<P>
	I have been listening carefully to the debate. I could not listen 
too carefully when the bill was in the Senate because it went so 
quickly. Quite frankly, it is going awfully fast in the House. It is a 
tax provision, tax reform for the wealthiest people in the country, 
for the elite of Canada. Is this our priority? Yes, it is. Is 
comprehensive tax reform taking place at this time? No, it is not. Is 
it called for by every single Canadian man, woman, and child in the 
country? Yes, it is. What are we doing? What is the government 
doing? The government brings forward a piece of tax reform via 
the Senate that will harmonize certain corporate tax structures with 
the United States and bring in provisions that are absolutely 
astounding.
<P>
	I would like to hear from my friends opposite before the debate 
ends why we are subsidizing American colleges. Why are Canadian 
taxpayers subsidizing American universities? Why do we consider 
it a priority at this time to give tax breaks of hundreds of millions 
of dollars to the wealthiest families in Canada?
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	My friend from Broadview-Greenwood, an individual for 
whom I have much respect, asks whether it is really a priority at 
this time to be passing tax legislation that will  benefit people who 
have investments in the United States in excess of $600,000. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15468"> 15468 </A></B>
<P>
suppose we could feel sorry for these folks. If you have 
investments over $600,000, the tax system could be more to your 
advantage. How many Canadians do we know with investments in 
the United States in excess of $600,000? A lot of people might have 
a cottage, an apartment in Florida or in California or someplace. 
How many people are worried today in terms of their financial 
realities who own $600,000 worth of real estate in the United States 
or have $600,000 worth of investments in the United States?
<P>
	I say to my friends opposite in the Liberal Party, is this your 
priority? Are these the Canadians you want to go to bat for today? 
What about the people at the food banks who are lining up this 
afternoon? What about the single parents who are struggling 
simply to make ends meet? What about the small business 
operators in this country struggling daily to simply put food on the 
table for their families? Why are you not bringing in legislation for 
them?
<P>
	I am referring to the second amendment which tries to bring at 
least a shred of credibility to this debate. As my hon. friend from 
Newfoundland has indicated, it is not perfect; it is sort of half a loaf 
because it says we are to limit this tax break to the year 2000. I see 
this as a bit odd, but I think it is at least going to end this particular 
tax buffoonery that is going to benefit a handful of very wealthy 
Canadians, at least to the year 2000.
<P>
	When I go back to Kamloops later this week and I have to 
explain to the people on Main Street in Kamloops, struggling 
business people, people who are struggling simply to put food on 
the table and unfortunately an increasing number who find 
themselves out of work, jobless, that this somehow is a priority of 
this Parliament and this government, they will shake their heads in 
disbelief and say that this place has lost touch with reality, that this 
place somehow deals in some Walt Disney version of the real 
world.
<P>
	I look forward to hearing other participants in the debate explain 
why on earth this is a priority.
<P>
	I say in conclusion to my hon. friend from Gander-Grand Falls, 
thank you for standing up and putting forward two amendments 
today that will bring at least some sanity to this legislation and 
indicate on your behalf and a handful of your colleagues your 
disgust with this legislation as well.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask members again to please put 
their remarks to the Chair. The Chair gets lonely and feels not a part 
of the debate and so on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to take a few moments and clarify what I believe to 
be some misconceptions or possibly attempts by particularly the 
person who just spoke to put things that are not in the bill before 
Canadians. I feel that is extremely unfair.
<P>
	What we are talking about here is a bill whose purpose is to put 
into place a protocol to amend the 1980 income tax treaty between 
Canada and the United States that was signed on March 17, 1995. 
The purpose of this is to put these measures into force. It has 
nothing to do with the member for Kamloops' statement of us 
wanting to give rich people more money or some such nonsense.
<P>
	One of the provisions of this bill will be, for instance, the 
elimination of withholdings that are there now. For instance, some 
people have estates in the United States. The example was given of 
a Florida winter home. I have a case a constituent brought to my 
attention of a mobile home in Florida owned by senior citizens and 
one of them died. I would not exactly call those rich people. Rich 
people do not own $10,000 mobile homes when they are 70 years 
old.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	I know the amounts. I know very well the amounts that are in the 
bill. The limits that are there now in terms of estates would barely 
cover a mobile home, its furniture, and a car.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The member across says that is not true. That 
could be his opinion. I am looking forward to his speech, which he 
seems to be wanting to make simultaneously with other hon. 
members. Perhaps he is in a hurry and cannot wait the extra 10 
minutes to speak. Perhaps then he had nothing substantial to say to 
start with. Either way, we will find out in 10 minutes what the hon. 
member wants to say.
<P>
	The point I am making here is that we are trying to amend the tax 
treaty between two countries. Under the terms of this treaty, gifts 
by Canadians to American colleges and universities will qualify for 
charitable donation tax credits, as has been said. However, half of 
the sentence was not said. That is the fact that gifts made by 
Americans to Canadian post-secondary education institutions will 
also qualify as charitable donations for the purpose of computing 
the donor's U.S. tax liability. In other words, it will permit people 
to donate money to a university-which we all recognize, I would 
hope, as being something legitimate and worth doing. It will enable 
us to continue doing that, and for a Canadian to donate to a U.S. 
institution should there be such people, and I am sure there are. 
Given that the U.S. population is at least 10 times the size of ours, I 
would say there is at least a fair chance that the reverse will also be 
true.
<P>
	That was not said by the hon. member for Kamloops. Why? 
Because the member for Kamloops did not feel it injected part of 
the partisan debate he was trying to portray in the House. We 
should remember what the bill does. Perhaps we should go beyond 
the rhetoric of the hon. member for Kamloops.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15469"> 15469 </A></B>
<P>
	I ask the hon. member from the New Democratic Party, who a 
minute ago could not wait for 10 minutes to  make his contribution, 
to speak to us about that and to admit to this House that in fact 
Americans will be able to donate to Canadian universities. Inject 
that into the debate so that all of us can understand. Maybe he can 
tell us if he is against that, particularly at a time when we are 
seeking assistance for our post-secondary education institutions.
<P>
	I believe these tax protocols are for the benefit of residents of 
both countries. The protocol has to be ratified by both countries 
before it takes effect. Some people have withholdings right now 
that have been there for years, and they cannot get their money 
back because this ratification process is not yet complete.
<P>
	Let us get on with it and pass this bill. Let these people have their 
funds and allow for the kind of investment that I brought to the 
attention of the House a moment ago.
<P>
	Let us look at other changes that are included in this treaty: 
bilateral reduction of withholding taxes on dividends, interest, 
royalties, reflecting the rates now accepted in force between most 
industrialized countries-is that so terrible; complete withholding 
tax exemptions for payment for the use of technology-I hope we 
are not against that; relief for Canadian residents from the 
application of U.S. estate taxes-that is the issue I raised earlier; 
and expansion of the exemption from U.S. tax for income earned 
by RRSPs, RRIFs, and Canadian pension plan-are we against that 
too? I would hope not. That is in the bill. Should we not be 
supporting that? I suspect we should.
<P>
	The bill also provides for authority to impose withholding on 
CPP and OAS payments made to American residents. Is the NDP 
against that too? I am still awaiting the speech from the hon. 
member across the way, the speech he could not wait to give us 10 
minutes ago.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	In addition, the bill provides for mutual assistance in the 
collection of taxes owed. Are we not in favour of collecting taxes 
that have not been paid? That is part of the protocol as well. That is 
what we are trying to do today. Are the NDP members against that 
too? Presumably they are, otherwise they would be supporting this 
bill. I cannot wait to see how they vote on the final outcome. I 
cannot wait for the third reading debate.
<P>
	Finally, the bill provides for authority to enter into arbitration to 
resolve disputes where the two countries' revenue authorities 
cannot agree. In other words, there is even a mechanism in here for 
dispute resolution in the whole process. In my book that makes this 
a good bill, notwithstanding the rhetoric. It makes it a bill that we 
should be supporting and passing. I cannot wait to see what the 
NDP will do particularly after the remarks of the hon. member for 
Kamloops.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to Bill S-9 and in support of the amendments put 
forward by the hon. member opposite, the member for 
Gander-Grand Falls.
<P>
	Since 1988 the Americans have required all non-residents to pay 
a 55 per cent estate tax on all U.S. property worth more than 
$60,000. However, the agreement before our House which is not 
yet ratified means that Canadians with less than $600,000 in U.S. 
assets will now be exempt from American estate taxes. That also 
means that Canadians with more than $600,000 in assets will pay 
the American tax and then will be allowed to claim a portion of it in 
foreign tax credits here in Canada. This means a $600,000 U.S. 
exemption which is a $900,000 Canadian exemption in real dollars. 
This is a tax bill which is helping the very rich.
<P>
	I want to say a couple of things about this bill. Members of the 
Liberal Party opposite, including the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, talk about how important this bill 
is to education. It is very peculiar that medicare, the health care 
system and the education system in Canada are being squeezed by 
these very Liberals through the drastic cuts in this time bomb 
budget which is before our country now.
<P>
	We are hurting the education system in Canada as a result of it, 
yet we are going to give the very wealthy an opportunity to make 
contributions to the education system in the United States and we 
are going to subsidize it through our tax dollars. My colleague, the 
member for Kamloops, clearly delineated and outlined the outrage 
of Canadians with respect to the approach of this government 
cutting back on education in Canada but providing an opportunity 
for wealthy Canadians to get tax credits for making contributions to 
the American education system.
<P>
	Now we see whose interests this government is working on 
behalf of in this House of Commons. It is not for ordinary 
Canadians, not for unemployed Canadians who require 
unemployment insurance or who require some assistance with 
respect to health care and education. They are not the interests of 
the Liberal federal government. The interests are those who feed 
the Liberal government, those who make substantial financial 
contributions to the Liberal Party. The very wealthy in this country, 
the large corporations, the wealthy families are getting their 
interests high on the agenda of the House of Commons because 
they own the Liberal Party, they contribute millions of dollars to it 
every year.
<P>
	As a result, their agenda is what is on the agenda of Canada. 
Their agenda is to accumulate more wealth. That is the agenda of 
the wealthy, the individuals, families and corporations in this 
country who bought and paid for the Liberal Party. This is a bill the 
Liberal Party is putting forward in the House of Commons which 
will thank them in spades for their generosity over the last couple 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15470"> 15470 </A></B>
<P>
of  years. The Canadian population is going to be paying for this 
generosity by the Liberal Party to their wealthy friends.
<P>
	Bill S-9 is an absolute disgrace for the Liberal Party. The 
Liberals should be embarrassed out of their shorts with respect to 
this bill. I hope they are feeling as bad as some of the members 
opposite look like they are feeling because this bill is a wrong 
priority for Canada. It is a wrong priority for the House of 
Commons.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	What about the farmers? This bill gives the wealthy families a 
break with retroactive tax breaks back to 1988, but what about the 
farmers in the prairies? What has the government done for the 
farmers? It eliminated the Crow benefit, which is a transportation 
subsidy. In effect 25 per cent of Canada's farming population will 
be eliminated from earning a living using their farming skills, yet 
the government is going to give the very wealthy additional 
hundreds of millions of dollars. This is tax reform of the very worst 
kind.
<P>
	What about a fair taxation system where Canadians who are 
earning a living feel confident that their load is being shared by the 
very wealthy? The Liberal government is not providing that sense 
of confidence to the ordinary Canadians, to those who are working 
and to those who are looking for jobs.
<P>
	This is an issue on which typically, Liberal members have 
mastered speaking out of both sides of their mouths. The hon. 
member for Gander-Grand Falls did an exceptional job of 
articulating the pitfalls of the legislation and the lack of priority it 
has with the Liberal government. That is common practice in the 
Liberal Party. Whenever it has a bill which is embarrassing, which 
will hurt the majority of Canadians at the expense of the very few 
wealthy, it always tries to have a few members of Parliament say: 
``What we are doing is not the right thing, but we are not going to 
vote against it. We are not going to make any public contention that 
it is a bad bill. However, we are going to put it on the record that we 
are not happy with what is going on''.
<P>
	It is time for Canadians to recognize the fact that members of the 
Liberal Party of Canada speak out of both sides of their mouths. 
They do it effectively. I want them to understand that Canadians 
will not accept that very much longer.
<P>
	This is not the first piece of legislation to help wealthy 
Canadians. In the budget last February the government dealt with 
family trusts. Family trusts are costing Canadian taxpayers 
millions and millions of dollars each year in terms of lost revenue, 
hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of the last four or 
five years. A family trust allows very wealthy families to shelter 
their income and their assets from Revenue Canada. Therefore, 
they do not contribute in a fair way to the revenues of our country.
<P>
	In the last budget the Liberals said they would do away with the 
family trust situation to obtain more money for the population of 
Canada. When? In 1995? No. 1996? No. 1997? Well no, it takes a 
bit of time to unwind these things. Maybe in 1999, a year or two 
after the next federal election is when the Liberal Party will address 
the issue. It is helping the very wealthiest families and corporations 
in Canada.
<P>
	The New Democrats are four square against this sort of priority 
when there are a large number of people who are unemployed, 
when the unemployment insurance program is under attack, when 
education is being cut back and when there is a vicious, unrelenting 
attack on medicare. The New Democrats will continue to stand up 
for ordinary Canadians on these issues, including fair taxation. We 
are asking the government to reconsider the bill, to make amends 
and to return it to the Senate, telling the Senate that we will not pass 
the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wanted 
to rise today to say that I consider this entire debate to be 
pathetically irrelevant. I reflect on the words of the hon. member 
for Kamloops that it is a frosty Friday when we have a member of 
the Reform Party agreeing with a member of the New Democrats.
<P>
	We should be bringing forward issues like true tax reform, such 
as the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood and our member 
for Calgary Centre have suggested. We should be bringing forward 
legislation for proper protection, particularly under the CPP and 
protection for seniors. We should be bringing forward realistic 
reform to health care and returning room to tax and powers to the 
provinces. I look at the Order Paper and I see that in addition to this 
totally irrelevant and pathetic Bill S-9, the next orders of 
government are: Bill C-90, the Minister of Finance, an act to 
amend the Excise Tax Act and the Excise Act; Bill C-106, the 
Minister of Justice, an act respecting the Law Commission of 
Canada; and Bill C-105, the Minister of Finance, Income Tax 
Conventions Implementation Act. We should be doing some real 
legislation in this House.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	It is a very unusual day but I underscore the fact that I stand very 
strongly behind the member for Kamloops when I say that this bill 
along with the rest of the legislation that is being brought forward 
by this government is pathetically irrelevant. Why not bring 
something to this House that has some meaning to the people of 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak on Bill S-9 to draw out some of the points that are in the bill. 
First I want to congratulate my colleague, the member for 
Gander-Grand Falls, for bringing this important issue forward in 
a number of ways.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15471"> 15471 </A></B>
<P>
	There are a number of good points in this bill and there are a 
couple of points I have very grave and serious concerns about. 
It is important to try to put on the record what some of those 
changes are so that we can distinguish between the areas of 
concern and the areas that may be positive.
<P>
	The agreement makes a number of important changes to the 
earlier treaty, including bilateral reductions in withholding tax 
rates and dividends, interest and royalties reflecting the rates now 
accepted and enforced between most industrialized countries. That 
is an area I have some concern with.
<P>
	A complete withholding tax exemption for payments for the use 
of technology, I think is a good point.
<P>
	There is significant relief for Canadian residents from the 
application of United States estate taxes, increasing the maximum 
estate tax exemption from $60,000 to between $600,000 and $1.2 
million U.S.
<P>
	The expansion to the exemption from United States tax for 
income earned by RRSPs, RRIFs and Canadian pension plans I 
believe is a good point.
<P>
	There is the authority to impose withholding on CPP and old age 
security payments made to American residents. The 1980 treaty by 
contrast allowed only the state of residence to tax such payments.
<P>
	There are two other points I should mention. There is the 
provision for mutual assistance in the collection of taxes owed by a 
citizen of one country who resides in the other, thus assisting in the 
prevention of tax fraud and evasion. Finally, there is authority to 
enter into arbitration to resolve disputes where the two countries' 
revenue authorities cannot agree.
<P>
	My point is that there are good points in the bill but also some 
areas which I think we should be concerned about. I want to draw 
attention to my major area of concern. I agree fully with the 
member for Gander-Grand Falls on this point. The member raised 
it in his point of order with the Speaker. He referred to a letter dated 
July 17 from the Minister of Finance. That letter makes these 
points. I quote from that letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am not aware of the basis for your suggestion that the cost associated with 
the reductions in withholding tax rates and certain dividends will total $250 
million annually. The only estimates that have been made post that figure at 
$125 million for 1995-96 and $145 million for 1996-97. It is important to note 
that these figures do not attempt to account for the effects of increased 
investment and the consequential growth of income tax revenues that may be 
anticipated because of the steps we are taking to bring our withholding tax rates 
in line with our major trading partners.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the nub of the issue. To me the statements indicate there 
is certainly a benefit to the wealthy in that part of the bill which I 
have to be concerned about. To be up front about it, one of the 
concerns I have about this Parliament is that I firmly believe for a 
Parliament to  operate effectively, one has to have good 
government and good opposition.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	I am amazed. I am extremely angry at what I hear from the 
opposition parties in terms of the issues sometimes. They have 
failed in previous debates to draw out these points so that they can 
be looked at early enough to try to address them.
<P>
	The Reform Party is always willing and able to criticize some of 
the social programs in Atlantic Canada, to criticize the 
unemployment insurance program. Here is a case where there are 
benefits to the wealthy and its members have kept mum and been 
highly supportive. As members of a good opposition party, they did 
not even draw out these points in debate.
<P>
	I am confident as a member of the government that there will be 
a counterbalance found in future legislation to reinstate some of the 
money back into the tax system, either by looking at RRSPs, 
corporate taxes or other taxation. As the government whip said in 
his speech, there are certainly some areas where we will gain 
finances as a result of this bill in terms of what is happening to the 
American residents.
<P>
	In the future we have to find a counterbalance to the mesh, to the 
finances, that have been lost as a result of the tax dividends being 
forgiven here.
<P>
	I would hope and encourage the government to look at that in the 
future.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-90 contains legislative provisions  permitting the 
implementation of a number of amendments to the excise tax 
announced earlier this year.
<P>
	Most of these proposals are linked to amendments announced in 
the February 27, 1995 budget, including amendments to the air 
transportation tax, the excise tax on gasoline, the marking 
requirements on tobacco products for sale in Prince Edward Island 
and the seizure and notification provisions relating to violations of 
the Excise Act.
<P>
	Other proposals concern amendments to rates of excise tax on 
tobacco products for sale in Quebec, Ontario and Prince Edward 
Island. These amendments were announced in February and March 
along with provincial tax increases on tobacco.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me begin by addressing the key budget measures contained 
in Bill C-90. First, proposed changes to the air transportation tax 
will enable the government to recover a greater proportion of the 
costs of the air transportation services and facilities that are used by 
air travellers.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to the Excise Tax Act will increase 
the maximum air transportation tax on higher priced domestic and 
trans-border air travel and the tax on international air travel 
purchased in Canada from $50 to $55.
<P>
	In addition, the maximum tax on trans-border air travel subject 
to the United States' 10 per cent air transportation tax and the tax 
on international air travel purchased outside Canada will increase 
from $25 to $27.50.
<P>
	These changes to the air transportation tax, effective May 1, 
1995, will generate additional revenues of $27 million in the 
1995-96 fiscal year and $33 million in the 1996-97 fiscal year.
<P>
	Second, Bill C-90 proposes an increase in the rates of excise tax 
on gasoline equal to 1.5 cents per litre effective February 28, 1995.
<P>
	In a budget that focused almost entirely on reducing the 
spending of government and delivered expenditure cuts by a 
margin of seven to one over tax increases, a move that I know was 
applauded by members of the Reform Party, this measure is 
necessary to raise an additional $500 million per fiscal year to 
ensure that the government meets the deficit reduction targets that 
are integral to a strong and growing economy. The Minister of 
Finance has reaffirmed repeatedly the government's commitment 
to meet the deficit reduction targets outlined in the budget in 1995 
and will undoubtedly reaffirm those in the next budget.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Third, in addition to these rate changes affecting the air 
transportation tax and gasoline, Bill C-90 also enacts amendments 
to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15473"> 15473 </A></B>
<P>
marking requirements for tobacco products for sale in Prince 
Edward Island. These  amendments will phase out the sale of black 
stock or unmarked tobacco products in Prince Edward Island and 
allow for the sale of Nova Scotia marked tobacco products in the 
province.
<P>
	This change in the tobacco marking scheme is being undertaken 
at the request of the two provinces and will allow for greater 
efficiency in serving the Prince Edward Island market.
<P>
	The final budget measure contained in Bill C-90 concerns the 
seizure and notification provisions in respect of offences under the 
Excise Act.
<P>
	The proposed amendments will rectify certain enforcement 
difficulties by allowing officers discretion in their ability to seize 
vehicles while stipulating that reasonable efforts must be 
undertaken to provide notice of seizure to known third party 
interests.
<P>
	The bill also implements important changes in respect of excise 
tax rates for tobacco products for sale in Quebec, Ontario and 
Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	As all hon. members are aware, modest federal excise tax 
increases were announced earlier this year in conjunction with 
provincial tobacco tax increases in these three provinces.
<P>
	These tax increases follow the success to date of the national 
action plan to combat smuggling in significantly reducing 
contraband tobacco activity and restoring the domestic tobacco 
market to legitimate Canadian wholesalers and retailers.
<P>
	In Quebec and Ontario, federal excise tax rates are being 
increased by 60 cents per carton of 200 cigarettes, while in Prince 
Edward Island excise taxes are being increased by $1 per carton of 
200 cigarettes and 32 cents per 200 tobacco sticks.
<P>
	The excise tax increases in respect of cigarettes for sale in 
Quebec and Ontario are effective February 18, 1995 while the 
increases in respect of cigarettes and tobacco sticks for sale in 
Prince Edward Island are effective April 1, 1995. These changes 
will generate an additional $65 million in federal revenues on a 
fiscal year basis.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the importance of the 
provisions contained in Bill C-90, notwithstanding the flippant 
remarks made by the hon. member of the Reform Party while 
speaking earlier and saying that the legislation on the government's 
agenda was unimportant.
<P>
	The proposed changes to the air transportation tax and the excise 
tax rates for gasoline are an important part of the government's 
commitment to increased cost recovery and deficit reduction.
<P>
	Amendments to the tobacco marking scheme will allow for 
greater efficiency in serving the Prince Edward Island market, 
while amendments to the seizure and notification provisions of the 
Excise Act will improve the delivery of enforcement activities.
<P>
	Finally, the changes to the excise tax rates for tobacco products 
for sale in Quebec, Ontario and Prince Edward Island represent 
important first steps toward the long term restoration of uniform 
federal excise tax rates for tobacco products across Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I encourage my colleagues to pass this bill without delay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-90 is now at the third reading stage. We have already had an 
opportunity, as the official opposition, to state our position on this 
bill at the second reading stage and in committee, the Standing 
Committee on Finance.
<P>
	Although some of these measures may be positive, there is one 
that bothers us particularly, so much so that we would vote against 
this bill. I am referring to the proposal to increase the excise tax on 
gas by 1.5 cents per litre.
<P>
	I will be brief. I want to make a connection between this debate 
and the one we had when we were discussing the excise tax on 
cigarettes.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	In fact, this bill contains measures that would bring about a 
gradual upward adjustment of the tax on tobacco products. Of 
course we all realized at the time that the purpose of the drastic 
reduction in taxes on tobacco products was to destabilize 
smuggling networks. However, everyone agrees that now the price 
is so affordable it could have a disastrous impact on the demand for 
these products in the long term. The lower the price, the better a 
product sells.
<P>
	No one objects to an adjustment. However, we should be careful 
not to do this too quickly and in the process give these networks a 
chance to regroup and take control again.
<P>
	That being said, the government still has a duty to monitor the 
situation, because there are other ways besides taxation to ensure 
that people engaged in smuggling various products are arrested. 
This still goes on. It is still the case for various kinds of products. 
Enforcement is not as strict at that level. Much remains to be done 
to improve the way we deal with various smuggling networks.
<P>
	As far as the excise tax on gas is concerned, everybody knows it 
can be very irritating, and it is so easy for the government, when it 
needs money quickly, to use the excise tax on gas, because this is 
instant revenue. We are talking about $500 million which the 
finance minister quickly took out of taxpayers' pockets.
<P>
	It is hard for the consumer to see this happening, because when 
the price of gas goes up at the pump, the consumer is not sure 
whether the price of oil has gone up or the retailer, the manufactur-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15474"> 15474 </A></B>
<P>
er or someone else has  raised his profit margin or whether the 
government has just increased the excise tax.
<P>
	Unlike other types of products, when we buy gas, it does not say 
what proportion of the price we pay for a litre of gas is actually 
taxes. It is just as well, because taxpayers would be even more 
furious with the various governments. They would be constantly 
reminded of all the taxes levied on gasoline products.
<P>
	In this case as in the case of tobacco products, when the 
government goes to the other extreme and tax levels rise beyond 
the acceptance threshold, taxpayers feel they have every right to 
buy contraband goods. We may deplore it, but the taxpayers' 
feeling is that this is a legitimate action they are taking.
<P>
	We must not do anything to bolster this trend, because we know 
all the problems there are with the underground economy, the black 
market economy. At some point, the tax on gasoline reached the 
limit people would bear. We feel that any increase will only 
contribute to pushing consumers toward an underground economy 
which is extremely counterproductive for everyone. 
Counterproductive not only for the taxpayers who make use of it, 
since those using the black market economy are penalizing 
themselves without knowing it, but also for everyone in the long 
run. At some point we have to learn our lesson.
<P>
	It does not seem that we have learned any lesson from what 
happened with tobacco products. Certain products in a number of 
different areas are still being heavily taxed.
<P>
	However, it is not abnormal for there to be higher taxes on 
gasoline than on other products, because of the environmental 
effects everyone is aware of. Steps must be taken to ensure that 
when what the economists call externalities result from the 
consumption of a product, there are provisions to make the users 
bear the cost of those externalities. At some point, however, there is 
some uncertainty as to whether we have gone too far in this.
<P>
	Essentially, we strongly disagree with this measure and feel that 
raising the tax again by 1.5 cents a litre in his last budget was not 
the route the Minister of Finance ought to have taken. We do not 
feel this is a measure that will contribute to any great extent to 
economic recovery. Everyone knows that there is a lot of work to 
be done on the expenditure side. If the Minister of Finance has no 
ideas of his own, we might suggest that he hasten before the 
finance committee to discuss it, something he has refused to do 
because of his fear of presenting his financial statements before the 
referendum. That is understandable.
<P>
	If he wants to discuss it in more detail, we invite him to do so. 
This will provide us with the opportunity to debate the matter with 
him and to point out that there may be other avenues he ought to 
explore when he needs  to balance his books, instead of constantly 
digging into the taxpayers' pockets for more revenue.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	So, essentially, it is our intention to oppose adoption of Bill C-90 
on third reading and, as I have said, essentially because of this 
measure. There are others on which I have not spoken but which we 
were able to bring up during second reading or in committee on 
which we do agree. But we have a major disagreement with this 
one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak in opposition to Bill 
C-90. This is a Liberal taxation bill. I want to comment on how 
easily the words ``Liberals'' and ``increased taxation'' flow 
together; they seem to be a naturally united phrase.
<P>
	This bill amends the Excise Tax Act and the Excise Act in order 
for the Liberals to bring in the increased taxes they proposed in 
their budget last February. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that you and 
probably every other working Canadian will agree that this country 
simply does not need any more new taxes. Canadians are probably 
one of the most overtaxed people in the entire world, and we have a 
government in power that is intent on continuing to make sure we 
do not lose that mantle of taxation.
<P>
	Taxation ultimately drains the lifeblood out of our economy. 
This is something Canadians are very aware of and very concerned 
about, how the high taxation levels in our country have such a 
devastating effect on the economy. We will talk about two areas of 
harmful effects of taxation, which probably account for 90 per cent 
of how we build and keep our economy buoyant, and that is 
investor confidence and consumer confidence.
<P>
	High taxation levels have delivered a tremendous level of 
uncertainty to the investors, the people who would build and 
expand businesses in our country, who would hire Canadians to run 
their factories and operations, creating jobs in the country. Because 
of the rising taxation levels there simply is no certainty of the 
future for these investors, who have no incentive to increase their 
investments.
<P>
	The average working person in Canada probably has less 
disposable income than ever before. There is no certainty that 
disposable income will not continue to shrink. Therefore consumer 
spending has been drawn back, thus creating a harmful effect on 
our economy.
<P>
	The Liberals respond not with a plan to decrease their spending, 
to decrease their deficit spending, not with a plan to offer some tax 
relief to Canadians, the two things that would probably serve in 
more ways than any other measures to restore some buoyancy to 
our economy. No. The Liberal Party does not respond with these 
two natural solutions. Instead, they implement more taxation in 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15475"> 15475 </A></B>
<P>
their February budget. Now they are seeking the authorization to 
put that into force.
<P>
	Prior to the election in 1993, the Reform Party said that if the 
Liberal government were elected, using their own red book 
predictions on the financial aspect, over the term of this 35th 
Parliament the Liberal government would add $100 billion to our 
national debt and would increase the annual interest payments on 
that debt by some $10 billion. That is $100,000 billion and $10 
billion. The Liberal Party is right on target.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	By the end of the 35th Parliament our national debt will have 
increased by $100 billion, our interest payments on that debt will 
be up somewhere in the neighbourhood of $50 billion to $52 
billion, and all because the Liberal Party has not taken what could 
be considered a common sense solution to the financial crisis in 
this country, which is to reduce taxes and reduce its deficit 
spending. Instead the Liberals chose to increase taxes. Bill C-90 
gives them authorization to implement, for example, the 1.5 cent a 
litre tax on gasoline, which is going to add $500 million more taxes 
on the middle class alone.
<P>
	While the government talks about tax fairness, in its last budget 
it in fact raised taxes by over $1 billion. In fact if we look at tax 
increases in the last two government budgets, the Liberals have 
increased taxes by about $2.5 billion, with another $500 million in 
user fees or hidden taxes.
<P>
	Canadians should be pleased that these increased taxes have in 
fact been put to good use. I would like to give some examples of 
Liberal good use. The U.S. Department of Energy-and this is 
small potatoes, but there are about 5,000 of these, I 
understand-received a $35,000 grant from the Canadian 
government. The United Steel Workers of America received 
$116,000 from the taxpayers of Canada via the Liberal 
government. Here is a good one: the Prison Art Foundation 
received $51,000 from the Canadian taxpayers, compliments of the 
Liberal Party. And the Feminist Literacy Workers Network 
received another $57,000 from the taxpayers of Canada, thanks to 
the Liberal government. This is only part of about 5,000 or 6,000 of 
these grants that have gone out.
<P>
	This type of money does not fall down from the sky in some 
miraculous manner. We do not pick it off a tree, as some Liberals 
would like to believe. This kind of money comes from the pockets 
of hard-working Canadians, who are among the most highly taxed 
people in the world.
<P>
	It is said that the average middle class Canadian worker in this 
country in all forms of taxes pays about 63 per cent of their gross 
income in taxation. In a country as rich as Canada is, with the 
potential and the opportunity Canada has, the fact that Canadian 
workers are paying this much taxation out of their gross income is 
absolutely obscene.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, of course you will have the floor, 
should you so desire it, after the question period.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., we will now proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
real pleasure for me to rise in this House today to acknowledge the 
contribution to Canadian life by Carolyn Thomas, who is an 
outstanding Canadian and who is a constituent of mine.
<P>
	Mrs. Thomas, from the community of East Preston, yesterday 
was the recipient of the 1995 Governor General's award in 
commemoration of the persons case. This is a particular honour for 
me because I have known Mrs. Thomas and worked with her and 
her husband since I was elected to this House in 1988. In that time I 
found her to have dedication and determination practically 
unrivalled in my community, not only pertaining to the betterment 
of women, but for the betterment of her community of East 
Preston, the oldest indigenous black community in Canada, and for 
Canadian society as a whole.
<P>
	In addition to her work in the struggle for equality for women, 
over her lifetime Carolyn has been a visionary in her struggle for 
human rights and better race relations. She was a founder of the 
Human Rights Commission in the province of Nova Scotia and 
continued her good work with them for 23 years.

international day for the elimination of poverty provides an 
opportunity for all Quebecers to take a moment to reflect on the 
dramatic living conditions of some of our fellow citizens.
<P>
	Nearly a million and a half Quebecers live below the poverty 
line. We live in a province that suffers from the highest rate of 
poverty in Canada, by far. Despite all the efforts of the Government 
of Quebec, one child in five in Quebec comes from a poor family. 
Quebec seniors continue to be much poorer than seniors anywhere 
else in Canada. We are struggling with a huge problem that is 
tearing us apart.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
week, for the first time ever, Canadian MBA teams took to the 
courts to the great delight of their fans across the country. How 
ironic that at the same time as we are welcoming the MBA to 
Canada we are closing the door on North America's largest sports 
magazine, <I>Sports Illustrated</I>.
<P>
	Essentially the government has said that Sports Illustrated 
cannot be allowed split runs in Canada because SI is too efficient in 
its production and too effective in attracting readers and therefore 
advertisers. By all means let us not encourage that; we do not want 
people to go around thinking it is all right to be efficient and 
successful.
<P>
	By shutting <I>Sports Illustrated</I> out of Canada the government is 
taking a 200-year leap back in time. While other Canadian 
communications technologies compete head to head with 
companies from around the world, the magazine publishing 
industry in Canada has adopted the views of communist Bulgaria.
<P>
	Sadly Canadian magazines will be the big losers in this policy. If 
advertisers cannot reach their market in magazines they will do so 
in other media that do not respect laws issued by sentimental 
Canadian regulators who pine for the good old days before the 
telegraph.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
NDP health critic on April 2, 1994 in third reading debate on the 
Canada Health Act, I welcomed the move to eliminate extra billing 
and user fees. But I also asked the Liberal government of the day, 
which was the first federal government to unilaterally cut back on 
federal transfers, ``to sit down with the provinces and renegotiate 
that funding relationship so we can have a full-fledged financial 
partnership with respect to medicare''.
<P>
	The Liberal government's new Canada health and social transfer 
with its $7 billion cut is just another Liberal unilateral cut and a 
further erosion of the partnership that was medicare.
<P>
	Dealing with private clinics is one thing, but it is a form of 
straining out gnats while swallowing camels if the federal 
government continues to set up medicare for destruction by 
starving it to death.
<P>
	When it comes to medicare the Liberals are into a form of 
passive euthanasia that plays into the hands of those who would 
like to actively destroy it by what I would call right wing assisted 
suicide.

	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of Dr. May Cohen of Burlington, Ontario, a keen 
promoter of women's health issues and a powerful advocate of 
gender equality in the medical profession. She was a recipient 
yesterday of the 1995 Governor General's award in 
commemoration of the Persons case.
<P>
	A physician, researcher, educator and activist, Dr. May Cohen 
has repeatedly challenged the medical profession on the way it 
deals with the health concerns of women patients. As a volunteer 
and in her capacity as Associate Dean of Health Services at 
McMaster University's faculty of health sciences, she has taken a 
lead on an impressive array of issues, including gender equality, 
sexual harassment, sexual abuse of patients by physicians, the role 
of women in the medical profession and women's health in the 
context of women's lives.
<P>
	I ask colleagues to join with me in celebrating Dr. May Cohen's 
achievements and extraordinary commitment to women's health.

approach the anniversary of the Persons case I am honoured to pay 
tribute to Alice E. Tyler of Edmonton, Alberta, the province where 
the Persons case got its start.
<P>
	Alice Tyler has made the portrayal of the famous five champions 
of the Persons case and the promotion of their accomplishments a 
major focus of her life's work. In recognition of her efforts Alice 
Tyler was recognized as a recipient of the 1995 Governor General's 
award in commemoration of the Persons case.
<P>
	Alice Tyler's portraits of the famous five in the Persons case 
have been hung in the Alberta legislature, the Edmonton Law 
Courts Building and the Edmonton City Public Library. They have 
been displayed elsewhere in Canada and abroad.

<P>
	On a personal level, she has always been an ardent believer in the

by Ruth Flowers of Makkovik, Labrador, a recipient of the 1995 
Governor General's award in commemoration of the Persons case.
<P>
	The voice of the women in her community, she has sought to 
protect women victimized by violence, to involve women in 
community economic development and to preserve and promote 
the traditional culture of Inuit women.
<P>
	A committed advocate of women's rights, Ruth Flowers was the 
catalyst behind the creation of Inuit Women of the Torngats and its 
first president. Under her leadership the organization established 
the first safe house for abused women on Labrador's north shore.
<P>
	For her dedication and selfless efforts on behalf of the women of

southern Ontario to close, the Harris government has just revealed 
its true intentions with regard to Ontario francophones.
<P>
	For Franco-Ontarians, the message is clear: if you really want 
services in French, move to Quebec. This action, which speaks 
volumes, unfortunately confirms that Quebec's presence in Canada 
does nothing to prevent decisions that flout the fundamental rights 
of francophones outside Quebec.

	Where is the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the 
self-styled defender of francophone rights? Why is he hiding when

keeping with our government's policy of openness to provide as much 
information as possible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Why then is the government denying access to information 
requests regarding the severance package for Claude Bennett, the 
former chair of CMHC. Mr. Bennett agreed to step down last 
August after a back room cabinet deal sweetened his severance 
package.
<P>
	It is time the government came clean with its backroom deals. 
Either we have a policy of openness as the Prime Minister states or 
we do not, or perhaps the policy is opaque as recently stated by the 
parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	Mr. Bennett's severance package was paid for with taxpayer's

<P>
	Ms. Kingham's accomplishments have been many. An articulate 
and persuasive public speaker, she has given countless 
presentations and briefs on topics ranging from the rape shield law 
to women's health. She has encouraged others. As a firm believer

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THECRTC">THE CRTC</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
I want to say I am appalled at the statements made by the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs who said this morning that Quebec 
sovereignists were racist. I think that is entirely unacceptable.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Increasingly, 
francophones see their language and culture threatened in Canada. 
The CRTC, whose mission includes preserving the cultural identity 
of francophones in the broadcasting sector, is being forced to shift 
its decisions as we saw recently when an exemption was granted to 
Power DirecTv for the use of an American satellite for television 
transmissions.
<P>
	Now that Power DirecTv has applied to the CRTC for a 
broadcasting licence for pay per view television, what guarantees 
do francophones in Quebec and the rest of Canada have that the 
regulations now in effect at the CRTC will be enforced this time, 
unlike what happened in this recent case before the CRTC?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, what is important is what it says in the act, and I am 
referring to the Broadcasting Act which established the CRTC. I 
am very pleased that the CRTC will consider representations on the 
subject raised by the hon. member. That is how the legislation 
works, and it is there to protect Canadian content on our airwaves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
minister has decided to come out of his shell, we will ask him about 
the CRTC.
<P>
	Would he agree that Power DirecTv's application for permission 
to broadcast 63 English channels, 60 of which are American, and 
only one French channel on pay per view will leave the door open 
for Canada and Quebec to become a mere extension of the 
American market, which would be extremely harmful to the French 
fact in America?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, obviously, in Canada the interests involved can apply 
for whatever they want, but it is up to the CRTC to decide. It makes 
its decisions on the basis of the legislation, the Broadcasting Act to 
which I referred earlier.
<P>
	When the CRTC has made a decision with respect to a licence, 
that decision can be appealed to cabinet. That is how the legislation 
works, and its purpose is to protect Canadian content.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the House 
will recall that in a recent case, when the minister  was gagged by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15480"> 15480 </A></B>
<P>
the Leader of the Government, CRTC regulations were 
circumvented to ensure that Power DirecTv obtained a special 
authorization.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	My question to the minister raises the same concerns. How can 
the minister expect francophones in Quebec and Canada to feel 
secure in the belief that the federal government will protect the 
French fact and their cultural identity in the broadcasting sector, 
when we know perfectly well that recently, the federal government 
bent the rules of the CRTC to give Power DirecTv an advantage and 
that now the same company proposes a pay per view service 
including 63 English channels, 60 of which are American, and one 
French channel? How can francophones say they are being well 
defended by this government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, </B><B>Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question would be valid if it were 
based on fact, which it is not. The federal government never 
violated the act and never instructed the CRTC to contravene the 
act, on the contrary.
<P>
	We wanted to ensure there was no penetration of Canada's 
airwaves via American satellites. We acted for the purpose of 
protecting Canadian content.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, cultural groups in Quebec rallied together yesterday to ask 
the CRTC to not compromise the present linguistic balance in 
broadcasting, specifically by granting a licence to Power DirecTv. 
For its part, the federal government claims to be acting, again in the 
case of Power DirecTv, in the name of free competition. This new 
episode demonstrates that Quebec has no control over its 
broadcasting environment.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that the Power DirecTv 
project would seriously compromise the linguistic balance of the 
Quebec broadcasting system and consequently risk weakening 
Quebecers' cultural identity? Is this what awaits Quebecers 
following a no vote in the referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the CRTC has received a number of applications for 
licences. Next comes the perfectly natural process whereby they 
are heard, everyone's comments are heard, those in favour and 
those opposed-this is the point of the process.
<P>
	The government will not intervene in the debate, because the law 
prevents it. We will, however, see at the end of the process whether 
the CRTC's decision is wise and, if it is not, interested parties will 
certainly be appealing to the government. At that point, we can 
decide. Let us allow the process to take its course, and then we will 
have some answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the minister acknowledge that, in the  present federal
<P>
context, Quebec has no power over broadcasting enabling it to 
protect its cultural identity against the massive influx of new 
English language television channels into Quebec? Is this not 
another good reason to vote yes in the referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like our colleague to respond to questions I 
have often put to my friends in both the Bloc and the Parti 
Quebecois.
<P>
	As a country separated from Canada, how is Quebec going to 
block the American programs that spill over its borders via 
satellite? They will need the mechanism that we already have-the 
CRTC and the Broadcasting Act.
<P>
	They should be delighted to have such a mechanism and vote no.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canada 
Health Act will not allow private clinics to provide services that are 
insured by medicare. Most Canadians feel they should have a 
choice if medicare does not meet their needs.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	Will the health minister finally agree to amend the Canada 
Health Act to allow fully opted out private clinics in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unlike the opposition Reform Party, we have stood by our red book 
promises. We have said that we would continue to support the five 
principles of medicare. The medicare we have in Canada is one of 
the great reasons why it is wonderful to be Canadian.
<P>
	In this country, Mr. Speaker, we have a system where it matters 
not how wealthy you are. What matters is how sick you are. That is 
the way it should continue to be. We should use our resources the 
best way possible to have the best technologies, the best 
pharmaceuticals in order to treat our sick Canadians and make 
them healthy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have trouble 
figuring out why waiting lists do not seem to bother the Liberals.
<P>
	An American firm is now selling waiting list insurance for 
Canadians. If you have to wait more than 45 days you can ship off 
to the states. Not only do the Liberals say line up and shut up but 
they also say ship out.
<P>
	What is the minister doing to reduce waiting lists or is she 
content to have Canadians travel to the U.S. for medical attention?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Perhaps, Mr. 
Speaker, if the Reform Party really wants to know about waiting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15481"> 15481 </A></B>
<P>
lists they should speak to the 38  million Americans who have 
absolutely no insurance at all.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, a survey conducted last year by the 
Alberta Consumers' Association found that ophthalmologists who 
only operated in hospitals had waiting lists for surgery of two to 
five weeks while those who worked in both private clinics and 
hospitals could perform surgery on a private patient in two to four 
weeks but a hospital patient could wait up to 20 weeks.
<P>
	Private clinics are not necessarily the answer to long waiting 
lists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, these are facts. 
The wait for elective heart surgery in Manitoba is over two years; 
for a hip replacement in P.E.I. it is over one year.
<P>
	This minister clings to her bureaucrats and her beloved 
legislation-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Macleod.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> The minister clings to her beloved 
bureaucrats and her old-fashioned legislation. In the nineties that 
means medicare is literally bad for everyone.
<P>
	Will the minister put health before petty politics and arbitrary 
deadlines, sit down with the provinces and reform the Canada 
Health Act so we will not have to choose between death on a 
waiting list or travelling to a foreign country?
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will work and I am working with the provincial governments to 
shape the future of medicare. The National Forum on Health is also 
working and will be consulting with Canadians.
<P>
	When it comes to waiting lists in this country, allowing the 
wealthy to get to the head of the line does not shorten the line; it 
only pushes others to the back.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	After two years of Liberal government and 25 years of the 
Official Languages Act, the situation of francophones outside 
Quebec continues to worsen. One third of them now speak English 
at home. In British Columbia, the assimilation rate is even 75 per 
cent. So now we are not speaking of more than a million 
francophones outside Quebec but rather of 640,000 who are still 
using French.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that the poor results obtained 
from the Official Languages Act shows the  failure of his vision of 
Canada, since it has not been successful in blocking the increasing 
assimilation of francophones outside Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, recently the magazine <I>L'Actualité</I> reported that Canada 
has made more progress in recent years than any other country in 
the world with respect to the use of French.
<P>
	I cannot understand the hon. member. She is prepared to abandon 
francophones outside Quebec. She is prepared to abandon the 
million francophones living outside Quebec.
<P>
	They show no consideration for these people because they want 
to separate from Canada. We on the other hand want to remain 
within Canada because we want to offer real protection to those 
who really have the merit of speaking French, the francophones 
outside Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to remind the Prime Minister that it is he who 
has separated us from Canada, it is not Quebec which wishes to 
separate from Canada.
<P>
	Secondly, may I remind him also to consult the figures from 
Statistics Canada. There are one million francophones, yes, but just 
640,000 of them use French at home and are therefore considered 
French speaking.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They are becoming assimilated.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>They have been assimilated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Poof.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>The francophones-poof.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The francophones-poof.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>Does the Prime Minister then not acknowledge 
the very opposite, that the future of francophone culture in America 
rests with a sovereign Quebec, for only a sovereign Quebec will 
constitute the anchor point for all francophones. In it they will find 
a true and tenacious ally in solidarity with them, one that will 
defend their most legitimate demands everywhere.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this very day the newspaper representing francophones 
outside Quebec has asked Quebecers to vote no in the referendum, 
because the future of francophones outside Quebec depends on the 
federal Official Languages Act, and on the fact that there is a 
government here in Canada, in Ottawa, which has always defended 
francophones outside Quebec.
<P>
	Certainly some people have more difficulty than others in 
retaining their French, but they do want to retain it. Not only that. 
Every year 350,000 English speaking Canadians learn French 
because they live in Canada, a country where there are 
francophones, and this raises the number of people speaking 
French in Canada and in the world. The reason French is alive and  
well in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15482"> 15482 </A></B>

America is that the French have remained in Canada since 
Confederation.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOMALIAINQUIRY">SOMALIA INQUIRY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday Canadians were stunned by the admission 
of the defence minister that the National Defence Act will prevent 
certain charges from being laid at the conclusion of the Somalia 
inquiry.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of National Defence told the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> that charges could be laid under the Criminal Code of Canada. 
The chairman of the Somalia inquiry stated: ``Most of the matters 
we will be dealing with might end up in some findings that could 
perhaps call for disciplinary action as opposed to criminal 
charges''. As opposed to criminal charges.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that there will be no judicial remedy for 
certain charges when the Somalia inquiry is finally concluded?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I answered this 
question rather clearly yesterday.
<P>
	There is sufficient flexibility in the National Defence Act to 
ensure that justice will be done. The government well knew the 
statute of limitations on certain disciplinary matters under the 
National Defence Act when the inquiry was called. Indeed the 
justice who chairs the commission, Justice Létourneau, knows it 
well because he was a former judge of the court martial appeals 
court.
<P>
	There are other ways in which justice may be done 
administratively. If the hon. member is afraid that those people if 
identified cannot be brought to justice or are somehow not going to 
be dealt with fairly, I assure him to the contrary.
<P>
	This will be a matter that will be done in a very deliberate way 
after all the evidence is brought forward. I would like him to let the 
commission get down to work so that justice can be done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister knows full well that I am afraid of 
nothing, but the minister should be very afraid of his 
mismanagement of this entire affair.
<P>
	I will read from the National Defence Act. It sets out a three-year 
limitation period for everything except mutiny, desertion, absence 
without leave, and death penalty offences. That is it.
<P>
	Canadians know there is a separate code of law which applies to 
our military to enforce discipline and  leadership which expires in 
March 1996. Canadians want to know why the minister has so 
mismanaged the affair that now discipline and leadership cannot be 
enforced in our Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member quite frankly does not know what he is talking about. He 
has cited rather selectively sections of the National Defence Act. I 
want to assure him that there are ways of dealing with culpability 
other than with criminal charges. He should go back and look at the 
National Defence Act and perhaps get some advice on how to 
interpret it and then come back with some decent questions 
tomorrow.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Premier Roy Romanow of Saskatchewan, that great Canadian 
who was a party to excluding Quebec from the Canadian 
constitution during the night of the long knives in 1982, said 
recently that if Quebec voted yes, that was the end of French school 
boards in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister intend to protest against this kind of 
blackmail at the expense of francophone communities, or does he 
agree with his 1982 accomplice?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, this question is not the 
administrative responsibility of the Prime Minister. This question 
would be out of order but if the Prime Minister wants to answer it, I 
will let him answer it. If not, I will go on to the next question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the best way to protect the education rights of 
francophones outside Quebec-which we put in the Canadian 
constitution in 1982, it was not there before-the best way to 
ensure that French schools outside Quebec are protected by the 
constitution adopted by this Parliament in 1982, when I was 
Minister of Justice, is to stay in Canada. The best guarantee 
francophones have is to stay in Canada.
<P>
	When I see francophone members abandoning francophones 
outside Quebec, I find that shameful, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
asking the Prime Minister whether he dissociates himself from 
what was said by Premier Roy Romanow of Saskatchewan. That is 
what I am asking, and he is evading the question.

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Premier of Saskatchewan, like the other premiers 
today in Canada, has an obligation under the Canadian constitution 
to protect French schools outside Quebec. If Quebec separates 
from Canada-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is blackmail.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> It is not blackmail. There will 
be only one million francophones outside Quebec who will no 
longer have the support of francophone members from Quebec, 
like me and others who have spent their careers defending 
francophones outside Quebec here in the House of Commons. I 
have been doing that for 32 years. It produced results. But they 
want to abandon them because they want ambassadors from 
Quebec driving around abroad in their limos.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
the February budget the defence minister announced the closure of 
CFB Chilliwack, the only land force base in British Columbia. Yet 
in a memo marked secret and prepared for DND just prior to that 
announcement, land forces command made the following 
observations: ``Land forces command requires an army base to 
support the domestic operations in B.C. LFC feels Chilliwack is 
ideally suited to fulfil those operations. The closure of CFB 
Chilliwack should be opposed and CFB Chilliwack should be 
retained''.
<P>
	Why did the minister ignore the advice of his own officials and 
choose to close B.C.'s only land forces base, CFB Chilliwack?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, 
I accepted the advice of my officials. It was the department that 
recommended the consolidation of the army base in Edmonton 
with the closures of Chilliwack and Calgary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
another memo obtained under the Access to Information Act, 
Brigadier General Stephenson, director general of land forces 
development, questions whether there will be any savings by 
closing the base. Colonel Daigle of land forces command says that 
the cost of moving the engineering school for example will negate 
the savings achieved by closing CFB Chilliwack.
<P>
	If land forces command argued it needed the base open for 
military reasons and the experts said that closing the base was not 
going to save any money, did the minister close the base because of 
mismanagement or did he merely choose to move it to Edmonton 
because his Liberal seatmates live there?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would ask you to please consider 
not to impute motive in any sense. The first part of the question I 
would say is in order. The second part is not in order. If the hon. 
minister would like to answer the first part, I would give him that 
option.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again the hon. 
members opposite read selectively from documentation. They did 
not look at the full range of advice that was provided to the deputy 
minister and to the chief of defence staff. The fact is the savings 
generated by the closing of Chilliwack will be $46 million a year.
<P>
	I find it rather odd that the Reform Party, a party that comes into 
this House everyday and tells the government to cut spending, 
objects when that spending is cut close to home. ``Not in my 
backyard'' is the way Reformers play politics.

question is for the Prime Minister. In causing the closure of the 
Centre francophone de santé et des services communautaires in 
southern Ontario, the Harris government has revealed its true 
colours. For Franco-Ontarians, the message is clear: If you want 
services in French, move to Quebec.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister explain his silent complicity with 
Mike Harris, as he cuts services to francophones in Ontario?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not aware of this matter. I will certainly look into it, 
because I intervened successfully in the matter of the French school 
in Kingston, not very long ago. I want to see if there is a valid 
reason. I find it absolutely incredible, however, that suddenly, two 
weeks before they want to leave Canada, they are worrying about 
the francophones outside Quebec, who will be left to their own 
devices if Quebec separates.

Quebecers-not the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois-but 
Quebecers themselves will never drop francophones outside 
Quebec.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	According to a recent analysis by the Centre for Strategic and 
International Studies in Washington, an independent Quebec could 
acceed to the various international treaties.
<P>
	Can the minister explain to us the stages and steps a country 
must pass through to acceed to NAFTA and to the World Trade 
Organization?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I can quote some of the conclusions and even produce the 
report. Mr. Roh's main conclusion is as follows: An independent 
Quebec would have no automatic entitlement to existing trade 
agreements such as NAFTA, the World Trade Organization 
agreement and the Auto Pact. Accession to these agreements would 
have to be negotiated.
<P>
	Second conclusion: American law does not allow the President 
of the United States to grant an independent Quebec access to the 
trade advantages it enjoys at the present time as part of Canada, 
until such time as Congress approves and implements such 
accession.
<P>
	In addition, it would be a long and difficult process to negotiate 
accession by an independent Quebec to the WTO, NAFTA and the 
Auto Pact. Bowing to congressional and private sector pressures, 
American negotiators would try to obtain changes in key sectors 
such as agriculture.

<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	The decision of the Supreme Court to hear the case of convicted 
child murderer Alton Royer shows clearly that the unelected 
Supreme Court has ignored the views of the elected members of 
Parliament and millions of Canadians.
<P>
	We were told yesterday that the justice minister is seeking 
intervenor status in this case. Could the justice minister tell the 
House what his objective is in doing so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government appreciated the 
support of all parties in respect of Bill C-72, which changed the 
criminal law in this country, as all hon. members know, to make it 
impossible for someone to rely upon their own self-induced 
intoxication as an excuse when they commit crimes of violence 
against another involving general intent.
<P>
	The case to which the hon. member refers included acts that 
occurred at a trial that was held prior to the enactment of Bill C-72. 
Therefore, when the Supreme Court of Canada grants leave to 
appeal in that case it will consider that case in reference to the law 
as it stood at the time of the alleged acts. Bill C-72 will not have 
any application.
<P>
	Carriage of that prosecution rests, of course, with the provincial 
attorney general. However, as the parliamentary secretary told the 
House yesterday, we are considering asking the Supreme Court of 
Canada to allow us to intervene. If we did so, it would be to provide 
whatever assistance we can to the court in deciding the issue 
presented by that particular case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as it seems 
there is some question as to whether Bill C-72 has been effective in 
preventing the use of extreme intoxication as a defence, what will 
the justice minister do to ensure that extreme drunkenness is not 
used as a defence in these cases?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I should emphasize for the hon. 
member that Bill C-72, which has now been approved by 
Parliament and proclaimed in force, is the law of the land.
<P>
	I would simply point out that no such criminal law amendment is 
retroactive, so it would not affect a case that arose in the courts 
prior to its enactment. The case to which the hon. member referred 
is proceeding on the law as it stood before Bill C-72.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15485"> 15485 </A></B>
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that the enactment of Bill C-72 
did in fact change the criminal law in this country. It made it 
impossible from that date onward for anybody to rely upon their 
own act of intoxicating themselves to escape the consequence of 
criminal conduct when it involved violence against another and 
general intent.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
directed to the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	According to the Official Languages Act, public servants in 
Ottawa-Hull have the right to work in their own language. 
However, in his latest report, the Commissioner of Official 
Languages confirmed that only 11 per cent of francophone public 
servants regularly write in French and that for three-quarters of 
francophones, English is still the only language of communication 
with their boss and at meetings at work.
<P>
	Will the President of the Treasury Board acknowledge that the 
federal policy on language of work has failed pitifully in the 
Ottawa-Hull region and that once again, francophone employees 
are paying the price?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it was a Liberal government that brought in the Official Languages 
Act. It is a Liberal government that has in fact advanced the cause 
of speaking in the official language of a person's choice in the 
federal public service right across the country.
<P>
	There is more work to be done. We have recently put out a 
brochure, together with the Commissioner of Official Languages, 
to help encourage people to use the official language of their choice 
at their place of work in the federal public service. We will 
continue to try to improve the means of using the language of 
choice because that is part of this government's policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the choice is 
there, but the result is always the same.
<P>
	Would the President of the Treasury Board agree that federal 
public servants in Quebec working in the Ottawa-Hull region are 
treated by the federal government as second-class citizens and that 
only the sovereignty of Quebec would be able to make French a 
language of work in government offices located in the Outaouais?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Certainly 
not, Mr. Speaker. I hear French and English used frequently, 
constantly, every day in my work. I am sure others in this 
government do as well.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	We will continue to encourage people to use the official 
language of their choice. That is a commitment this government 
has made. It is made to the people of Quebec, it is made to the 
people of every part of this country, all francophones in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Spending on the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy is spinning out of control. The Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans has now admitted that this year's deficit 
alone is $105 million.
<P>
	Last week the minister announced his so-called brilliant solution 
was to siphon money away from the $300 million capacity 
reduction portion of the plan to cover the shortfall. Will the 
minister tell this House exactly how much of the $300 million 
allotted for capacity reduction will be diverted and confirm what 
many fishermen already suspect, that there will be no further 
licence buybacks?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the only thing spinning out of control, after only his 
second question as the new fisheries critic, is this member's 
credibility.
<P>
	This government is consulting with fishermen's organizations, 
including the Canadian Council of Fish Harvesters, representing all 
of the major fishing unions and associations right across Canada. 
The adjustment that has thus far been made by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and by the Department of 
Fisheries and the Minister of Fisheries to the TAGS program has 
been made after consultation, a foreign concept to the Reform 
Party, with the fishermen's unions representatives. Any 
adjustments that may occur in the future will be made after the 
same kind of consultation.
<P>
	If the member is interested in reflecting properly the reality of 
Atlantic Canada and the tough challenges Atlantic Canadians face, 
he ought to do at least a minimum of homework.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> The minister has managed to blow the 
hopes of Atlantic Canadians right out of the water. Capacity 
reductions were supposed to fix the problems of Atlantic 
fishermen, but this government's failure has left Atlantic 
Canadians with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15486"> 15486 </A></B>
<P>
no hope for a viable future in the fishery. All they can hope for is 
that the cheques  from Ottawa do not run out. That is not hope, it is 
dependency. Atlantic Canadians deserve better.
<P>
	Will the minister now admit that his attempts at capacity 
reduction have been an abject failure and that he has quashed the 
last hope of Atlantic fishermen for a livelihood in the future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member's question is will we admit that Atlantic 
Canadians are defeated. Will we buy the policy of the Reform Party 
to buy everyone a one-way ticket to Toronto? Will we give up on 
the region and see it cut and cast adrift? Will we assume that all 
Atlantic Canadians are losers? Will we assume there is no future 
for our people? Absolutely not. We are going to work to rebuild the 
region.

	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is directed to the President of the Treasury Board. The 
Public Service Alliance of Canada recently conducted several 
talks, unsuccessful so far, aimed at reaching an agreement with the 
Government of Quebec on hiring 26,000 federal public servants 
now residing in the Outaouais, in the event Quebec separates from 
Canada.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, are these promises not rather unrealistic and liable 
to create false hopes, considering the obvious fact that this cannot 
be done, administratively speaking?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Government of Quebec is talking about a public service of the 
size of 110,000 people to serve a population of some 7 million, 
whereas after the current downsizing is completed at the federal 
level we will have 190,000 public servants serving a population of 
28 million.
<P>
	Those numbers do not add up. Federal public servants in Quebec 
should be very concerned about the ability for the separatists to 
meet those kinds of numbers. They are simply out of proportion. 
They are simply unbelievable. Federal public servants should 
beware of the false promises coming from the separatists.

	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I draw to the attention of the House the fact that Bill C-64, 
an act respecting employment equity, on which we are to vote 
tonight has passed through the House from report stage to the 
conclusion of third reading in five consecutive sitting days. This is 
as a result of a new procedure whereby the bill went to a committee 
after first reading.
<P>
	However I also draw to the attention of the House that the new 
procedure, which was instituted for the very best reasons, has made 
it impossible for some MPs like myself who have serious 
reservations about the bill at report stage to have our reservations 
answered by bringing witnesses to committee, because the 
committee no longer sits after report stage reading.
<P>
	Consequently the speed with which the bill has gone through the 
House presents a problem for MPs who would like to see all 
legislation going through the House given full and due 
consideration so that they know how to vote in the most informed 
way possible.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I guess the comments of the hon. member deserve some reply. I 
am not sure he has raised a valid point of order, but I submit in 
respect of the procedure on this bill and others that are dealt with 
in this way that hon. members are able to go to the committee 
to which the bill stands referred. Hon. members are also in a 
position to move amendments to the bill in the House at report 
stage.
<P>
	There was an extensive debate at report stage. There was 
extensive debate at third reading. Indeed third reading debate was 
extended today by unanimous consent because some members 
apparently missed an opportunity to speak last evening. The 
government has been most solicitous in its efforts to ensure fair and 
reasonable debate on all aspects of the bill.
<P>
	I submit the procedure followed was correct and in accordance 
with the rules. If the hon. member is suggesting-although I do not 
think I heard it in his comments-that there was in any way a 
problem with the procedure, I think if he looks at it and sees what 
happened in the committee he will agree there was not really a 
point of order.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak on the point of order raised by 
the hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth. We previously 
brought to the attention of the House the fact that legislation 
submitted to committee prior to second reading has not had proper 
analysis at the committee level and has been denied adequate 
debate in the House.
<P>
	Once the legislation goes to committee it does not come here for 
second reading, one of the most extensive reviews of legislation 
available to members of the House. That is gone. We are limited to 
a 180-minute debate just to review sending the legislation to 
committee, not to review the contents of the legislation.
<P>
	When we agreed to this change in the rules we thought the 
potential was there to make committee work much more 
meaningful. However we have experienced in committee clause by 
clause study of legislation that is restricted to a few seconds per 
clause or a minute or so per clause. Things are rammed through. 
Then without second reading we came to third reading where the 
bill is approved in principle and no further amendments could be 
brought forth by members.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This is a new procedure that the House has 
adopted. If there are flaws in the procedure I suggest these can 
probably be looked at in committee again.
<P>
	The hon. member has made his point. I appreciate the 
interventions of both the parliamentary secretary and the member 
for Kindersley-Lloydminster, but this is not a point of order.

<P>
	The hon. member raises a case in point. I am well aware of the 
point he is raising. That we do not like how one member or another 
acts is not necessarily a point of order. In my view it is a point of 
debate.
<P>
	I think I know where the member was going with his point. It 
was that all hon. members should respect one another. We should 
be listening to one another either when we ask questions and when 
we give answers. I encourage all hon. members in the House to do 
just that.

that when a minister quotes from a document in the House the

	When an ordinary member like you or me, again forgive my

consent of the House. The rules are quite clear on that.

third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before our interesting question period the hon.

approximately 30 minutes remaining.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Thirty minutes?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> That is what I was talking about the heckling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for the extra time. I am sure my colleagues will 
be pleased to hear that.
<P>
	Before question period I was talking about some of the free 
spending habits of the Liberals. I pointed to the U.S. department of 
energy receiving $35,000 from the Liberal government. It really 
needed the money. The United Steelworkers of America received 
$116,000 from the Liberal government; Prison Art Foundation, 
$51,000 from the federal government; and Feminist Literacy 
Workers Network, $57,000 from the government.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	This is where the taxpayer's money is going. This is what is 
contributing to overspending by $30 billion every year. Why are 
the Liberals continuing to do this, continuing in the same habits as 
the prior Tory government? Because all of these special interest 
groups that are receiving these funds year after year are constantly 
in Ottawa lobbying the government, talking to the government, 
yapping away at the government for more money, being obnoxious 
almost to the point the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway was 
earlier in question period. All these special interest groups are 
standing in line for this free-wheeling, free-spending handout from 
the Liberal government.
<P>
	In order to continue these free-wheeling, free-spending ways, 
what does the Liberal government do? It simply raises taxes, as it 
did in the February budget. It seeks approval in Bill C-90 to 
increase the taxation on gasoline by a cent and a half per litre to 
raise another billion or two billion dollars or so. This goes on and 
on and on. Canadians are tired of the deficit spending of this 
Liberal government and they want it to stop.
<P>
	Study after study after study has shown that deficit spending will 
not create a buoyant economy. Study after study by economist after 
economist has said that we cannot spend our way out of a recession. 
The only way we can get out of a recession is to get the economy 
going again, and we are not going to get the economy going if we 
keep increasing the taxation levels on the Canadian workers and 
Canadian companies. This is not rocket scientist stuff. Why can 
they not understand this?
<P>
	One of the reasons most of the economists around the world 
agree with the Reform Party's method of getting this economy back 
in shape and getting Canada out of its fiscal crisis is because when 
the Reform Party stands up to talk about fiscal responsibility and 
curing the fiscal ills we are prepared to put it on paper, in writing, 
very clearly and very distinctly showing exactly how we would get 
the economy going again, how we would reduce taxation and 
reduce overspending without seriously harming the Canadian 
people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15489"> 15489 </A></B>
<P>
	This Liberal government stands up every day and calls us 
hackers and slashers, saying that we want to cut off all these 
programs for the Canadian people, the programs that we never 
could afford in the first place and that this group over here have 
used year after year-and the Tories before them-to get elected.
<P>
	I would like to suggest something that is not only my own 
opinion but also the opinion of many economists. The biggest 
threat to the social programs in this country is the out of control 
spending by the Liberal government. The biggest threat to the 
social programs in this country, to medicare, to education, and to 
things Canadians have come to depend on is not the fiscally 
responsible Reform Party on this side of the House but the out of 
control Liberal spenders on the other side of the House, and the 
Tories before them.
<P>
	It is time this government got serious about getting the economy 
going again. It is time this government got serious about addressing 
the concerns the Canadian people have about the high taxation 
levels in this country. It is time this government got serious about 
what it takes to create real and long-lasting jobs in this country. It is 
time this government got serious about its out of control deficit 
spending.
<P>
	I guess I am sad to say that I cannot believe for a minute that this 
party and this government ever will get serious. Let me make a 
suggestion to this government. If they are not prepared to get 
serious about addressing the concerns the Canadian people have 
about the economy, jobs, and taxation, maybe they should just 
move over and let someone else move in who will get serious about 
it. That of course is the Reform Party of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Canadian people are going to have to bear the 
pain for another couple of years. I wish it were over sooner, but it 
looks like another couple of years of out of control deficit 
spending.
<P>
	I am sorry, I forgot to mention something in my speech. The hon. 
member for Beaver River reminded me that I should never stand up 
and talk about out of control spending by the Liberal government 
without talking about the pensions. I thank the hon. member for 
Beaver River for walking by at the right time.
<P>
	The Reform Party did the responsible thing in this Parliament 
when 98 per cent of the Reform MPs in the House opted out of the 
pension, giving our personal commitment to the Canadian people 
that we are serious about cutting spending. We intend to save the 
Canadian taxpayers some $35 million by our simple act of opting 
out of the MP pension plan.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that while 98 per cent of Reform MPs 
chose to opt out, chose to do the right thing, unfortunately 98 per 
cent of the Liberal MPs chose to stay in, chose to do the wrong 
thing. What kind of a message does that send to the Canadian 
taxpayers, who  are watching their disposable income shrink more 
and more on a daily basis? What kind of message does that send to 
the Canadian middle income taxpayer who is suffering under a 63 
per cent tax burden on their gross income? Does that send the 
message to them that this government is prepared to get serious 
about the financial crisis we are in?
<P>
	I just hope that before this Parliament ends we will see the 
Liberal government make some distinctive, specific plan to reduce 
the spending habits they have, which they acquired from the Tories 
and which they taught to the Tories.
<P>
	We have heard the Minister of Finance talk about targets, but he 
will never let a target stand still. He uses the phrase of ``rolling 
targets''. Rolling targets are a good way to set them, because if you 
miss them you can always blame the fact that they were not 
standing still.
<P>
	The IMF, the C.D. Howe Institute, and almost every economic 
think tank in Canada and many in the U.S. have sent a clear 
message to the Canadian government, this Liberal government: 
``Get your spending in control and get your level of taxation down 
or you guys are going to be in a whole bunch of trouble''. I hope 
they got the message.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to enter the debate on Bill C-90.
<P>
	Some members have suggested that Bill C-90 is part of the other 
side of our budgetary commitments. Our budget in 1995 stated it 
would reduce spending by $7 for every $1 of revenue increase. 
Unfortunately, this bill deals with the revenue increase side of that. 
Needless to say, most people do not like the idea of tax increases. I 
do not think anybody does.
<P>
	One aspect of the bill reports a 1.5 cent per litre tax on the cost of 
gasoline. I think we are mature enough to admit that it will hurt 
people, small and medium-sized businesses that use gasoline in 
their business, commissioned salesmen and so on. We also realize 
that Canada has one of the lowest retail prices for fuel in the world. 
We are still very much the recipients of a very cheap fuel program 
in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to address other aspects and areas that some of my 
Reform colleagues talked about today when they asked when we 
are going to get our spending under control. I do not know where 
the Reform Party has been for the last two years, but I have seen 
some tremendous changes in cost reductions of the federal 
government in the area of the civil service in particular, with 
45,000 civil servants being cut from expenditure programs. I have 
watched the Department of Natural Resources be cut in half. There 
have been the bills to privatize CN Railway. There have been bills 
that deal with the government's commitment to its shareholding of 
Petro--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15490"> 15490 </A></B>
<P>
Canada. It goes on and on. There has been all kinds of evidence of 
cutting.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The trick about cutting, of course, is that it has to be done 
equitably and fairly. The whole object of program review has been 
to go to each department of government to try to find those areas 
where it is possible to cut while at the same time maintaining the 
very important aspect of our social fabric, the underpinning of our 
social network in Canada.
<P>
	I am very proud to be a part of a government that took that kind 
of approach to deficit and debt reduction. I look at some of my 
colleagues, especially those in the province of Ontario, and often 
wonder whether they have gone through that kind of thought 
process and whether in fact we have properly dealt with some of 
the people who can least protect themselves in society.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the Auditor General of Canada two 
weeks ago tabled his report, in which he questioned whether 
Canada's level of debt was sustainable. What does that mean? 
Quite frankly, if you were running a corporation, there is a level at 
which the debt structure compared to the income structure is so 
onerous that you can no longer continue and you become insolvent. 
Indeed, some people have suggested that if we apply that test to the 
country we may well discover that Canada may be an insolvent 
nation, unable to pay off our debt. Our debt is increasing due to 
interest rates. As long as interest rates exceed the level of growth in 
the economy, we will continue to have an accumulation of debt and 
we will have to cut even deeper into the expenditure side of 
government.
<P>
	Some people think we are in an endless situation. However, the 
government, particularly the Minister of Finance, has taken a 
specific course of action to reduce the debt to three per cent of the 
gross domestic product. That is not an end in itself. I have heard the 
minister say over and over again that with the concept of two-year 
rolling targets in fact we will continue to focus on reducing the debt 
on a year-by-year basis and go beyond the three per cent of GDP 
target.
<P>
	There are a number of tax bills before the House. There was 
some interesting debate on Bill S-9, which is the Canada-U.S. tax 
treaty. I do not want to speak on that bill, as we are debating Bill 
C-90, but some of the aspects that came out of that debate were 
interesting. The hon. member for Kamloops was surprised that the 
Reform Party had accepted some of the negative aspects of the 
Canada-U.S. tax treaty, those things that specifically appear to 
assist people in the higher income groups. I wondered why the hon. 
member felt that way, because he also seems to be interested in the 
concept of tax reform and some of the Reform Party's discussions 
about a flat tax. I notice that the hon. member is taking part in a 
conference to be held later this month that deals with that area.
<P>
	I would like to talk generally about the concept of a flat tax. In 
my mind, it also represents a form of tax change and a shift of the 
tax burden within the Canadian taxation system.
<P>
	A lot of things the Reform Party has come out with sound 
simple. Why do we not have a simple system? The income tax 
system to many people in Canada is complex. There is no question 
about that. I do know, however, that less than half of the population 
actually requires professional help in filing their tax returns. The 
average person can still file a tax return without the need of an 
accountant or a tax lawyer. The people who require tax assistance 
are usually those who are in the higher income brackets. They 
usually are trying to take advantage of certain tax credits and tax 
advantages which exist in the system.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The whole concept of taxation is also an element in fiscal policy. 
The government attempts to get aspects of the economy energized 
by using certain tax legislation which gives advantages to certain 
sectors as opposed to others. I would think members of the Reform 
Party would be quite aware of the oil and gas sector out west. It has 
been greatly assisted by a number of concepts, flow through shares 
and other kinds of tax driven investments which have encouraged 
exploration.
<P>
	If we look at the history of a flat tax aspect, it is interesting to 
note that its actual birth occurred in England. At the time it was 
originally brought in, it was thought of as more of an income 
redistribution process. It actually entertained the concept of 
moneys flowing from the government back into the taxpayers' 
hands. It was used as a method of negative income tax. It was used 
as a method of doing away with the multitude of social programs 
that existed. It used the tax system to allocate these resources to 
people. People in the lower income bracket would actually be net 
receivers from the government, looking at a guaranteed annual 
income or whatever that means is. Of course people over a certain 
means would be the net payers.
<P>
	Surprisingly enough that has changed appreciably. In 
presentations I have heard it is especially becoming very popular in 
the United States. It does not talk about redistribution at all. As a 
matter of fact it talks about flattening the existing tax rates.
<P>
	In Canada we have three basic classifications of tax rates. A flat 
tax essentially would eliminate that and would create one rate of 
tax. At the same time, as I understand the proposal, it would also 
eliminate certain members from the lower income stream. In a 
sense it is like a two rate system. Some people would not pay tax 
and everybody else would pay a flat tax. It does not take a lot of 
arithmetic if we actually sit down and start figuring it out to know 
who is going to pay this tax.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15491"> 15491 </A></B>
<P>
	Some people like to say that if we took away all the benefits, 
all the bells and whistles from the existing system there would 
be so much efficiency that we would not have to change the 
quantum of tax. The quantum of tax would be reduced and when 
the smoke cleared nobody would be paying any more taxes than 
they were before. Some people would be paying a little bit less 
and everyone would understand the system better. Therefore it 
would be an efficient system.
<P>
	These are all great ways to sell something but the reality is it is 
not true. It is just not true. Right now, 63 per cent of all income 
taxes paid in this country are being paid by the top 30 per cent of 
income earners. That tells us right away that the system is 
progressive. That is to say, as one makes more money one pays 
more tax.
<P>
	People in this House will say they can point to somebody who is 
a millionaire and did not pay any tax last year. There are situations 
like that but the reality is they are very rare. I will repeat it because 
it bears witness and deserves to be repeated, the reality is that on an 
ongoing basis 63 per cent of all income taxes in this country are 
paid by the top 30 per cent of the income earners.
<P>
	What happens if we do tax flattening? There is only one 
assumption which is that we are going to allocate tax liability away 
from that top 30 per cent, not to the bottom 20 per cent who do not 
pay any taxes at all, but we are going to shift it to the middle class. I 
do not have to tell anyone that the middle class are fed up with the 
taxes they are already paying. They think they are paying too much. 
It is those people, the two income earner families that are going to 
be paying the expense of a flat tax situation.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kamloops was amazed that the Reform 
Party would be supportive of the Canada-U.S. tax convention and 
some of the good things it was doing for the very wealthy in that 
treaty. At the same time I suggest it is the same element and the 
same people that this party is representing that also want the flat 
tax.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	The benefactors of this tax will be the very, very wealthy. It is 
not just me who is saying that. The U.S. Business News states that 
those people who earn in excess of $200,000 in the United States 
will be substantially better off with a 19 per cent flat tax. David 
Bond, an economist with the Hongkong Bank of Canada, says there 
will be significant income allocations of taxes with a flat tax. Most 
economists all over the world who have studied this will say that 
the flat tax is not viable mainly because it creates increased taxes 
for the people who can least afford them.
<P>
	What is wrong with the tax system? Quite often people come 
along giving us solutions for the wrong problems. Yes, the existing 
taxation system in Canada is very complex. Does it need to be as 
complex as it is? No, it  does not. We can get simplification in the 
system. Some of the simplifications are to stop fiddling and 
changing it every week. Every week we change some aspect of the 
income tax system. This constant change creates a situation where 
nobody understands it. If we just had a moratorium on tax changes 
perhaps we would understand it.
<P>
	What is the main frustration people have with the taxation 
system? It is not so much the filling out of the forms as it is the rate 
of tax. People in this country are constantly referring to the fact that 
we have an underground economy. People will take their money to 
the Turks and Caicos Islands or wherever their favourite tax haven 
is to avoid taxes. That has nothing to do with the taxation system 
but it has to do with the rate and quantity of taxes we pay.
<P>
	There have been countless international studies of every regime 
which has increased its taxes. There constantly was a correlation 
between an underground economy and tax evasion. The GST is 
another symptom of people avoiding taxes. The problem is the rate 
of tax. Canada's rate of taxation is the second highest in the OECD, 
just slightly less than that of France. When tax rates are as high as 
they are today we are also going to have tax evasion and tax 
avoidance.
<P>
	Changing the system is not going to change the fact that we are 
bringing in about $123 billion in taxation. Our deficit and debt 
relationship do not allow us to change those numbers today. What 
we want to do of course is get on to a program of deficit and debt 
reduction so that somewhere after the year 2000 we can actually 
see a rationing down of tax rates. With that rationing down of tax 
rates it will create a greater confidence in our taxation system and 
hopefully domicile some of our lost tax revenues.
<P>
	As a matter of fact I have often been a great supporter of asking 
the Turks and Caicos Islands to become one of our provinces. This 
was the subject of a debate in this House some years ago. I have 
been to the Turks and Caicos and have talked to some of those 
people. I think it would be a great thing. We could re-domicile all 
of those tax revenues that are now hiding down there.
<P>
	The whole area of fiscal and monetary policy is very complex 
but the taxation system is still very much an important aspect of 
our fiscal tools to stimulate various aspects of the economy. The 
flat tax of course would eliminate that kind of manipulative 
approach to the economy and force the government to treat 
everybody much the same.
<P>
	Is the forestry sector the same as the car manufacturer? Is the 
Saskatchewan wheat farmer the same as the Ontario beef farmer? I 
suspect they are not. I suspect the industries in this country, for 
example the oil and gas industry or the mining sector which rely 
heavily on capital intensive aspects of their businesses look at  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15492"> 15492 </A></B>
<P>
rapid depreciation within their businesses which are all different 
and all unique.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	We can say we do not want the mining sector and indeed that is 
what is happening in this country. The mining sector is going south. 
The mining sector says there are too many inhibitions to set up here 
in Canada and that it is cheaper to set up down in Chile. That is 
because of the tax regime. We have to remember how they got 
going. There were also tremendous tax incentives to get those 
businesses started. There is not any country in the world that does 
not use the concept of some kind of form of favouritism of various 
sectors it wants to promote.
<P>
	Today we want to promote our science and technology sector. 
Our government is now giving something like $1 billion away in 
scientific tax credits. These scientific tax credits are to provide an 
underpinning that Canada will get into the science and technology 
revolution which we see creating jobs in the small and medium size 
business sector in Canada. Personally, I feel that those science and 
technology tax credits are misguided. They are not going to the 
small and medium size companies that really need them. A lot of 
that expenditure is being focused at the multinational level and 
larger corporations. It is not actually doing what we want it to do.
<P>
	That is the kind of debate we need in this House. That is the kind 
of change to our tax system we need in order to fine tune it, so that 
it is working in the best interests of all Canadians and creating jobs. 
Simple solutions for complex problems are not going to do that.
<P>
	This bill, of course which I support, is a money bill of the 
government and it is one necessary aspect of the 1995 budget. I am 
happy to be part of a government that continues on its commitment 
to meet its objectives which were laid out in that budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to address some of the comments made by the member for 
Durham, specifically his attack on a flat tax. Based on the way he 
was making his comments I do not believe he understands what the 
flat tax is. The flat tax is a simple equitable system for all 
taxpayers. It will greatly increase the incentives to work, invest and 
save.
<P>
	He talks about the problem in this country. The problem is the 
debt and the high taxation levels. It is not the deficit. We can 
change the deficit: just raise taxes, lower spending and it is gone 
any time we want to. This government is saying that the deficit is 
the problem and it is going to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of 
GDP. The government is adding to the problem. It is digging the 
hole deeper by adding to the debt.
<P>
	We need to look at our spending. We need to look at a way of 
stimulating the economy, developing a taxation system that is pro 
growth, something that will get the  government off our backs, out 
of our pockets and leave us alone with more disposable income.
<P>
	In the name of deficit reduction, I am getting sick and tired of 
government after government not addressing change in the taxation 
system. We need fundamental tax reform. Every other country is 
looking at their high rates of taxation. Every other country is doing 
something about it and this gentleman from Durham on the 
government side says it is a simplistic solution.
<P>
	In the months and the year ahead, he will see that it is not a 
simplistic solution; it is a very complicated solution. The simple 
flat tax is harder than it looks. The simple flat tax is not as easy to 
implement as he claims the Reform Party suggests. There are a lot 
of items in this area that need discussion and debate. We cannot 
argue with the fact that if there is a broad tax base and the tax base 
is redistributed we could have a lower rate. A flat tax would get rid 
of all the tax loopholes, incentives and shelters the hon. member 
was talking about.
<P>
	It is not income from the forestry business or the oil and gas 
business or wealthy people, middle income people, lower income 
people. A dollar is a dollar. We want to tax that dollar as little as 
possible. We want to broaden the base as wide as possible, so we 
can have the lowest maximum rate. That is what equity is. That is 
what fairness is.
<P>
	A flat tax, whatever form it is, whether it is a pure flat tax, a 
proportional flat tax, a Mills flat tax, a Hall-Rabushka flat tax, 
whatever kind of flat tax it is, the key is that we want to protect the 
lower income people, people who are making minimum wage or 
close to minimum wage. We do not want them paying taxes. That 
will reduce the pressure and the strain on the social programs. 
Middle income earners will not be affected. They will remain 
relatively the same. However they are going to be happy knowing 
that when the tax loopholes and incentives and shelters are taken 
away from the wealthier people they will pay more in tax dollars 
even though their rate is low. That is what makes it interesting to 
look at a flat tax and why we should be doing so. It may sound like 
a simple solution but it is not.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	A flat tax is not as simple as it looks. It is very complicated. In 
fact, it is harder to bring in something simple than it is to bring in 
something complicated.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice brought in the gun control bill. It was a 
very complicated bill. It was a very elaborate bill, but he got it 
through, no problem. Is that not right, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	The flat tax is going to be a very difficult tax reform to get 
people to look into and to look at. I would like, in my section of 
comments, to point out that it is not simple. I am not saying on 
behalf of the Reform Party that a flat tax is simple. It is just 
simplifying the system. That is where the merit lies. Simplification 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15493"> 15493 </A></B>
<P>
of the taxation  system will save us billions of dollars in 
compliance costs.
<P>
	Does the member want to know what else it does, Mr. Speaker? 
It would also get the government out of the business of trying to 
micromanage the economy. It would reward initiative by leaving 
75 to 80 per cent of every dollar earned in the pockets of the earner 
which is a better place than in the pockets of the government.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would imagine the hon. member for Durham 
would like a counter commentary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I noticed the member reading from 
a piece of paper. I guess it is the hymn book of the Reform Party. I 
suggest that Reform members start going back and actually looking 
at the whole structure of taxation in Canada.
<P>
	I could not believe my ears when he said it is a difficult tax, it is 
not simple. Then he turned around and made the statement that is 
so simple it is hard to get in here. I cannot quite understand his 
philosophy.
<P>
	I am going to repeat one more key statistic. It comes from their 
favourite Fraser Institute. Sixty-three per cent of all income taxes 
in Canada are paid by the top 30 per cent of taxpayers.
<P>
	It does not matter what the Reform Party members want to 
argue, they are not going to change that statistic. Realistically, 
when you start saying you are going to let the lower bottom people 
off, fine, I understand that.
<P>
	There are some problems with that because you create a wall of 
taxation. It keeps poor people in debt. It keeps people down 
because they have no the way to make progress. As soon as they 
earn an extra dollar, they are hitting the 23 per cent tax rates. That 
is the philosophy of the Reform Party. Keep the poor people poor 
and while we are at it, let us shift the tax burden from the very 
wealthy, which that party represents, to middle income earners.
<P>
	That is not going to fly. It is not going to fly out west and it is not 
going to fly down here either.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know the member for 
Durham was telling you through me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join in the debate on Bill C-90 which specifically 
enables the government to increase the already high levels of 
taxation imposed on Canadians.
<P>
	It never ceases to amaze me the disregard the government seems 
to have for the intelligence of Canadians. This bill is an outright 
betrayal of the commitment in the red book or the election platform 
of the Liberal Party. In addition to the betrayal, the Liberals 
promised not to increase taxes to Canadians. There is the 
dishonesty, the deceit and the rhetoric surrounding the cuts that 
have to come and inevitably will come whoever is the government 
some day if we are to reach a balanced budget.
<P>
	We just heard the best example of this rhetoric that we hear all 
the time. The member for Durham rises to join the debate on Bill 
C-90, a bill to increase tax levels. In his speech he says there is 
nothing wrong with the tax system. All that is wrong is the rates are 
too high, the second highest in the OECD. Yet he is speaking in 
support of a bill that raises the level of taxes higher. That is rhetoric 
and double talk and we hear so much of it.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I would like to discuss a couple of other examples of the betrayal 
of red book promises. The Liberals said during the election 
campaign they could solve the problems of the country simply by 
economic stimulation and job creation. They did not need to cut 
programs. They did not need to raise taxes. They could solve the 
problems of the nation by job creation and economic stimulation.
<P>
	It is now two years into the mandate. We have seen lots of cuts in 
programs and services but we have not seen problems solved 
through economic stimulation and job creation. We consistently 
remind the government day after day of the GST fraud which it has 
imposed on people. The Deputy Prime Minister told us she would 
resign within a year if the GST was not gone. She is still here. I saw 
her in the House today.
<P>
	The government tells Canadians these things during an election 
campaign because it knows those topics are popular and that it will 
get votes. The Liberals tell Canadians what they want to hear. After 
they get elected they abandon their promises and hope Canadians 
will forget them before the next election.
<P>
	Another bit of dishonesty is the story the government told the 
federal civil service that it would not be cut, that it would protect 
their jobs and honour the job security clauses in their contract. We 
are only two years into the government's mandate and it is talking 
about cutting 50,000 civil servants. What happened to the 
commitment to the civil service? It seems to have been abandoned.
<P>
	There was the promise to maintain funding for social programs. 
The government said that it would never slash and burn like the 
Reform Party proposals would do. It would protect the precious 
social programs, the fabric of the social safety net system. Only 
two years into its mandate, the government has cut and cut far 
worse than what would have happened under what it called our 
slash and burn policies. The government's measures have been 
even more draconian than the Reform Party ever suggested they 
should be. If the $7 billion cut to provincial transfers in support of 
social spending is not slash and burn I do not know what we could 
refer to it as.
<P>
	I do not think Canadians are so naive or so easily deceived that 
they are prepared to forgive all this before the next election. The 
Reform Party is here to do everything it can to see the government 
is not forgiven. I  am sure that come next election time it will have 
some real answering to do to the Canadian taxpayers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15494"> 15494 </A></B>
<P>
	I hear all the time from the other side of the House about how 
caring the members are, that they are not hard hearted and without 
compassion like the Reform Party, that they care about the human 
deficit. I have never heard such arrogant hypocrisy in all my life. 
They do not have the market cornered on compassion or caring. 
The very reason I became involved in the profession with the 
lowest regard in this country-at least outside of this place-was 
simply because I care and I am compassionate. I care very deeply 
about the things the Liberal and Conservative governments have 
done to the future of my children and my grandchildren in the last 
30 years. That is not caring and compassion. It is selfishness. It is 
the me generation saying that not only will the next generation, my 
kids and my grandkids, have to look after themselves but the next 
three or four generations will be paying for the greed of this 
generation. That is not caring and compassion. It is the me 
generation.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Today we are debating Bill C-90 which is about tax increases. 
The area I wanted to talk about specifically is the 1.5 cent a litre 
increase in tax on gasoline. For the last 30 years every time there is 
a cash crunch, a squeeze, governments have turned to the cash cow, 
the sin taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and gasoline. It turned in a big 
way to gasoline in the last budget to make up the shortfall.
<P>
	The finance minister made a commitment to have a ratio of tax 
increases to expenditure cuts that was not in the red book. As I 
mentioned earlier, the red book said no increase in taxation. Now 
we have moved to a commitment to keep it in balance, so many 
dollars of cuts to so many dollars of tax increase. That is a serious 
betrayal of an election promise.
<P>
	We still have the GST that applies on top of the 1.5 cent per litre 
tax increase. That is the GST that was supposed to be gone. 
Therefore, we have a double tax increase on gasoline.
<P>
	It is important for members of the House to remember where the 
excise tax on gasoline started. It was back in 1975 when a Liberal 
government placed the excise tax on gasoline. It was a special tax. 
It was the first time an excise tax was applied to gasoline and was 
to be a one-time tax. How many times have we heard that before?
<P>
	This one-time tax was to cover the gap between oil import 
compensation payments and the oil export charge revenues. In turn, 
this compensation system was as a result of the 1974 decision to 
maintain domestic oil prices at levels below world prices.
<P>
	In essence, the federal government of the day had adopted a 
made in Canada oil pricing policy which saw the proceeds from an 
export tax used to protect consumers of imported oil from the full 
impact of the  international price. A noble intent I am sure. As we 
so often experience with taxation, we are shown that taxes which 
are meant to be one time or special or temporary, quickly have a 
habit of becoming permanent.
<P>
	One must only refer back to the imposition in 1917 of a 
temporary income tax and see where that has gone, how temporary 
it was and how complex and expensive it has become.
<P>
	The same is true in every sense about the excise tax on 
transportation fuels. The excise tax has remained in place and its 
revenue objectives certainly have changed. The tax is no longer 
used for what it was originally intended but the tax remains and 
continues to be increased by 2 cents, 1 cent, 1.5 cents every budget 
that is presented in the last number of years. Obviously it has 
changed from a special tax for a specific purpose to a general tax 
for a source of general revenue.
<P>
	In the last session of Parliament, in the natural resources 
committee of which I am a member, the members of the NDP 
introduced a proposal for the committee to study gasoline pricing 
in Canada. They thought there was some bogeyman causing the 
price of gasoline to be so high when we were facing a surplus of oil 
on the international market and low prices for crude oil.
<P>
	It does not take a genius to look at this. There have been 
numerous studies over the last number of years that the bogeyman 
in this scenario is the government. If we look at the price of 
gasoline in Vancouver at 59.6 cents per litre, 28.9 cents goes 
directly to provincial and federal taxes. That is not oil royalties or 
corporate income tax, that is simply gasoline taxes hidden at the 
pump. The 28.9 cents leaves the remaining cost of that litre of 
gasoline to cover the cost of exploration, production, marketing 
and refining and only another 3 cents to the dealer for his costs and 
overhead.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	We can example after example of a gasoline price. The figures 
provided by the government's statistics for Calgary shows the price 
of gasoline is 52.3 per litre; 22.4 cents of that goes directly to 
governments in taxes, leaving only 3.5 cents for the dealer to cover 
his costs, with the remaining going for exploration, refining and 
marketing. I have example after example of almost 50 per cent of 
the cost of a litre of gasoline everywhere across the country being 
the tax on gasoline by government.
<P>
	We continue to have these kinds of tax increases rammed down 
our throats with no choice. Because they are hidden they are often 
put in and the consumer does not realize the taxes have risen. The 
cost increases which we have seen so dramatically in the last 
number of years are not the result of the oil companies' getting 
together to fix the price of gasoline. It is the result of governments 
starved for cash continually coming back to that cash cow.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15495"> 15495 </A></B>
<P>
	Members can ask their constituents if they realize what 
percentage of the cost of a litre of gasoline is government taxation. 
I will wager very few consumers realize the level of taxation. If 
we are to continue to tax Canadians in this way it is time we were 
up front and open and let Canadians see where their dollars are 
going.
<P>
	When we look at these increases in taxation levels and what they 
are doing to us internationally there is an important implication of 
these tax increases as well. Gasoline is one of the things that gives 
our natural advantage which allows us to be competitive in the 
global marketplace to compensate for the huge distances and the 
expensive transportation costs we face in getting our products to 
market.
<P>
	It is very important that we are able to take advantage of that 
natural advantage to compensate for other disadvantages. Our 
natural advantage is being seriously eroded when the Americans 
can come to Canada with a $1.30 dollar, buy our crude oil, take it 
home, refine it and sell it at almost half the price we have to pay. I 
do not think that is what Canadians want. I do not think that is what 
the government wants, to simply become and exporter of raw 
natural resources.
<P>
	This is not the way to create jobs, to create wealth, to stimulate 
the economy. It is time we support Canadians industries and 
manufacturers and allow them to take advantage of the natural 
advantage we have in our abundance of natural resources.
<P>
	Instead, the government seems to stick to its historical way of 
raising revenue, that cash cow. I suggest this poor cash cow is 
milking at capacity and is in danger of dying from mastitis from 
forced overproduction.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	I can go on about the unfairness of this endless taxation. The 
government should seriously look at what it is doing to the 
economy through high taxation and what the debt and deficit are 
doing to the country.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister and the finance minister to heed the 
words of F.J. Clarke that a politician thinks only of the next 
election; a statesman thinks of the next generation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
make a few comments on Bill C-90 as it emanates from the 
Department of Finance and the finance minister. I will review for a 
few minutes what he said when he was in opposition during the last 
budget he criticized.
<P>
	I have direct quotes from <I>Hansard</I> dated April 27, 1993: 
``Canadians are demanding an end to the volleys of taxation that 
issue from the nation's capital every spring. They are demanding 
that governments cease their political fiddling while our prosperity 
burns''.
<P>
	Bill C-90 is nothing more than a tax grab. It raises taxes through 
excise taxes. It raises taxes on gasoline. It  raises taxes on air 
transportation from $50 to $55. It raises taxes on cigarettes. Pure 
and simple, it is hitting Canadians in their pockets, at the pumps 
and in the air.
<P>
	This flies in the face of what he said. As critic to the finance 
department he said Canadians are demanding an end to the volleys 
of taxation that issue every spring. He has been in charge for the 
last two springs and we have sprung taxes higher, albeit he never 
touched our personal pocketbooks which is why we can thank him 
a little, but he is taxing everywhere else. Revenue Canada is even 
squeezing businesses and individuals on audits in every way, shape 
and form it can.
<P>
	I have a second quote: ``Canadians are demanding nothing less 
than an end to the political economy of governments that can 
neither follow the wishes of their citizens today nor bring before 
them the questions that must be decided tomorrow''. Does the 
minister think Canadians want gasoline taxes to increase at the 
pumps? Does he think Canadians want to pay more taxes on 
products and goods and services? Does he think Canadians want to 
pay more taxes at the airport? They do not want to do that.
<P>
	Does the minister think the people of Canada want the 
government to add to the problem of the debt? He has committed 
the country to bankruptcy by committing it to a 3 per cent of GDP. 
That is all he will reduce the deficit to? He will keep digging the 
hole deeper, slower than the Conservatives, but he will keep 
digging the hole. Is that the kind of Canada he thought Canadians 
were demanding, to keep adding to the problem?
<P>
	Here is his chance as the finance minister to correct and follow 
his points of view to the letter. He has an opportunity to be in 
control and do the things that are required to stimulate and help the 
economy. He says it is through jobs. Governments do not create 
jobs. The private sector creates the majority of jobs, 85 per cent. 
Nobody disputes that. It takes consumer and investor confidence to 
create those jobs.
<P>
	When the government keeps increasing taxes through excise 
taxes, personal taxes, corporation taxes, payroll taxes or property 
taxes, it is hurting and impeding confidence. By just talking about 
it, like the finance minister does, he is using smoke and mirrors to 
fool the Canadian public. He is doing a great disservice by making 
Canadians believe he is solving the problem when in fact he is 
adding to the problem.
<P>
	I have already shown two examples of where the finance 
minister can do something about the very things he criticized, but 
he has done nothing. He keeps doing it the same way. He is 
defending the status quo. It is as if the Department of Finance 
regardless of who becomes finance minister will do it its way or no 
way and it is the only way. That should change.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15496"> 15496 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I have a third quote from the finance minister: ``Irregular 
taxation among jurisdictions has produced economic distortions, 
inefficient and wasteful collection costs and a perverse sense that 
the tax system is irrational and unfair. Canadians are prepared to 
pay their fair share of taxes. What they object to is when they see 
discrimination against them in favour of others. What they object 
to is when they see that the services that they have come to expect 
cut back and their taxes going up. There is a deep feeling that the 
system is warped against Canadians''.
<P>
	If that opinion was really believed then by the finance minister, I 
would like to refresh his memory. If he still believes it today what 
that really means is that we need to review the entire taxation 
system, the way we collect taxes, why we collect taxes, what those 
taxes are for, what the program costs are in the government.
<P>
	We need to diffuse and separate tax expenditures from direct 
spending. Very few MPs know the total we spend on child care 
through the four or five various programs that exist. We do not 
know because we use the Income Tax Act to do it.
<P>
	If we would simply use income tax as a method of raising taxes 
other than a personal exemption and nothing else, then decided we 
wanted to subsidize or support various groups, people who cannot 
work, who cannot help themselves, whether we want to help 
education or health care, all the programs we want to fund, that 
would be fine. We should put that under direct spending.
<P>
	Then we can set the rate to raise the money we need to pay for 
those programs. Simplification will lower compliance costs. 
Simplification will satisfy the concerns he had in opposition about 
the tax system, the very one he is defending now, to which in his 
two years of tenure as finance minister he has added over 1,000 
pages of clarifications, rulings and justifications so that people can 
understand it better.
<P>
	He said it was irrational and unfair. In two years he has done 
nothing about it except tinker around by raising an excise tax here, 
trying to do that over there. He has not addressed the problem the 
way he could and should.
<P>
	I would like to see him match his rhetoric, his belief, his ideas 
and deep felt conviction that the current system is unfair and allow 
the Standing Committee on Finance to explore fundamental tax 
reform for Canadians.
<P>
	The time has come for that. If he really believed in what he said I 
challenge him to allow that kind of debate, to allow that kind of 
exploration to begin so that it is outside the realm of bureaucracy, 
so that it is outside the realm of deputy ministers who want to have 
it their way and only their way.
<P>
	Put it back into the purview of members of Parliament who can 
come to the finance committee and represent their constituents' 
wishes and their constituents' point of view.
<P>
	I am sure if he lets that happen he will find there are a lot of 
Canadians who would like to see tax reform. They would like to see 
some form of system they can understand, a system in which 
everybody can do their own return, in which fairness is 
reintroduced whereby everybody pays their proportionate share of 
taxes after a certain level of exemption. If I make 10 times more 
money than another, I pay 10 times more taxes.
<P>
	Eliminate all those tax shelters and incentives that distort the 
economy and allow the government to manipulate and direct our 
social and economic lives. We have to separate the income tax 
system away from social and economic engineering.
<P>
	I look at the comments the finance minister made in opposition 
because I am on the finance committee and a critic of finance. 
Therefore I have to go back to find out what this gentleman 
believed in, what he fought for, his values, where his goals and 
objectives lie. Now that he is finance minister he is not following 
his own beliefs. I do not understand that.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Year after year MPs say one thing to get elected and when they 
get elected they do another thing. I am very disappointed the 
Liberals have already broken about 15 promises in their read book. 
They said one thing to get elected and did exactly the opposite.
<P>
	We commend and compliment them for some of the promises 
they have broken, because we know they are heading in the right 
direction. We know spending has to be cut and social programs 
have to be looked at because they represents 67 per cent of the 
budget. We understand that. We were hoping the government 
would listen to us and make those kinds of tough decisions.
<P>
	However, there is room for more spending cuts. The spending 
cuts that could really help are those direct subsidies for business 
and individuals, the billions we do not need to spend.
<P>
	The compliance cost of the taxation system is $12 billion in a 
country of 27 million people. This includes accountants hired, the 
audits that must be done and the cost of departments such as 
National Revenue and taxation: customs is at $2.2 billion; the GST 
group, $500 million; all the tax lawyers and services. Twelve 
billion dollars changing hands just to collect this money, to 
interpret our tax rules.
<P>
	Members of the House should spend three months on tax 
simplification, trying to improve the system to make it more 
simple, more equitable and fulfil the concerns the finance minister 
had when he was in opposition that the tax system is irrational and 
unfair.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15497"> 15497 </A></B>
<P>
	If we want to bring reason and fairness back into the system, 
why does he not empower the Standing Committee on Finance to 
do something about it? Why does he not empower all the members 
of the House to do something about it? It could be fixed so fast 
to the benefit of all Canadians. It would make so much more sense 
than some of the weak-kneed insignificant bills we are debating 
and issues we are discussing in the House right now.
<P>
	I know why that is being done and why the government feels it 
has to do that, so I will not dwell on it. Instead of debating 
employment equity and legislating in the board rooms of 
businesses, in the offices of the private sector who must be hired 
and policing them to ensure it happens, a waste of time, why not 
introduce a system in which more people would gain confidence? 
More people would have a hope for the future of the country and 
feel the leaders, the politicians, are looking after their interests for 
the long term, not the short term.
<P>
	We have a deficit and a debt problem but the solution is not just 
spending cuts and cuts and cuts. If all we ever look at is the solution 
we will never solve the problem.
<P>
	In the name of deficit reduction too many governments are afraid 
to look at other means of helping businesses and creating jobs. The 
government cannot keep spending and stimulating the economy 
through direct subsidies. That has to stop. We must look at a system 
and a method whereby the government will get out of the business 
of looking after a lot of people, companies and the creation of job 
stimulations and helping the development of hockey rinks. Leave 
more money in the hands of business. I know that is a sensitive 
spot, Mr. Speaker. I did not mean that as a personal remark. I 
believe in hockey players. I enjoy watching the game.
<P>
	Let us look at a way of empowering the people who know how to 
create jobs. Let those people and those institutions do what they do 
best. I think the private sector can create jobs better than the 
government.
<P>
	It has taken about 15 years for everybody to learn this. I believe 
everybody in the House is beginning to recognize there is some 
merit in that. I am asking the finance minister to look at what he 
said when he was in opposition two years ago and the last budget he 
criticized. I am criticizing his budget and Bill C-90. I know almost 
everything has already been implemented. I am criticizing his role 
as finance minister the same way he criticized Mr. Wilson and Mr. 
Mazankowski.
<P>
	The finance minister has an opportunity to do something about it 
but he is not doing anything about it. He is letting the status quo 
live. He is letting the Income Tax Act survive. The Income Tax Act 
should be explored and reviewed. We need fundamental tax 
reforms with the idea of lowering those marginal rates. I do not 
care how we make it fair, I do not care whether it is a flat tax or not. 
We need tax reform in a way that we can then give  instant tax relief 
to Canadian individuals and Canadian businesses.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	This is where we get stimulative effect on the economy. This is 
where we create optimism. This is where people get security. When 
they go to work in the morning they now know they will have a job 
at the end of next month. Right now that is what is lacking.
<P>
	I do not care how much money the government throws at job 
creation, it will not work. It drives up the spending. It will actually 
put more pressure on increasing taxes. It works in the exact 
opposite way the government and the finance minister believe.
<P>
	Bill C-90 is a tax grab. It is the very thing the finance minister in 
opposition spoke against. He wants fairness. Fairness is lowering 
taxes. Fairness is lowering spending. Fairness is smaller 
government and less intrusion. Fairness is making it more 
equitable for all walks and classes of life and giving hope to people, 
not false hope saying ``come hell or high water'', as he said, ``we 
will reach our goals and objectives of 3 per cent of GDP''. That is 
like highjumping six inches. That is not a very difficult target to 
reach from the high levels of spending the government has.
<P>
	Another disadvantage of high taxation and spending is we are 
not competitive globally. We are already worse off than the States. 
Look at the hockey players there compared with what the hockey 
players get here. They all want to get paid in U.S. dollars. Why? 
Their tax rates are lower than ours and they even want to lower 
them to 17 per cent. The Americans are competitive and their free 
market system has worked better than ours. We have too much 
government involvement in our economy and we need less 
government intrusion, less direct government involvement and that 
way we would eliminate this high tax burden. The uncompetitive 
tax systems lead to choices by consumers which adversely affect 
government revenues.
<P>
	I challenge the finance minister to fulfil those three promises, 
the concerns he had when he was opposition critic to the 
Department of Finance. There are three items he said he would 
fight for and that he believed. He felt they should be looked at. I 
wish the finance minister would practice what he preached.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened with a great deal of interest and sympathy to the comments 
by the member from Calgary Centre. I believe the tax system is so 
broken that it cannot probably be fixed and that a new and 
innovative approach to the whole area of taxation has to be 
undertaken.
<P>
	The member mentioned two very interesting points. One, a 
partial conversion I hope on behalf of the member of the Reform 
Party, was with respect to cuts. Throughout the election campaign 
and shortly after this  Parliament was convened all we heard from 
the other side was to cut, cut, cut. What the member has said today, 
however, and it probably comes from having been in this place, 
understanding the complexity of some issues that we do not quite 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15498"> 15498 </A></B>
<P>
get to understand on the campaign trail, is that cutting is not the 
answer.
<P>
	Governments must do everything to ensure that each dollar spent 
is spent in a manner that is prudent, focused and that maximizes 
our wish to attain certain goals as a government and as a Parliament 
and as a people.
<P>
	On the revenue side I agree with him. I am one of those 
individuals on this side of the House who believes the taxation 
system, albeit attempting to be fair, is inherently unfair to many. 
Each time we try to fix this monster created by dozens of 
amendments in this place by this and previous governments, it 
makes it even harder to attain our goal.
<P>
	He mentioned single taxes and flat taxes. I agree that is a 
direction we have to go in. My colleague from 
Broadview-Greenwood in the last Parliament and this Parliament 
continues, and sometimes I know he must feel he is alone, to 
promote a different system of taxation. It is a system I supported in 
opposition. It is a system I supported during my campaign and it is 
a system I will continue to support on this side of the House.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	The member wishes the Standing Committee on Finance would 
be specifically asked to review this. I do not usually wait for 
somebody to tell me what I can do. If there is an opportunity for me 
to work with other members to build a consensus across party lines, 
across this aisle which is only a few feet but many times feels like 
miles, I will rise to the challenge.
<P>
	I ask the member not to wait for the mandarins at finance or for 
the government or for officials of his own party to say the time has 
come for parliamentarians to work together in a non-partisan 
fashion to come up with solutions. We all know what the problems 
are. We all try in our respective roles in opposition or government 
to put the best solutions forward we think can be implemented.
<P>
	I throw a challenge out to him to work with me and other 
members on this side. I will work with him and other members on 
that side to look at what can be done, real tax reform, single tax, 
flat tax, to work together to put a challenge not just to the 
government but to all parliamentarians. I am prepared to put the 
time in. I ask the member if he would be prepared to put the time 
in. Canadians are looking for those types of solutions from 
Parliament and I think they are looking for them now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his 
remarks. I accept his offer. I openly say in the House I will work 
with any member toward a simplification of the tax system, to 
share any of the points of view I have and to also get input from any 
other  member as to what direction they think we should go in. The 
current system is not good and needs some fixing.
<P>
	I know the biggest concern of Department of Finance is that in 
the name of simplicity we will give up fairness. The test is any new 
system has to be as fair as the current system.
<P>
	I had discussed a single tax, a flat tax, quite a bit with the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood. It was reading his book four 
years ago that got me interested in this subject. I believe many of 
the problems he pointed out were true. They were true then and 
they are more true now.
<P>
	I am not waiting for the Standing Committee on Finance. I use 
my opportunity to speak in the House freely to challenge the 
finance minister to get every committee we can on board. Even the 
Department of Industry should be looking at this. IT controls 
business. The minister knows what businesses are concerned about. 
What can we do to attract more businesses? It is not higher taxation 
levels but lower taxation levels.
<P>
	We are presenting various alternatives to tax proposals. The 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound is presenting one on October 
31 at the Fraser Institute symposium in Toronto. The member for 
Broadview-Greenwood will be there presenting his as well. I 
believe there will be officials from the government there although 
they will be listening and not presenting anything. I believe the 
Conservative Party is also looking at a proposal for a flat tax. It is 
important that we get this movement and momentum going. In the 
end, in the final analysis, if we can simplify the taxation system all 
Canadians will benefit, which is the important target here.
<P>
	In terms of my conversion, I ask the hon. member not to hold out 
too much hope because I am not being converted. I am just getting 
tired of hearing everything about cuts, cuts, cuts. If the member 
does not believe cuts are important why has his government made 
$7 billion in cuts already?
<P>
	When we campaigned on cuts our point was that when we make 
them we should make them wisely, judiciously and quickly because 
they will hurt. Whether we cut $1 billion, $7 billion or $10 billion, 
we will end up with a lot of special interest groups riled up and 
upset and we will hear all the barrage just like what is happening in 
Ontario now in response to the 22 per cent cutback in welfare 
payments. All it sufficed to do was reduce the welfare payments in 
Ontario to the same level as everywhere else in the country. Look at 
some of the extremists voicing their concerns.
<P>
	Cutting is important. We feel the Liberal government has not cut 
enough. There is still too much fat in areas where there is 
subsidizing failure. Those are the areas the government is not 
looking at. The other program cuts it has done are excellent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15499"> 15499 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is cutting and then spending money on 
infrastructure programs, building hockey rinks on direct subsidies 
to regional development grants to businesses. Not all but many 
are wasted. That money does not need to be spent by government. 
Cut that out. Give the equivalent tax cut to the businesses and 
individuals and I will guarantee that they will do more with those 
billions of dollars than the government will. That is the point 
which I am trying to make. Therefore, we need both spending cuts 
and a review of the taxation system. We can have tax relief at the 
same time. That is my argument.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	If we really want to solve the deficit, we can. Just lower 
spending, raise the tax rate and the deficit is gone. However, we 
cannot do that. We have to ignore the deficit. It is not the 3 per cent 
of GDP that matters. We have to look at a way to stimulate the 
economy and have a pro-growth taxation system so we can apply 
those extra revenues to the debt. That is what is important.
<P>
	I thank the member for his kind intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed listening to the hon. member. However, I am not 
too certain that the solution is as simple as he purports.
<P>
	The corporate tax rate in Canada is 38 per cent. When provincial 
corporate taxes are added the average is 43.4 per cent. In the United 
States the tax rate is 35 per cent nationally. When state taxes are 
added the average is 40.3 per cent. In Japan the corporate tax rate 
has never been below 50 per cent. In fact, the corporate tax rate 
today in Japan is 52.5 per cent. The corporate tax rates in France 
and Germany, which are major trading partners of the largest 
nations in the world, in Germany range from 56 to 44 per cent, with 
France at 33 per cent.
<P>
	The hon. member is suggesting a substantial decrease in 
corporate taxes, with a single rate of tax. In fact he has expanded 
that to personal income taxes. He suggests that there should be a 
simple direct rate which would be the same for everybody 
regardless of income. I would ask him what deductions, if any, he 
would allow for corporations if that were the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite right that the 
corporate tax is complicated in Canada with all the provincial and 
federal taxes. However, I believe that in a reform of the taxation 
system, businesses and individuals should be taxed at the same 
rate, that the income generated by individuals or businesses should 
only be taxed once and that the rate would be based on federal 
expenditures. However, we have to move expenditures under direct 
spending, not under tax expenditures, so we will know exactly what 
these programs are costing us.
<P>
	When it comes to business directly, there are deductions which 
we can explore when looking at tax  reform. Decisions have to be 
made. Currently we treat active and investment income the same 
way. The Hall-Rabushka model for a flat tax makes interest 
payments that are received by individuals non-taxable and 
non-deductible and all of the capital gains and dividends are paid at 
the corporate level. The corporations actually end up paying more 
taxes in that model.
<P>
	When we explored that we found that the pure flat tax system for 
corporations would allow wages, benefits and salaries to be 
deducted, as well as input costs and the cost of sales. If they were 
allowed a 100 per cent write off in the year of acquisition for 
taxation purposes, for balance sheets purposes, they could still 
amortize it out or depreciate it. However, no interest deductibility 
on the cost of borrowing money would lower interest rates. 
Effectively there could be a rate of 20 per cent which would be 
revenue neutral.
<P>
	We could probably get rid of the GST with another 4.5 per cent 
on that. With a rate of 24 per cent or 25 per cent it would be gone. 
There is a whole department gone and a half billion dollars in 
collection costs gone. There would then be $5 billion to $6 billion 
more in revenue from the corporate sector than there is now.
<P>
	The trade off is that there will be CFIBs, but all businesses will 
be treated the same, whether they are manufacturing or high tech. 
Manufacturing could be 21 per cent, instead of the 38 he is talking 
about.
<P>
	The small tax on business is a concern. The member for 
Broadview-Greenwood found a lot of lobby groups came to him 
and complained that we would lose that 12 per cent tax on the first 
$200,000. If we had this kind of a tax reform, where we put it out 
there to everyone and said: ``We are looking for equity and 
everybody has to share in this equity'', we could then have a system 
that is simple enough so more people could understand it. The rate 
could be low enough that people would work in the surface 
economy instead of the underground economy. It could high 
enough that it would generate close to the revenues that we want 
and need now. I do not accept the conclusions of economists who 
say that we have to be revenue neutral right now. I argue that if I am 
a little bit short the money will come through the effect of the 
growth in the economy. If it is combined with more spending cuts, 
if we spend the money on behalf of businesses, if we give people 
the money to start a business, we are-

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-106, an act respecting the Law 
Commission of Canada, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in connection with Bill 
C-106. May I say at the outset that by tabling this bill the 
government fulfils a commitment which it made during the 
campaign of 1993, a commitment that was expressed clearly in the 
red book to restore the important machinery for law reform that had 
been abolished by the previous government.
<P>
	This bill fulfils that commitment by creating a new body to be 
known as the Law Commission of Canada, a commission whose 
object would be continuously to monitor the evolution of Canadian 
law, to advise the government, and Parliament, on its improvement 
and modernization, and to do so in a manner that would reflect our 
unique bijuridical system of law: the common law and the civil 
code.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In short, this Commission will play a major role in fulfilling the 
responsibility-common to every generation-of keeping 
Canadian law relevant to the needs and conditions of our time. The 
task is a much more difficult and complex one than it was in the 
early 1970s, when the former Law Reform Commission was 
formed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Now in the mid-1990s we are swept along on a tide of social 
change, change involving technology, change involving social life 
itself. In some areas, these transformations have rendered existing 
law either obsolete or inadequate. In others, we confront issues that 
have not yet been addressed by law or by precedent.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	It is the view of the government that we need a commission with 
respect to law, a commission that is independent and objective to 
provide informed commentary to government on the directions it 
should take.
<P>
	Let me provide some examples to hon. members about the kinds 
of challenges to which I refer. One is the increased risk and 
incidence of economic crime flowing from the application of 
computer technology in financial markets, the way funds are 
transferred from person to person and, indeed, from continent to 
continent. Another is the steady parade of new questions that 
accompany the commercialization of biotechnology. A third is the 
emergence of issues raised by the mass application of new 
information technology, such as the use of the Internet for hate 
messages or pornography.
<P>
	In addition, there are issues that concern the functioning of the 
criminal justice system itself, including the effectiveness of that 
system or the effectiveness of incarceration for certain offences as 
compared with other sanctions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To compound the challenge, these issues are coming on to the 
screen at a time of profound social and political change. In many 
respects, Canadians are not the same people they were a quarter of 
a century ago.
<P>
	The Charter of Rights and Freedoms has changed the way we 
look at the law and at each other. People are no longer content to 
leave government to politicians and bureaucrats, and law to 
lawyers. They insist on having a hand in decisions which affect 
their lives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Something else that is different in the 1990s is the fiscal 
environment. We must cope with these challenges with drastically 
reduced budgets. The quality of every option and of every decision 
must be tested not only for theoretical effectiveness but also for 
financial feasibility.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the government is not proposing in Bill 
C-106 a restoration of the last Law Reform Commission brick by 
brick. We propose the creation of an entirely new institution, a new 
kind of institution, to deal with new issues in new ways.
<P>
	The law commission visualized in Bill C-106 will first of all be 
an independent and accountable body working at arm's length from 
government and operating in a  mode that matches the challenges 
and the constraints of our time, that is to say, it will work with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15501"> 15501 </A></B>
<P>
windows open. It will make law reform a visible, understandable 
process in which not just legal professionals but Canadians in every 
walk of life can play their part.
<P>
	Furthermore, because of its structure, the commission will not be 
remote or isolated. Last but not least, it will approach its task with a 
vigilant attention to cost.
<P>
	The principles that will govern the make-up of a commission and 
guide it in its work are set out in the preamble of Bill C-106. The 
House should know that these principles were not developed in a 
theoretical test tube. They emerged in a rigorous nationwide 
consultation that preceded the drafting of the bill. They reflect the 
synthesized thinking of many disciplines, sectors and groups. 
These are the characteristics that Canadians tell us the process must 
embody if it is to work effectively.
<P>
	The first principle is related to the unwritten goal of every aspect 
of this work, the building and the maintenance of confidence in our 
system of justice. To that end, this principle points to the need to 
democratize and demystify the making and remaking of the law.
<P>
	It provides that the commission must be transparent, must 
involve disparate interests in its work. The door to the workshop of 
law reform must be open to all who want to watch or join in the 
process. The results of that work must be available for inspection 
by all in a form understandable by all.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	The second principle is that the commission must not only have 
keen foresight, it must also have wide peripheral vision. It must see 
the challenges of law reform in their full social and economic 
context. To achieve this end, the commission will have to be 
multi-disciplinary in its approach. It will focus not just legal 
expertise on the issues, although that will be needed, but the talent 
and training of all the relevant disciplines-for example, in 
economics, in technology, in the social and natural sciences, in the 
field of law enforcement.
<P>
	The third principle is that the commission should be responsive 
and accountable. Specifically, it should forge partnerships with a 
wide range of interested groups and in particular with the academic 
community. The law is never static. Only in this way can the 
commission keep ahead of endless change to avoid gaps or 
duplication in agendas and to make the most of limited resources.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The fourth principle is one that would have seemed odd in 
legislation drafted 25 years ago, but it seems perfectly natural in 
our time.
<P>
	It is a requirement that the Commission, as it tackles today's 
tasks, employ today's technologies, wherever it is appropriate to do 
so. The Commission must take  advantage of the capabilities of 
new tools and new methods, particularly in information 
technology. This is essential to success in every aspect of the 
Commission's operation-to its ability to share work with other 
groups and institutions-and to operate effectively on its modest 
budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The fifth principle relates to the overriding requirement that we 
arrive at solutions we can pay for. This principle requires that the 
commission in its deliberations must never fail to consider the 
elements of cost and economic impact. This too is a matter of 
relevance in the 1990s.
<P>
	These then are the five principles as set forth in the preamble. 
There is a sixth, which may not be spelled out expressly but which 
hon. members will find implicit throughout the statute. That is to 
say, the requirement for balance, the need for the commission to be 
both independent of government in its decisions and accountable to 
the public for its actions. This principle and indeed all the others 
find expression in the structure of the commission as set forth in 
clause 7 of the bill. Let me touch briefly on that structure.
<P>
	The executive branch of the Law Commission would be 
appointed by order in council. It would comprise five members, a 
full-time president and four part-time commissioners, who may all 
be drawn from different disciplines. In terms of size, it seems to me 
this is the balance we need: large enough to be diverse, but small 
enough to be decisive.
<P>
	The fact that four of the five commissioners will serve part time 
has many important advantages. First of all, it means that these 
individuals will not run the risk of becoming isolated from the 
world beyond the national capital region. They will retain their 
roots in their home communities and in the sectors they represent 
and their careers will not be interrupted. There is another benefit. It 
will make it easier for government to attract the calibre of person 
we want on such a commission to join in the work of law reform.
<P>
	The second element is an advisory council made up of 25 
members representing a variety of viewpoints and disciplines and 
backgrounds. All of these people will serve as unpaid volunteers, 
except for reimbursement of expenses. This arrangement supports 
the independence of the process. The council will be appointed by 
the commission, not by the government, and the commission, not 
the government, will be the client of the council.
<P>
	The third component also fosters independence of the whole. It 
comprises the study panels that the commission will set up as 
required to focus on specific issues. Each panel would be headed by 
one of the commissioners and the other panel members would be 
drawn from the relevant disciplines or interested groups. For 
instance, a study panel on biotechnology might include  
representa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15502"> 15502 </A></B>
<P>
tives of the industry, the health sciences, consumer groups, and the 
legal profession.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The use of these panels will also contribute to the 
cost-effectiveness of the process. These bodies will be transient 
rather than permanent. They will come into being as the issues 
emerge. They will then do their work and they will disband. Panel 
members will perform this public service on a voluntary, unpaid 
basis.
<P>
	These then are the components of the Law Commission of 
Canada as proposed in Bill C-106. The structure is simple. It is also 
economical. The commission will be served by a small secretariat 
of no more than eight people. Instead of retaining an in-house staff 
to conduct studies, the commission will contract for research from 
outside sources. In this way we will avoid duplicating the effort of 
provincial reform bodies or work being done in the academic 
communities. As a result, the commission will be highly 
cost-effective.
<P>
	Although the last law reform commission, abolished by the 
previous government, cost $5 million a year to run, the law 
commission proposed in Bill C-106 will have a budget of $3 
million, all of which will be found through a redeployment of 
existing funds. It seems to me that we can be confident of getting 
the job done within these constraints because of the new 
commission's composition and because of the way it is 
approaching its work: the use of new technology, a commitment to 
partnership endeavours, and the reliance on voluntary advisers and 
panel members.
<P>
	That brings me to my final observation. The legislation would 
give the new commission a mandate to explore and to innovate. 
That requirement is explicit in the purpose section of the bill, 
which provides that the commission's tasks will include the 
development of new approaches to law and new concepts of law.
<P>
	What does that mean? Among other things, it means that the 
commission will not feel compelled to recommend as the solution 
for every problem a new law or even an amended law. Its mandate 
requires the commission to look at the full range of options. It is 
vitally important that it do so. One of the most urgent challenges of 
law reform is to cope with change without creating an impassable 
morass of litigation, administration, and enforcement.
<P>
	The system is close to being overburdened now. A primary goal 
of the commission will be not only to avoid increasing that load but 
indeed to lighten it. As the purpose section of the bill provides, the 
commission's task will include, and I quote, ``the development of 
measures to make the legal system more efficient, economical and 
accessible''.
<P>
	As to the balance in that architecture of independence and 
accountability, obviously both elements are indispensable: 
independence because the value of the  commission will depend in 
large part on its ability to provide expert impartial advice to the 
government on legislative programs and policies; accountability 
because the commission will be a public body serving the people of 
Canada, and as such it must answer to the people and their elected 
representatives for the conduct of its affairs and the quality of its 
work.
<P>
	I believe these principles are reflected in the arrangements the 
bill describes. The commission will submit its reports and 
recommendations to Parliament through the Minister of Justice of 
the day. That minister must forward these products of the 
commission to Parliament untouched, unaltered, and must respond 
to them in a specific period. On the other hand, the responsibility 
for the final decision about their disposition remains, as of course it 
must, with the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Hon. members will find balance built into not just the general 
design but the detail of this legislation. One example is to be found 
in the section on Purpose, Powers and Duties. The Commission 
will draw up its own agenda-but will consult with the Minister of 
Justice before making it final.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
The legislation would also require the minister to consult with the 
commission before referring other matters to it for consideration.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	As I have said, the essential purpose of the bill is to bring a 
wide-ranging integrated approach to the reform of Canadian law. 
The law is more than a book of statutes. It is a living thing, a 
presence in our individual lives. The law is also the infrastructure 
of our social and economic life. Seen in that context, the task of law 
reform is part of the wider work of nation building, of advancing 
our collective and individual well-being, of building social 
harmony, improving our competitiveness, our standard of living, 
our quality of life, and our relations with each other.
<P>
	It was in the 18th century that the British jurist Lord Mansfield 
said that as the usages of society alter the law must adapt itself to 
the changing needs of all. At the end of the 20th century that is still 
the task. I suggest that the instrument proposed in Bill C-106 will 
help us meet that continuing challenge.

consent to vote the same way as other Liberal members on the bill, 
in fact not the same way as the Reform or the Bloc will vote on the

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I declare Motion No. 1 lost.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 2
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, if you were to seek it, I believe that 
you would find unanimous consent in the House to apply the vote 
just completed on Motion No. 1 to Motion No. 2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc members will vote nay.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> All right thinking Reformers will also vote no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, all New Democrats present in the 
House this afternoon will be voting yea on this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> Mr. Speaker, all the PCers will be voting nay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bhaduria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be voting against this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I presume you 
will have me down as voting in favour of the motion. That is 
exactly what I want, and in case any other members want to do the 
same thing they are free to do so.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In response to the 
intervention by the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls, the vote 
just taken on Motion No. 1 will be applied to Motion No. 2. Is that 
agreed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ianno:</B> Mr. Speaker, on this motion I would like to vote 
contrary to what I did on the last vote.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The Chair will need some 
clarification from the hon. member for Trinity-Spadina. Could he 
could be more specific? Is he voting yea or nay?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ianno:</B> I am voting for the amendment. I am voting yea.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question. I know we are 
applying votes in the interest of saving time and that is great. 
However I am wondering about the members who leave.
<P>
	There were members who voted on the first one. Will there 
names automatically appear? Who knows who has left? Can they 
leave after one vote and then just have their names on the list for 
the rest of the night?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In response to the hon. 
member for Beaver River, unless we have a very definite way of 
doing things such as through a roll call, the Chair assumes that 
members would be staying for the subsequent vote that would be 
applied.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is a 
fundamental principle of the House, and you are the guardian of the 
principles of the House, that in order to be recorded as voting on a 
particular matter the member's presence is required in the House.
<P>
	Is the hon. member opposite indicating that certain members left 
the House?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Then I do not see, Mr. Speaker, how you can 
apply a previously held vote to this vote when certain members 
have left.
<P>
	If you take that position, I would suggest that you are setting an 
unfortunate precedent and that in future when this type of approach 
is taken to multiple votes in the House it would be open for any 
member to leave the House once the first vote is taken and to have 
his or her vote applied to each and every other vote taken in the 
House.
<P>
	I would ask that you reconsider that position.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15506"> 15506 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. I 
wish to inform the Speaker and the House that  when this 
arrangement was made for the sake of speeding up the vote it was 
assumed that all members would remain in the House during the 
course of the speeding up of the vote.
<P>
	I support the contention of the hon. member opposite that if this 
precedent is set it would be unfavourable and unacceptable to the 
NDP caucus.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I respectfully suggest that you take 
the vote row by row, as usual, on report stage Motion No. 2. 
Hopefully that will get the process started again.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I just want to set the record 
straight if I misled any member of the House. I have no dispute 
whatsoever with the hon. member for York South-Weston, the 
hon. member for Regina-Lumsden or any other member with 
respect to the tradition of the House. I was simply trying to clear 
the air by saying that yes, the Chair assumes members are staying.
<P>
	Unless we can actually verify the absence of someone clearly 
and definitely, obviously the best measure is to take the advice of 
the chief government whip and take the vote on Motion No. 2.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADALABOURCODE">CANADA LABOUR CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed from June 15, 1995, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-317, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code 
and the Public Service Staff Relations Act (scabs and essential 
services), be read a second time and referred to the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak to Bill C-317 standing in the name of my 
colleague and friend from Manicouagan. The purpose of this bill is 
to amend the Canada Labour Code and the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act so as to deal with the issue of scabs and essential 
services in the case of labour disputes.
<P>
	I am somewhat surprised to be in this position in 1995, because it 
seems to me this kind of legislation should have been passed long 
ago at the federal level.
<P>
	The history of labour relations has more often than not been one 
of struggle and sometimes, unfortunately, one of violence. When 
we study the history of the labour movement, we realize that when 
violence occurred, either on picket lines or as a result of a strike, it 
was in situations where the employer had hired strike breakers. In 
other words, he had replaced his employees who were legally on 
strike with people who were supposed to do the same work.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Scabs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> As my colleague says, scabs, to use a colloquialism.
<P>
	I think it only makes sense that in 1995, the Canada Labour Code 
should contain a provision of this kind that would harmonize 
labour relations in situations where a strike may turn violent and 
ensure that employees who have temporarily lost their jobs are not 
replaced, since otherwise violence tends to develop on the picket 
lines and we get situations that are truly appalling.
<P>
	I actually thought the Canada Labour Code contained a provision 
to that effect, because the Government of Quebec passed similar 
legislation in 1978, if I am not  mistaken. At the time, 
representatives for the employers protested that it was not 
appropriate to intervene in labour relations in a conflict situation of 
this kind, the excuse being that employers should be free to take 
any action necessary to continue their operations.
<P>
	I think that at the time Quebec society made a wise decision 
when it told employers: Gentlemen, in our society, the government 
has a responsibility to provide leadership, to identify potentially 
violent situations and remove the cause of violence on the picket 
lines. In Quebec, if I remember correctly, we had two major 
disputes in which strike breakers were hired by companies and 
there was violence on the picket lines.
<P>
	I remember the infamous strike in the sixties at United Aircraft 
in Longueuil and seeing on the news that armoured buses were 
bringing in people who were supposed to replace the workers who 
were legally walking the picket lines. This was a violent situation, 
and I think it is not in the interest of society to allow such situations 
to continue.
<P>
	There was another case referred to at the time as the strike at 
Lapalme. This was a company connected with the Post Office 
Department. Its employees were on strike and, again, had been 
replaced with strike breakers or scabs. This dispute poisoned 
labour relations in Quebec for months and months. There were 
demonstrations supporting the workers, and petitions were signed. 
When the PQ government came to power in 1976, there had been 
considerable debate on the issue, so that legislation was adopted to 
regulate the whole issue of hiring strike breakers.
<P>
	In fact, since that time, Quebec has had no violent conflicts 
comparable to those we saw in the sixties and seventies. Employers 
finally understood, although for a long time they were against this 
legislation. They were supposed to go to the Supreme Court but, if I 
remember correctly, the case was withdrawn in the eighties when 
the employers realized that the situation had improved since the 
passage of this bill.
<P>
	I am very surprised that the Canada Labour Code did not take its 
cue from the Government of Quebec, especially since this concerns 
a large number of employees in Quebec. There are more than 
200,000 employees in crown corporations, corporations regulated 
by the Canada Labour Code. In Canada, there are more than one 
million. I think that the House of Commons should act responsibly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15510"> 15510 </A></B>
<P>
and realize there is a major problem which should be dealt with as 
soon as possible.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Why is this still a problem? I think there are two reasons. The 
first, obviously, is negligence. The official opposition has put a 
number of questions to the Minister of Labour since her arrival in 
the House. We asked her if the Canadian government was going to 
introduce legislation. Her replies have always been evasive. The  
questions put to her by the official opposition concerned a labour 
dispute which still today, in 1995, poisons labour relations at a 
flour mill in Montreal. The employees came and demonstrated 
outside Parliament; they came to hear us in the House galleries. 
The dispute lasted a very long time.
<P>
	What is odd is that this dispute involved the same company and 
the same people who were on the management side in a dispute 
that, a few years or months before the Parti Quebecois enacted the 
legislation in Quebec, forced the government to take immediate 
action because one man had been killed. Somebody was shot at on 
the picket lines, and a worker was dead. The government assumed 
its responsibilities at that point.
<P>
	Today we realize that the Government of Canada, with a minister 
whose arrival was a bit strange and whose role was rather vague-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> She was elected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> She was elected and a department was found for her. 
It could have been the department of the Canadian near north, it 
could have been the department of Canadian rain, or the 
department of the Rocky Mountains. It was simply a matter of 
finding her a department so she would have some credibility when 
she toured Quebec defending the option she is currently defending.
<P>
	I am not saying this to criticize her work, but simply to point out 
that she did not do what she had to do as Minister of Labour. We do 
not feel there is a Minister of Labour in Canada in this case.
<P>
	The second reason the Government of Canada is putting off 
passing legislation like this is one of ideology. You know that there 
was a law like this in Ontario. If I am not mistaken, it was passed 
by the NDP government. The new Harris government-I might say 
the harass government, but it is the Harris government-has 
announced that this law will be repealed.
<P>
	I have not heard that the legislation in question had caused any 
more trouble in Ontario than in Quebec. It is being challenged for 
only one reason, an ideological one, which is to allow employers 
the freedom to do what they want with their property.
<P>
	I thought that way of thinking was out of fashion in Canada 
today. I thought that the Canadian state had taken certain steps to 
oversee the action of employers in order to ensure a certain balance 
between the law of the market place, the law of might makes right, 
the law of the jungle, whatever you want to call it, and basic public 
interest. I believe that the attitude adopted by the Government of 
Ontario in this instance is a purely ideological one.
<P>
	Nothing in Ontario labour relations in recent years has proven 
that the legislation was not working. In Quebec, on the contrary, it 
can be said that since 1978, which  makes 17 years now, there has 
been unanimous agreement that the act is working well.
<P>
	Even the conseil de patronat du Québec gave up its Supreme 
Court challenge by the late 1980s.
<P>
	I hope that this House will examine the bill of our colleague 
from Manicouagan with care, and will once and for all settle this 
pressing problem of justice in labour relations for all Canadian 
workers, and no doubt for a few months more for Quebec workers 
as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would have liked to be able to say that I was pleased to 
rise today on Bill C-317. Unfortunately, earlier incidents prevent 
me from doing so.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	However, today, I will take a few moments to deal with it, and 
then I will talk about related issues. They are indeed related 
because, to a large extent, they have to do with remarks we heard 
today and I want to spend some more time dealing with those.
<P>
	The bill sponsored by the member for Manicouagan is aimed at 
amending the Canada Labour Code with respect to public service 
staff relations. As it stands, this piece of legislation respecting the 
Canada Labour Code is relevant; unfortunately, I cannot support it. 
I believe that the proposals cannot be examined independently 
from the federal government's general approach to industrial 
relations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
Prohibiting the use of replacement workers and maintenance of 
essential services must be considered in the context of a 
comprehensive review of the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Indeed, amending only one aspect of the Canada Labour Code is 
the wrong way to proceed; a certain balance must be achieved when 
considering changes to labour laws. I am sure that this is what the 
government will be seeking when it eventually chooses to amend 
the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> When? When?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The member opposite wants to know when. The 
Canadian Parliament will undoubtedly have the opportunity in the 
future, as it did in the past, to improve all the laws for the good of 
the Canadian people. I commend the member who asked me when 
for his concern for Canada's future. I know that when the 
constitutional issue will have been settled, when we will have voted 
no in a few days, he and I will continue to strive to improve the 
legislation in the long term. So when he worries about the exact 
date, I can tell 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15511"> 15511 </A></B>
<P>
the member for Bourassa that he will have ample time to examine 
these issues because in two weeks he will vote no  and refuse the 
separation and Quebec will still be part of Canada.
<P>
	The member who spoke just before me mentioned that the 
Minister of Labour came to the House in a way that was a bit 
strange. I respectfully protested without disrupting the decorum of 
the House-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> As you often do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> -as I do once in a while, and I specified that ``a 
bit strange'' in that case referred to her election.
<P>
	We heard that many times in this House. We even heard a Bloc 
member say, a few weeks ago, that the labour minister was not as 
legitimate as other Quebec members because her constituents were 
mostly anglophones since she represents Westmount. We all 
remember those comments made in the House last week. The 
member for Bourassa heard them just as I did. He knows who 
uttered those words and he knows these comments were made.
<P>
	We also heard a member say in this House-no, it was rather 
outside the House and the media reported it-that, in this 
referendum debate, maybe only the so-called old stock Quebecers 
should get involved in this issue. Surely the member for Bourassa 
does not support that theory. Indeed, I would be surprised if he did.
<P>
	<B>Mr. St-Laurent:</B> Could we get back to the bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The member opposite asks me to get back to the 
bill. It is not I who alluded to the supposedly strange way the labour 
minister-and we are talking about the labour code 
amendment-was elected.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, or should I say a few months ago, we heard 
derogatory remarks made against the member for Saint-Léonard, 
the secretary of state for parliamentary affairs, just because he also 
represented a riding composed mainly of an ethnic group that is 
different from that of other Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How is this relevant?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not raise the issue of relevance. 
It is simply because, a few minutes ago, another member of this 
House referred to what he called a rather curious situation. I want 
to say a few more words about this curious situation because today 
a member of the media was the target of what I would call virulent 
attacks.
<P>
	Joyce Napier, a well-known CBC reporter, was also insulted 
because her accent-I do not even know if this is true-is 
supposedly not quite the same as that of other Quebecers. This 
journalist was insulted in this way because another 
parliamentarian, this time the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, has decided that such attacks should be 
aimed not only at members of  other parties and of some cultural 
communities but also at members of the media.
<P>
	Is this because the lady in question has a name that is-I do not 
know if it is English, Irish or Scottish-but the fact is that it is 
not-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I have been 
listening to the hon. member for a while and his remarks are not at 
all relevant to Bill C-317, which deals with anti-strikebreaking 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have been in the chair since 
the beginning of private members' business and I clearly recall 
another member making a speech on the bill, in which he addressed 
other issues as well.
<P>
	On the other hand, the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell was certainly on the right track at 
the beginning of his speech.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yes, at the beginning.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> More or less.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> More or less, but still I feel 
that in the little time he has left, he will certainly get back on topic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply want to use another quote to 
make a point and then go back to the main issue.
<P>
	Here is the quote. It reads: ``Canada has always protected French 
speaking people. It always let them be assimilated. If you know a 
bit of history-given your accent and your language, you may not 
have been a Quebecer at the beginning-did you study Quebec's 
history''?
<P>
	I now go back to the main issue, but I want the House to know 
that, at least as far as I am concerned, those who applaud when the 
member for Rimouski-Témiscouata makes such comments 
should also be condemned, just like she was when she lashed out at 
another person, thus showing once again the separatists' 
intolerance. We saw that. We also saw that intolerance when the 
Leader of the Opposition made his statement about little white 
babies. We saw it in other statements too. We saw it today and we 
see it again with the applause of another member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will conclude my remarks by saying that we do not intend to 
support the legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. St-Laurent:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	We go to the trouble of introducing bills because we sincerely 
believe that the House serves some purpose, and I still believe it 
does. However, when I see the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell do what he just did for ten minutes, 
I begin to seriously question the true role of this House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15512"> 15512 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This is not a point of order, 
although we should always take great care to make our remarks 
relevant. The rule of relevancy is interpreted with a great deal of 
flexibility on both sides of the House.
<P>
	I will now ask the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell to conclude his remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I have finished, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to make 
my remarks strictly relevant to Bill C-317, an act to amend the 
Canada Labour Code. On page 1a of this bill, it says, and I will read 
very slowly so that everybody can understand:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this bill is to prohibit the hiring of persons to replace employees of 
an employer under the Canada Labour Code or of the Public Service who are on 
strike or locked out.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is what the bill is all about. This bill was carefully prepared 
by my colleague from Manicouagan, who carried out a study and 
who is sort of making a new attempt to remind the House that we 
must do something in this area. Another purpose of this bill is to 
ensure that essential services are maintained in the event of a strike 
or lockout in a crown corporation and in the public service.
<P>
	Bill C-317 was introduced by the hon. member for 
Manicouagan, whom I want to congratulate again for his insight. 
He was able to come up with this piece of legislation by relying on 
his work experience. The purpose of this bill is to expand on what 
we already have in Quebec. It tries to influence this Parliament, 
even though we are in the middle of a referendum, because a lot of 
the federal provisions included in the Canada Labour Code affect 
workers in Quebec. This is why my hon. colleague introduced this 
bill.
<P>
	May I remind you that it is not the first time that such an 
initiative is undertaken and that such a bill is introduced in the 
House. Without going into details, I want to mention as an example 
that, in November 1992, the Conservative member for Abitibi had 
brought forward Bill C-376 that had essentially the same intent as 
the introductory paragraph of the bill introduced by the member for 
Manicouagan.
<P>
	Before that, during the postal strike, the present member for 
Richelieu, who was then a Conservative, tried twice to get the 
House to adopt legislation to prohibit the hiring of scabs by crown 
corporations. The first time was in February 1988 with Bill C-282 
and the second time was in April 1989 with Bill C-201. That last 
bill was defeated by 18 votes only, which means that the member 
for Manicouagan has a good reason for trying again today, having 
seen that a good number of members from different parties in the 
House had supported such a bill at that time.
<P>
	The Liberal Party, then in opposition, had expressed its support 
for the bill. Many Liberal members were in favour of the bill at that 
time. If we go back a little further, in 1980, Ed Broadbent, then 
leader of the NDP, had introduced an antiscab bill. Since that time, 
several unions have asked various federal governments to pass a 
similar act. So, this is nothing new.
<P>
	In October 1994, the present Minister of Human Resources 
Development promised that an anti-scab bill would be introduced 
in the spring of 1995. We all know what happened. A part of the 
responsibilities of the Minister of Human Resources Development 
were transferred to the present Minister of Labour, who seems to be 
to busy with the referendum because she has not yet introduced 
such a bill. Yet, the minister had made a priority of that issue after 
her appointment in February 1995. We are in October and nothing 
has been done.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House that in Quebec, provincial 
anti-scab legislation was passed in 1977 and became part of the 
Labour Code. Since then, Ontario and British Columbia have 
passed similar legislation.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	The preventive, dissuasive and indicative role of the Quebec act 
has resulted in a 35 per cent decrease in the average number of 
labour conflicts since 1979. And 35 per cent is not a figure to be 
sneezed at.
<P>
	There is agreement between the partners in the Quebec labour 
market on the beneficial effects of the Quebec legislation on scab 
labour. Even the strongly federalist and strongly pro-business 
Conseil du patronat du Québec has abandoned its challenge against 
these acts before the Supreme Court, saying that there had been 
improvements in labour relations in Quebec over the years since its 
adoption.
<P>
	And yet, as you know, there is a new government in Ontario and 
the new Mike Harris government which is chummier with business 
than with workers, has promised to do away with Ontario's Bill 40 
by the end of this year. It is noteworthy that Chrysler Canada has 
publicly advised the Harris government not to move too hastily on 
this change and to weigh its consequences. The automobile 
manufacturer fears that precipitous action might upset labour 
relations in Ontario. This is a very recent happening and right in 
Ontario. Chrysler Corporation is not just any company, it is a huge 
company, an important one, and it is warning the government of 
Ontario not to take away the legislation.
<P>
	In Quebec, 10 per cent of workers are governed by the Canada 
Labour Code, or about 217,000 people.
<P>
	Now I will speak to you about one example of a labour conflict 
in Quebec which dragged on because Quebec's scab legislation was 
not enforced. That example is Ogilvie Mills Limited. Ogilvie 
processes grain, and somewhere in the constitution, in Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15513"> 15513 </A></B>
<P>
constitutional law, it says that grain comes under federal 
jurisdiction. So what  happened at Ogilvie? Because it was 
federally regulated, Quebec's anti-scab legislation did not apply.
<P>
	This dispute, which was settled only recently, went on and on, 
despite all attempts to reach a settlement. I remember raising the 
matter as the member for Lévis. Although Ogilvie is mainly in 
Montreal, there was an impact across Quebec. In the notorious 
dispute at CN, we told the Minister of Labour: You do not seem as 
anxious to appoint a mediator to settle the grain dispute at Ogilvie 
in the Port of Montreal.
<P>
	The dispute dragged on and on and on, until it was settled quite 
recently, but it went on for many months, and in fact it lasted about 
18 months, if I am not mistaken.
<P>
	So what did the workers at Ogilvie want? What caused the 
dispute? It seems they just wanted to maintain their working 
conditions, not improve them, only maintain them. The company 
wanted to backtrack on conditions that had already been agreed to.
<P>
	In the circumstances, it was perfectly normal for the employees 
to act as they did. Not many people, and I would even include 
members opposite and, in fact, all members of the House of 
Commons, would be prepared to go back to what conditions were 
in the past. And that was the problem.
<P>
	I could mention another case in Quebec to illustrate my point. I 
come from the riding of Lévis. MIL Davie, a marine construction 
firm, comes under the Quebec Labour Code because the sector is 
regulated by the province. The company does not have the right to 
hire strike breakers. However, a small shipyard like the one at Les 
Méchins, which does ship repairs and is thus in a related sector, 
would be subject to the Canada Labour Code because of the federal 
government's jurisdiction over marine traffic, and so the anti-scab 
legislation would not apply.
<P>
	Today, these shipyards are being invited to bid for the same jobs 
but they are not subject to the same conditions, the same bargaining 
rules.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	In the minute I have left I would like to say that-and it might 
look odd for a Bloc member involved in the current referendum 
campaign to encourage the federal government to pass anti-scab 
legislation-, if the yes vote wins, Quebec will do what it likes 
once it is sovereign. We can envisage that.
<P>
	However, at the same time, as the areas of worker intervention 
are often interrelated and we want an open economy, we feel that 
our future neighbour, Canada, should be subject to the same 
conditions so that the rules for business-we are talking here of 
free trade-are consistent.
<P>
	This is to be expected, and we want the members opposite to 
vote in favour of this legislation so that workers in all fields, 
particularly industry, enjoy the same conditions in this part of the 
North American continent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to 
be here tonight in my first duties as the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Labour and to speak briefly on Bill C-317.
<P>
	I thank the member for Manicouagan for bringing this important 
bill forward. The member proposes to amend the Canada Labour 
Code and the Public Service Staff Relations Act. As I read it, there 
are two very important objectives here.
<P>
	The first objective is to ban replacement workers when there is a 
strike or lockout in the public service or at an employer covered 
under the Canada Labour Code. The second objective is to ensure 
that essential public services are maintained in the event of a strike 
or lockout in the public service or at a crown corporation.
<P>
	The issues raised in the bill are difficult and complicated. It deals 
with peoples' pocketbooks, their livelihoods and their rights. To 
those involved in labour relations, it will also influence Canada's 
economic and social progress.
<P>
	Thus the bill merits our time and consideration. Any decisions 
taken on these issues have to be carefully thought through. Bill 
C-317 proposes to change part I of the Canada Labour Code. This 
part of the code is meant to achieve a balance of power between 
labour and management.
<P>
	As a former union executive I know a careful balance is needed 
to keep the collective bargaining process running. Therefore I do 
not think it is wise to isolate or grab on to certain issues without 
considering the effect on the big picture. That is the point I want to 
emphasize.
<P>
	As I am sure the hon. member is aware, there has not been a 
comprehensive review of the industrial relations provisions of the 
labour code in over 20 years. The last amendments were made in 
1972 and before that we have to go back to 1948.
<P>
	In 1972 amendments were made involving the certification 
process, new provisions to require good faith bargaining, the 
extension of the unfair labour practices section and increasing the 
authority of the Canada Labour Relations Board. Most important in 
my mind, especially in light of today's economy, was the inclusion 
of a section on technological change. This meant that unless a 
collective agreement dealt with the issue, an employer was 
required to give 90 days notice of any new technology likely to 
impact on working conditions or job security of a significant 
number of employees. That notice was lengthened in 1984 to 120 
days.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15514"> 15514 </A></B>
<P>
	After such notice the union can apply to the CLRB for leave to 
notify the employer of its desire to reopen negotiations to discuss 
provisions for those workers affected by technology. Once notice is 
received the employer cannot make technological changes until the 
board denies the union application or an agreement is reached or 
the parties negotiate and reach a strike provision.
<P>
	These changes were made only after extensive consultations 
with unions and employers and after two thorough studies. The 
Freedman study in the 1960s looked at the impact of technology at 
CN Rail and recommended a formula for labour and management 
to resolve disagreements over the consequences of new technology. 
As well, the Woods task force in 1968 examined just about every 
aspect of labour-management relations under federal jurisdiction. 
It commissioned a number of studies and submitted several 
important recommendations to the government.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	I have touched on the history just to show that in Canada we do 
not fool around when it comes to labour-management relations. 
Hastily ill-conceived actions however well meaning can have 
serious consequences in this area.
<P>
	Our tradition is to only change collective bargaining laws after 
thorough deliberation and consultation with all of the stakeholders. 
This tradition has served us very well. It has allowed us to develop 
at the federal level at least. I will refrain from commenting on the 
radical and polarizing swings in my home province of Ontario over 
the last five years. We had the NDP way over here at one end for a 
little while and now we have the Conservatives, some would 
suggest very right wing indeed, going the other way. That kind of 
polarization and swinging back and forth does nothing for 
labour-management relations. In fact, it does a disservice to the 
people who have to make a living by collective bargaining.
<P>
	Since the last amendments were made in 1972, the environment 
surrounding industrial relations has undergone a revolution. Free 
trade, deregulation, rapid technological advances and workplace 
restructuring place new demands on both labour and management. 
In light of this, we need a comprehensive review of the Canada 
Labour Code, not piecemeal action as suggested tonight.
<P>
	In fact, the Minister of Labour launched such a review just a 
little while ago. This review is looking at the big picture. We want 
to improve the labour code to encourage co-operation between 
labour and management, to reduce unhealthy and 
counterproductive levels of conflict and to ensure that 
administrative bodies are responsive to the new and always 
changing labour relations environment.
<P>
	Since last winter, extensive consultations have been carried out 
with labour, management and interested and  knowledgeable third 
parties. Many issues are being studied, including those that the 
member proposes to deal with in Bill C-317. It is a difficult task, as 
labour and management hold diametrically opposed viewpoints on 
these issues. For example, there is the issue of replacement 
workers. Let me quote Tom d'Aquino, whom we all know, and 
what he thinks on this ban.
<P>
	Tom d'Aquino writes: ``We would dramatically alter the delicate 
equilibrium which has been established over the course of many 
years between management and labour and firms which are subject 
to federal jurisdiction. The obvious result would be to strengthen 
the position of organized labour while simultaneously weakening 
management's position, with clear implications for the outcome of 
their private contractual negotiations. Government interference of 
this sort would violate the most basic principles of equity and fair 
play. It would be highly disruptive and entirely inconsistent with 
our open market economy. It also would override the fundamental 
rights of individuals to decide where and when they choose to 
work''.
<P>
	On the other side we have Bob White, whom we also know quite 
well. He is on record expressing the CLC's strong support for 
restrictions and even a total ban on replacement workers, including 
management staff.
<P>
	Our job is to try to reconcile these deeply held, apparently 
incompatible positions. It will not be easy, but it is something we 
simply have to do.
<P>
	Last June the Minister of Labour established a task force to 
conduct an independent review of part I of the labour code and to 
recommend changes. I want to mention tonight the issues and areas 
this task force will be looking at and to mention to the members 
opposite who have suggested that the Minister of Labour has done 
virtually nothing on this issue and that she has been somewhat 
reluctant to get involved in these major changes that are necessary 
for the economy and for the labour relations we have to deal with. 
The review will be completed by December 15. I am confident the 
people on the task force will do a thorough and professional job.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	The task force is dealing with very critical and important issues 
which include the conciliation and mediation process with a view 
to reducing delays and encouraging settlements and the possible 
role of alternative dispute settlements; fact finding and special 
mediation; the procedures for acquiring the right to strike or 
lockout; and the rights of employees, employers and bargaining 
agents once a strike or a lockout occurs. The general purpose of the 
code will be looked at as will the need for labour management 
committees, preventive mediation programs, grievance mediation 
and expedited arbitration. Bargaining unit structures including 
recommendations of industrial inquiry commissions into labour 
relations at west coast ports will be made regarding geographic 
certification provisions. Finally the  need for alternative procedures 
or bargaining structures for the non-traditional work relationships 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15515"> 15515 </A></B>
<P>
like telework, contract work and casual employees will be looked 
at.
<P>
	As members can see, although I did not lay them all out tonight, 
the task force has a large task ahead of it. There is a lot to do and 
not much time to do it. Then we will be able to make informed 
decisions on the issues raised by the separatist party opposite and 
on other issues as well taking into account the big picture.
<P>
	In order to make sense of the whole process we will have to wait 
until the ongoing studies are complete. Then we will all be able to 
make an informed decision and a position will be reached by the 
government on what we will put in front of the House as far as new 
legislation is concerned.
<P>
	That is what the federal government believes is the true way. We 
have put comprehensive labour relations management proposals to 
the House instead of the piecemeal approach suggested by the 
member opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to participate in the debate on Bill 
C-317, sponsored by the member from the Bloc that deals with the 
ban on replacement workers.
<P>
	The Bloc member favours a ban on replacement workers. This 
stems from the Bloc being very upset with the use of replacement 
workers by the American owners of the Montreal company known 
as Ogilvie flour mills. Because flour mills fall under federal 
jurisdiction and Quebec's provincial anti-replacement worker 
legislation had no effect on the company, I understand Bloc 
members feel it is important to bring the legislation forward to the 
House of Commons for us to review in private members' hour.
<P>
	The proposal comes from a member of a separatist party that 
wants to take the province of Quebec out of Canada. We feel they 
do not realize the consequences of their actions. I do not think they 
realize the consequences of the bill as well. It is a bit like sandbox 
diplomacy where a youngster is playing in the sandbox and if he 
does not get along with his companion he says: ``I am going to take 
my toys and go play in another sandbox. No one else can play with 
these toys; I will take them with me''.
<P>
	Hopefully when we are dealing with legislation and labour 
disputes we can get beyond sandbox diplomacy in politics. The 
sandbox approach to labour disputes and to labour legislation, 
particularly legislation such as the bill that would ban replacement 
workers, is not the solution to the problem. It would exacerbate the 
problem considerably.
<P>
	I will not go on at great length debating the clauses of the bill 
proposed by my colleague. However I want to take a brief look at 
the consequences of labour disputes and perhaps a more 
constructive and positive way of resolving them other than banning 
replacement workers  and getting into a frustrating battle between 
labour and management where people take sides. I would also 
advise my colleague from the Bloc that perhaps this approach to 
labour legislation and a relationship with labour is not in their 
political best interests.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	All we have to do is look at our political cousins, the New 
Democratic caucus, and see what has happened to them over the 
years and what happened to them over this past weekend. They 
have always catered to the elite in the labour movement, the 
leaders, and felt that was the key to their political success. Even in 
their leadership convention over the weekend we saw where labour 
played a significant role in determining who the leader of the party 
would be. That has led to their political demise and even to an 
erosion of support among rank and file union workers because of 
their position on issues dealing with labour and management.
<P>
	A word of advice to my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois is that 
perhaps for their political well-being they might not be advised to 
pursue this type of legislation.
<P>
	I want to discuss labour relations on the west coast, which 
impact on my part of the world. Western Canada is important. I 
know we debate Quebec and its relationship within Canada quite a 
bit these days. However, I just want to deal with the labour 
situation and replacement labour and perhaps a better approach to 
solving labour disputes from my perspective in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Since 1972, six labour disputes relating to the west coast ports 
were settled by federal back to work legislation. Two other labour 
disputes were settled by federal back to work legislation in 1988 
and 1991. They were also directly related to grain handling 
disputes in British Columbia, although they were somewhat 
different.
<P>
	Within the current term of this 35th Parliament, two labour 
disputes have occurred at the west coast ports and there had to be 
back to work legislation. Specifically, these are the West Coast 
Ports Operation Act, Bill C-10, and the West Coast Ports Operation 
Act 1995, Bill C-74. These relate to disputes occurring in February 
1994 and March 1995.
<P>
	That brings me to the principle of the right to strike, the right to 
lock out workers, and the right to replace workers with so-called 
scab labour, or the opposite of that, the right to implement 
legislation that would ban the hiring of replacement workers.
<P>
	The strike and the lockout are effective tools in the labour and 
management arsenal. They have been using these for a long time to 
bring about a resolution. Usually the side with the deepest pockets 
and the strongest resolve to win will force resolution in their 
favour. We respect this mechanism. If that is the approach that  
labour and management want to take, we respect it. It is not a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15516"> 15516 </A></B>
<P>
mature approach, but we live in a free country and that should 
certainly be considered.
<P>
	In the case of the west coast ports, however, labour disputes are 
unique for a couple of reasons. One is that the federal government 
does not allow labour and management to actually carry the 
resolution process to the point where there is a disruption and it 
gets into a replacement labour situation or the banning of it. It 
passes back to work legislation as part of that. That has taught us 
that there is an innocent third party that is damaged economically. 
For that reason, there has been great pressure to find a better way to 
resolve management and labour disputes than through strike or 
lockout actions and subsequently through the use of scab labour or 
the banning of that same labour.
<P>
	We have suggested that what has been working and has even 
been legislated by the House is the use of final offer selection 
arbitration. I would be more encouraged if my colleague had 
brought forward legislation that would take us from sandbox 
diplomacy with regard to labour relations and move it to a more 
mature ground, such as that of the final offer selection arbitration 
process.
<P>
	The cost of the west coast ports disruption is in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars. The direct cost of the 1994 dispute was over 
$125 million. The indirect cost in the loss of future contracts was 
over $250 million. According to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, the threatened grain sales could amount to $500 
million.
<P>
	Having outlined these problems, we did not leave the people in 
the lurch. We decided we had to do something constructive about 
this. We suggested the final offer selection process. It is a tried and 
true process. It is not a brand new idea. In fact, the process has been 
legislated in this House.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	Perhaps it could have an expanded role beyond some of the 
essential services, such as west coast ports and national railways. It 
could be accepted by labour and management more readily, rather 
than going the route of replacement workers or a ban on 
replacement workers.
<P>
	This is how final offer selection arbitration works. If, and only if, 
the union and the employer cannot make an agreement by the 
conclusion of the previous contract, the following measures are 
immediately put into place without work disruption. If there is no 
work disruption that means there are no replacement workers and 
that step has been precluded altogether.
<P>
	The union and the employer are requested to provide the name of 
a person they would jointly recommend as a arbiter. The union and 
the employer are required to submit to the arbiter a list of matters 
agreed on and a list of matters still under dispute. For the disputed 
issues, each party is required to submit final offer for settlement  
and the arbitrator then selects either the final offer submitted by the 
trade union or the final offer submitted by the employer. In the 
event that one party does not submit a final offer, then the other 
side's offer is automatically accepted and the arbitrator's decision 
is binding on both parties.
<P>
	This is the direction in which we believe labour and management 
relations should be going. It is the way to more maturely settle 
management-labour disputes. It precludes having to use 
replacement labour or banning replacement labour altogether. It 
prevents work disruptions. It prevents loss of pay for the workers. 
The collective bargaining process is still in place. It is still allowed 
to take its full course. The parties are brought together to resolve 
their disputes more quickly, more fairly, more equitably and more 
harmoniously.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to consider when he brings future 
legislation to the House this as a third option which might be 
superior to others that have been considered.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say a few words on Bill C-317 introduced 
by the hon. member for Manicouagan.
<P>
	This bill proposes to amend the Canada Labour Code and the 
Public Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is, first, to prohibit the hiring of persons 
to replace employees of an employer under the Canada Labour 
Code or of the public service who are on strike or locked out and, 
second, to ensure that essential services are maintained in the event 
of a strike or lockout in a crown corporation or in the public 
service.
<P>
	Although this bill proposes to amend the Canada Labour Code as 
well as the Public Service Staff Relations Act, I will deal only with 
the amendments to the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	Furthermore, I want to examine two aspects of staff relations I 
find significant: the use of replacement workers and the 
maintenance of essential services in the event of a strike or lockout.
<P>
	It is not the first time that such issues have been raised in the 
House. Politicians must have raised them often. The spokesmen for 
employers and unions expressed their views quite forcefully. And 
industrial relations experts from our universities have tried to 
explain to us the consequences of our decisions in this area.
<P>
	The problems concerning the use of replacement workers and 
essential services are not easy to solve because what is involved is 
people's livelihoods and rights, as well as society's legitimate 
expectations. We are asked, as membres of Parliament, to decide if 
restricting the rights of one group is in the public interest. We are 
also asked to strike a balance between the rights of  employers and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15517"> 15517 </A></B>
<P>
those of employees. Whatever legislative action we take, one group 
will feel that it is being wronged, that its rights are being denied.
<P>
	Therefore, it is essential not to make hasty decisions on these 
issues. As I said, members have raised them often. It is all to their 
credit that they did not act impulsively and incoherently. I believe, 
however, that this bill's time has not yet come.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	As the hon. member probably knows, the government has 
undertaken a complete review of part I of the Canada Labour Code. 
That part defines the framework for industrial relations and sets the 
rules for collective bargaining in federally regulated industries.
<P>
	It applies to areas like rail and road transportation, pipelines, air 
and sea transportation, longshoring, grain handling, banking and 
broadcasting, as far as they concern interprovincial or international 
activities. Some crown corporations, like Canada Post, are also 
subject to the code.
<P>
	For more than 20 years, the Canada Labour Code provisions on 
labour relations have not been reviewed. However, the collective 
bargaining process has changed tremendously during that time. 
Due to globalization, deregulation, technological change, and work 
environment restructuring, many requirements must now be met.
<P>
	The government is holding major consultations with 
management and labour organizations, as well as with academics. 
Many concerned citizens have written to give their opinion on 
labour relations.
<P>
	The task force examining Part I of the Code must report to the 
minister by December 15, 1995. Certain complex and difficult 
aspects have been looked at already, particularly the use of 
replacement workers in legal work stoppages and the question of 
essential services. These are highly volatile issues, particularly the 
issue of replacement workers.
<P>
	At the present time, the Canada Labour Code does not forbid the 
use of replacement workers but it does offer some measure of 
protection to workers on strike. The employer may not take 
disciplinary measures against an employee who takes part in a legal 
work stoppage or who refuses to perform the duties of another 
employee who is taking part in a legal work stoppage.
<P>
	As well, according to Canada Labour Relations Board 
regulations, employees are entitled to resume their positions after 
the strike is over and to have priority over any other person who has 
been hired to replace them. In the United States, there is no 
measure of protection against hiring replacement workers. 
Employers are in fact even permitted to hire permanent 
replacement workers, although President Clinton is working to put 
a stop to this practice.
<P>
	Here in Canada, several provinces have passed legislation to 
limit the use of replacement workers in legal strikes. Those who 
favour a measure to prohibit the use of replacement workers feel 
that, when collective bargaining breaks down, the parties will be 
motivated to reach compromises by the economic difficulties they 
face.
<P>
	However, when an employer continues to operate his business 
during a strike through the use of replacement workers, he loses the 
motivation to bargain. Work stoppages last longer, and tension on 
the picket lines increases.
<P>
	Some claim that, in Quebec, where the use of replacement 
workers has been banned since 1978, violence on the picket line 
has dropped. Others say that using replacement workers poisons 
labour relations and discourages employees from joining the union; 
they know they can be easily replaced during a strike, and 
consequently they doubt that belonging to a union would be of any 
use. This is especially true of companies using untrained low paid 
workers.
<P>
	To those who say that banning the use of replacement workers 
would tip the scale in favour of workers, unionists and the like 
reply that globalization is already tipping the scale in favour of 
employers. Those who do not support banning the use of 
replacement workers say that it could discourage new investments 
and drive some companies to the United States where there is no 
law to this effect.
<P>
	Those who oppose such legislation also maintain that most 
businesses under federal jurisdiction are infrastructure industries. 
Therefore, if these businesses have to stop all operations because 
they cannot hire replacement workers, the whole economy will 
suffer and we will have to use back to work legislation more often.
<P>
	To those who say that the banning of replacement workers would 
reduce tension and violence on picket lines, those who oppose the 
banning reply that labour legislation is not the appropriate tool for 
solving this problem. They think that the government should turn 
its attention to those who commit these acts of violence.
<P>
	This is obviously a very difficult problem, and it will not be easy 
to reconcile the two sides. It is therefore absolutely essential to 
continue to talk, to consult each other, to do research, to discuss 
and to think.
<P>
	The comprehensive review of the code undertaken by the 
government should be allowed to continue before amendments can 
be submitted to the House for approval.
<P>
	The issue of essential services is also very complex. Coming up 
with an exact definition of essential services is no small task. In his 
bill, our colleague seems to establish a direct link between essential 
services and services provided by Crown corporations. 
Consequently, crown corporations would be covered by provisions
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15518"> 15518 </A></B>
<P>
governing essential services, while private companies offering the 
same services would not.
<P>
	To conclude, I would just like to remind the House that a 
thorough review of the Code has been undertaken by the federal 
government and that the two points raised by our colleague will be 
considered as part of this review. It would therefore be premature 
to adopt such a bill while the Code is under review.
<P>
	Given the complexity and importance of the points raised, it 
would be wise to wait until this review has been completed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the bottom 
of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It being 7.13 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
