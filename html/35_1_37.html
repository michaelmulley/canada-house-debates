	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-224, an act to require charitable and 
non-profit organizations that receive public funds to declare the 
remuneration of their directors and senior officers.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to introduce a 
private member's bill entitled the charitable and non-profit 
organizations director remunerations disclosure act, the purpose 
of which is to bring public accountability to all organizations 
funded by the taxpayer  in the matter of salaries and benefits of 
their directors and principal officers.
<P>
	Once a group receives public money directly or indirectly it 
must be prepared to surrender its right to privacy. MPs declare 
their pay, and the same principle of salary disclosure should 
apply to all persons charged with the public trust. This bill 
addresses that principle.

	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, it is my honour to present a 
petition signed by residents from British Columbia, Alberta, 
Quebec and Ontario, which I think highlights the importance of 
this petition.
<P>
	The petitioners state that whereas Russian troops continue to 
occupy a large radar station in Latvia; whereas the maximum 
intensity of electromagnetic radiation from the station has had a 
profoundly negative effective on the health of the surrounding 
population; whereas Latvia as an independent state has 
repeatedly demanded the withdrawal of these Russian troops, 
the petitioners pray and call upon Parliament to urge the 
government to urge the Russians to promptly withdraw these 
troops from Latvia and further to remind the Russians that future 
Canadian aid and credits will be tied to the timely compliance 
with this request.
<P>
	The petitioners will forever pray.

<P>
	(a) Preliminary data for 1993 shows that 109,765 immigrants 
landed in Canada under the family reunification program.
<P>
	(b) There are three major categories under the family 
reunification program: spouses, dependent children, and parents 
and grandparents. The principal applicant may bring with 
him/her dependents as specified in the regulation. Of the 
109,765 immigrants, 50 per cent landed under the spouses 
category, 12 per cent under the dependent children category and 
38 per cent as parents and grandparents.
<P>
	The average age for principal applicants in the spouse 
category was 31 years. Ninety per cent of the dependents of 
spouses were under 19 years and nine per cent were between 19 
and 30 years old.
<P>
	The average age for immigrants in the dependent children 
category was 16 years.
<P>
	The average age of principal applicants in the parents and 
grandparents category was 64 years. Fifty-three per cent of

	He said: Mr. Speaker, we believe it is time to review our 
foreign policy in light of the changes occurring in the world, our 
national interests, our capabilities and the new constraints that 
we now face.
<P>
	Our red book outlined several initiatives a Liberal 
government intended to pursue. Since my appointment as 
Minister of Foreign Affairs on November 4, 1993, I have taken 
steps to implement these initiatives.
<P>
	First, the government will soon be ratifying the law of the sea 
convention. We recognize that Canadians, especially those from 
the Atlantic region, want a more effective international regime 
for managing fish stocks on the high seas. To this end, my 
colleague the minister of fisheries went to New York yesterday 
to attend a special United Nations conference on this issue.
<P>
	Furthermore, I have asked my officials to produce a working 
paper on UN reform issues in preparation for the 50th 
anniversary of the UN in 1995. I want to point out that Canada 
has always played a relatively prominent role at the UN. We 
have given an important grant to the United Nations Association 
in Canada to promote Canadians' awareness of UN reform in the 
context of the 50th anniversary.
<P>
	Together with my colleague the Minister of the Environment, 
I am also pursuing means to make sustainable development a 
key component of our approach to international assistance.
<P>
	In our red book, we also spoke of our desire to make Canada's 
foreign policy development more democratic. Our 
determination has not flagged.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	This is why I am pleased to open the debate on Canada's 
foreign policy review in this House today.
<P>
	We promised to develop an independent foreign policy for 
Canada. What does that mean? It means first and foremost to 
have the political courage to say what we think. To dare say what 
we think, sometimes in spite of others, to say it often before 
others, but also to always say it better than others. Our foreign 
policy must not only be independent but also more democratic. 
And the best way to make it more democratic is of course to 
listen to the concerns and interests of Canadians. This is why we 
want to broaden the public consultation process and enable 
Parliament to play a major role in this review.
<P>
	We promised to allow Parliament to express its views on 
major international issues. Indeed, the members of this House 
have been able to debate our peacekeeping role in Bosnia and 
cruise missile testing in Canada. I believe that these new 
initiatives must be pursued. I also think that the parliamentary 
committee has a unique opportunity to debate the major issues 
which must be reviewed in the context of our foreign policy 
review.
<P>
	I do hope that parliamentarians will hold public hearings 
across the country and will invite Canadians, not only to submit 
briefs and testify before the committee, but also to establish a 
dialogue with the government through the members of that joint 
committee of the House and the Senate.
<P>
	We will also invite Canadians at large to play an active part in 
this review. On March 21 and 22, we will hold a national forum, 
here in Ottawa, on Canada's international relations. This forum 
will be sponsored by my colleagues, the Minister for 
International Trade and  the Minister of Defence, and myself. 
The Prime Minister will preside at the opening of the forum.
<P>
	More than 100 Canadian personalities from different walks of 
life will be invited to examine the major directions of our 
foreign policy in light of the overwhelming changes of recent 
years. Their comments will be extremely useful to us in 
assessing our foreign policy. We should be able to determine 
which policies continue to serve our interests and which should 
be redesigned.
<P>
	After the forum, the government will ask the joint 
parliamentary committee to undertake its own review of 
Canada's foreign policy, taking into account what will have been 
said at the forum, and to make specific recommendations. I hope 
the committee will have the opportunity to hear the views and 
opinions of all Canadians across the country.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Meanwhile, together with my colleagues, the two secretaries 
of state and the parliamentary secretary will continue 
wide-ranging consultations with all those who are interested in 
international issues, especially the international development 
assistance program.
<P>
	The recent annual human rights consultations with 
non-governmental organizations were very productive for us in 
preparing for this year's meeting of the Commission on Human 
Rights in Geneva. The recent International Development Week 
was more than a mere listening exercise for me; it enabled me to 
pursue and develop co-operative ties with our partners. We 
intend to continue in that spirit, because many people in 
non-governmental organizations follow Canadian foreign 
policy and contribute to Canada's good name throughout the 
world by serving Canadian interests abroad in a worthy and very 
substantial way.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize in this House the importance that I 
attach to the consultation process. The forum and the work of the 
joint committee will certainly not be the last step in this 
consultative process. Indeed, the government intends to pursue 
these consultations, as I was saying, and we hope that it will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2256"> 2256 </A></B>
<P>
become a good precedent that will be followed throughout this 
government's mandate.
<P>
	In the coming years, we want this forum to be used to examine 
some particular aspects of Canada's foreign policy. The 
government will seek to maintain an ongoing review of its 
foreign policy that will involve Canadians and their elected 
representatives, because in this world where rapid change and 
upheaval are the norm, we must establish and develop a flexible 
and effective mechanism. That is what we intend to do and that 
is what I promise in this House.
<P>
	While we are engaged in our foreign policy review, we cannot 
ignore our international responsibilities. In this regard, we are 
to participate in five major multilateral meetings this year. At 
the start of the year, the Prime Minister took part in the recent 
NATO summit. This  summer, he will go to Italy for the annual 
G-7 summit. In the fall, he will go to Asia for the summit of 
APEC, which stands for Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation. 
Finally, he will attend the summit of the Organization of 
American States and of the Conference on Security and 
Co-operation in Europe.
<P>
	We will therefore be very visible on the international scene 
this year and we must seize the opportunity to make our views 
and interests known at these gatherings.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This government was elected with the mandate for the 
renewal of our economy, our society, our political integrity and 
our confidence in the future. We have already begun the hard 
work and we know much more will have to be done. The 
obstacles are many but our duty to move forward is clear.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Many of our most difficult challenges and hardest choices 
must be faced here at home. As we said in the red book, finding 
jobs, protecting the environment, enhancing national unity, 
providing political security and enriching the cultural identity 
of Canada are all goals intrinsically linked to how Canada acts in 
the global arena.
<P>
	The international community faces difficult problems. 
Answers will require a concerted effort by countries working 
together in common. Whether we talk of the economy, of 
international security, of respect for international law, no nation 
can stand alone. We face common burdens and share links that 
cannot be severed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This government knows how hard the task of national renewal 
is, but we also know that our well-being as a country depends on 
a stable international environment in which we can prosper.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister said in our red book: ``Canada has 
always adapted to change and overcome adversity, and that will 
be the key to our future''. We cannot dissociate change abroad 
from change at home. We must show determination, 
imagination and courage. We are confident of success in 
meeting the challenges of our times. However, we will need the 
support and confidence of all Canadians to meet these 
extraordinary challenges. We have shown in the past our desire 
to solve this country's problems in a shared, open and 
co-operative manner.
<P>
	The foreign policy review process that I am launching today is 
intended to observe these same principles. But we do not seek to 
be iconoclasts. We do not seek to overturn all the values that 
have guided us in conducting our foreign policy until now. We 
must achieve a balance between continuity and change. Many 
sound elements of our foreign policy remain valuable and 
necessary today, objectives and characteristics that have helped 
to define us as an independent nation in the eyes of the 
international community.
<P>
	I would say that the whole world expects something of us that 
it does not expect of others. We must keep in mind that Canada is 
a country which has something special that few countries in the 
world can pride themselves on having. We are in a sense 
universal. We have a universality that is unlike any other 
country in the world. We are Americans and because we are in 
America, we have forged special ties with our American and 
Mexican neighbours through NAFTA. But being Americans and 
members of the Organization of American States, we are also 
partners with countries in the Caribbean and Central and South 
America. But we are not only American; our geography also 
makes us an Atlantic people. Because of our past, our 
transatlantic past, we have forged very close ties with countries 
on the European continent. Within the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, we have developed ties of friendship and 
co-operation with European nations. However, we have also 
looked to the Pacific. Within APEC, Canada is developing 
increasingly important ties with Asian nations. We must not 
forget, however, that there are three oceans. There is also the 
Arctic. Given our geographic location, we must also develop 
relations and maintain important co-operative ties with 
northern nations.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	We are fortunate to benefit from both the French and English 
cultures and languages and to belong to both the Commonwealth 
and la Francophonie. Canada plays a major role within these 
organizations. We have become a major trading partner of 
several African and Asian countries. As a former British colony, 
we maintain ongoing, friendly relations with Australia and New 
Zealand, as well as with a number of other African and Asian 
countries.
<P>
	Canada acted as a negotiator and helped to bring India and 
Pakistan closer together with a view to achieving peace. We 
were involved in settling the Korean War conflict. Following 
World War II, our military was actively involved in establishing 
a new peace in Europe. More recently, with the UN 
peacekeeping missions, Canada has made its presence felt just 
about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2257"> 2257 </A></B>
<P>
everywhere in the world, but particularly in the Middle East, 
contributing in the process to making the world a better place.
<P>
	When we look at what Canada has done and at the extent of its 
participation, we can see that few countries in the world can 
claim to have such tangible, important relations with countries 
on all continents.
<P>
	We have to bear this fact in mind when we consider ways of 
improving and changing our foreign policy, while remaining 
faithful to those before us who helped to develop it.
<P>
	Of course, we will have to make some difficult choices in 
some cases, but we cannot betray the hopes and trust that many 
countries around the world have placed in us.  As I said earlier, 
they expect more from Canada than they do from other nations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As we embark on this foreign policy review process, we must 
take heed of what has served us well, of what policies have 
gained us international respect and admiration, the positions we 
have taken and the progress we have achieved in critical areas 
such as peace and security, north-south relations and human 
rights.
<P>
	We can be proud of Canada's historic leadership in the 
international struggle against apartheid in South Africa and of 
Canada's vision in creating peacekeeping. We have consistently 
pursued our international values and interests, not through force 
of arms or belligerent diplomacy but through force of reason and 
commitment. We have always willingly fulfilled our 
responsibilities as a global citizen seeking to build international 
understanding through co-operative multilateralism. We have 
welcomed international trade and investment rather than 
retrenching ourselves behind protectionism. Canada played a 
key role in the successful conclusion of the Uruguay round and 
toward the creation of the World Trade Organization.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	We will continue to build on the strong foundations of our 
support for peace and security, international prosperity and 
development, respect for human rights, democracy and good 
governance, the rule of law and free trade.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These elements will continue to be basic objectives. While the 
dramatic events of recent years give us a sense of hope, modern 
times, unfortunately, are as dangerous as ever. The war in the 
Balkans is, sadly, an all too obvious example.
<P>
	We must continue to move from security structures originally 
designed to contain the Soviet threat toward a new system 
designed to manage risk and unpredictability. Thus, we must 
consider the future of multilateral organizations such as NATO 
and the CSCE. We must also redefine, as I stated earlier, the role 
of the United Nations and we must also endeavour to make 
regional organizations such as the Organization of American 
States more relevant.
<P>
	We must also nip possible new sources of conflict in the bud 
by continuing our assistance to programs aimed at dismantling 
nuclear weapons and by broadening and enforcing 
non-proliferation treaties, especially in North Korea, South 
Asia and the Middle East.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction raise 
new fears. Recent treaties to halt and reverse their proliferation 
are steps in the right direction, but improved verification and 
universal accession are essential. International action is also 
needed to arrest and  reverse an excessive stockpiling of 
conventional armaments.
<P>
	Large scale movements of people, whether refugees displaced 
by persecution or persons seeking improved economic 
conditions, will continue. The scenes of displacement and 
despair we see every day unfortunately on our television screen 
are graphic reminders of how much remains to be done.
<P>
	Countries will have to work together to address the root cause 
of migratory pressures. Stopgap measures to ease the pressure or 
stem the tide will fail.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The rise of ultranationalism as a political ideology puts 
progress toward democracy at the mercy of intolerance. We 
must act internationally to respond to problems related to the 
treatment of ethnic, religious and cultural minorities. Canada 
has much to offer the international community in this regard. 
The political, social and economic components of various 
environmental issues must be studied as parts of a whole. The 
solutions we must find to new environmental threats will not 
always be easy to accept. Sustainable development is the only 
way for both developing and industrialized countries.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Economically we are faced with explosive change. Dramatic 
developments in technology are driving changes in the 
organization of production, in investment patterns and in 
financial transfers which defy traditional frames of analysis and 
forms of control.
<P>
	My colleague, the Minister for International Trade, will 
discuss these changes and their implications for Canada in 
greater depth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2258"> 2258 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to note that economic, political and social 
changes cannot be separated. As we can see in eastern Europe, 
they intercept, overlap and occasionally conflict.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With this in mind, we wish to benefit from the knowledge and 
experience of Canadians. I know that our fellow citizens care 
about their country's foreign policy. We must therefore listen to 
Canadians. They can best tell us what values and interests this 
country must promote abroad, and how we can best contribute to 
the international community.
<P>
	However, I think that we should take into account our 
important cultural contribution abroad in our review of 
Canada's foreign policy. We must recognize that our 
international contribution in this area is directly tied to our 
national actions to support creativity, innovation and human 
resources development.
<P>
	Of course, our policies must be realistic. Unfortunately, we 
will not be able to do everything we want to do. So, difficult 
choices will have to be made. Our resources are limited, and we 
must focus our efforts where our contribution will have the 
greatest impact. No single issue will be off-limits in this debate 
on foreign  policy. However, as a government, we must give the 
broad outline of this policy and we intend to pursue our action in 
the following areas: first, the pursuit of international peace and 
security. Second, defining Canada's place in a world where the 
role of regional associations is growing stronger. Third, linking 
Canada's values and interests, including our economic and trade 
interests.
<P>
	Geoffrey Pearson aptly described in his book entitled <I>Seize 
the Day</I> how Lester B. Pearson and his ministerial colleagues 
shaped Canadian foreign policy to be independent, original, 
forward looking, based on truly Canadian values but requiring at 
the same time a sustained involvement in international 
organizations such as the United Nations and NATO.
<P>
	In fact, Canada has always centred its security policy on two 
multilateral institutions: NATO, to contain the threat of 
communist expansion and to protect democracy; and the United 
Nations, to promote the values of dialogue and co-operation to 
resolve or prevent conflict. The end of communism has reduced 
NATO's importance as a military alliance. However, much can 
still be done by NATO.
<P>
	In the unstable new Europe, NATO must transform itself into 
a collective security organization while welcoming into its orbit 
the countries of eastern Europe which want to join and become 
our friends instead of our enemies. This is an opportunity that 
the western world cannot ignore or refuse to see and take up, one 
that will have to be acted upon as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	While NATO's role has changed, the UN has had to face a 
multitude of new demands and its role, instead of declining, has 
grown considerably. As you know, Canada has greatly 
contributed to the building of the United Nations, which reflects 
many values held dear by Canadians. After 40 years of near 
paralysis caused by the cold war, the UN is now being asked to 
play an increasingly active role in seeking and maintaining 
international peace and security.
<P>
	Of course, this transition has not been an easy one. Far from 
yielding to the temptation of easy criticism, we must admit that 
the United Nations has been asked to assume almost overnight a 
role for which it was never prepared. Indeed, one wonders how it 
has been able to function in these trying times. I think that it is in 
order to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, and to hail his remarkable efforts. He needs the 
support and encouragement of all peace-loving nations and all 
representatives of UN nations.
<P>
	Canada has led appeals for a sweeping reform of the United 
Nations, but we must show as much courage, innovation and 
determination today as in the aftermath of the second world war, 
when the nations of the world united to create major 
international institutions which, I would say, have served us 
very well over the years in spite of their little flaws.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Institutional inertia has frustrated creative thinking. We 
accept that the world is far more complex than it was five 
decades ago. We realize there are many more countries 
representing many more interests and perspectives. We 
understand we cannot tear up everything and start anew, 
ignoring the significant contributions made by international 
organizations, in particular by the United Nations. Lester B. 
Pearson said many years ago: ``We cannot abandon the United 
Nations as the main structure of peace''.
<P>
	We do believe, however, that it is time once again to 
encourage fresh ideas about where we want to go as a world 
community. We could draw on our expertise and our experience 
to develop new ideas on peace making, peace keeping, peace 
building; on arms controls and disarmament; on forms of 
adjudication and redress for interstate conflicts; on reform of 
the UN's specialized economic, social and cultural agencies; on 
practical measures to strengthen co-operative security 
organizations; on improving multilateral development 
mechanisms to deal with chronic underdevelopment; on dealing 
with international ecological disasters; and on reacting to 
international population migrations.
<P>
	Obviously this list is not exhaustive, but it is indicative of the 
areas where the government believes Canada can help make a 
difference for the better. Now that the cold war is over we must 
continue to bring the nations of the world together in the pursuit 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2259"> 2259 </A></B>
<P>
of peace. We must continue to work on frameworks that will 
enable dialogue and co-operation between nations.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Lester Pearson said in accepting his Nobel peace prize in 
1957:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The best defence of peace is not power but the removal of the cause of war 
and international agreements which will put peace on a stronger foundation 
than the terror of destruction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada must review its geographic priorities in this new 
international context. The end of a world divided into two camps 
and the emergence of new economic powers have contributed to 
the development of regional groups. Regional institutions can 
benefit the international system in many ways. They are 
sometimes the best tool for economic development and 
mediation.
<P>
	We hope the growing power of certain countries will give 
them the necessary confidence and determination to promote 
co-operation between regions on a large number of international 
issues. We wish to establish strong ties that will enable us to 
initiate open and honest dialogue on our economic, social and 
political concerns, and on human rights in particular. However, 
these regions may form hostile and aggressive blocs. Canada has 
much to contribute in avoiding such a development.
<P>
	We Canadians know the importance of dialogue and 
co-operation. The government is determined to help the 
countries of the world to adopt this course. To this end,  we will 
have to review our priorities. We will maintain our relations 
with Europe because of our historical, cultural, political, 
economic and security ties with that part of the world, but we 
will also have to see how this new Europe will be affected by the 
growing development of the European union. This union will 
admittedly play an increasingly important role in Europe and 
lead North America, and Canada in particular, to reconsider its 
position in relation to the old world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is clear that North America will have to adjust its presence 
and influence in a Europe growing stronger and more united. 
Our political task in Europe today is building the economic and 
democratic structures and security of eastern and central Europe 
including Russia and Ukraine.
<P>
	The past election in Russia has confronted us with new 
challenges. The results of the upcoming elections in Ukraine 
could also be critical in determining that nation's progress. We 
have already mentioned our interest in developing a special 
relationship with Ukraine. I have already announced specific 
measures toward that goal.
<P>
	There is a great deal to be done. We will continue to work 
closely with our traditional allies and our new friends in Europe 
to promote security. However the respective roles of North 
America and Europe will gradually change. The transition will 
lead to a new relationship as rich and as harmonious as the one 
that saw us through the cold war, but it will be focused on new 
issues that reflect the new world environment.
<P>
	Canada is by geography a nation of the north. Our relations 
with the United States are of paramount importance to us. We 
have already established a businesslike atmosphere in which to 
pursue our many bilateral interests. We intend to keep it that 
way.
<P>
	The United States today is adapting to changed circumstances 
at home and abroad, and we share many of the same concerns. 
We believe Canadian experience, particularly our approach to 
multilateralism, can prove useful to the Americans as they 
develop new perspectives. We look forward to working 
constructively on the international scene with our neighbour.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	This however does not imply that we will jeopardize our 
concern and our interest so as to avoid disagreement between 
our two countries at any cost. This is what I have indicated very 
candidly and very forthrightly to my American counterpart, 
Warren Christopher, during my recent visit to Washington last 
month. I made Canada's concerns about efforts by a certain 
group in the U.S. to reduce our agriculture and other exports 
quite clear and unequivocal to him.
<P>
	I also indicated to Mr. Christopher that this government was 
determined to set its own independent course in foreign policy. 
By being independent I do not  mean that we are opposed to the 
American policy but that we want to see action being taken with 
a Canadian point of view in mind. Our hope to see the end of the 
American commercial embargo against Cuba is a clear 
affirmation of our wish. This is a point I discussed recently with 
my Mexican counterpart, Secretary Tello, when I visited Mexico 
as the head of the Canadian delegation to the bilateral joint 
ministerial committee.
<P>
	In the past Canada has been in the forefront of diplomatic 
initiatives. Canada recognized China before the Americans did 
and in a certain way paved the way to bring President Nixon to 
China and change substantially the relationship with this giant 
of Asia.
<P>
	We Canadians believe that we could play a very important 
role to bring about democracy and respect of human rights 
throughout the entire hemisphere. Canada will pursue 
vigorously such a policy in every area of the Caribbean, Central 
America and South America in co-operation with other 
countries. Certainly it will not be against the wish or the will of 
the Americans but in co-operation as a partner within the 
Organization of American States.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2260"> 2260 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is obvious that we must further develop our ties with Latin 
America. We are very enthusiastic about the possibility of 
creating a community that will include the entire Western 
Hemisphere, from the Canadian Arctic to Tierra del Fuego. The 
potential for our trade and investment is enormous. The 
trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement shows us the 
way to go. Many steps must be taken, however, before we can 
achieve such a community.
<P>
	We wish to encourage open and honest dialogue with our 
partners regarding our common and respective problems. 
Together, we must define the results we expect to achieve in 
order to clearly establish our priorities.
<P>
	The Organization of American States can play a decisive role 
in our hemispheric relations, and Canada wishes to make this 
organization more effective and dynamic.
<P>
	This government's creation of a position of Secretary of State 
responsible for Latin America is an indication of our interest in 
the region. My colleague, the hon. member for Northumberland, 
has already made two trips to Latin America to promote 
Canada's ties with its hemispheric partners. I will leave it to her 
to talk about our objectives in more detail. She is also 
responsible for Africa. It is in this latter capacity that she will 
lead the Canadian delegation to the election-monitoring 
mission in South Africa and visit some African countries to 
maintain our very close ties with that continent.
<P>
	The Asia-Pacific region has become a major economic power.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	As we stated in our red book, our economic prosperity partly 
depends on our determination to develop our  trade relations 
with the Pacific rim countries. We will work continually with 
our private-sector partners to increase export opportunities for 
our businesses.
<P>
	We also expect to see the region play an increasingly active 
role in politics and security as its economic power grows.
<P>
	To show the importance we attach to this area, we have also 
appointed a Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific. I know that the 
hon. member for Richmond has already taken initiatives to 
improve Canada's ties and exchanges with the countries of the 
region, and that he intends to explain them to you later in today's 
debate.
<P>
	With its west coast open to the Pacific, it is in Canada's 
interest to develop and diversify its economic and social ties 
with the countries of the region, as the Prime Minister 
demonstrated at the APEC summit in Seattle in November 1993.
<P>
	Canada's interests are worldwide, and we will continue to 
have an active foreign policy that reflects our interests. Over the 
years, Canada has played an important role in the quest for 
peace. We are actively participating in the Middle East peace 
process, and we chair the refugee working group.
<P>
	Last month, we chaired a meeting in Montebello to 
co-ordinate the work of all multilateral groups involved in the 
Middle East peace process.
<P>
	We are actively participating in South Africa's transition to 
democracy. Elsewhere in Africa, either bilaterally or as part of 
the Commonwealth and la Francophonie, we are actively 
working with governments and NGOs to contribute to the 
economic and democratic development of these countries.
<P>
	We will, of course, continue to be active around the world. In 
these days of budget constraints, however, we must restrict our 
scope of action. Changes in the world and in our own country are 
forcing us to make important choices.
<P>
	If we want to have a coherent and effective foreign policy, 
these choices must be guided by our desire to build regional and 
inter-regional mechanisms that will serve us well in the 
fast-approaching 21st century.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will remain globally active and committed but we cannot 
be everywhere in equal force any longer. That is very important. 
We could continue to be present but not everywhere with equal 
force. Change in the world and in our own capacity means that 
choices will be necessary. This parliamentary committee will 
have to help us make these choices and these priorities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, I would like to address the issue of human rights in 
our foreign policy. Some people would like to see a foreign 
policy aimed solely at promoting human rights and their values, 
while ignoring Canada's other interests. Others insist on a 
foreign policy that would serve only Canada's economic 
interests.
<P>
	It is far too easy and dangerous to simplify the debate in this 
manner. In so doing, we would only compromise this country's 
foreign policy. We must recognize that such a cut-and-dried 
version of the world is wrong. Of course, our economic interests 
are important. Of course, we want to promote human rights. 
Nevertheless, we do not have the right to impose one at the 
expense of the other. Insecurity, instability and war are 
detrimental to international trade. Human rights, democracy and 
good governance are the best defences of peace and security.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	History shows us that economic development and respect for 
human rights sometimes go hand in hand. Increased prosperity 
often triggers social change. When we talk about economic 
prosperity, we are also talking about international trade and 
investment. The development of international trade and 
investment is clearly vital to Canada. We depend on it for our 
own development, for job creation and for our economic 
recovery. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2261"> 2261 </A></B>
<P>
There is thus a complex interplay of values and interests, both in 
developing countries and here at home.
<P>
	Is there no way to better reflect our values and interests in our 
foreign policy? Is there no way to combine them? Can we build 
economic and political mechanisms that will show that the way 
to universal prosperity lies through fundamental rights for all?
<P>
	It is my profound belief that the concept of intervention as a 
right and a duty represents a turning point in the history of 
humankind. The world has only recently understood and 
accepted this concept which, to some, constitutes interfering in 
a country's domestic politics but to many others is a sign of 
hope.
<P>
	I say this because I have seen the results. In Haiti I spoke to 
Canadian members of religious orders who work in that country, 
and these quite remarkable people taught me that intervention 
could be a duty. Considering Canada's intervention capability, 
we cannot afford not to use that capability to advance the cause 
of human rights. We cannot remain indifferent to the fact that 
throughout the world, millions of human beings are being 
denied their most basic rights.
<P>
	Indifference is the modern barbarism, and we must therefore 
make every effort to advance the cause of democracy where we 
have an opportunity to do so as Canadians, because democracy 
remains the highest value, in the Northern snows and in the rice 
paddies, in the tall grasses of the savannas and the tropical rain 
forest, on the hot sand and in the desert. Everywhere, democracy 
remains the supreme value.
<P>
	And if democracy is to be truly synonymous with peace, we 
must support it through our foreign policy. Where there are 
democratic governments, these governments support the cause 
of peace and promote peace in the world. In a democratic 
system, there is respect for minority rights and human rights are 
protected.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	We must act as tireless promoters of democracy throughout 
the world, and in doing so, we will have an impact on world 
peace and security. This does not mean we must cut our political 
and economic ties with countries that do not respect democracy 
and human rights. If we isolate them, we will never be able to 
influence them. That is why I say, to those who insist that we 
make respect for human rights a pre-condition for our trading 
relations with certain countries, that they are on the wrong track.
<P>
	We must persevere in our efforts to advance the cause of 
democracy in countries where it does not exist. We must do so 
carefully and with respect but we must persevere. I believe that 
if we do, if we are determined, Canadian values will be 
appreciated and indeed emulated by these countries which we 
must help, not for the sake of their leaders but for the sake of 
their people who are suffering and who deserve a better life.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This brings me to our development assistance program. 
Canadians are proud of our development assistance record, but 
they are concerned about program delivery and the long term 
effectiveness of aid.
<P>
	The pressure for review of the aims and utility of the 
development assistance program is increasing as governments 
and societies struggle with deficit, debt and structural 
adjustment. The countries we assist are also coming under 
increasing pressures to provide proof that aid works and to show 
that the aid provides value. Developing countries will have to 
demonstrate they have or are prepared to adopt the social, 
political and economic policies that will maximize the impact of 
development assistance programs.
<P>
	The government's earlier policy statements recognized the 
interdependent relationships between developed and developing 
countries. There are those who argue that we should abandon our 
commitment to the developing world because we cannot make a 
difference. My answer to that is that we must make a difference 
or we will see the level of global insecurity, instability and 
uncertainty increase to our peril.
<P>
	We must work domestically and internationally with other 
donors to ensure that our assistance is applied coherently, 
consistently and to the maximum possible benefit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We believe economic and social development in developing 
countries is a basic element of our own security. The 
consequences of underdevelopment, such as uncontrolled 
population growth, environmental damage and mass human 
migrations, have a long term effect on our security. Perhaps 
even more dangerous than the threat of nuclear war is the gap 
between rich and poor on this planet, a gap that is widening 
steadily.  Unfortunately, the poor are very much aware of this 
situation.
<P>
	With the communications media we have today, we can no 
longer hide this fact.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	The people of the south who are suffering and destitute know 
that the people of the north live in wealth and opulence. If we 
cannot act to ensure that the people in the south benefit from the 
wealth of the north, we are going to have a very serious problem, 
because ultranationalist, extremist and fundamentalist 
movements will use this human misery to turn people against the 
richer countries and take advantage of this situation to become a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2262"> 2262 </A></B>
<P>
revolutionary force in the world. It is therefore imperative for us 
to collaborate with other partners and the world of poverty.
<P>
	I believe that when formulating our foreign policy, we must 
ask ourselves the following question: What kind of world do we 
want to live in?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In formulating a foreign policy, questions of Canada's future 
should never be separated from the wider question: What kind of 
world do we want? This will be the question that the members of 
the parliamentary committee will have to answer in formulating 
suggestions for our foreign policy. I look forward to receiving 
their views and advice in this regard.
<P>
	Let me indicate the kind of world I would like to live in. I 
dream of a world where there will be no more arms race, no more 
famine, and no more economic deprivation. I dream of a world 
where every child will go to school during the daytime in a safe 
environment and will go to bed at night well fed and in a decent 
home.
<P>
	This is obviously a dream. But Canada should work hard to 
make this dream come true. After all, great events, unthinkable a 
few years ago, have given rise to a renewal, a new sense of hope, 
and must inspire all of us as parliamentarians engaged in this 
democratic decision making process for this country.
<P>
	Nelson Mandela was released from his prison cell and now 
leads his party in South Africa's first democratic election. The 
Gdansk naval yard electrician and underground union leader, 
Lech Walesa, is now Poland's democratically elected president. 
A political prisoner and playwright, Vaclav Havel, is now the 
Czech republic president.
<P>
	This was unthinkable just a few years ago. But dreams came 
true.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I believe we must work hard to give Canada a foreign policy 
that meets our foreign aspirations and this includes maintaining 
our presence on the international scene, in accordance with a 
tradition of excellence that we will maintain in the future.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to thank the government for giving us this 
opportunity to address some very important issues that will most 
certainly generate some very interesting discussion in this 
House and in the committees that are formed to address the 
twenty-first century and determine the kind of relations we want 
to have with the rest of the world.
<P>
	I would say that I found the minister's approach to the 
problems and the issues facing us today most interesting. I felt 
there was a certain vigour in the approach to the future taken by 
the minister and the government, and I believe this augurs well 
for the coming series of extremely important discussions.
<P>
	We know that such discussions were long overdue and that it 
was very important to get this process under way. Tremendous 
changes have taken place within a very short period of time. In 
1989, we saw the Berlin wall crumble, and subsequently, 
everything that happened in the Soviet empire.
<P>
	These changes, and I assume we will have an opportunity to 
discuss them at length in committee so I will not describe them 
all today, are taking place as a result of two important facts. The 
first one is, of course, the end of the cold war, and as a result, the 
end of the polarized state of international relations which had 
lasted for several generations.
<P>
	However, the situation that existed before the present changes 
took place had the advantage of a certain simplicity. At the time, 
there were the good guys and the bad guys, and it was relatively 
easy to define Canada's role, for instance, in the struggle 
between the oppressors and the other side that wanted to liberate 
the oppressed and acted in the name of democracy. We all knew 
where we stood, so there was no need to sit down and wonder 
whether or not we would support the forces of democracy 
against stalinism.
<P>
	Today, things are not that simple. The fragmentation process 
had led to the emergence of many new players on the 
international scene, where conflicts have become far more 
diverse and complex. As far as Canada is concerned, the 
situation is a far cry from the problems that existed in the golden 
age of Canadian diplomacy, in the days of Lester B. Pearson, for 
instance. After World War II, in which Canada had fought on the 
side of the Allies and helped to win the war, Canada played a 
very important role and won the recognition of the whole world. 
The Canadian economy was in excellent shape.
<P>
	It was a time when there was no deficit and Canada's public 
finances were not in the vulnerable state they are now. When 
people talk about changes on the international scene, there have 
been changes that affected everyone, and these I mentioned 
earlier: the end of the cold war, the advent of many different 
players on the international scene, and so forth.
<P>
	However, for Canadians and Quebecers, there is a new 
dimension with respect to the international environment. We 
have a debt that exceeds $500 billion, 40 per cent of which is 
financed by foreign interests. When we speak of independence, 
we speak of a concept that is no longer the same. When one is 
grappling with $200 billion in debt financed abroad in the very 
short term, a new kind of vulnerability enters the picture and 
becomes one of a range of factors to be considered when the time 
comes to define our collective future in terms of our foreign 
relations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2263"> 2263 </A></B>
<P>
	Clearly, independence does not have the same connotation it 
had in Mr. Pearson's day. Mr. Pearson did not have to concern 
himself with the reaction of Canadian lenders. He did not have 
to worry about the reaction of those abroad who finance 
Canada's debt. He could, with full knowledge of the facts, 
define with his government and with Parliament the country's 
foreign policy directions which depended very little on the 
reaction of others, in any case, but certainly on the reaction of 
financial markets. Therefore, many questions arise and it is not 
my intention, or was it the intention of the minister, to suggest a 
set course for our foreign policy in the future. What we are 
beginning here is a process of reflection.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	This debate must fuel this process and provide an opportunity 
to formulate the major questions that we need to ask ourselves. 
Thus, we must devise a framework for action for the committees 
that will be sitting. The parameters must be more or less defined 
so that more specific proposals can be put forward.
<P>
	With your permission, I would like to identify a number of 
questions and problems that need to be resolved, new problems 
stemming from the changes that have taken place.
<P>
	The geopolitical changes alluded to carry enormous 
implications. For example, the end of the cold war has also 
signalled an end to ideology clashes. Today, few people in the 
world are arguing about who was right, Marx or Henry Ford. I 
am not saying that the issue is settled and that theorists now 
believe that Ford was right, but I will say that fewer and fewer 
people are interested in engaging in this kind of intellectual 
debate which, what is more, affected the political life of nations.
<P>
	In Europe, it was extraordinary; some societies were torn by 
these debates, even at the political level. We were not affected to 
the same extent but our American neighbours lived through the 
excesses of McCarthyism. That a great democracy like theirs 
could be sidetracked by the fears born out of the cold war shows 
the impact ideology had on the world scene.
<P>
	We ourselves witnessed the impact of Marxist-Leninist 
schools of thought and the emergence of various political 
movements on the evolution of life in Canada and particularly in 
Quebec. But it is now over in the sense that there is no longer any 
ideological war. We will not  see a Canadian Parliament or a 
Quebec or other provincial legislature divided between Marxists 
on one side and capitalists on the other. It is over. This 
ideological war has been replaced by-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Oh, 
Oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to continue my 
speech and deal with these issues at the appropriate level instead 
of responding to sarcastic comments from the other side. I am 
sorry, Mr. Speaker, but I would like the hon. member to be called 
to order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We all want to listen to what all hon. members 
have to say and we hope that we will be able to listen attentively 
to what the Leader of the Opposition is telling us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to sound 
presumptuous but the ideological war has been replaced 
throughout the world by a trade war. Competition is now at the 
centre of international concerns and has given birth to a very 
widespread anti-protectionist movement. We saw that the 
GATT has been reopened, that free-trade movements are 
gaining momentum and that we, in North America, are at the 
cutting edge of this trend, having taken concrete action and 
signed with our great American neighbour and now with Mexico 
a free-trade agreement that will be extended, we hope, to other 
countries of this hemisphere. Chile may be the next country to 
apply; the last treaty that was signed contains an admission 
clause. Some very important changes have taken place.
<P>
	All these changes have created new problems. For instance, 
since international economic development erases borders, 
economic boundaries will become the fundamental criteria on 
which international movements will be based. There are dangers 
on the horizon. For example, it is not a coincidence that concern 
for the environment surfaced at the same time as the trend 
towards global economic development. People saw another 
threat to the environment. We saw that if economic development 
becomes the rule, we must find ways to subject it, for example, 
to the constraints of sustainable development. Develop the 
economy, sure. Create a huge area transcending political 
boundaries for the movement of goods and services and capital, 
sure. But not at the price of increasing the pressure on this planet 
and our environmental heritage to meet such demands. 
Economic development should not mean killing our forests with 
clear-cutting, allowing our rivers and lakes to be polluted with 
toxic substances for the sake of market globalization or clearing 
our rivers and the oceans of fish. When you see what is 
happening on the coasts of Newfoundland for instance, it is 
obvious that economic development is not a cure-all and that 
such factors will have to be taken into account as we consider 
and develop our foreign policy.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	There are other risks as well. Who will benefit from this 
economic development? If we are not careful, is there not a risk 
that only the mighty will gain? Is it not to assert the ``survival of 
the fittest'' principle in a new way to allow unrestricted, 
unrestrained economic development and trade? We must 
therefore look for ways of making all of this work. We are in 
favour of free trade. We know this is the way of the future, but 
we must make sure large, powerful nations are not the only ones 
to gain. So, we have to ensure that we too, in Canada and in 
Quebec, can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2264"> 2264 </A></B>
<P>
benefit from this arrangement and that the mighty, such as Japan 
and the USA are not the only ones that stand to gain from this.
<P>
	We must look for solutions. What can be done? I will come 
back to this in a minute. But there is a risk. If commercial 
interest becomes the golden rule, what will become of the third 
world? The minister mentioned earlier the widening gap 
between developing countries and ours. That is a fact we are 
aware of, but mentioning it does not solve the problem, 
especially since the Western economy, the have nations are 
largely responsible for this problem. Take our international 
development programs for example. We did spend a lot of 
money on supporting development efforts abroad. Yet, the gap 
widened. On the whole, we can see that what we have given third 
world, developing countries in terms of assistance is less than 
what we have gained from that investment in terms of 
commercial interest.
<P>
	So, if market globalization means allowing free trade without 
taking any of that into consideration, there is a risk. A new 
economic order is required. So we must think about it here in our 
country and take concrete action to provide a minimum structure 
not only for making speeches deploring the widening gap 
between south and north but also for ensuring ways to remedy 
the deficiencies which we have observed.
<P>
	Another very obvious problem also arises. Since international 
relations are no longer governed by two superpowers 
confronting each other, we have witnessed a great increase in the 
number of players on the international stage. I believe that the 
UN now recognizes 175 sovereign countries. Some claim that 
there may be nearly 200 or 275 by the end of the millennium in a 
few years. And it goes on. It goes on because the small and 
middle powers who had little say now have the opportunity to 
act themselves-it is no longer just a monologue between the 
Soviet empire and the Americans. It is growing because the 
natural lines of force have resurfaced. As the imperial structures 
break up like the Soviet Union, we see nationalism coming to the 
surface again, this old nationalist feeling which sets political 
boundaries. So there will be more participants in international 
life.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	What should we do about it? Obviously the situation is more 
complex than it was. It has become more difficult  than it was in 
Mr. Pearson's time, for example. It is no longer a question only 
of managing a relationship with two players confronting each 
other; now it is a matter of establishing a certain order in 
relations among nearly 200 actors. Imagine all the permutations 
of bilateral relations.
<P>
	There are two dangers there. First is the danger of disorder 
and disorder leads to threats to peace. We finally realize now 
that in this tense face-off that we lived with during the cold war, 
there was a sort of stability, the stability of deterrence; we know 
how we learned to live with it and it worked in a way that 
prevented direct confrontation between the two superpowers.
<P>
	Now we are hundreds and it is not so easy, especially since 
there are many more sources of conflict and I would say in a 
way, paradoxically, that the conflicts are somewhat less rational 
since they involve religious, territorial or ethnic conflicts. 
Sometimes the irrational takes the upper hand so that the sources 
of tension and threats to peace are increased. They may be less 
serious because those countries are not armed with the 
destructive capacity that the nuclear powers confronting each 
other had, but there is still a danger.
<P>
	The other danger is standardization. As you lower economic 
barriers and have one large area where all kinds of goods can 
move around, cultures also circulate, but which cultures? The 
issue has been raised and I think that we will have to discuss it 
thoroughly in committee. Cultural and identity issues will 
become more important than ever, because it is dangerous to 
have a standardized culture take over national identities. The 
one thing everyone needs when confronted with an intrusive 
culture is to have familiar anchor points.
<P>
	It is here that the debate will have to take place regarding the 
concept of nationalism. I know that this concept has often been 
debated in this House. It has also been the subject of a recent 
debate in the Senate. Not long ago, I read a speech on the word 
nationalism made by a senator from the other place, and I think 
such a debate will have to take place because there are all kinds 
of nationalisms.
<P>
	I was pleased to see earlier the minister allude in his speech to 
the emergence of this element in international relations and 
refer to ultranationalism. The minister talked about the bad 
consequences of ultranationalism, including the resulting 
intolerance, while in the copies distributed a little earlier the 
word nationalism and not ultranationalism was used. There is a 
big difference, because those two concepts are opposite.
<P>
	I want to remind the House that not everybody thinks the same 
about nationalism. In fact, there are all kinds of nationalisms. It 
is somewhat like the comment made by the Greek poet Aesop 
when, referring to the human language, he said that it was the 
source of all evil but also the source of all good. It all depends on 
how you use it.
<P>
	I want to refer to a speech made by Mr. Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, the current UN Secretary-General, in  Montreal, 
on May 24, 1992. If you will allow me, I would like to quote two 
excerpts of this speech made by the UN Secretary General, in 
which he wonders about the different connotations of what we 
call nationalism. He begins with this quote: ``The best 
contribution one can make to the world is oneself'', which is 
from the French writer Paul Claudel.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2265"> 2265 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Boutros-Ghali goes on to say: ``To enter into a relation 
with someone else, you must first be yourself. This is why a 
sound globalization of modern life is based on strong identities, 
since the globalization of a standardized culture could crush 
other cultures and melt them together, something from which 
the world has nothing to gain''.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	In order to communicate you must have something to 
communicate: To have a dialogue, you must have something to 
say. So, when you are present on the international scene and you 
want to transmit your culture to others, as the minister 
mentioned earlier when he said that he intends to spread our 
cultural values abroad, you have to know that culture. You have 
to preserve it, because it must exist. In other words, our identity 
must be affirmed at some level in our rapport with others abroad.
<P>
	Mr. Boutros-Ghali also said this: ``Each individual needs an 
intermediary between the universe which is greater than he is 
and his solitary condition, if only because he needs a source 
language to understand and decipher the outside world. An 
individual needs practical interdependences as well as a set of 
cultural references; in short, he needs an access code to the 
world. It is in the context of those needs that nation-states 
operate, in the sense that they go beyond the immediate 
interdependences of family, clan and village. A nation is a 
common will to live together which is the first step towards 
universal civilization. In today's world, if you destroy nations, 
you will not have a vast universal solidarity; rather, you will 
have tribes and primary links, whether ethnic or religious, such 
as in Somalia or in Yugoslavia. You will also have super states to 
exploit or dominate the former''.
<P>
	There is such a thing as chauvinistic nationalism, the 
ghetto-building kind, which is turned inwards. There is also the 
kind that produces great nations, like the United States, France, 
Great Britain, Germany, Spain and Russia, people who live their 
identity through political structures adapted to their needs and 
concerns and their relation with the rest of the world, and who in 
the process become assets to civilization. Nationalism, if 
properly understood, is a link to the universal. It is the bridge 
between the individual and the universal, between the individual 
and others.
<P>
	No one will ever say anything against nations as such. Canada 
can hardly criticize nations because it is one. There is in English 
Canada a nation which to me consists of people who have a 
culture and language in common,  people who speak English and 
have an anglophone culture, and the majority of whom occupy 
the rest of Canada.
<P>
	In Quebec, there is a nation, predominantly francophone with 
a francophone culture, which has a francophone vision of the 
world but at the same time is linked through its language to a 
universal language, French, just as anglophones are connected 
by English. That is what culture is about. Culture is a way to 
reach the universal from what one happens to be, and we are not 
all the same. We are not all the same as individuals, and we are 
not all the same as communities.
<P>
	In Canada, the problem is we have two communities. We have 
two groups that define themselves according to different 
elements. The basic elements in this case are language and 
culture. As long as we have not resolved this problem, we will 
have to live with the political consequences.
<P>
	To support what I just said, I would like to refer to a passage 
from a report on UN activities, covering the forty-seventh 
session of the UN General Assembly and dated September 1993. 
I am not quoting a pathological nationalist but people who live 
at the apex of the pyramid of world diplomacy and know 
everything about relations between nations and countries. I will 
quote two short passages: ``Individuals find their identity in a 
nation. Nations find their identity in universality. There can be 
no international communities without nations. Hence, the 
so-called incompatibility between the nationalist and the 
internationalist perspective is merely an illusion''. A second 
and last passage from the same page: ``Sovereignty is the art of 
making unequal powers equal''.
<P>
	I think that in the course of the discussions we will have in 
these committees, which should be held at the appropriate level, 
we will have to examine these issues, because the Canadian 
problem, the problem of relations between Quebec and Canada, 
the problem of our two nations, is, in my opinion, not unique. It 
is a universal problem. It can be found at the centre of all 
international relations, and if we are to define a new 
international policy without taking this into consideration, it 
will not be long before we have to start the review process all 
over again.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Earlier on, I spoke of the international disorder to which we 
become vulnerable when fragmentation occurs among players. 
We cannot oppose or prevent this phenomenon because there is 
some good to it, namely that it reflects reality and the will of the 
people. To this extent, we must respect it.
<P>
	However, it increases the need for international relations 
which are more multilateral in nature. Fewer relations will be of 
the bilateral kind. Major international organizations will be 
called upon to play an increasingly important role. This is 
especially true of the UN which will become increasingly 
important, even essential.
<P>
	Within this community of several hundred sovereign nations, 
there will have to be forum in which discussion can take place, 
general policies formulated, ideas on common values shared and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2266"> 2266 </A></B>
<P>
peacekeeping operations conducted. I believe that the UN will 
increasingly be called upon to serve as this forum.
<P>
	Here in Canada, we are facing a dilemma, as the minister 
alluded to a while ago in his speech. Our dilemma stems from 
Canada's geographic location as described by the minister. Our 
country borders on three oceans and is open to the Atlantic and 
to the Pacific. We also have the United States as our neighbour. 
And, although it is true that we must participate more and more 
in multilateral relations, that is relations where everyone speaks 
within a common international organization such as the UN, we 
cannot overlook the United States.
<P>
	We are fortunate to have the United States as a neighbour. We 
have to recognize that this country is a considerable asset to 
Canada. We also enjoy one of the highest standards of living in 
the world and this is due, at least in part, to the fact that we are 
part of the vast North American continent which has an 
extremely prosperous economy. We should not lose sight of the 
fact that the United States are on the receiving end of 80 per cent 
of our exports.
<P>
	Let us not forget that Ontario's economic development is 
closely tied to the Auto Pact. Let us not forget that the United 
States are vitally important to us. Most of our large companies 
that succeed are based on US capital. We must not forget this. In 
some ways, it will be impossible for us to avoid having bilateral 
relations with the United States. In our committees, we will have 
to find a balance.
<P>
	So, I say yes to the UN and yes to multi-faceted relations with 
all international players. Obviously. There must be a more open 
relationship with Asia and Europe, too often forgotten in 
discussions at the Lester B. Pearson Building. But our 
relationship with the United States calls for a very delicate 
balancing act. I think there is a lot of work to do in this area.
<P>
	I do not want to take too long, as my colleagues will speak 
after me. I think we can draw a few conclusions anyway. The 
first one is that we have the nation and we have the individual 
and that the individual now has a place in international life. In 
the past, we did not talk much about the individual in 
international relations but that has changed. We are now talking 
about it to the point of invoking the duty to intervene, as the 
minister was saying, in sovereign foreign countries that violate 
human rights.
<P>
	I think that our policy should be centred on promoting 
individual rights. We must also realize that there can be no valid 
policy on individual rights without a national policy. 
Individuals form communities. It is very difficult to separate 
one from the other. Communities bring us to the subject of 
democracy. Democracy and human rights  are, of course, the 
foundations of the international policies we must define 
together.
<P>
	If we are looking for a role that Canada can play, it is to 
continue to promote democracy in concrete terms at the 
international level. To travel, for example, to the site of an 
election so that foreigners can benefit from the expertise of 
Elections Canada in this field. The Director General of Elections 
in Quebec also provides expertise and advice abroad. We must 
actively participate in operations like that in Eritrea, where we 
have to ensure that the referendum on access to sovereignty is 
held in a democratic fashion.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	The second conclusion is that we must respect democratic 
rights everywhere. We must recognize the democratic decisions 
made by others in an appropriate framework under criteria we 
deem compatible with democratic principles.
<P>
	Third, we must define methods of intervention. This is not 
easy because the concept of security has changed, too. For a very 
long time, security was seen as the need to protect ourselves 
against foreign military attacks or invasions. I would venture to 
say that the whole Canadian defense system is directed at the 
North where the threat has almost disappeared. So we must 
rethink all this and look at the new, very insidious threats to 
security, in particular social inequities.
<P>
	The problems of overpopulation, illiteracy and poverty 
throughout the world will exert very strong pressure on 
immigration and create a gap so large that it could lead to all 
kinds of disasters. There is also the issue of the environment. In 
a way, the environmental issue is a matter of territorial integrity 
or should I say ecological integrity. In that context, the enemy is 
not only others but ourselves mainly. We are the first ones to 
pollute our lakes and rivers and to clearcut our forests. We are. 
So, a totally new concept of environmental safety and 
environmental threat is required.
<P>
	As for the extremely important but sensitive issue raised by 
the minister, namely the right or duty to interfere, I think that 
refinements will nonetheless be required, absolutely, in certain 
cases. Which ones? Not everybody should have the right to 
interfere and arbitrariness should not be the rule. The nation 
exercising the right to interfere should not be the one setting the 
conditions under which it can be exercised. I think there should 
be an international process. It is imperative, in my opinion, that 
some screening be done, by the United Nations say, to determine 
when, how and by whom this right can be exercised. I would not 
want superpowers to decide for themselves where and when they 
can use it.
<P>
	Of course it is understood that the intent is to promote human 
rights, but as we have seen, selective use can be made of this 
right. We all saw how quick we were to intervene in Kuwait 
against Iraq. Why was that? Because there was oil under the 
desert. In other cases, we were not so quick, in Yugoslavia for 
example. We had to be  reminded often of the horrors happening 
in Sarajevo before we took slightly more drastic actions. Much 
remains to be done. That is what we see happening in Sarajevo, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2267"> 2267 </A></B>
<P>
but similar things are happening elsewhere in Bosnia, in other 
enclaves, where there are no TV cameras, and perhaps because 
there are no cameras.
<P>
	So, yes to the right to interfere, but let us beware of facile 
enthusiasm where the obligations and conditions involved 
would be overlooked.
<P>
	Finally, about the conclusions to be drawn, I would say that 
some targeting will have to be done because the minister was 
quite ambitious in his speech. He gave a very broad outline of 
what Canada should do, what its role should be in this world. 
That is all very fine, but there is a need to target our action to be 
more efficient. I think that very delicate and important work has 
to be done in that area too and that it should be done in 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, we should be aware of the fact that one of the 
radical changes in the international environment is that foreign 
affairs are no longer foreign affairs. Foreign affairs are very 
much internal affairs.
<P>
	When we speak about the creation of jobs in Canada, and we 
badly need to create jobs, we should know that we will never be 
able to create the jobs we need if we do not have the kind of 
international trade activity we need. More than 25 per cent of 
Canada's standard of living is earned through our exports. It is 
much less in Japan where it is about 12 per cent. It means that we 
have to be very active abroad. We have to be innovative. We 
have to implement a very positive relationship with the rest of 
the world in order to be competitive so we have a very intimate 
blend of domestic and international issues.
<P>
	It would be the same when we talk about the question of 
identity. The identity question, which we thought was a 
domestic issue, is a very strong one all over the world right now. 
We believed it was only a question in Quebec but it is not. It is 
also a question for Canada because Canada will be a big player 
in the globalization of the economy. As such, Canada will be 
threatened by invading cultures. English Canadians will have to 
be very vigilant to protect their own identity. Quebec will have 
to do the same thing.
<P>
	There is quite a rapprochement of issues, whether 
international or domestic. The fact that we have such a huge 
deficit should be in our minds when we address those questions. 
We might have great ambitions as far as Canada's role, 
visibility, presence, prestige and involvement in peacekeeping 
missions in the world are concerned but do we have the means? 
We should take a hard look at that. Until we redress the mess we 
have in our public finances we will not be able to play any real 
role in the world.
<P>
	The government should be very vigilant and realistic and 
clean up our domestic mess before thinking we can be present all 
over the world. We cannot do that. We cannot sustain an army. 
We cannot fight the environmental threats with the finances we 
have. The government is now trying to sweep it under the carpet 
but we all know that the deficit is a terrible one. It is a cancer 
eating up the country. If we do not address it, all those exercises 
and features are useless.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to conclude with two reservations that we in the 
Bloc Quebecois have about the process, not about the content.
<P>
	The first reservation is that we are concerned that two 
processes are going on in parallel, the defence committee and 
the foreign affairs committee, to review fundamental 
government policies.
<P>
	However, the two are closely related. I would say that they 
belong together. We cannot define one without defining the 
other. The ties are so close that we are worried about having two 
different operations going on parallel tracks, especially since 
the deadline for producing reports is not the same in both cases. 
The left hand does not seem to know what the right hand is doing 
and it is impossible to define a foreign policy without including 
the basic elements of a defence policy; similarly, it is impossible 
to define a sensible defence policy without harmonizing it with a 
foreign policy.
<P>
	It all goes together. In reality, there is only one policy. We will 
have four groups working: a group from the House on defence, a 
group for foreign policy, and two joint committees that overlap 
the previous two and will consider the same things, without 
co-ordination and without having to present their reports at the 
same time. I find that very disturbing. I wonder where we are 
going with that. We risk scattering our efforts and fragmenting 
our thinking, which will not lead to as logical and coherent a 
conclusion as we might wish.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	My second concern is the creation of joint committees. First, 
two committees of the House already exist. I think that is quite 
enough, in terms of cost and consistency and efficiency, and now 
we add joint committees with representatives from the Senate.
<P>
	The Bloc will vote against the resolution. We want to form a 
committee where we can work, an effective committee of 
elected members who democratically represent Canada, Quebec 
and the various provinces, not unelected senators who are 
appointed for life by an order in council, a stroke of the pen, and 
do not represent the people.
<P>
	By their presence, the senators will make the committees 
more cumbersome, increase expenses and drag out the 
discussions, because they are not so in tune with the 
contemporary 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2268"> 2268 </A></B>
<P>
everyday reality of electoral democracy; it is not really worth 
knowing what the  senators think. We can do anything and not 
bother about what the senators think.
<P>
	I am convinced that it is a very serious mistake to involve 
senators in these committees. Elected people should do the job. 
We are mandated to do so and I am sorry that the government 
decided to include them. I would like the government to rethink 
this matter, because then we could vote with it on forming a 
committee of people who should really deal with these 
important issues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would advise members 
in the House and particularly those following in the gallery or 
elsewhere that while the first two speakers, the hon. minister 
and the hon. Leader of the Official Opposition, had unlimited 
time and no question or comment period, we will now enter the 
next stage of the debate pursuant to Standing Order 43.
<P>
	I will recognize the member for Red Deer who will now 
proceed with a 20-minute intervention followed by 10 minutes 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, initially I would like 
to say that we are very strongly in favour of this proposed review 
of foreign affairs and international trade.
<P>
	Canada needs a new foreign affairs policy that is more 
flexible and able to meet current issues quickly and effectively. 
The review must bring us to a foreign affairs position which 
allows us to leap into the 21st century.
<P>
	If Canada wants to regain its middle power role in 
international relations in the post-war period, it must a choose 
particular global issue and then diligently follow that issue to its 
end, utilizing our solid skills and resources. This will make 
Canada's influence felt. There are simply too many current 
issues for Canada to be involved in each.
<P>
	Before getting into some of the details of what I feel this 
review should incorporate, let me outline how I intend to deal 
with this issue today. First, I would like to evaluate the process 
itself. I would like to look at the forces that I see operating in the 
world. Then I would like to look at the specific areas that this 
review should cover and, finally, what the goals should be of this 
whole process.
<P>
	Regarding the process itself, while agreeing with the need for 
review and modernization I would like to make several 
comments about the process itself. First of all, there is the 
involvement of the Senate. I was very pleased to hear the last 
speaker agree with our position on involvement of the Senate. 
We feel this will greatly weaken our ability to present a policy 
that is truly representative of the people and one that will be 
accepted by the people.
<P>
	The Senate is not accepted by the grassroots of Canada and I 
would defy any member here to disagree with that. The public 
view is one of being a bunch of members  overpaid, big 
spenders, political appointments, no credibility, no 
accountability and no constituents to represent.
<P>
	The international view is much the same. It is a position that 
cannot even be explained. They are not elected. They have no 
credentials other than political. They are out of touch and they 
have no constituents. Their only role is as consultants and 
advisers but not as equal participants. This will immediately 
affect the credibility of this review. It may be seen as just 
another unrepresentative political study to be put on the shelf.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The argument given by the minister as to why we should 
include them was simply that they may duplicate the effort and 
the cost. My answer to that would be let them do that. Let them 
carry out their own study. I submit that it would be like the 
$6,000 Senator raise. The public would hold them accountable.
<P>
	In the area of travel, I believe it is justified for the 
subcommittee to travel. I believe it is a very strong point to go 
out and get the views of the grassroots and let them speak on this 
very important matter.
<P>
	Canadian policy should not be defined by diplomatic 
relations. It should not mirror what the consultants and what the 
political people want. It should be from the people. Direct 
democracy methods need to be instituted and this is a good way 
to do it. Consult Canadians directly. If you do not do that, at least 
go to the elected members.
<P>
	On public hearings, while the need for consultation is vital in 
developing a credible Canadian foreign policy, there must be a 
constant vigilance by the committee to avoid being over 
influenced by the many very efficient and sophisticated lobby 
groups which have been catered to in the past by previous 
governments. These hearings could easily become a honey pot, 
attracting a disproportionate number of special interest groups 
to the exclusion of many grassroots Canadians. A special effort 
should be made to hear the concerns and desires of the majority 
of Canadians.
<P>
	The timeframe I think also has to be dealt with. While all of us 
would deplore a study which might drag on, it is important to 
note that this foreign affairs policy document must be open to 
change. This policy must be designed to take into account the 
constantly changing world in which we now find ourselves. I ask 
members to think back just a few years: Who would have 
forecast such major changes as the end of the cold war, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2269"> 2269 </A></B>
<P>
collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Berlin wall and so 
many other economic changes that have occurred all around us?
<P>
	What are the major factors that are operating in the world that 
must be considered? The department of foreign affairs and 
international trade needs to be able to explain its relevance to 
the Canadian public. The Canadian people must think of foreign 
affairs and  international trade as a way for us to enter the new 
era and play an important middle power role.
<P>
	There have been an enormous number of changes on the world 
scene. Let us examine just a few of them. Let us start off with 
some of the political ones. Of course the most notable is the end 
of the cold war. Predictability is gone and now we have a rise of 
international, religious and ethnic wars which have plagued us 
in the past but were suppressed by the cold war. Of course we 
could talk about examples such as Iran, Iraq, Israel, Ireland, the 
Baltics, the former Soviet Union and many parts of Africa.
<P>
	We have as well on the scene Zhirinovsky, the wild card, the 
possible threat to eastern Europe. That must be considered in all 
of our deliberations, the growing gap between north and south, 
between rich and poor, and the lack of a real solid superpower or 
are there other superpowers which are going to rise and become 
a problem to world peace.
<P>
	Second, we have to look at globalization. This is possibly one 
of the most important phenomena occurring in the world today. 
Globalization is moving Canada toward an alignment with the 
western hemisphere and away from the alignment with Europe. 
It is clear that our military presence in Europe is not essential to 
Canada-Europe economic ties. Canada will succeed in the 
European market on the strength of its diplomats and 
entrepreneurs, not its soldiers.
<P>
	It is likely therefore that Canadian-European defence policy 
will now be one that integrates its European interest into a more 
global co-operation and security force, possibly using the 
United Nations.
<P>
	Having said this we should re-evaluate our policy 
commitment to NATO and NORAD to determine if these 
alignments are in the best interest of Canada in 1994 and 
beyond. Globalization is also moving Canada away from the 
European trade links and toward the western hemisphere and the 
Pacific rim. Furthermore, with the European Economic 
Community coming into place, Canada needs to secure its trade 
position within North America. The Canadian-American 
position is without a doubt the most important bilateral 
relationship in Canadian foreign policy. This is especially true 
with regard to the FTA, NAFTA and a possible future 
strengthening of the OAS to a level comparable to the EEC.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	While the western hemisphere is of utmost importance to 
Canadian trade, we must carefully evaluate our future trade in 
light of all the alternatives. We must look to the assortment of 
possible trade alignments, especially in the Pacific where we 
will have to work hard to overcome our reputation as a small 
player.
<P>
	While this is a highly competitive market, it is one in which 
we can successfully expand and do well. Some of our Canadian 
entrepreneurs are already leading the way.
<P>
	Third, we have environmental concerns. The environment 
must also be addressed at the national and international levels. 
The continuing dangers of ozone depletion, loss of species, 
accumulation of hazardous waste, loss of arable land all become 
serious potential international crises. This will be a particularly 
difficult issue for Canada.
<P>
	On issues such as the forests in Brazil, Canada has asked that 
other countries begin a process of sustainable development in a 
way that mirrors our national plan. Unfortunately for some 
countries, this becomes an issue of environment versus 
development. Likewise, these countries look for financial 
assistance from the north to offset their development losses. 
Currently Canada cannot afford to provide this assistance in 
light of our present domestic economic situation.
<P>
	Failure to address these environmental concerns will greatly 
handicap our ability as a country and, more significantly, the 
world in total to move ahead with normal sustainable 
development.
<P>
	Fourth, we have to look at the world population. With 
shrinking fiscal resources our ability to help in the ongoing 
problem of overpopulation only worsens. However, it is 
essential that efforts continue to try and control this overriding 
world problem.
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund must also be considered. 
Putting our domestic affairs in order is of obvious importance to 
our international affairs. We must remember that our public and 
private international indebtedness is the highest of any G-7 
country. If the IMF is forced to become involved in our domestic 
policy, we would suffer a major setback in our international 
reputation. This threat remains as long as we fail to deal with our 
rising debt and deficit.
<P>
	Next I would like to talk about the areas that I and we as a 
party feel should be reviewed and covered in this overall look at 
foreign affairs policy.
<P>
	First, what is the role of Canada in the world? In response to 
the new challenges of global competition, environmental 
problems, emerging nation states, in a time of shrinking fiscal 
resources and greater political uncertainty, what role should we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2270"> 2270 </A></B>
<P>
play in the world? We must target effectively those areas in 
which we can be leaders and target areas in which we can build a 
domestic pride inside Canada and a reputation as leaders 
internationally.
<P>
	Canada can play a leadership role as a major middle power, 
not by big spending and glitzy, showy consulates, not by being 
me too U.S. followers but by being ourselves; hard working, 
reliable, good managers of money and people. This is one area 
of government where we really can recreate a national pride 
which has been tarnished by recent governments.
<P>
	What about our foreign affairs and international trade 
department? The operation of this department must be part of 
our evaluation. We must be sure that some basic criteria are 
followed. The group must be efficiently  managed. Emphasis on 
Canadian strong points are of most importance.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	A lean mean group of dedicated, highly motivated individuals 
is critical. The group must be flexible in this rapidly changing 
environment. Cost must always be uppermost. 
Overexpenditures and waste will not be tolerated by the public 
any longer.
<P>
	We also have to ask if privatization is feasible. Another 
speaker will discuss this further. We must get more for less from 
this department.
<P>
	Two of my colleagues will be discussing the area of 
peacekeeping further. Conflict resolution must be seen as an 
international growth industry with new hotspots continually 
emerging. We must enhance our reputation as international 
peacekeepers.
<P>
	Furthermore I advocate using our conflict management 
experience to create international peacekeeping centres to train 
other countries in effective peacekeeping. International training 
would not only bring in funds but it would also present us as a 
world power and would allow us to use some of our abandoned 
military bases.
<P>
	In the area of trade, Canada is a trading nation. One of my 
colleagues will be developing this topic further a little later. We 
must remember however that only by developing our position in 
international trade will we truly be leading into the 21st century.
<P>
	The role of the United Nations has been discussed. There is 
reason to question the current ability of the financial and 
political capabilities of this whole organization. The UN's 
administration and guidelines that shaped international reaction 
must be reviewed. Therefore we support the call for a United 
Nations charter review conference in 1995.
<P>
	With respect to the issue of Quebec in the short term we must 
review the ramifications to Canada internationally should the 
Bloc Quebecois and Party Quebecois realize their goal of 
separation.
<P>
	Specifically we must look at trade and trade agreements as 
well as the international treaties. Quebec would have to 
renegotiate some 170 treaties with the U.S. alone, including the 
FTA. Also to be considered would be Canada's international 
position with the absence of Quebec.
<P>
	There are many other areas that should be examined. Some of 
our future speakers will be discussing such things as CIDA and 
the whole foreign aid situation and certainly the area of human 
rights. I will leave those issues to them.
<P>
	Finally, what should be the goals of our review and of our 
subsequent foreign policy that we will be developing?
<P>
	This review should cover all of Canada's affairs outside our 
borders such that all other related reviews and agencies can 
focus their policies and concerns solely on Canada's domestic 
situation. The last speaker mentioned  there are many studies 
going on. We must focus these studies and this one particularly. 
Conflicting points of view in this area will do nothing but send 
the wrong signals to our international partners.
<P>
	The goals can be summarized simply: First, to raise the 
profile of Canada as a truly influential middle power player on 
the world scene. Second, a policy which will allow us to move 
our human and capital resources on to the world scene quickly to 
take full advantage of opportunities presented by new 
technologies or new demands. Third, send a message to 
government, business and labour that we are open for business 
and that co-operation will be the only way to open and enlarge 
our status on the international scene. Finally, a policy of aid 
based on respecting human rights and basic democratic 
principles and on our ability to help those who want to help 
themselves.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party look forward to working with other 
members to achieve a truly representative foreign affairs policy 
to serve Canada well into the 21st century.
<P>
	Given my comments, I move the following amendment to the 
motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a) Deleting in paragraph one the word ``joint'' and the words ``and the

<P>

<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	We do this to complete the review and allow it to be more 
effective, more cost effective and more meaningful as a 
Canadian foreign affairs policy.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment is 
deemed acceptable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will just 
speak briefly, mostly on the amendment proposed by the Reform 
Party. I will say that we, Quebecers, have the same concerns 
about the involvement of the Senate, that we should call the 
other place, I believe, when we refer to it in the House. I am 
totally in agreement with the amendment which would remove 
any mention of that other place.
<P>
	I think that the government-as the leader of the opposition 
was saying a moment ago-is putting two trains on different 
tracks, and we do not know where they are heading. There is 
already a committee on defence, and then a joint committee on 
defence policy was agreed to a few weeks ago. There is a House 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
and now we want to set up a joint committee. I agree that the 
other chamber does not need to sit on the committee, does not 
have to be part of our reflection, because it does not have a 
democratic mandate. The leader of our party said so in his 
speech. We certainly are in favour of a review of our foreign 
policy, as it is necessary, but it should be done by a committee of 
the House only.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	In that sense, the amendment of the Reform Party is certainly 
desirable. I hope we will do without this relic of colonialism that 
we call the other place and that is made up of people without a 
democratic mandate, people who sit there as a political favour, 
former fund raisers for the two main parties, the Liberals and the 
Conservatives. There is no reason why these people should be 
involved in defining our foreign policy. There are enough 
elected members, including 205 newly elected ones, who have 
something to say. I could say too that expanding a committee or 
creating a parallel one is a waste of money.
<P>
	I wish to congratulate the hon. member for introducing this 
amendment. I share his views on the relevance of senators in this 
committee and also on cost, since increasing the number of 
members would increase the cost should the committee be 
called upon to travel. This, in my opinion, is a shameful waste of 
money and, as far as we are concerned, we would rather see the 
Senate abolished that have it participate to committees.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly I appreciate 
that support. As I mentioned in my speech we feel very strongly 
about it. I trust many of the members on the other side will agree 
that the other place does not need to be represented. We certainly 
look forward to the vote on that item.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
enjoyed the presentation of the member for Red Deer.
<P>
	One thing that made me very happy was his indication that 
Canada should identify its role by being what we are. We are 
good money managers and I thank him for that recognition.
<P>
	He also made reference to Mr. Zhirinovsky. About a month 
back I read an article in one of the papers about how Mr. 
Zhirinovsky was carving out his own version of Europe, 
chopping borders here and there. Today as we are dealing with a 
global economy we need to bring rest within our trading partners 
and throughout.
<P>
	How do we deal with those issues when we have comments 
such as those where at the utterance of one word we could create 
stability or instability? How do we address those types of 
outbursts from people such as Zhirinovsky?
<P>
	How do we force new players in this world which is unfolding 
before us almost daily? How do we recognize newly formed 
countries? Do we set preconditions? Do we ask them to come to 
the table and before handing out any blank cheques say that we 
should resolve those differences before recognizing them? How 
would we address those types of comments?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, this points out what we 
have pointed out a number of times in the past. That is we must 
have a little bit of a go slow attitude when it comes to reacting to 
certain individuals and what has happened in those unstable 
places like the Soviet Union.
<P>
	I heard an interesting comment from a speaker yesterday. It 
was that in Russia the Reagan poodle has died and we are now 
waiting to find out whether a Rottweiler or a Labrador retriever 
will take over the country. I particularly like that interesting 
analogy.
<P>
	I agree that the poodle is dead. I wonder whether Mr. 
Zhirinovsky is the Rottweiler. His answer was that for a number 
of reasons he is not. There are other people to fear in that area. In 
particular to the Soviet Union, there is a rise of nationalism. The 
change in the economy has not been good when we look back to 
the good old days. We must be conscious of all that. It is to our 
folly-and the last government fell into it-to jump in too 
quickly and so on.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	I suppose NATO recognizing places like Poland should be 
looked at very seriously. We should take our time. We would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2272"> 2272 </A></B>
<P>
agree with the government and certainly those people on the 
foreign affairs committee in that whole area. I would say go 
slowly and intelligently, not with knee-jerk reactions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I too want to congratulate the hon. member for the 
amendment that he moved and say that we intend to vote for it 
because it relates to an area where Canadians and Quebecers 
really want to be represented by those whom they elected. I 
think this would show respect for the opinion of the people who 
just voted last fall, in the general election, on the way they see 
the future of the foreign policy, that is that it be made by the 
people who were elected in the general election.
<P>
	By the same token, it would be for us an indication of our 
willingness to do things at a lower cost and to take into 
consideration all the criticisms that we may have received on the 
unnecessary spending there may be in the Canadian federal 
system as well as in all bureaucratic systems. However, we do 
not intend this morning to put  the federal system on trial. In that 
sense, the amendment from the Reform Party suits us very well 
and we hope that the government will also see fit to vote for it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his comments. They reiterate a very strong point and we 
appreciate the support.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not want to confuse 
members, but there was mention made in the intervention of the 
hon. member for Richelieu that we commonly refer to the Senate 
as the other place.
<P>
	Today, with the word Senate being in the motion, I would 
deem it acceptable for members in replying to questions or 
comments to use the same term as in the motion. Ultimately we 
must be vigilant and remain respectful of all members in the 
House as well as senators in the other chamber.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the discussions today 
of Canada's foreign policy initiated by my colleague, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	I want to share with members today some thoughts on the role 
of trade in our total foreign affairs policies, sketch out possible 
policy directions, and encourage discussions on how we can best 
proceed in the future.
<P>
	I am also very pleased to co-sponsor the foreign policy forum 
which will involve people across Canada from the private sector 
on March 21 and March 22. It will seek their views on public 
policy. I look forward to the subsequent work the parliamentary 
committee will undertake under the initiative of my colleague, 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	The importance of trade to the making and implementation of 
Canadian foreign policy has long been a central principle of our 
vision of international relations. Lester Pearson entitled his 
1957 Nobel peace prize address ``Four Faces of Peace''. 
Significantly his first face of peace and the one about which he 
spoke most eloquently was trade. Mr. Pearson noted:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The higher man sets his economic goals in this age of mass democracy, the 
more essential it is to political stability and peace that we trade as freely as 
possible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He spoke of the high political purpose of civilizing the 
commercial policies of governments through the reduction of 
trade and investment barriers.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Pearson understood that trading agreements can underpin 
human development, including greater respect of basic human 
rights, by expanding the scope of international law, by 
generating the growth required to sustain social development, 
and by making governments that have opened their markets 
more sensitive to the reactions of international business and 
other governments. An autarkic, inward looking society that 
depends little on trade and international investment is  less 
likely to respond positively to concerns raised by others.
<P>
	The construction of an international system of binding rights, 
obligations and effective enforcement in which Canada takes its 
place as one of the more active and creative architects helps to 
ensure that the rule of law prevails over the rule of unrestrained 
power and discriminatory fixes. The making of trade rules fits 
this objective very well.
<P>
	Despite the disputes that arise and the range of barriers that 
continue to impede people everywhere from reaching their true 
economic and social potential, internationally agreed rules 
governing trade relations can be the cement that binds together 
the international community.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our government has focused mainly on economic recovery 
and job creation. Trade directly impacts on that area.
<P>
	A large part of Canada's prosperity is due to the fact that we 
have access to foreign markets. Our exports of goods and 
services account for more than a quarter of our gross domestic 
product.
<P>
	At the beginning of the nineties that proportion was slightly 
less than the one recorded in Germany, about the same as the one 
recorded in France and in Great Britain and more than double the 
one existing in the United States and in Japan. Directly and 
indirectly, exports sustain more than 2 million jobs in Canada, 
and international trade will become more significant for the 
conservation and the creation of jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Against the background of Canada's trade record and the 
importance to Canada of exports as well as imports, the conduct 
of Canada's trade relations must rest on two pillars: first, the 
quest for greater international security through agreed rule 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2273"> 2273 </A></B>
<P>
making and enforcement and, second, the creation of 
competitively sustained jobs for Canadians, whatever the 
product, wherever the market.
<P>
	It is now generally acknowledged that the world economy has 
experienced fundamental changes over the last three decades 
and that these changes have been primarily structural in nature. 
The globalization of production, the growth of knowledge based 
industries and the shift in wealth and power to the Asia-Pacific 
region all point to the rise of a new international economic 
order.
<P>
	It is also commonly accepted that attempts on the part of 
national governments to shield themselves from these changes 
are not only illusory but fraught with danger. Admittedly this 
has not stopped certain governments from attempting to do just 
that. In the United States in some quarters the current political 
obsession is Japan, which enjoys a sizeable trade surplus despite 
or perhaps because of its current recession. Behind such cryptic 
phrases as fairer trade and levelling the playing field  often lurk 
notions of replacing open rules based competition with managed 
trade, restrictive quotas and regulated trade balances. Likewise 
in Europe there are some who support the idea of a closed, 
self-reliant bloc. Regional liberalization and policy 
harmonization are certainly laudable goals when aimed at 
deepening Europe's commitment to freer trade. However these 
objectives become rather less admirable when one additional 
goal is to shut out global competition, especially from low cost 
producers in Asia or Latin America.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Fortunately or unfortunately there is no turning back the clock 
on globalization. Like the industrial revolution of the previous 
century, the kinds of changes produced by rapid technological 
change and by the liberalized trading system have permanently 
altered the economic landscape. As we saw with the former 
communist bloc, efforts to shut out these forces eventually 
collapsed, with the collapse of the Berlin wall itself, largely 
because these countries were being left behind in an 
accelerating, footloose technological race. Countries must 
either move rapidly to adapt to change or watch their productive 
capacities deteriorate and their living standards decline.
<P>
	The central lesson of globalization for Canada is that we can 
only achieve economic growth through an open, outward 
looking trade policy. In the current domestic economic climate 
characterized by accumulating private and public sector debt, 
high rates of taxation and anaemic consumption, there is no 
wellspring of demand waiting to be unleashed by the right 
macroeconomic fix. Any meaningful domestic growth strategy 
must almost by definition be export led. Only by targeting new 
and additional markets, by assisting our firms to be competitive 
in those markets and by creating an open, outward oriented 
economic base both for domestic and foreign businesses, will 
the government have any realistic hope of securing long term 
growth and job creation.
<P>
	At the same time we must focus not just on how much Canada 
exports but on what Canada exports, the type of markets we 
pursue, the delivery systems were provide and, perhaps most 
important, the productive climate we foster at home will in 
many ways shape the kind of Canadian economy which evolves 
in the years ahead.
<P>
	We must also recognize that in a world of rapid and complex 
change where international institutions are struggling to keep 
up, where other countries are employing a wide range of 
instruments to gain advantage in the global marketplace and 
where Canada is but a middle power, we need to be more 
focused, more single minded in the pursuit of our policy 
objectives.
<P>
	It has been suggested that political diplomacy is giving way to 
economic diplomacy. If Canada is to remain a significant player 
in an international arena characterized primarily by the 
interplay of economic forces, we must define a more strategic, 
less universal niche in the affairs of the international 
community. More than ever trade  policy is about positioning 
Canada in the global economy so that we attract the high value 
added, high technology industries and jobs of the future.
<P>
	The key to developing an effective trade strategy for Canada 
is to begin to identify more precisely our national priorities, 
both regionally and sectorally, based on a much clearer 
assessment of where our economic interests lie. In practical 
terms this means working directly with our key export sectors to 
develop a more focused, more agile policy agenda which is 
concerned less with trade instruments or the institutional 
frameworks than with trade objectives. It means using all the 
policy tools at our disposal, multilateral, regional and bilateral, 
to achieve clearly set out national priorities. In an ideal world, 
trade liberalization would occur multilaterally on the broadest 
possible range of fronts. Unfortunately we are dealing with an 
imperfect, changing world and we must be prepared to wield a 
whole array of trade policy instruments if we want to reach our 
market access goals.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	Although time does not allow me today to examine in detail 
the policy directions in the trade area for Canada in the decades 
ahead, I want to set forth what should be our three objectives.
<P>
	First, we must define our priorities more clearly based on a 
rigorous assessment of where Canada's competitive advantages 
lie. It remains true that Europe is still central for many Canadian 
exports and an important source of investment capital.
<P>
	We shall continue to attend to the trans-Atlantic market very 
carefully.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2274"> 2274 </A></B>
<P>
	The United States market and the successful management of 
our trade relations with our neighbour remain fundamental to 
Canada's economic prosperity.
<P>
	Nonetheless, the highest growth rate, the most exciting new 
market opportunities are in the western hemisphere, in Latin 
America and more especially westward across the Pacific to 
Asia.
<P>
	Moreover, it is with many of these emerging markets that 
Canadian exports will enjoy a strong comparative advantage and 
major growth opportunities in the years ahead, much stronger 
than we enjoy in the markets of Europe or even in the United 
States.
<P>
	How can we secure further access to traditional markets while 
actively expanding our economic links with high growth 
markets overseas? The central focus remains the multilateral 
trade framework which provides the foundation upon which our 
trade policy is constructed. For this reason we are committed to 
promoting an early start to the work of the new world trade 
organization. Called into being by the recent Uruguay round of 
the GATT, it is largely a Canadian proposal that completes the 
post war trade and payment system in the best traditions of 
Canadian foreign policy.
<P>
	We shall actively encourage the international community to 
elaborate more fully a forward looking  work program that 
reflects Canadian interests as well as the new trade issues, 
especially trade in the environment and the possibility of 
replacing anti-dumping regimes with competition policy, that 
have arisen through greater global integration.
<P>
	We will also actively encourage means by which the new 
world trade organization, the World Bank and the IMF can 
co-ordinate their efforts to reach mutually reinforcing policy 
objectives. We shall actively encourage the prompt accession of 
China, Taiwan and Russia to the new world trade organization 
with all its rights and obligations.
<P>
	The fact remains that Canada's most critical economic 
relationship is with the United States, the destination of over 70 
per cent of our exports, and indeed with North America as a 
whole.
<P>
	To manage this relationship Canada has a more 
comprehensive rules based framework in the recently 
proclaimed North American Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
	The government's commitment to strengthening this 
framework is underscored by our successful efforts to establish 
NAFTA working groups that will strive to reform practices 
related to the inappropriate use of anti-dumping and 
countervailing duties.
<P>
	NAFTA can provide a complementary tool for expanding 
opportunities for Canadian exports only if it remains 
fundamentally open to the world economy. What we do not want 
to see is a NAFTA which turns inward on itself, devolving into a 
form of continentalist, protectionist block.
<P>
	For this reason we must focus our attention on the accession 
issue and underscore its importance as a means of strengthening 
trade and investment relations not only within our hemisphere 
but indeed across the Pacific for those Asian countries ready for 
a comprehensive economic partnership.
<P>
	The new world trade organization and NAFTA are not the only 
tools available to Canada to expand our trade relations beyond 
North America.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Another approach can be to explore the prospects for 
negotiating a range of bilateral trade arrangements with selected 
high growth economies overseas. Such a policy would in no way 
compromise our existing and vital relationship with the United 
States. The goal is not to increase Canada's independence 
through a rekindled third option. Such independence even if it 
were economically desirable is largely illusory in an 
increasingly interdependent world.
<P>
	On the contrary, Canada's role in the FTA and now in NAFTA 
should be translated into a competitive advantage by 
encouraging greater economies of scale, by facilitating mutual 
beneficial sourcing and networks and by helping Canadians to 
build globally competitive industries. It is essential that we 
view our North American base not as a buffer against 
international  competition but as a springboard to a rapidly 
expanding global economy.
<P>
	Trade agreements open doors. Our trade development 
activities help companies walk through them. In the emerging 
economies of the Asia-Pacific region or Latin America the goal 
of establishing an institutional foothold in those markets and 
constructing strong business links or alliances is at least as 
important as formalizing market access agreements.
<P>
	As the second part of our strategic approach to trade policy we 
must also devise ways to target government programs and 
resources more effectively to assist Canadian companies to 
reach into key markets.
<P>
	Of particular concern to the government is the role of small 
and medium sized enterprises which have the potential to be the 
growth engines of the future but often lack the critical mass, the 
financial resources or the technical expertise to penetrate 
foreign markets. Building stronger linkages with the private 
sector, improving the delivery of market information, better 
co-ordinating government programs, both federal and 
provincial and further leveraging domestic financial resources 
are issues now on the table.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2275"> 2275 </A></B>
<P>
	The main objective is not to encourage government to be 
better at exporting but to encourage the business sector to be 
more aggressive, more outward looking global traders.
<P>
	Are there ways of redesigning our trade development 
institutions and activities so that we bring a more co-ordinated 
approach to the design, the allocation and implementation of our 
limited resources? Should we consider working with the 
provinces and industry to be the linchpins of effective export 
strategies by adopting a more market driven approach to trade 
development, one which sees government as an export 
facilitator rather than an export leader? We can use market 
signals to set our real trade priorities.
<P>
	Last, we must foster a domestic economic environment 
conducive to export led growth. It has become commonplace to 
observe that the boundary between national issues and 
international issues is becoming blurred in the same way the 
distinction between domestic policy instruments and trade 
policy instruments is in many instances meaningless. 
Regulatory and tax policies that unnecessarily inhibit export 
sectors must be revisited. Regimes and restrictions that block 
constructive international investment must also be 
re-examined. As the world economy becomes increasingly 
open, Canada will inevitably be exposed to greater and more 
fluid investments.
<P>
	We need to ensure that Canada can attract the kind of high 
quality foreign investment that will allow us to take advantage 
of technology transfers to sources from global markets and to 
remain at the hub of international linkages and alliances. The 
basic objective of our policy is to further Canada's national 
economic interests at a time when these interests show a far 
greater constancy than  the increasingly complex and 
competitive world with which we grapple. We can do a much 
better job of ensuring that these interests are translated into bold 
policy objectives and clear priorities.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	To that end we intend to ensure that the government's own 
house is in order with regard to international business 
development support. Upon entering office we found 
duplication, overlap and sometimes confused mandates that 
hindered the efforts of our exporters to compete abroad. We 
intend to correct this and to build a single integrated program 
that addresses issues such as the timeliness and dissemination of 
market intelligence, the need to reform the mechanisms now in 
place that provide export financing, and the promotion of 
mutually beneficial science and technology co-operation 
between Canadian and foreign companies.
<P>
	We have to find ways of doing things better, both because 
good fiscal accountability demands it and because budgetary 
realities oblige us all to act responsibly as well as creatively.
<P>
	Moreover, we intend to develop this program through a much 
closer and more active partnership with the provincial 
governments and with the private sector.
<P>
	This process and the foreign policy consultations now 
launched will assist us in identifying the appropriate tools and 
strengthening program delivery. During the course of 1994 I 
shall announce the concrete results emerging from the 
consultations in which we are now engaged.
<P>
	We must ensure that the greater co-ordination of all Canadian 
foreign policy tools to underpin our interests abroad are 
respecting the fact that these interests will always be varied. I 
want to reassure this House that the government will vigorously 
defend the market access achieved through negotiations and 
realized in practise through the efforts of our export community. 
We shall not hesitate to challenge other nations when they do not 
live up to their international trade and economic obligations, 
threatening Canadian interests and Canadian jobs as a result.
<P>
	This is, after all, the whole point of international rule making. 
We shall be active bilaterally and we shall use the dispute 
settlement provisions in our international trade agreements to 
defend the interests of all Canadians.
<P>
	Today's debate marks early in our mandate a period of 
reflection and discussion about the direction of Canada's 
foreign policy in a new and more competitive world in which 
trade and economic issues will be at the centre of the stage as 
never before. I am convinced that by working through these 
issues together we shall emerge with a clearer sense of purpose 
and a direction abroad that can only benefit the prosperity of all 
regions of Canada.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, when we 
look at Canada's external relations in terms of development 
assistance and international trade with a  somewhat critical eye, 
we have to recognize that by providing assistance, Canada is 
doing business and seeking business.
<P>
	Does the minister believe it would be possible, without 
creating a gap, to make a better distinction between those two 
Canadian types of action in order to make it clear that business is 
business and assistance is assistance if we are going to try to 
eliminate the somewhat undue influences which clearly exist in 
that area?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLaren:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member brings forward a 
valuable question in terms of the intended purposes of foreign 
aid. I am sure that others during the course of this debate will 
want to comment on that broad question as well.
<P>
	With regard to the specific question the hon. member raises, 
the commercial relations of our aid program, commercial 
involvement in our CIDA program can often bring real benefit. I 
think in particular of how in a number of instances in which a 
sale of Canadian goods or services is envisaged in a recipient 
country, a Third World country, quite often CIDA can provide 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2276"> 2276 </A></B>
<P>
the training element that can make a greater reality of the 
investment. I have in mind the instances where Canadian 
companies have entered into joint ventures or even direct 
investment in a Third World country where quite obviously a 
short term problem is going to be the absence of local people 
capable of working in that factory or industry. In those instances 
CIDA has often been able to provide the financing for the 
training which enables the local people to participate in the new 
industries involved.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the minister. I will preface it.
<P>
	One of the criticisms in the past of our trade department is it 
has not had really strong links with the private investment 
community, private business, and it felt a little bit left out. I 
think I hear the minister saying that is something that is going to 
be corrected in this review that is taking place.
<P>
	Could he just assure me that in fact that is actually what he 
said?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLaren:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not for one moment want to 
suggest that I have had misgivings about the abilities of officials 
in the department to develop and maintain close working 
relations with the Canadian private sector.
<P>
	I think all of us would recognize, and I am sure the hon. 
member would do so, that the world is a rapidly changing place. 
Technology is evolving very rapidly in a way that suggests that 
new approaches to the relationship between the trade 
commissioner service on the one hand and the Ottawa based 
staff on the other with the business community needs to be under 
constant review.
<P>
	One way in which we are giving current expression to that is 
to examine the ways in which financing is provided  to Canadian 
companies for their export sales. Quite obviously there are 
limited total resources within the country, whether they come 
from government or the private sector, to bring about that 
support.
<P>
	We are talking with the banks at the moment about how we 
might better co-operate together on export financing. We are 
looking in particular, as I noted in passing in my statement, at 
the possibility of more financing being available to small and 
medium sized businesses that are interested in getting into the 
export world, a world that often is bewildering to them and 
where they need some assistance from either federal or 
provincial governments and from the banks to participate 
actively in the export world.
<P>
	Therein is an example of an area where we are actively 
looking at some initiatives to see whether we can tie the work of 
the department and of the Export Development Corporation yet 
more closely to the private sector interests.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
February 17, the government invited this House to a third debate 
on national defence launching the process that would lead to the 
review of Canada's defence policy.
<P>
	At that time, I mentioned the contradiction in the fact that the 
government was entering into such a debate before declaring 
what its own directions, its own intentions were on the subject of 
defence. Meanwhile, the government had already decided to 
authorise the United States to resume testing of cruise missiles 
over Canadian territory and, a few days later, it announced some 
drastic cuts in the defence budget, the closing of several bases 
and two military colleges, and the six-month extension of the 
Canadian peacekeepers' mission in Bosnia-Hercegovina. All 
those decisions have a direct impact on Canada's defence policy 
and they were made without the slightest announcement of the 
government's intentions and before the joint committee 
responsible for the review of the defence policy had even begun 
its proceedings.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	At the time of that debate, I said: ``Moreover, the government 
assumes that a defence policy can be considered independently 
from foreign policy, which is not the case. There again, the 
government carefully avoided unveiling its intentions regarding 
the direction it will give to this new foreign policy''.
<P>
	That statement is still very valid today, some four weeks later. 
Today, the government is inviting us to participate in the 
launching of Canada's foreign policy review process, while 
once more keeping its own intentions rather vague and unclear. 
However, today, we had the opportunity to hear the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and the Minister for International Trade outline 
the foreign policy guidelines the government intends to follow.
<P>
	I must say that I find it totally deplorable that it is only this 
morning that we were given the working paper which is 
supposed to be the basis for the debate on Canada's foreign 
policy. Moreover, the government persists in seeing the foreign 
policy review process as totally separate from the defence 
policy review process, an approach which, in many respects, 
does not make any sense.
<P>
	Foreign policy is closely connected to security and defence. It 
is particularly true in Canada where post-war foreign policy has 
been geared to the collective security system set up under the 
UN, NATO and NORAD.
<P>
	The foreign policy review we are embarking upon follows two 
major reviews of this kind undertaken by the Canadian 
government during the last 25 years. The first one took place in 
1969-70 under the Trudeau government and the second one was 
conducted in 1984 by the Mulroney government. Since then, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2277"> 2277 </A></B>
<P>
there has a been a lot of water under the bridge and a lot of events 
caused much ink to flow; cases in point are the fall of the Berlin 
wall and German unification, as well as the breaking up the 
Soviet Union and the collapse of communism.
<P>
	There is an urgent need to review defence and foreign policies 
in view of drastic changes in world order. Today, the notion of 
security takes on a meaning very different than was the case not 
that long ago.
<P>
	However, several other major changes have also contributed 
to making the federal government feel the need to review 
Canada's foreign policy. I can think of the development of 
communications, the emergence of environmental concerns, as 
well as the globalization of markets.
<P>
	It is important to point out that this globalization is an 
inescapable phenomenon. It is a tendency which affects the 
economy of all countries, whether they are G-7 members or 
developing nations. To try to escape this reality would be like 
ignoring the emergence of new means of communication and 
production; in other words, it would be tantamount to ignoring 
the changes which have occurred in our economic environment.
<P>
	In a previous speech made in this House, I mentioned that the 
economies of Quebec and Canada are largely dependent on 
exports of goods and services, which account for close to 16 per 
cent of the country's gross domestic product. Obviously, the 
economic prosperity of a nation of seven million people or, for 
that matter, of a country with a population of 28 million, is 
contingent upon having access to major markets. This is why I 
wonder about the reluctance of English Canada to recognize the 
existence of a potentially beneficial pattern, assuming it is well 
managed.
<P>
	However, even though market globalization implies a certain 
degree of integration in an economic structure which transcends 
national boundaries, it does not mean that small countries have 
to yield to the powerful economies of the world.
<P>
	By standing up for themselves, these small nations ensure that 
their interests will be protected, since they will have been 
enshrined in duly negotiated agreements implemented by 
neutral international organizations. Moreover, they can enjoy 
the same benefits as their trading partners and competitors.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Many smaller states, like Denmark and the Benelux countries, 
have done well against great economic powers such as Germany, 
France and the United Kingdom and have recognized the need to 
open up to the world.
<P>
	To protect ourselves against the almost unlimited 
high-handedness of the great powers, we need to embark upon 
some serious negotiations and to establish dispute settlement 
mechanisms capable of withstanding political pressure. Of 
course, laxness and obscure definitions would under no 
circumstances whatsoever be deemed acceptable.
<P>
	There is much more to the benefits of free trade and market 
globalization. In fact, it is our hope that foreign companies 
gaining access to the United States and North America will 
increasingly choose Canada and Quebec as their entrance point 
to these markets.
<P>
	As you may have guessed, the Bloc Quebecois is not against 
reopening NAFTA to include new partners. Quite the opposite, it 
would welcome them. However, it greatly hopes that the 
government projects will include significant measures to help 
Quebec and Canadian businesses and workers to adjust to this 
new reality.
<P>
	Various groups were opposed to the signing and 
implementation of the Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA, 
because these treaties did not include any adjustment measure.
<P>
	Finally, I have one last word of advice about market 
globalization that comes from the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce. At a round table on international trade, one of its 
officials said, and I quote: ``GATT, NAFTA and other regional 
agreements help to create a more dynamic, foreseeable and 
stable trade environment. However, our members believe that 
globalization represents bigger and bigger challenges for 
Canada. They think that the capacity of Canadian businesses to 
take advantage of the opportunities provided by GATT and 
NAFTA and to keep their share of the domestic market directly 
depends on the capacity of Canada to put its finances on a 
healthy footing''.
<P>
	In fact, the leader of the opposition himself raised this issue 
earlier today, during his speech.
<P>
	I have also mentioned that the Chamber of Commerce 
advocates improved co-operation between the private and the 
public sectors. As I have mentioned before in this House, this 
means, among other things, that the government must give 
access to all the information and expertise it has and create an 
environment conducive to investments in Quebec and in 
Canada.
<P>
	Although Canada and Quebec are irremediably committed to 
freer trade with the free trade agreement, the North American 
Free Trade Agreement and GATT negotiated agreements, we 
must be careful and watchful of arbitrary decisions on the part of 
our trade partners, in particular the United States, to which our 
industries could fall victim.
<P>
	The process leading to the gradual elimination of trade 
barriers between Canada and the United States is undoubtedly 
well under way and on schedule, but this does not prevent the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2278"> 2278 </A></B>
<P>
Americans from applying against some of our products and 
some of our industries protectionist measures which appear to 
be anachronisms given the current trend towards market 
globalization.
<P>
	This total disregard for the international rules of the game on 
the part of the United States when it comes to trade is evident in 
a number of areas of economic activity in Canada. Take for 
example the conflicts between Canada and the United States on 
steel, softwood, beer, some farm products and uranium.
<P>
	In those areas, the American authorities are systematically 
trying to deny Canadian products access to their market by using 
all kinds of cunning and harassing tactics such as constant red 
tape, countervailing duties, repeated use of the various dispute 
settlement mechanisms, etc.
<P>
	The latest weapon the United States added to their arsenal of 
trade impediments is their super 301. This rather exceptional 
measure allows the American administration to penalize the 
countries deemed guilty of unfair trade practices against the 
United States.
<P>
	Super 301, which is in total contradiction with the rules and 
the spirit of GATT and NAFTA, was strongly denounced all over 
the world, in particular by the Secretary General of GATT and by 
the European Commissioner for International Trade.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Fortunately, Canada is not directly threatened, at least for 
now, with possible application of super 301. The United States 
are now threatening Japan with trade retaliation measures if it 
does not open its market wider to some American products. 
However, there are reasons for Canada to fear the potentially 
negative impact of the application of super 301 to Japan. The 
Prime Minister of Australia and some French parliamentarians 
already expressed their fear.
<P>
	This strong hint of protectionism from another era shows the 
need to establish strong international institutions that can 
guarantee the continuation of the free trade movement and help 
countries to protect themselves against arbitrary and unilateral 
decisions by the great economic powers.
<P>
	In this regard, the creation of the world trade organization as 
of January 1, 1995 seems to be a step in the right direction. Also, 
we will have to ensure that clear and functional dispute 
settlement mechanisms are  included in NAFTA and that the 
discussions requested by the federal government regarding the 
definition of dumping and subsidies are successful.
<P>
	As I said earlier, trade liberalization and market globalization 
seem to be a trend, an irreversible phenomenon. The prosperity 
of nations will depend more and more on international trade. It 
is a fact that will be part of Canada's economic reality from now 
on. So, as I mentioned in this House on February 1, the warm 
reception given by both federalists and sovereignists in Quebec 
first to the free trade agreement with the United States and later 
to the North American Free Trade Agreement should surprise no 
one.
<P>
	In the context of market globalization, it appears essential to 
me that the provinces be able to ensure the development of their 
economy, their culture and their society. This position, inspired 
by the Gérin-Lajoie doctrine, implies that provincial 
government institutions abroad deal with areas under exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction at the international level.
<P>
	It is with that in mind that Quebec started, in the early 1960s, 
to establish a network ensuring its presence abroad. Today it has 
27 offices abroad to promote Quebec exports, to seek out 
investment, to implement immigration agreements and to 
encourage exchanges in education, language and culture.
<P>
	Other provinces also, including New Brunswick, Alberta, 
British Columbia and Ontario, have established a number of 
offices abroad. However, Ontario recently decided to close its 
offices outside Canada.
<P>
	When a provincial government chooses to maintain a mission 
abroad in order to promote its interests and its culture, it should 
not expect the federal government to undertake obstructive 
action against it. If we want provinces to be able to attract 
investors and to help our businesses break into foreign markets, 
we should avoid these centralist offensives or pressures on 
provinces by the federal government.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to add a few words on the 
government project called Team Canada. This should not be 
confused of course with the hockey team of the same name. This 
project aims to encourage and develop a synergy, a co-operation 
between the various Canadian stakeholders in the area of 
exports. Team Canada, it is to be hoped, must remain a flexible 
organization promoting co-operation and collaboration 
between these various Canadian stakeholders in the area of 
exports.
<P>
	Too often we have seen such initiatives become exercises in 
centralization which look like bureaucratic monsters. Moreover, 
consultation with the provinces is imperative if we are to avoid 
duplication, draw upon their expertise, and define their real 
needs.
<P>
	At any rate, the whole process of reviewing our foreign 
policy, more particularly as it applies to international trade, 
should obviously take into consideration the views, 
expectations, and concerns of all interested parties.
<P>
	At the very beginning of my remarks, I took great care to state 
my reservations and concerns about a foreign policy review that 
is totally divorced from the national defence policy review, a 
rather illogical decision. I would now like to deal with my 
concern about the process itself.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2279"> 2279 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	The government's motion provides for the appointment of a 
joint committee of the House of Commons and Senate. I think 
that such a committee is utterly useless and inappropriate. 
Having a certain number of senators join the members who sit on 
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade will only make for a heavier structure and lead to an 
inefficient and unproductive committee. It will also drive up the 
costs, since more people will be travelling with the committee.
<P>
	In my opinion, the creation of working subcommittees that 
some see as a solution to the problems of effectiveness and cost 
related to the joint committee's size is in reality a proposal 
which will ultimately undermine the coherence and unity of all 
committee members in their work.
<P>
	Some will say that creating a joint committee will help us 
avoid duplication between the House standing committee and 
Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade, thus avoiding expenditures made by two 
committees working simultaneously on the same issue. This 
argument is pointless since both committees, like all 
committees of the House which have an equivalent in the 
Senate, are constantly overlapping anyway.
<P>
	We agree with the principle which prompts the government to 
propose the creation of a joint committee of the House and the 
Senate, that is to eliminate costly and useless duplication 
between the two committees responsible for foreign affairs and 
international trade.
<P>
	Obviously, we disagree on the means. While the Liberals 
propose a temporary solution to a real problem, which is due to 
the existence of the Senate itself, we respectfully suggest to our 
colleagues that the sole purpose of creating such a joint 
committee is to maintain this ancient and antiquated institution 
which is completely out of touch with Canadian reality. That is 
why we oppose the creation of this joint committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a short 
question. We certainly agree with the mention of the Senate 
item. I look at the difficulty that Canada has in becoming known 
in the international community.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned something about the efficiency 
that some smaller countries can have. He made reference to 
several countries. I would take a look at Norway which has a 
huge tax burden and a high debt level and point out that maybe it 
is not being as successful.
<P>
	My question concerns the economy of size. Some of the hon. 
member's comments made reference to the fact that smaller 
units can be successful in the international community. I wonder 
if he could elaborate on that a bit, please.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find interesting the specific 
reference made by my colleague from Red Deer to a 
Scandinavian country which, everyone knows, has experienced 
over the last few years a growth in public spending for which it 
now has to bear the consequences.
<P>
	I think he has deliberately targetted a Scandinavian country to 
illustrate his point. He could just as well have chosen a country 
other than a Scandinavian one, such as Austria, Denmark or 
Switzerland. He preferred to choose Norway to argue that a 
small state is not necessarily more efficient than a large one.
<P>
	In answer to that, I will only point out that while Canada is a 
large country, it is not really in a better financial shape than 
Norway.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have this 
opportunity to address the House on the opening of our foreign 
policy review.
<P>
	My remarks today are made in the context of our 
government's commitment to a foreign policy review. A foreign 
policy review commences with this opportunity in the House of 
Commons for elected members of Parliament to speak to issues 
which, although they may not seem as urgent as their 
constituents' well-being, are in fact just as relevant to our 
well-being as health, welfare and a social safety net. Many 
factors outside of Canada threaten the security of our daily lives 
and those of our children and grandchildren just as surely as 
unemployment, health and education programs and difficulties 
resulting from our debt and deficits at home.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	If world population growth rates continue and poverty 
world-wide is allowed to continue to ravage our global 
environment, if consumption levels continue without 
consideration of whether that consumption is sustainable, if 
women world-wide are not recognized as the critical 
determiners of health and education standards and economic 
well-being and yet are not supported adequately in these roles, 
then our very survival is threatened, not just our economic and 
social well-being.
<P>
	Members of Parliament are elected to represent more than the 
immediate interests of their constituents, important as these 
interests are. Members of Parliament are obliged to balance the 
interests of their constituents with the broad and often 
conflicting interests of the regions of Canada and of our country 
as a whole. Federally elected members of Parliament must 
broaden the balance of all these interests to include a global 
perspective, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2280"> 2280 </A></B>
<P>
the best interests of humanity as a whole,  our global family. Our 
vision cannot be blinkered by narrow interests. We must not be 
blind to critical issues in a rapidly changing world.
<P>
	As I am sure all members have noticed since the 
commencement of the 35th Parliament, determining the future 
directions of our nation is a complex and often difficult 
balancing act. Canada has a longstanding reputation for 
leadership in addressing international problems and we intend 
to further strengthen this reputation over the years. However, no 
government has all the answers.
<P>
	In the post cold war era, we are continually presented with 
rapidly changing situations, new challenges and many 
opportunities. That is the reason the government is launching 
today a broad consultative process with the Canadian people.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	In the end, the government will have to make decisions based 
on principles, but we admit that Canadians, because of their 
culture, education, as well as their many travels and 
professional experience, are more than ever able to contribute to 
policy formulation. Such a combination of culture, education 
and international experience is unequalled in any other country.
<P>
	The Liberal government is not starting from scratch in this 
foreign policy evaluation. Over the last four years, we consulted 
Canadians on a whole series of issues such as UN reform, 
foreign aid, human rights and sustainable development. Our 
principles were stated clearly and we want them to be the 
grounds for our review.
<P>
	At the end of the process, I sincerely hope that we will be able 
to establish a more consistent foreign policy whose various 
components-assistance, trade, defence, environment, health, 
agriculture, immigration and politics-will be complementary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the past, elements of Canadian foreign policy have often 
operated without consideration of their effects on other policy 
areas. This resulted in policies which often worked at 
cross-purposes and which ran the risk of cancelling out each 
other's benefits. Our fragile planet cannot withstand the 
continuation of this short-sighted approach. Scarce resources, 
public and private, must be harmonized to maximize our limited 
capabilities. We need a full foreign policy review to help us 
better understand how to achieve coherent results.
<P>
	My specific purpose in addressing this debate today is to 
highlight the relevant issues from the perspective of my areas of 
responsibility, Latin America, which includes the Caribbean and 
Africa.
<P>
	I would like to begin with some reflection first on Africa. As a 
continent which is rich in culture, human and natural resources, 
I believe it cannot be marginalized. Africa currently has a 
population of 650 million people, a figure that could double by 
the year 2010.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	With such enormous population pressures, what can we do 
when the people of Africa are forced to eradicate their own 
natural resources for the purposes of survival? It is in those 
situations that environmental concerns become as much a 
security issue for Canada as terrorism.
<P>
	The nature of Canadian aid to Africa has changed in recent 
years. More and more our dollars are spent in providing relief, 
not development assistance. This relief is augmented by 
peacekeeping and defence dollars dispensed in response to 
social, economic and political upheaval.
<P>
	Ultimately Canada is forced to make huge contributions to 
refugee programs at home and abroad. We must recognize the 
immense costs of social, political and economic crises and their 
effect on our own well-being at home here in Canada.
<P>
	The cost to Canada of emergency assistance, peacekeeping 
and refugee care and processing in war zones far outweighs the 
cost of building secure and stable societies through long term 
development. In recent years it has become clearly evident that 
we cannot afford not to promote international peace and 
security.
<P>
	Aid or development assistance alone in whatever volume is 
insufficient to the task. Dollars spent by Canada for 
development should complement policies and programs of 
recipient country governments with the same ends in mind.
<P>
	Sustainable development, good governance, respect for 
human rights, adherence to democratic principles, economic 
transparency and acceptable accountability standards are 
requisite. We cannot afford to squander too many development 
assistance dollars in countries that do not respect the principles 
and goals of our initiatives.
<P>
	For that purpose, Canada has already started to relate our 
assistance to such principles as respect for human rights and 
competent economic management. This will surely be examined 
as part of the foreign policy review.
<P>
	This is obviously an approach of utmost importance. Yet even 
a policy of providing development dollars to countries 
practising good governance policies will not alone achieve 
sustainable development in those countries. Economic 
opportunity must also be possible.
<P>
	For many African countries debt burdens threaten to prevent 
the emergence of a viable economy. There is an additional need 
in developing countries for policies to encourage foreign 
investment and international policies which permit free and fair 
trade to occur with poorer nations.
<P>
	Political will on all sides to bring about necessary reform is 
paramount. I am sure our foreign policy review process will 
assist the Canadian government in developing proactive, 
effective methods to achieve this goal.

<P>
	Africa is going through a period of profound changes. The 
people of many African countries proved their determination to 
rid themselves of cyclical problems of corruption and abuse 
associated with their governments. Africans want governments 
that will be able to fulfil their basic needs, namely as regards 
health, education, peace, sustainable development and 
economic stability.
<P>
	Africa is facing a tough challenge. The changes needed will 
not be possible without tremendous work and the commitment 
of its people. Canada is aware that the road to democracy will 
not be an easy one. Any political change inevitably comes with 
problems and unexpected detours. Nevertheless, it is important 
that the democratization process be anchored in the respect of 
African customs, traditions and values in order to take root 
deeply and provide hope for future generations of Africans.
<P>
	In countries that are on their way to democracy, it is not 
enough to support the democratization process and principles of 
good public administration up to election day. Although 
decisive elections are but a first step. Canada must go on 
supporting the principle of good administration of public 
affairs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We also should not underestimate the economic ties Canada 
has established with Africa. Our African trade involves every 
Canadian region and has allowed many companies to make more 
effective use of their knowledge in technology.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	This is of significant benefit to Canadians who not only gain 
market access but jobs and greater economic security for 
themselves. By applying our knowledge and supplying our 
products where the demand emerges, Canada maintains and 
increases its competitiveness.
<P>
	It is worth recalling that the United Nations, the 
Commonwealth and la Francophonie are major multilateral 
organizations through which Canadians and Africans have been 
closely associated. Many hon. members may not be aware that 
African countries comprise 30 per cent of the United Nations 
membership, 27 per cent of the Commonwealth and 52 per cent 
of the countries in la Francophonie.
<P>
	The linguistic, cultural and historical ties between our nations 
have existed far longer than our relationships through aid 
programs. Canada's bilingual and multicultural nature has been 
an important factor in building those long term relationships. 
That is the foundation upon which we can take the opportunity to 
build a long fruitful partnership well into the future. We only 
need the political will to do so. In my opinion, we cannot afford 
not to.
<P>
	Within our development assistance programs Canada has 
traditionally attached the highest priority to activities which 
attempt to reduce global poverty. It has been  recognized that 
crime, violence and large scale conflict often result in situations 
where poverty is most prevalent.
<P>
	The government has stated that its goal is to provide 25 per 
cent of official development assistance. This is to meet basic 
human needs and human resource development, to provide basic 
health and education, to work more closely to assist women who 
are the principal providers of health, nutrition and education, 
and to provide sustainable development so that future 
generations may also know peace and security.
<P>
	The government was elected on the promise of fiscal 
responsibility. While we are not in a position at this time to 
increase funding to our development assistance program, our 
goal remains the same: to achieve a 0.7 per cent official 
development assistance to GNP ratio.
<P>
	Despite this need for fiscal restraint I do not believe that 
limited financial resources necessitate a reduction in 
effectiveness. Through creative, proactive and well-managed 
programs our impact can even increase. Initiatives in terms of 
human rights for example often administered on a small scale 
can have a widespread impact. Our challenge is to administer all 
our programs more effectively.
<P>
	We recognize the impact of necessary change can be felt 
unequally by different groups in society. Canada is trying to 
respond to this reality by working with international financial 
institutions and through local governments to protect existing 
adjustment programs, but mitigate the negative impacts by 
launching new social programs to benefit those most directly 
affected by adjustment. We hope the foreign policy review will 
address this issue.
<P>
	Still, Africa's continuing debt burden severely handicaps its 
efforts at sustainable development. As a development partner 
we need to consider how best to alleviate this burden. Success 
will assist in the creation of healthier African economies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, allow me to speak now about Latin America. 
Canada is part of the Americas. With globalization, Latin 
America and the Caribbean are more and more the focus of 
Canada's foreign policy. That region has already got involved in 
a process of fundamental change and modernization on the 
economic, political and social levels. With its positive 
co-operation, Canada has a unique opportunity to be able to take 
part in that development and help shaping it. In this hemisphere, 
we are considered as a responsible and increasingly involved 
partner, and I think we have a lot to gain from that partnership.
<P>
	While recognizing the potential of that partnership, we must 
also admit that Canada has a lot to learn if it wants to avoid being 
marginalized in the development of its relationships with the 
other countries of the hemisphere. These countries have a very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2282"> 2282 </A></B>
<P>
different history, language and culture than ours, and our 
understanding of their  circumstances will affect the scope and 
success of our relationships.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Canada's foreign policy regarding that region is faced with 
many difficulties. Our attitudes towards Latin America and the 
Caribbean must be in tune with the general objectives of our 
foreign policy, that is the relief of poverty, the promotion of 
sound public management, of human rights, of social stability, 
of gender and racial equality, of a sustainable environment and 
of international peace and stability.
<P>
	While that population is quite educated compared with other 
developing regions, they have serious social problems which 
must be addressed at the grass roots. It is essential that we solve 
these problems if we want to ensure their well-being in the 
future.
<P>
	These last few years, there have been positive political 
tendencies in Latin America. In the early eighties, many 
countries had military regimes. Now, almost all governments in 
that region have been democratically elected in accordance with 
free constitutional procedures. As these countries get familiar 
with the democratic process, they bring their policies up to 
international standards.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Work is being done by Latin American and Caribbean citizens 
to consolidate and strengthen democratic judicial and human 
rights institutions. Canadian assistance has been and remains 
important in reinforcing these trends. The military in most 
countries now shows a greater respect for civilian authority and 
has retreated to a more limited proper role in society.
<P>
	Canada supports and is encouraged by this process of 
democratization. Similar to our work in Africa it is imperative 
to remember that elections in themselves do not create 
democracy. It is incumbent on the donor countries to continue 
their support until a true democratic society is achieved. In fact 
we anticipate the day when we learn from each other in this 
regard.
<P>
	In the Commonwealth Caribbean, Canada has longstanding 
strong ties with both governments and people. These ties have 
been based on shared parliamentary and democratic traditions, 
common values, close personal contact with government 
leaders, extensive tourism and major involvement by Canada's 
chartered banks. We expect these ties to endure and strengthen 
in the years ahead.
<P>
	How should our relationship with the region be modified to 
reflect future and global interests? There has also been 
significant progress in the area of economic renewal in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. This provides the foundation for 
sustainable growth and development.
<P>
	Many countries in this region are making considerable 
progress in implementing market oriented economic reforms, 
privatization, deregulation, emphasis on export  oriented 
production and are integrating into regional and global markets. 
Investor confidence is improving.
<P>
	As a result this is a region which is expanding economically 
and in which Canada has an increasingly important trade and 
investment stake that can contribute to economic recovery and 
renewal in Canada. We must seize these opportunities in the 
most effective manner possible.
<P>
	Canada's official development assistance plays an important 
role in our partnership throughout Latin America and the 
Caribbean. In this instance there are certain existing similarities 
to our relationship to Africa.
<P>
	By supporting the economic reform process and encouraging 
governments to do more now to mitigate the associated social 
costs, Canada's aid program has promoted sustainable 
development, particularly in the management of natural 
resources. It has contributed to a reduction in poverty and has 
promoted respect for human rights, democratic development 
and good economic governance.
<P>
	I know from firsthand experience with grassroots projects 
throughout Central America the good that can result from 
human scale community development initiatives supported by 
Canadians. Our larger scale official programs of development 
assistance have also had a positive impact in vital areas ranging 
from food production to human rights, from the development of 
clean water sources to economic reform. They have contributed 
to encouraging the economic and social improvements that are 
taking place.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since it became a member of the Organization of American 
States in 1989, Canada actively supported the OAS in its efforts 
to promote democracy and constitutional rule, as well as judicial 
reform and human rights protection. Its missions have given 
Canada an opportunity to strengthen human development in all 
regions.
<P>
	I believe that Canada should continue to support regional 
initiatives in favour of human rights, environmental protection 
and trade development.
<P>
	In this process, we should also make sure that poor countries 
are not marginalized. Marginalization of less developed 
countries can result in instability and massive movements of 
populations away from poor countries and into rich ones, and 
could also jeopardize emerging economies. Such situations have 
re-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2283"> 2283 </A></B>
<P>
percussions all over the world. Therefore, there may be merit in 
trying to prevent them.
<P>
	Recently, Canada launched a partnership with a country of 
this hemisphere, Haiti. As one of four friendly countries-with 
the United States, France and Venezuela-Canada will play a 
role in the OAS and the UN in the restoration of democratic and 
constitutional  rule in Haiti. It will support President Aristide 
and protection of human rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Cuba poses another challenge. The Cuban economy has 
undergone serious deterioration. Economic reforms have been 
limited as have human rights improvements. However I believe 
we cannot afford to marginalize any country in this hemisphere. 
Careful evaluation is necessary to encourage the full 
reintegration of Cuba into the hemispheric family, a process that 
will require significant change.
<P>
	Canada's relationship with the countries of Latin America and 
the Caribbean cannot be classified in general terms as each 
country of the region is so vastly different. For those in the 
initial stages of development simply providing education and 
poverty alleviation is not enough. We must also assist them in 
developing fairer trading relations with their trading partners 
throughout the world.
<P>
	Latin America is on the brink of having a more significant 
impact in international policy areas, as it now has a chance to 
pursue its vision of becoming an important international player. 
The challenge for Canada will be the flexibility of our approach 
and the way in which we accept benefits which are offered 
through the maintenance and continuance of relationships with 
both Latin America and the Caribbean.
<P>
	In closing, it is the vision of the future of Canadians that the 
Liberal Party is trying to capture in this review process. The 
result of the process should permit policies which not only 
respond to the domestic needs of Canadians but also project the 
international image which Canadians want their government 
and government initiatives to pursue.
<P>
	In all of this we are working toward a better future, a future 
with considerably less poverty, positive sustainable 
development, social and political equity not only for ourselves 
but for all women, men and children throughout the world and 
for our partners in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. I 
hope everyone present will assist us in achieving that goal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend 
the hon. minister on her comments this afternoon that add to the 
very important debate taking place with regard to our foreign 
policy.
<P>
	I heard the minister speak about the need for aid in the areas 
that she represents, Latin America and Africa. Would the 
minister agree with the Auditor General and his comments that 
there is a need to downsize and reduce the number of countries 
we give aid to in order to better target our resources? Could the 
minister comment on that?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Northumberland):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to comment. Earlier today the Minister of Foreign Affairs said 
that we have to try to be more focused in our foreign aid policies. 
Being more focused in  foreign aid policy does not refer only to 
aid. There has been an ongoing debate about whether or not we 
can concentrate on fewer countries having fewer bilateral 
relations with countries around the world. Through that debate 
we have produced a greater concentration of development 
assistance to regions of the world.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The government and I support the development of regional 
initiatives in the world, but I personally believe that should not 
preclude our bilateral relations with any country in the world. 
There are many other instruments of foreign policy besides aid 
which we can use to enhance and promote bilateral relations 
with nations around the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the minister for her comments. As we all enjoy the debate about 
foreign policy, hopefully we will come to the start of the process 
in which we are going to be involved to set policy going into the 
next century.
<P>
	I would like a comment from the minister or at least her 
opinion on whether we should have enabling legislation for 
CIDA. I was surprised to find no legislation in place at this time 
that gives CIDA its legislative authority; it is just a creation of 
cabinet.
<P>
	Would the minister comment on both the advisability of that 
because I realize it restricts CIDA's activities somewhat and, in 
view of that, whether or not it would help to control some of the 
costs the Auditor General mentioned that have been permanent 
sores in many Auditor Generals' reports over the past few years?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Northumberland):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure 
development assistance, foreign aid, and in particular the role of 
CIDA in providing development assistance and aid around the 
world, will be very large subjects in the foreign policy review 
process in general.
<P>
	The government in its history has kept CIDA closer to its day 
to day operations of foreign policy. Through the instrument of 
CIDA and foreign aid there was the desire to supplement other 
political foreign policy initiatives by keeping them close to the 
government rather than legislating CIDA at arm's length from 
the government, as we have done for various other institutions 
such as the International Development Research Council and the 
International Institute on Democratic Development and Human 
Rights.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2284"> 2284 </A></B>
<P>
	At this point I would not like to conjecture on how CIDA 
should progress into the future. I know I want to see these issues 
discussed very fully in our foreign policy review so that we hear 
from Canadians how they feel the aid development assistance 
instrument can be best used in our whole foreign policy package.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have taken notice of the 
member standing. Unless there has been a reassignment of seats 
he might seek to return to his seat while I am on my feet and I 
might recognize him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her excellent speech. I 
would ask for her opinion on whether or not she sees any role for 
Canada utilizing the United Nations and bringing together the 
international community to employ economic levers against 
countries that may be abusing the foreign aid they get, or even in 
the context of gross human rights abuses within their countries.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Northumberland):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government is committed to working very closely with the 
United Nations in trying to strengthen it, in order that the United 
Nations can be better able to meet all complex situations that 
exist in our global world. Right now the United Nations is 
dominated by a security council with a very limited membership 
which reflects in many ways a cold war era rather than the era we 
now exist in.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	It is very difficult for the United Nations because of its current 
structure to respond, as the member suggests, to some of the 
difficulties existing in the world today. As I said, Canada is very 
interested in not only continuing to support the United Nations 
but to help it to reform itself in many ways so that it better 
reflects the global needs of the world.
<P>
	Certainly Canada as a nation in its bilateral relations with 
other countries of the world is very concerned about issues of 
corruption and misuse of funds provided for development 
purposes to other nations. We do everything we can. We use 
every bilateral instrument we have at hand to try to encourage 
governments that may be practising corrupt activities to stop.
<P>
	I can say from my own experiences as a minister travelling 
throughout Latin America and Africa that our own country's 
initiatives in that regard have had some good effect. Countries 
are now coming forward voluntarily to tell me about measures 
they are taking to overcome problems. Many countries through 
regional approaches are beginning to police each other.
<P>
	There is great hope about what we can do to face the 
difficulties the member raised which are serious for us. There 
are things we can do bilaterally as a nation, but there is more we 
can do through helping the United Nations to reform itself and 
reform its institutions so that it can help in the process of 
addressing these issues.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There being no further questions and it being

	It is possible to reach a compromise on the future of the Royal

collaboration with the Government of Quebec, has offered to

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
draw the attention of the House to the situation at the port of 
Halifax.
<P>
	Atlantic Container Lines was ready to guarantee 8,000 new 
containers per year of cargo bound for Chicago, simply because 
the port of Halifax provides the most competitive entry location

<P>
	The Halifax Port Corporation and the longshoremen's union 
both agreed on major cuts in handling fees and surcharges to 
attract this business and keep it there. However, last week the 
Maritime Employers Association, a board dominated by

offer to lower benefits. Only after public outcry did the board 
decide to accept a revised offer.
<P>
	However, I remain astounded that any supposedly responsible 
employer's group could have considered rejecting an offer of 
concessions from its union, an offer of lowering operating costs 
and increased competitiveness.
<P>
	For now, the port of Halifax may have escaped permanent 
damage, but this incident forces me to question the system 
through which the port of Halifax can be hampered in its drive 
for success by a board made up of its competitors.

	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
is World Consumer Rights Day, declared by the International 
Organization of Consumer Unions.
<P>
	Throughout the world consumers are marking this event by 
taking part in activities stressing their contributions to the 
marketplace in our society. Consumers have a vital role to play 
in maintaining the wealth and competitiveness of this country; 
over 60 per cent of Canada's GDP is attributed to consumer 
demand.
<P>
	Consumers' voices should be heard and their rights 
recognized. The IOCU defines eight basic rights of consumers 
as given in the UN guidelines: the right to satisfaction of basic 
needs, the right to safety, the right to be informed, the right to 
choose, the right to be heard, the right to redress, the right to 
consumer education, and the right to a healthy environment.
<P>
	We Canadians are fortunate that many of our basic rights as 
consumers are already acknowledged. We have good consumer 
protection legislation in place and businesses that for the most 
part are concerned with producing high quality goods and 
services using fair marketing practices.
<P>
	Consumers in prosperous countries such as Canada are lucky 
to be able to choose from a wide variety of goods and services.

	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
<I>Toronto Star</I> of Monday, March 14 I read about a visit by two 
members of the Reform Party to my riding of Trinity-Spadina. 
In their travels they visited Chinatown and Kensington Market 
where they felt they would encounter Canadians of origins other 
than English and French who would share with them their 
opinions of slashing immigration to Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2287"> 2287 </A></B>
<P>
	In the process they discovered that the majority of those with 
whom they spoke looked favourably on the government's 
immigration policy. One respondent business person, Mr. 
Danny Tran, a recent immigrant who creates jobs himself, said 
that more immigrants meant more jobs.
<P>
	Because of these responses the title of the article was 
``Reformers Get An Education''. To no one's surprise, least of 
all my own, they discovered that the multicultural mix of 
Trinity-Spadina positively contributes to the dynamic nature 
of Toronto.
<P>
	If the hon. members had ventured around the corner to the 
Alexander Park Community Housing complex, they would have 
also learned of how three years ago a determined group of 
residents, multicultural in character, led by Mr. Sonny Atkinson, 
banded together and drove out the drug problem.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to extend an invitation to all 
Canadians to visit Trinity-Spadina to discover these well kept 
secrets of the success of multiculturalism. In particular, 
however, I would like to extend an invitation to more of the 
members of the Reform Party so that they too may benefit from 
these lessons.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, an 
unprecedented event took place Saturday in Montreal,  namely 
the Forum de la solidarité sociale du Québec. For the first time 
ever, over one thousand representatives of citizen and 
community groups as diverse as the Assemblée des évêques and 
unions from all regions gathered together to embrace a common 
goal and to wage war on unemployment and poverty through 
joint social action.
<P>
	After painting an alarming picture of poverty in Quebec, the 
forum levelled the blame squarely at the federal government's 
anti-inflation policy which has led to a 50 per cent increase in 
the federal debt, prompting governments to slash social 
programs every further.
<P>
	Above all, forum participants agreed on the need to take 
action so that Quebec stands solidly behind a job creation policy 
that encompasses job sharing, a reaffirmation of the role of the 
state, taxation reform, maintenance of social programs and a 
broadening of democracy.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. Yesterday in this 
House, the Prime Minister denied the possibility that his 
Minister of Finance would propose at the Detroit summit a tax 
credit for businesses that create jobs, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I do not think that the Minister of Finance will present in Detroit a proposal 
on Canadian taxation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
As soon as the G-7 summit opened yesterday in Detroit, about 
the same time that the Prime Minister said what I just quoted, 
the Minister of Finance made such a proposal to his G-7 
partners.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister reconcile his statement with the 
proposal that his Minister of Finance presented to his G-7 
partners at the same time yesterday?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Finance is meeting with his counterparts from 
the other G-7 countries. They are looking at some mechanisms 
that could be used to create jobs.
<P>
	Stimulating job creation through tax credits is an option that 
was discussed here but it was not specifically  included in the 
budget. During discussions, the minister put the proposal before 
the assembly. He certainly heard the reaction of the other 
ministers and will take it into account in preparing his next 
budget. They are there to exchange ideas and to have 
intergovernmental discussions. Knowing the Minister of 
Finance, he is not afraid of exploring new avenues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives a measure of the kind of co-ordination that 
exists in this cabinet.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister tell the House whether his Minister 
of Finance was authorized by cabinet to make such a proposal at 
the G-7 Detroit summit? Was he speaking on his own behalf or 
on behalf of the government?
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Finance discussed an idea. When the Minister of 
Finance or other of my colleagues have new ideas, they do not 
call me to ask if they can have new ideas.
<P>
	I encourage my ministers to explore new ideas and make 
proposals to cabinet. At that time I will decide whether we can 
incorporate them into the budget, yes or no.
<P>
	I certainly would not blame any of my ministers for going to a 
summit to discuss new ways of creating jobs. I would applaud 
that.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> The 
point is not to forbid the minister to have new ideas. Anyway, we 
know he does not have new ideas. He is only copying old Tory 
ideas.
<P>
	The point is that yesterday in the House the Prime Minister 
told us in a very firm and clear way that his minister would not 
raise the idea of a tax credit in Detroit. Here he was at the same 
time doing the one thing he should not have been doing, if we 
rely on what the Prime Minister said yesterday.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister intend to support the proposal made 
by his minister yesterday? Also, when the minister comes back 
from Detroit, can we expect a statement announcing a tax credit 
in favour of businesses that create jobs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have voted on the budget. I do not expect the Minister of 
Finance to come with a new budget next week. He is there to 
explore new ideas. We on this side of the House can have new 
ideas.
<P>
	In the case of the Leader of the Opposition, he changed parties 
five times in order to have new ideas. We can have them in one 
party.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, last Friday, 
the Minister of National Defence refused to confirm that 
negotiations were taking place with the Quebec government 
regarding the future of the Collège militaire royal de 
Saint-Jean. Also, yesterday the Prime Minister alluded to 
discussions with the Quebec government, while the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs said that an agreement was 
imminent, this in the presence of his colleague the Minister of 
National Defence, who visibly disagreed.
<P>

<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Can the minister tell us if, according to the agreement which he 
saw, some military activities will be maintained, as requested by 
the Quebec government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we are negotiating with officials from the Quebec 
government to determine the best possible use for the facilities 
in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	When you are negotiating, it is somewhat like a poker game. It 
would be too easy to put all your cards on the table. What I 
indicated yesterday was that the federal government was 
prepared to negotiate on the basis of renting for $1 per year the 
buildings and the property, which are valued at about $42 
million. This is the basis of our negotiating position. The details 
will be known later.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary is for the Prime Minister. Given the very 
contradictory statements made by officials of his government, 
could the Prime Minister tell us exactly what the situation is 
regarding negotiations with the Quebec government on the 
future of the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as I just said, we do not negotiate in public. We 
indicated to Quebec government officials what our terms are, 
and they, in turn, informed us of their preferences. There is no 
disagreement between ministers of this government, including 
the Prime Minister, because we looked at this issue together. It 
will take a few days or weeks before the outcome of the process 
is known.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JOBCREATION">JOB CREATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Senior ministers of the government continue to send out 
contradictory signals on an old idea, namely the government's 
promise of job creation. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development says that this government will initiate job creation 
directly by spending more tax dollars. The Minister of Finance 
now refers to high taxes as a cancer on job creation and told Don 
Newman on <I>Capital Report</I>: ``We are going to cut government 
spending and we are going to cut it severely''.
<P>
	These statements do not represent a balanced approach. They 
represent a contradictory approach to job creation. Can the 
Prime Minister tell us which of these senior ministers is 
accurately representing the position of the government on job 
creation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
say to the leader of the Reform Party that our program on job 
creation was tabled in the House of Commons a few weeks ago 
in the budget. He has only to read the budget and he will know 
the position of this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not know how to put it more plainly. The government cannot 
spend more tax dollars and cut spending at the same time. We 
cannot have one minister with his foot on the gas, one with his 
foot on the brake and nobody with their hand on the wheel, even 
if they are driving around Detroit.
<P>
	There is a deep, inherent, systemic contradiction in the 
government's job creation strategy. Will the Prime Minister tell 
Canadians how and when he proposes to resolve this 
contradiction?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have cut expenditures and we are spending money on job 
creation with the municipalities and the provincial 
governments. It is a program that was approved by all first 
ministers and all mayors, including the mayor of Calgary. I have 
said that many, many times.
<P>
	We have a very dimensional approach to this problem. It is the 
same situation as yesterday when two of his colleagues stood up 
to ask us to spend more money. Every time the leader of that 
party stands up, he tells us not to spend money. When will he put 
order in his little house and we can run our big house?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the statements made by members on this side are not in support 
of spending money.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister acknowledged that public 
works spending only creates temporary jobs. His own Minister 
of Finance has said that debt and increased taxes kill long term 
private sector job creation.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister not commit his government to 
long term private sector job creation? Why does he not resolve 
this difference by coming down hard and unequivocally on the 
side of deficit reduction and tax relief?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we did it when we reduced the level of contribution for 
unemployment benefits. We have cut $300 million in this 
program which will permit small and medium sized businesses 
to create jobs. At the same time we said that we have to invest 
money in research and development. Just yesterday one of his 
colleagues was asking for even more money to be invested in 
that field.
<P>
	Our approach is that we want jobs created by the private 
sector. In fact, there is no plan for increasing the public sector. 
Building roads and bridges is not wasting money. It is important 
and is adding to the productivity of the nation. Any nation that 
<P>
<HR>

nations that have to move around in a horse and buggy.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
learned with dismay that the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs is playing with the future of the Collège militaire de 
Saint-Jean as if he were playing poker. He will certainly come 
out a loser. In any case, his partner, the Minister of National 
Defence is clearly not in agreement with him. The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs said: ``According to the agreement I 
saw with my own eyes, all operating costs, including taxes, 
would be paid by the province since it would have access to the 
installations free of charge and would have the possibility of 
using the Collège for educational purposes.'' He further said: 
``The property is worth $41 million, we are offering it for $1 a 
year''.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Given this declaration of the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, should we understand that the government is preparing 
not to give, but to lease the Collège militaire to the province and 
wants to keep a tight control over its installations while 
transferring all the costs to the government of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, at this time, the government intends to lease the 
facilities and the land of the Collège militaire royal de 
Saint-Jean for the amount of $1 a year. That in itself constitutes 
an important contribution.
<P>
	The provincial government will have the possibility of 
transforming the buildings in order to create a university or a 
post-graduate school of some kind. In such a case, evidently the 
provincial government will be the one using the facilities for 
activities of its choice and it will therefore have to pay the 
operating costs for the courses given there.
<P>
	The federal government's contribution will be the facilities' 
value, the provincial government's contribution will be the 
operating costs for the courses that will be given there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, would the 
Prime Minister agree that the compromise made by the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs serves only one purpose, to help 
the government get rid of parts of its commitments to 
bilingualism just for one dollar?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to see that the opposition is so concerned 
about bilingualism. I want to congratulate them. It is about time 
they address this issue.
<P>
	We, on this side, are concerned with the whole situation. The 
only problem I have to deal with is an agreement with the 
province about the future use of the facilities at the Collège 
militaire royal de Saint-Jean.
<P>
	Bilingualism and the use of French in the armed forces are 
commitments we fulfilled in the past and which we will continue 
to discharge, according to my colleague, the minister of 
National Defence.

for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	As we heard earlier, the government is considering a human 
resources tax credit to subsidize hiring. As a small businessman 
I can assure the Prime Minister that business people do not want 
more government subsidies to stimulate employment and do not 
want to be told how to run their businesses.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has stated repeatedly that he is counting 
on small business to create the majority of jobs so desperately 
needed by 1.5 million unemployed Canadians.
<P>
	Why then does he not listen to what small business people are 
telling him about job creation: ``Get out of our pockets, get off 
our backs and get out of our way so we can create the real jobs in 
the new economy''.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the hon. member would look at the budget papers he would see 
that we have taken a lot of initiatives to help small and medium 
sized businesses. We talked not only about the reduction of 
unemployment insurance premiums, but about helping them to 
get more credit from the banks, to get credit for innovations to 
help them in exports, and they all welcomed that.
<P>
	I say to everybody that the government is here to help, not to 
hurt. That is exactly what this government is trying to do with 
small and medium sized business at this time.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, while the 
Prime Minister has been a politician for 25 years, I have been a 
businessman. While I can take lessons from him on how the MP 
pension plan works, perhaps he might listen to a word or two 
about people who have worked in the real world for 25 years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2291"> 2291 </A></B>
<P>
	Government programs to help small business are more likely 
to impede rather than to help private sector job creation. Why 
then is the government considering another such impediment, a 
subsidy that will interfere with the business decisions, 
ultimately raise taxes and further impede private sector job 
creation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not understand why the member is taking that line. We have 
not announced anything like that. We are discussing better ways 
to help small and medium size businesses in Canada.

<P>
	Yesterday, we learned that the Kahnawake band council had 
issued an eviction notice to about 143 families that had been 
living on that reserve for several years. Among the arguments 
used to justify that decision, there is the lack of space and even 
genetic purity.

totally contravenes the Canadian Charter of Rights and

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was advised about this problem 
early this morning. It is causing me a lot of concern.
<P>
	The information I have is that in 1973 the Kahnawake band 
council used section 81(1)(h) of the Indian Act which governs 
the use of buildings on reserves to establish bylaws regarding 
the residency of band members and other persons on a reserve.
<P>
	My understanding is there is a case before the courts relating 
to this matter and it would be inappropriate to comment further.

this contravenes the charter of rights.

also personally, to put an end to this disgraceful and 
discriminatory operation, instead of hiding behind legalistic 
rhetoric which in no way reflects the reality that some men and

they were predicted to be in the budget.

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
can tell the hon. member that the Minister of Finance has 
presented a budget which was well received by the Canadian 
people and by the financial community. There are always 
variations in interest rates and neither the Prime Minister nor the 
Minister of Finance are in the habit of commenting on the 
financial market fluctuations.

	For example, let us look at interest rates. Since the tabling of 
the budget, in the last six weeks interest rates have risen 35 basis 
points. The bank rate went up 9 points today. We have had a 
three-quarter per cent raise in six-month government bond rates 
and over a full percentage point in long term rates.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that not only will this cost the 
country in terms of job creation it will also endanger the public 
debt charge cost to taxpayers. It is also important to note that 
already it is costing Canadians millions of dollars in higher 
mortgage payments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

<P>
	Despite our repeated questions over the past week concerning 
Ginn Publishing the government refuses to cast any light on its 
reason for selling the Canadian interest in the publishing 
company to the American giant Paramount.
<P>

that person who by a simple, verbal agreement consented to the 
takeover of Ginn Publishing by American interests?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no refusal to 
acknowledge who was responsible for that. It was a decision of 
the previous government. It was a legally binding decision that 
we were forced to finish up. It was left on our platter when we 
took over as the government.
<P>
	There is no secret as to who is responsible. It is the previous 
government.

	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, they applaud to be called so. 
That is their problem. They are showing their true colours.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister not find the courage to act as he did 
in the case of Pearson International Airport in order to ensure 
that our cultural industries remain Canadian owned? Simply 
cancel the deal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the situation is as described by the Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions. There was  an agreement 
with the previous Conservative government, and it is our 
tradition and obligation as a government to respect agreements 
of this nature signed by our predecessors. At this time, there is 
nothing we can do.
<P>
	If a similar document was submitted to us today, without the 
obligations we inherited from the other government, we might 
make a different decision. However, this is a private contract 
and because the previous government changed its mind, the 
American company took advantage of the situation, as provided 
by the contract, and as the government, we had to respect our 
obligations.

school breaks as qualifying time for UIC.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to

the hon. member may know during difficult fiscal times and 
changing economies we have witnessed an increased use of 
contracting in many industries. This is creating some pressure 
on the UI system.

this one where people are using the UI system, the member can 
rest assured that in most cases they are the victims rather than

	We have already initiated measures in the federal budget to 
rectify this problem. For example it has been suggested that to

<P>
	This government is in the process of opening three new 
lavishly furnished regional ministers offices. One of them is in 
Quebec City, even though there are no ministers from that area 
and there is an office already in Montreal.
<P>

government is not closing regional ministers offices instead of 
wasting another $1.5 million on their proliferation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there has been a review and as a result there had been offices 
closed.
<P>
	The office in Quebec City was opened. That is the capital of 
the province. It is an important part of relations with provincial 
ministers in terms of dialogue with our own ministers when they 
are in that city.
<P>
	However the entire group of ministerial regional offices is 
constantly under review both in terms of cutting costs and also 
determining if there are any offices we could do without. We 
have conducted a review. We will continue to conduct a review 
because we are concerned about the efficiency and effectiveness 
of the use of taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to hear these offices are currently under review.
<P>
	I am a little bit surprised at the answer because in this House 
on April 25, 1986 the Deputy Prime Minister asked in a question 
to the PC government why it was turning its back on pensioned 
workers and opening six ministerial regional offices. This 
government is now doing the same thing.
<P>
	The people of Canada would like to know. Does this mean the 
Deputy Prime Minister has become a PC in Liberal clothing? Is 
this government following a PC agenda?
<P>

Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. Simply put, the response is no.
<P>
	Before the hon. member makes interventions on the floor of 
the House of Commons he should check his facts. Over nine 
ministerial regional offices have been closed by this 
government since it has taken power.

a constant review is being taken with regard to ministerial 
regional offices as well as all expenditures ministers make with

compassionate to immigrants but retain the belief that 
immigration levels must be reduced.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2294"> 2294 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister has repeatedly defended his immigration quotas 
with references to the red book and the outdated Economic 
Council of Canada report. In this case it is clear that the red book 
is not consistent with the wishes of the Canadian people.
<P>
	Could the minister explain why he continues to pursue this 
policy when it is clear Canadians do not support it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the hon. member back 
from his educational journey through metropolitan Toronto. I 
find his statement today at variance with something he told 
residents of metropolitan Toronto. The <I>Toronto Star</I> quoted the 
hon. critic as saying: ``I  don't see our immigration policy as out 
of line with the opinions that I have heard in the last few days''.
<P>
	I caution the member to take one snapshot of a public opinion 
survey and therefore deduce that we ought to make policy on the 
fly. If he were to look at how Gallup has tracked unemployment 
and Canadians' feelings on immigration in the last 25 years, he 
would find that in 1982 almost the same kinds of levels were 
reported by Ekos Research. At the same time in 1988 and 1990 
there was a record 65 to 70 per cent support for more 
immigration.
<P>
	We cannot ask people about immigration like we ask them 
about their favourite flavour of ice cream. It is more complex 
than that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> There is no question, 
Mr. Speaker, that there is an education process involved here.
<P>
	The Reform Party is not opposed to immigration. What we 
oppose is the idea of increasing immigration levels at this time. 
It would appear that a majority of Canadians support our 
position and would like to see the minister's policy reversed.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	In light of these facts, would the minister care to retract the 
statement he made to the press that anyone who disagrees with 
his policy is ignorant and uninformed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not retract because that is 
exactly what I did not say. If any member ought to go around 
retracting statements it ought to be that member for the things he 
said in metropolitan Toronto.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Although the member did say that education 
ought to continue, in another quote from the <I>Toronto Star</I> the

else''.
<P>
	That is what he ought to do. Rather than take one snapshot of 
one poll at one time in the history of our country, let us engage 
fellow Canadians; let us go beyond the superficiality of simply 
one poll and understand the forces at play.

	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, March is the final month of the government's fiscal 
year. This usually means that last minute purchasing decisions 
are being made in most departments before the final date. Often 
the spending frenzy is not based on need. It is commonly felt 
that if there is money in the budget let us spend it.
<P>
	What are the ministries doing to prevent unnecessary 
spending during this month?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
is usually said, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	The Auditor General looked at this matter a number of years 
ago and found that there were some poor cash management 
practices. He was not saying that managers were wasteful in 
their spending at year end but that because the moneys were 
lapsing at year end, the end of March, if they did not spend them, 
they had a tendency to spend them perhaps prematurely, make 
purchases prematurely or spend money too quickly when it 
really was not due on the invoice.
<P>
	To help prevent that, Treasury Board in the last fiscal year did 
an experiment that involved carrying forward some 2 per cent of 
departmental budgets into the following year so there would not 
be this year end frenzy as the member pointed out. That only 
involved a few departments.
<P>
	This year we expanded it to all departments and have allowed 
them to carry over 5 per cent, which I think will help end that 
year end frenzy.

	Why is the government unable at the present time to convince

getting agreement. Not all were there and in fact three abstained.
<P>
	The problem that we now face in particular with the nose and 
tail of the Grand Banks is with ships flying flags of convenience, 
ships that are not members and do not come from NAFO ports. It 
is therefore particularly important for the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans to make perfectly clear in New York that we are not 
interested any more in papering over the differences, in having 
statements of principle.
<P>
	We are interested at this time in the type of concrete success in 
writing down clear prohibitions against fishing that the minister 
of fisheries, I have to admit, was enormously successful with in

	Tariff protection for Canadian apple producers was dropped

dumping apples into Canada. This has devastated growers in 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt and across Canada. The

that it ensure fair trade and enforce Canadian trade law.

question and for the courtesy of some notice of the question.
<P>
	As I am sure he will appreciate, since the decision of the CITT 
is in effect a decision of a quasi-judicial body, it would be 
inappropriate for me to comment in any way on the merits or 
demerits of the decision.
<P>
	However I can confirm that I had the opportunity to meet with 
representatives of Canadian Apple Growers on Monday, March 
7, when they were in Ottawa, in conjunction with the National 
Convention of the Canadian Horticulture Council. We discussed 
a variety of options in terms of how the decision of the CITT 
might be reacted to, including the various forms of appeal or 
other potential reactions.
<P>
	I am now considering the input I received from apple growers 
about a week and a half ago. In due course we will see what an 
appropriate further response might be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the answer from the minister.
<P>
	The Canada-U.S. free trade agreement is supposed to contain 
mechanisms to resolve unfair trade practices. Is the minister 
taking action to use those mechanisms to help Canadian apple 
growers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, the provisions of the free trade 
agreement are one potential avenue that might be pursued. There 
is the potential of an appeal of the CITT ruling to the Federal 
Court. There is also the potential of commencing a brand new 
CITT inquiry.
<P>
	The difficulty with all these avenues is that they take a long 
time. The time factor was of particular concern to apple growers 
when they met me. In terms of my consideration of what the 
government's response might be, I am bearing very much in 
mind the timing issue apple growers had uppermost in their 
minds.

me the documentation I needed for my assignments.
<P>
	As you know, Gilbert Rondeau was the right-hand man of 
Réal Caouette from the Social Credit Party of Canada, as well as 
a worthy representative for the riding of Shefford. Let us not

the House of Commons and the Senate. Serving the Canadian 
Parliament is a little bit of a family tradition for the Rondeaus.
<P>
	Again, I want to express to Micheline and to her siblings our 
deepest sympathy on the death of Gilbert Rondeau, a former 
member of Parliament.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the review of Canada's foreign policy and 
international trade. I anticipate that we are going to have a great 
deal of interest in the review process and I encourage Canadians 
from coast to coast to be part of that greater debate.
<P>
	The upcoming national policy forum is both timely and 
important. The cold war has ended. The foreign policy of many 
countries is drifting and needs to be reviewed. Most industrial 
countries are reviewing their policy on foreign affairs as a result 
of what has happened in a rapidly changing world.
<P>
	I have concerns about the foreign policy, specifically CIDA. 
We will have speakers later today who will deal specifically 
with that so I will comment mainly in the area of international 
trade.
<P>
	International trade perspective to me means opportunities to 
develop our trade with other countries. It means opportunities 
for our businesses to take advantage of these important trading 
deals that we have just concluded.
<P>
	One such opportunity is the expanding trade with Mexico 
through NAFTA. I look forward to Canada participating in that 
very important trade pact as well as the discussion that is going 
to take place about the expansion of NAFTA. As we know, Chile 
is one of the countries that is looking to expand or to become 
part of the NAFTA arrangement. I would encourage our trading 
partners to accept Chile as part of this greater trading pact.
<P>
	Currently 80 per cent of our exports are to the United States, 
our most important trading partner. I want to emphasize that we 
do not want to lose the United States as our most important 
trading partner. I think it is a natural relationship that is going to 
continue. But I do think we have to look for new opportunities as 
well.
<P>
	New opportunities exist in southeast Asia where dynamic 
growth is being experienced. Growth forecasts for this area are 
in excess of 8 per cent annually. That compares with less than 3 
per cent for OECD countries. Southeast Asia is the one place in 
the world where trade is booming.
<P>
	Canada is well positioned to export to this area. Our western 
provinces, particularly British Columbia, have a natural 
advantage in water transportation, a very cheap method of 
transportation.
<P>
	Canada has already had some success in selling into the 
Pacific area. Japan is our second most important trading partner 
and South Korea, of course, rates right up there as number six. 
Among the top 25 markets for Canadian goods are six nations 
from southeast Asia: Singapore, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, 
Indonesia and Thailand. However, our total merchandise 
exports to these six countries only amounts to 2.7 per cent of 
Canada's total trade. I see this as being a real area for growth 
opportunity for Canada. We can and should be doing better in 
this area.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	We have a large untapped resource. I am talking specifically 
about the one million Canadians of Asian origin who possess 
knowledge of the language and the culture. They know what the 
consumer habits are in these countries. They know the business 
norms, the conventions that need to take place. They often have 
family ties in that region. This invaluable knowledge is not 
found in a textbook, but it is very real and should be used.
<P>
	We could be looking at encouraging Asian language training 
in our universities and encouraging our businesses to support 
that. We should also be looking at encouraging our trade 
department to hire more people with a background in that area to 
take advantage of these natural ties.
<P>
	I want to speak specifically about some projections from 
Canadian business. The Canadian Cattle Commission is a good 
example of an organization that plans to take advantage of this 
very rich trading area. It estimates that by the year 2000, which 
is only six years away, exports will increase twelvefold to this 
area, from 6,000 tonnes to 75,000 tonnes of beef annually.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is projecting steady growth in that 
area. South Korea now accounts for a significant amount of our 
feed grains.
<P>
	Canada is a trading nation. Twenty-five per cent of our gross 
domestic product is accountable to our exports in goods and 
services and that sustains over two million jobs in Canada.
<P>
	Our present recovery is being led by solid increases in our 
export trade. Canada has a very good reputation as a leader in the 
trade area. Our Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade has been doing an excellent job of developing markets 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2298"> 2298 </A></B>
<P>
abroad. Canada gained a good reputation as a leader in helping 
to establish the GATT after World War II and now the new world 
trade organization.
<P>
	I believe the trade component of the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade should not be downsized. It 
should be streamlined to become more cost effective. We need a 
strong department promoting Canadian interests abroad. That is 
one way we are going to continue to grow.
<P>
	We heard the minister speak this morning about the review 
that is under way in the department. I encourage him in that 
review. I would also like to encourage him to make our business 
community, our private sector, more a part of our trade 
organization. It should be taken into account in a lot higher 
degree.
<P>
	New emphasis should be placed on putting in place people of 
Asian background specifically in our trade department, as I said, 
to promote trade in southeast Asia. Opening trade consulates in 
emerging countries such as southeast Asia should be examined. 
The joint ventures that were talked about earlier today I would 
certainly encourage in order to make it the most cost effective 
method of promoting our interests abroad.
<P>
	Problems at home must be corrected before we can be 
effective traders. We cannot expect our businesses to operate 
with one hand tied behind their backs. If we cannot give our 
industries a fair chance to compete our efforts are really futile. 
Our companies, small, medium and large which have to break 
into and develop these foreign markets cannot do so effectively. 
They are hampered by disappointing results at home because our 
government will not act responsibly on fiscal management.
<P>
	Taxes must be reduced. Deficits must be eliminated and 
government overspending must be stopped. A greater emphasis 
has to be placed on removing internal trade barriers. We have to 
create the proper climate in Canada to promote business. I 
believe that we must put  into place realistic tariffs so that we do 
not invite challenges from our trading partners as a result of the 
very important negotiations concluded at GATT.
<P>
	In closing, I would certainly welcome a review of our foreign 
policy, our defence policy and our trade policy. These are all 
happening at the same time.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	There is merit in having some joint meetings of defence and 
foreign affairs in order to dovetail these as much as possible. It 
is very important because the policies we are putting in place 
this year will determine where we stand as a nation when we 
reach the 21st century.
<P>
	In my mind it is a very important review. I look forward to the 
process. I hope that as many Canadians as possible will 
participate in this review.
<P>
	I also have some concerns, as does my colleague, as to the 
make-up of the joint committee. I look forward to travelling 
across the country and taking this hearing process to the very 
people who have to make representations instead of having them 
come to Ottawa. That is a very important part of this process as 
well.
<P>
	In closing this is a very important time in Canada's history, 
with the two reviews that are going on. It is not an easy time. All 
countries are facing some kind of a review as a result of what is 
happening internationally with globalization. I hope we can 
meet that challenge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to take a minute to 
thank the hon. member for the support his party is giving to this 
whole policy review.
<P>
	I know members of his party have some objections to the joint 
committee with the Senate, but I am wondering if he would not 
agree there are many senators who could be very helpful. I am 
thinking of former secretaries of state for foreign affairs such as 
Senator Allan MacEachen. Would he not agree that some of 
these senators could provide valuable input to our policy 
review?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member for that very important question. I certainly see there is 
some expertise there.
<P>
	My view is they should make representations to the 
committee in the same way as other witnesses do. The problem I 
have is that they are not elected officials. There certainly is 
merit in having their input because they do have a great amount 
of expertise and knowledge. Perhaps that is one way to 
accommodate that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Could I ask Reform 
Party members if they are dividing their time 10 minutes each?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, our first two speakers will be 
using up the full 20 minute allotment. When we break from that 
mould we will give you the word.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific)):</B> 
Madam Speaker, as my colleagues, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, the Minister of International  Trade and the Secretary of 
State for Latin America and Africa have all mentioned, the 
government believes it is time for a foreign policy review, for a 
review of Canada's international interests and our domestic 
capabilities and constraints in the pursuit of our interests.
<P>
	I have listened carefully to each of their remarks. I would like 
to add my views on Canadian foreign policy and more 
specifically on how it relates to my portfolio as Secretary of 
State for Asia-Pacific.
<P>
	First of all my role as Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific is to 
advise the Minister of Foreign Affairs on Asia-Pacific matters. 
My responsibilities therefore cover both geographic and 
sectoral issues such as political economic matters and social 
development assistance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2299"> 2299 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians recognize the need for job creation in Canada as 
well as the restoration of faith of Canadians in our economy. 
These two goals can be achieved to a large degree through an 
export led recovery. Presently about one-quarter of Canadian 
jobs are directly related to exports.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	The Asian markets for pulp and paper, telecommunications 
and transport equipment, construction materials, agri-foods and 
petrochemicals present tremendous potential for economic 
growth in Canada. At the same time they meet the needs of many 
developing nations. Furthermore the Asia-Pacific region not 
only provides markets for our exports, but it is also an important 
source for the technology, investment capital and skills in which 
we can enhance Canadian competitiveness.
<P>
	Growth rates in much of the Asia-Pacific region during the 
1980s were more than twice as high as the rest of the world. 
Asia's share of world income could rise from 24 per cent in 1989 
to 35 per cent by 2010 and to over 50 per cent by 2040.
<P>
	Canadian businesses must prepare themselves to capitalize on 
the opportunities presented. If they fail to do so then we as a 
nation risk the erosion of those institutions that have made 
Canada the envy of the world.
<P>
	Our success will depend on our ability to achieve greater 
access to these markets and to develop initiatives that will result 
in the provision of the greatest possible competitive advantage 
to Canadian exports. As part of this effort bilateral and 
multilateral economic and trade arrangements with countries in 
the Asia-Pacific region will need to be examined in light of the 
major economic changes taking place.
<P>
	We must also recognize an increasingly important element is 
that Canada's trade and economic relations with the 
Asia-Pacific region will be the development of new institutions 
such as the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. Within 
APEC are included five of Canada's top 10 export markets. As 
we can see, an active Canadian role within APEC is vital to our 
interests.
<P>
	I was pleased that my first official function as Secretary of 
State for Asia-Pacific was to attend the APEC summit in 
November in Seattle with the Prime Minister and the Minister 
for International Trade.
<P>
	APEC, like the region's explosive growth, is a relatively 
recent phenomenon. Since its creation five years ago it has 
become the region's main forum for discussions on regional 
growth, economic interdependence, strengthening the 
multilateral trading system and reducing barriers to trade in 
goods, services and investment. It has also become a major 
vehicle for co-operation on sectoral issues such as 
environmental problems.
<P>
	During my first overseas trip in January to Hong Kong, south 
China, Thailand and Japan I was able to discuss many of these 
issues in more detail. These are some of the fastest growing and 
important markets for Canada. As I have already mentioned 
their needs correspond to many of our skills and expertise areas.
<P>
	We need to devise ways to target government programs and 
resources effectively to assist Canadian companies to be even 
more successful international players. Of particular concern to 
this government is the role of small and medium size businesses. 
They have the potential to be the growth engines of the future 
but often lack the critical mass, the financial resources or the 
technical expertise to penetrate foreign markets.
<P>
	The government must help to facilitate Canadian businesses 
to access the market in the Asia-Pacific region. We have some 
excellent examples of practical initiatives businesses and 
governments are undertaking together.
<P>
	The Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong is 
planning Canada-Hong Kong Trade and Investment Week. This 
event is appropriately being titled ``Profiting from Partnership'' 
and will take place in Hong Kong and Guangzou in early May.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	This initiative, which has the full backing of government and 
industry, has been designed to create networks between business 
people in Canada, Hong Kong and China. It will educate 
Canadians about business opportunities in Asia.
<P>
	As the Minister for International Trade outlined recently, in 
co-operation with the Minister of Industry he has instituted a 
full review of this matter. The aim is to ensure that our small and 
medium size firms have access to the tools and the environment 
needed to compete.
<P>
	Exports and venture financing, delivery of market 
information, co-ordination of government programs and the 
pooling of private sector resources are all issues now on the 
table. By adopting a more market driven approach to trade 
development, one that sees government as an export facilitator 
rather than an export leader, we can use market signals to help 
set our real trade priorities. We need to develop a national 
strategy to tap into the Asia-Pacific market. In order to develop 
the proper  strategy we need to hear from parliamentarians and 
Canadians.
<P>
	However foreign affairs must not only be concerned with 
international trade issues but also with political, social and 
economic matters. During the election campaign the Prime 
Minister clearly enunciated his mission of creating a stronger, 
more independent role for Canada on the international scene.
<P>
	The Prime Minister stated his belief in a government that 
reinforced Canada's reputation for tolerance and openness, one 
with a common sense approach to ensure our values are reflected 
in all aspects of our foreign policy. The Minister of Foreign 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2300"> 2300 </A></B>
<P>
Affairs is working hard to make that mission a reality. I am very 
pleased to have the chance to assist him in this regard.
<P>
	One important aspect of the relationship Canada has with 
many of the nations of the Asia-Pacific region is in the area of 
development. It was not too long ago that the relationship 
between trade, aid and development was viewed by many as 
non-existent. Yet there are many facets to Canada's 
development program.
<P>
	First, assisting societies in meeting their citizen's basic 
human needs has been a pillar of Canada's international 
involvement. However development assistance is much more 
than that. The environment, building peace and security, good 
governance, the promotion of human rights and racial and 
gender equality are also development issues.
<P>
	Development assistance has been particularly effective in 
fostering the development of countries in the Asia-Pacific 
region. In light of the progress achieved Canadian development 
priorities have shifted from isolated project planning to broader 
policy interventions intended to involve Canadians in 
co-operation for sustainable development in the region.
<P>
	CIDA's strategy for the Asia-Pacific region has five broad 
priorities: strengthening the institutional capacity in support of 
sustainable development; co-operating in resolving national, 
regional and global environmental problems; promoting 
co-operation between private sectors in Canada and the 
Asia-Pacific region; fostering institutional linkages and 
networks; and encouraging respect for human rights and 
promoting good governance.
<P>
	As these five priorities clearly demonstrate, the social, 
economic and political aspects of foreign policies are related. 
We as a nation will only benefit from an integrated approach.
<P>
	Just last week I saw these five priorities in action during my 
visit to Bangladesh and Cambodia. Then I left the Canadian 
delegation to attend the ICORC meeting in Tokyo. ICORC 
stands for the International Committee on Reconstruction of 
Cambodia. My main interests were to promote our bilateral 
relations with Bangladesh and Cambodia and to observe first 
hand the effects of Canadian aid programs.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	I was deeply impressed by the commitment of Canada's 
efforts to date.
<P>
	Bangladesh is our biggest aid recipient and despite serious 
ongoing problems caused by overpopulation and environmental 
stress, Bangladesh has made important progress in a number of 
areas including family planning, food self-sufficiency, and an 
economic growth rate of 4 per cent in 1993.
<P>
	Bangladesh is also becoming less aid dependent with donors 
now required to fund just over 70 per cent of its development 
budget compared with 100 per cent some years ago.
<P>
	Our commitment to Cambodia is also of several years 
duration. We were signatories to the Paris peace accord of 1991 
and contributed substantially to the UN Transitional 
Administration Committee that ushered in the new government 
last year.
<P>
	Now that Cambodia has a democratically elected government 
after years of war we are assisting in such crucial areas as 
demining, technical assistance and poverty alleviation in rural 
areas. It is hard to think of a more compelling environmental 
problem than demining. Canada's leading role in helping to 
solve this problem has been recognized by the international 
community.
<P>
	The highlight of my trip was meeting the 13 Canadians who 
are training Cambodian soldiers to complete this most difficult 
task.
<P>
	As Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Focsaneanu explained to 
me, the Cambodian people cannot return to the fields to work the 
land until those fields are safe. Demining is the most important 
part in helping Cambodia to develop.
<P>
	Canada's political relations with the Asia-Pacific region are 
complex and challenging. Since the end of the cold war the 
region has evolved into an area of greater stability, productivity 
and justice. Nevertheless, serious causes for concern remain and 
other potential sources of dispute and conflict also exist.
<P>
	Despite outstanding overall growth, disparities continue. 
While east and southeast Asia are outpacing the rest of the world 
the majority of the world's poor are still in the Asia-Pacific 
region.
<P>
	These uncertainties present major challenges in any review of 
Canada's political and security relations with the region.
<P>
	Perhaps the most encouraging development in recent years in 
the Asia-Pacific region is the growing willingness to address 
security issues and potential problems multilaterally using 
institutions such as the ASEAN ministerial consultative process 
in which Canada is a dialogue partner.
<P>
	The process of multilateral consultation among regional 
governments is still in the early stages and much more work 
needs to be done before the region will  develop practical 
mechanisms for resolving conflicts and disagreements.
<P>
	In the interim informal methods of consultation involving 
academics, businessmen and officials acting in their unofficial 
capacities have developed. Canadians have been playing leading 
roles in these activities, notably in creating the North Pacific 
Co-operative Security Dialogue in 1990.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2301"> 2301 </A></B>
<P>
	Through funding provided by CIDA Canada has also been 
instrumental in fostering consultations on specific areas of 
potential conflict such as the workshops on the South China Sea.
<P>
	In the Asia-Pacific region, as in elsewhere, co-operative 
security means more than just reducing armaments and creating 
barriers to military ambitions.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	There can be no real security if hunger, poverty, social 
injustice and environmental degradation continue. Our foreign 
policy has to be based on a comprehensive approach that 
involves trade developments, the respect for human rights, the 
support of social development and the institutionalization of 
good, open governments.
<P>
	Recently the debate over social injustice in the Asia-Pacific 
region has acquired new dimensions. There are those who have 
argued that democratic development must necessarily take a 
back seat to economic development. However, I am one who 
maintains that in many instances the two are not mutually 
exclusive.
<P>
	Certainly there is evidence that increased political flexibility 
is a by-product of economic liberalization, and governments 
that have opened their markets to international trade are more 
sensitive to the views and reactions of other countries. An 
inward looking society that depends little on trade and 
international investments is less likely to respond to concerns 
raised by foreigners.
<P>
	Trade reduces isolationism. Trade also expands the scope of 
international law and generates the economic growth required to 
sustain social change and development. Economic liberalization 
also leads to a pluralization of interest groups in society. 
Nevertheless, all societies must resolve the tensions between 
individual and collective rights and we must all be vigilant to 
ensure that fundamental human rights are protected.
<P>
	In this regard it is imperative that we as a government 
continue to raise the matter of human rights with those countries 
we believe to be in violation thereof at every opportunity. While 
we respect time honoured traditions and cultures, our position 
has always been that the best guarantee for stability and 
prosperity is a government that is responsive to its people.
<P>
	The topics I have touched on today may serve as a preliminary 
indication of the kinds of issues that will need to be addressed as 
we consider Canada's relations with the Asia-Pacific region 
during the review of Canada's foreign policy. We are seeking 
views and guidance from Canadians in all walks of life to help  
provide directions in the development of our new policies and 
initiatives for the Asia-Pacific region.
<P>
	While establishing strong and effective economic and trade 
relations with our Asia-Pacific partners is a primary focus, we 
shall continue to promote respect for human rights, the 
development of truly democratic political institutions and the 
objectives of sustainable development in our relations with the 
region. Establishing strong and effective economic and trade 
relations with the region is an important goal for Canada. As I 
hope I have outlined, we have much more to offer each other 
than just commercial opportunities.
<P>
	As part of the foreign policy review process I look forward to 
discussing with Canadians their views on expanding our 
engagement with the countries of the Asia-Pacific region across 
the entire spectrum of political, social, environmental and 
economic relations.
<P>
	As a country bordering both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, 
Canada has the opportunity to expand in both directions. I 
believe the time is right for us to realize our full potential as a 
partner in the dynamic developments taking place in the 
Asia-Pacific region and I look forward to hearing the views of 
Canadians on how to best achieve this goal.
<P>
	In the Asia-Pacific region, Canada is faced with a number of 
very important issues. We must continue to establish beneficial 
trading relationships and we must also work hard to promote our 
bilateral as well as multilateral linkages. We must continue to 
support economic and social development in the region, while 
being mindful of its cultural diversities, and we must capitalize 
on our natural human advantages to realize this tremendous 
potential.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to thank my colleague for having described so well a huge 
market and an incredible population. For a number of years, 
very commendable efforts have been made between Canada and 
Asia-Pacific.
<P>
	I come from a rural riding where we manufacture chopsticks. 
We are present on the market, but it is extremely difficult for us 
to break into that market. We have large quantities of wood. My 
colleague talked earlier about pulp and paper. In my area, we do 
have pulp and paper mills.
<P>
	My question is this: Why can we not break into that market? 
What are the main problems? In my area, we know perfectly 
well that relations with the United States and Europe are easy. A 
lot of people who went to Asia did not come back disappointed, I 
would venture to say, but observed that things were a bit slow.
<P>
	What are the main problems we have to deal with in order to 
get a share of that huge market, when we know that 
multinationals can afford to pay lobbyists and when  we know 
that things are easier for them? How can a small business get a 
share of that market?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his question. I have heard the kind of complaint the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2302"> 2302 </A></B>
<P>
hon. member mentioned when travelling across Canada trying to 
investigate the problems facing Canadian industry right now.
<P>
	I cannot agree with him more about the problems faced by 
small and medium sized businesses. However, the problem is 
multifaceted. In a lot of Asian countries the commercial laws are 
not in place. They have different cultures. They also have 
different ways of doing business. Also, because of language 
barriers and so on Canadian businessmen usually have a tough 
time making deals with Asia-Pacific countries in comparison 
with the way we can deal with our European counterparts and 
our North American counterparts. That is why for the past while 
only big business seems to have the ability to make deals with 
the region.
<P>
	That also points to the reason why social development and a 
system of development to help those countries to 
institutionalize good open government are so important in our 
foreign relationships with them.
<P>
	However, at this moment we still have to promote our trade 
for small and medium size businesses. What the department is 
doing now is investigating and looking for an institutionalized 
structure through which small and medium sized businesses 
could reach those markets. Sometimes they could afford one trip 
to the Asia-Pacific region but they might not be able to sustain 
the effort.
<P>
	Through these trade commissions in our posts in those 
corresponding offices and with a more permanent structure in 
place we hope to help the small businessman facilitate them. At 
this moment we are trying to invite trade delegations from the 
Asia-Pacific region to Canada as well as to support our trade 
delegations going to various regions. By matching the 
businessmen on both sides of the ocean, by helping them to form 
partnerships and joint ventures we hope to help facilitate the 
trade effort.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a lot more that needs to be done at the beginning of 
our exploration of that market. The business community has 
done quite a bit on its own. With the government's commitment 
to providing help we can achieve much more in the near future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the hon. parliamentary secretary for his comments. I agree 
with the gist of the member's earlier comments noting that the 
key to future prosperity was going to be in both access to foreign 
markets and enticing foreign investment to come to Canada in 
the sense that the recent GATT negotiations enable us to ensure 
those markets. It is a good move. The approval of the NAFTA is 
also a positive move.
<P>
	One of the ministers who reports to the Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International Trade has mentioned that 
he did not differentiate between foreign affairs and international 
trade, that the two were almost inseparable in many ways. That 
is part of the process we will be going through in the next few 
months in our review.
<P>
	Because the member has a longstanding tradition in the 
human rights movement, I would appreciate his comments on 
whether he believes there should be any linkage between human 
rights or human rights violations and international trade 
opportunities, open doors and so on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
concern about the relationship between human rights and trade 
development.
<P>
	Because of the bilateral relationship between countries and 
the situation of particular countries, the method of dealing with 
the issue of human rights should not be a blanket approach. In 
some cases the government is not willing to have dialogue or 
even open up to trade and communications. We have to deal with 
them quite differently.
<P>
	However in many instances in the Asia-Pacific area, for 
example China and Indonesia, the governments are willing to 
have dialogue on human rights and have been willing to adapt to 
a liberalization of their economies. Many cultural exchanges 
and social contacts through academics and other people are 
taking place. It is through those kinds of exchanges the people 
who are part of the leadership within the countries are 
responding to the concerns of international institutions.
<P>
	In dealing with those cases, trade development with those 
countries is helping to move on to the international stage, to 
participate in international institutions and to respond to the 
international promotion of human rights. At the same time it 
encourages them to respond to international supervision of 
those issues.
<P>
	Through trade we encourage them to participate. That is one 
issue. The other issue is that through trade we can help the 
government and the country to develop economically. If the 
country improves its economic position education centres can 
elevate their awareness of human rights and so on.
<P>
	I always look at trade as part of helping developing countries. 
They are not mutually exclusive. We can pursue trade at the 
same time as helping to promote awareness of human rights in 
those countries. I hope I answered the hon. member's question.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity today to speak to the motion presented by the 
government. Today, the Minister of Foreign Affairs moved that 
the House of Commons and the Senate form a special joint 
committee of the House  of Commons and the Senate to consider 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2303"> 2303 </A></B>
<P>
Canada's foreign policy, including international trade and 
international assistance.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I would like to say a few words about this 
committee. I have no objection to examining Canada's foreign 
policy, including international trade and international 
assistance. I would be delighted and proud to discuss these 
issues because this is a very important area, but I do object to the 
fact that the government is ordering us to form a special joint 
committee of the House of Commons and the Senate.
<P>
	In fact, I will have the honour and the privilege of seconding 
the Reform Party's motion that the Senate should not be part of 
this committee. Let me explain. Quebecers no longer believe in 
the relevance or credibility of the senators and the Senate. 
Quebecers feel they no longer represent what people really 
think, because they are out of touch.
<P>
	Every day, I meet residents of Longueuil who say, when we 
talk about the budget: When are you going to get rid of that 
useless Senate? Between 85 and 90 per cent of the residents of 
Longueuil agree we should abolish the Senate, which is an 
indicator that the Senate's credibility is not that high. And that is 
why I hope the Senate will not be part of this committee.
<P>
	Quebecers gave us a vast majority in Quebec. Fifty-four 
members of the Bloc Quebecois, 20 Liberals and one 
Progressive Conservative were elected in Quebec. With this 
sweeping majority, Quebecers are saying that they want to get 
rid of the Senate, and as a result, it is my duty to say today that I 
object to the Senate being part of this committee.
<P>
	This is the second joint committee the government has 
created, the first being the committee on national defence 
established a few weeks ago, and today the committee on 
foreign affairs. What is the purpose of all this? What is the 
government trying to do? I have come to the conclusion that the 
government wants to dilute the democratic rights of Quebecers. 
By diluting the number of elected members on this committee, 
since a number of senators is being added which reduces the 
proportion of representation by members from Quebec, which 
should be about 25 per cent and will now be only 10 per cent, the 
government is diluting the power of Quebecers on this 
committee. I think this is an insult to the people of Quebec and 
also to the people who elected the Reform Party.
<P>
	I deplore this interference by the senators in our affairs. Is it 
not the role of the Senate to review bills and make 
recommendations for amendments? Quebecers will once again 
feel they have been deceived by authoritarian federalism. And 
that is why I intend to second the motion of the Reform Party 
that the Senate withdraw from this committee.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	In my opinion, it is admirable that the government wants to 
review its foreign policy with respect to  international trade and 
international assistance. There are many reasons why I consider 
this to be an excellent initiative. First, because the world around 
us is constantly changing.
<P>
	Look at what is happening within the European Economic 
Community, the changes in the USSR, the new North American 
agreement, NAFTA, the reunification of Germany and East 
Asia. These changes put a new slant on international relations 
and create new economic realities. We must contend with 
market globalization, with new policies and with new 
democratic structures being set up in the world. Priorities have 
also emerged with respect to human rights, democratic values, 
the policy of life and environmental protection. We are faced 
with new challenges, new players and uncertainties and an ever 
more complex state of interdependence. As a member of 
Parliament representing Quebec and as a citizen of Canada, I 
find it especially important that we re-evaluate our position so 
that we can meet these challenges head on. Exactly what 
changes and challenges are we confronting?
<P>
	Let me begin by speaking about the situation in Europe. For 
the past 30 years or so, Europeans have been trying to come 
together while remaining highly sovereign nations with their 
own language and culture. European nations have been trying to 
achieve economic integration through such means, for example, 
as the elimination of trade barriers, political co-operation and 
new infrastructures. Recently, to improve communication in 
Europe, a decision was made to dig a tunnel under the English 
Channel. This must be seen as a very serious attempt on the part 
of sovereign European nations to unite and work for a common 
purpose. However, as you can see, the process is by no means 
simple. They have been at it for 30 years. Nevertheless, as 
Canadians, we must take these facts into consideration.
<P>
	Let us also consider briefly the unification of Germany. I had 
the pleasure and privilege of being in Germany about one week 
after the wall came down and I can assure you that it was quite 
something. Germans were proud and pleased to be reunited with 
their families after having been split up following the war in a 
rather cavalier manner. I was quite surprised when barely a few 
weeks after the wall came down, Germans decided to reunite 
their country. Today, we should be proud of the German people 
for reuniting to form a great nation and an important power in 
terms of Europe's economic development.
<P>
	However, as Canadians, we have to understand that the 
Germans invested a great deal in Canada, particularly in 
Montreal, in real estate and in other areas. Where are they going 
to invest their money now? Probably they will invest more in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2304"> 2304 </A></B>
<P>
former East Germany. We will have to take this fact into 
consideration, as will the committee.
<P>
	In Eastern Europe, including the former East Germany, 
important changes have occurred. First of all, an economic 
turnaround has taken place. State-run economies have been 
abandoned in favour of market economies. We must also realize 
that all of these countries have become sovereign and that their 
system of government has changed. Democracy and the 
free-market system have taken hold.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The most important of the sweeping changes of recent years, 
particularly in the nineties, was the dismantling of the U.S.S.R. 
First, because it signalled the end of the cold war.
<P>
	For years, we were concerned day in and day out about what 
was going on between the two superpowers, the U.S. and the 
U.S.S.R. This was the cause of conflicts here and there around 
the world. Now that the U.S.S.R. no longer exists, I guess one 
can say that major conflicts have practically been eliminated.
<P>
	But we must not forget that these 300 million people were 
divided into some fifteen republics which have now become 
sovereign nations. National assertion movements in Russia, the 
Ukraine and the Baltic States have led these nations to 
sovereignty and having recognized one another, they can now 
flourish and prosper better. As Canadians and Quebecers, we 
will have to be well informed and prepared to adapt to these 
major changes.
<P>
	All these changes, these major changes cannot be 
overemphasized. I think that most people wondered what on 
earth would happen when the U.S.S.R. decided to let these 
nations become independent and flourish within their culture. 
Such changes affect the economy. In the old days, the 
government had total control on the economy and the people 
were not used to taking initiatives, whereas today they are living 
in a free market.
<P>
	For a hundred years or so, the economy was managed from the 
top. All of a sudden, the people found themselves in a free 
market context. Just imagine the changes and problems these 
people are facing. This causes adjustment problems and we can 
see the changes happening, particularly in Russia. The people 
living in these countries are concerned, and so are we as we try 
to co-operate with them.
<P>
	In that sense, the situation becomes very tricky, economically 
and, of course, politically. It is not sure that the Russians will 
accept switching from a communist system to a free-enterprise 
or open trading system. There could be problems and instability 
for several decades to come. It makes it a little difficult for 
Canadians to know how to deal with them. It is in that context 
that the committee will have to take a very serious look at our 
relations with the former U.S.S.R. countries.
<P>
	There is also the Asia-Pacific region. In that region, Japan in 
particular has become a world economic power and managed to 
position itself very successfully on all world markets. Today, it 
has to redefine its relations with its Occidental trading partners.
<P>
	South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, the four 
dragons of South East Asia as they are called,  together with 
Japan are the driving force behind the region's economic 
development and fierce competitors on the international market. 
We will have to deal with these people and nations.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Let us stop a moment and think about a country that we 
sometimes tend to overlook, but which has a population much 
greater than any other country in the world, namely China.
<P>
	China is a complex country with a population of 1.2 billion. It 
is also undergoing major changes. For several years, it has been 
changing its economy significantly. Last year, China's economy 
grew nearly 15 per cent, compared to Canada, where the 
economy grew about 1.5 per cent.
<P>
	With the development of a market economy, China is 
becoming an economic power. Some predict that China will be 
the world's leading economic power as early as the beginning of 
the next decade. This means that we Canadians will have to 
adjust our relations with China.
<P>
	I had the privilege of going to Japan and the Philippines in 
January and I took note of certain things there. I attended the 
annual forum of Asia-Pacific parliamentarians, where about 14 
countries were represented. The big topic of discussion of 
course was how these countries would unite and create a sort of 
free trade pact among Asian countries. They have trouble 
understanding or accepting that North America is a free-trade 
area. It frightens them. They also want their economic pact, like 
Europe, America and Asia, of course. The Asian countries, 
especially those on the Pacific and in eastern Asia, have started 
to hold discussions about creating their own economic pact.
<P>
	We have also noted what is going on in Asia now. These are 
dynamic countries with intelligent, educated people who want to 
succeed. I can tell you that the economic growth of these 
countries is quite remarkable. Again, we will have to watch 
closely so that we can be in a good position to trade with them in 
future, to develop together and to benefit from their knowledge 
and know-how as much as they can benefit from ours.
<P>
	Let us take North America for example. In North America, we 
have made giant strides to be able to deal with the globalization 
of the economy. The highlight is no doubt NAFTA, which gives 
us the opportunity of joining a North American market of about 
350 million people, one of the largest markets in the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2305"> 2305 </A></B>
<P>
	Especially for us in Quebec, I can tell you that North 
American free trade is very important because Montreal is 
within 1,000 kilometres of 100 million people, 100 million 
consumers, the best consumers in the world. We think that the 
line between the United States and Quebec should be eliminated 
as soon as possible so that we can sell our products and we very 
sincerely believe that the smaller countries always win in trade 
agreements, not the big ones, because the smaller countries 
often have smaller businesses and they can double their 
production  without being noticed. That is how Quebec will 
benefit from it.
<P>
	I was pleased to talk about the whole area of international 
affairs and I will be very active on this committee so that Quebec 
in particular is well positioned to face this global economy, 
these increasingly open markets, and I am convinced that we 
will succeed together, we intelligent members on this 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East):</B> Madam Speaker, I do not 
know whether we should be happy today to debate a government 
motion to appoint a joint committee to consider Canada's 
foreign policy. On the one hand, we are happy to have the 
opportunity at last to discuss Canada's foreign policy in this 
House. We believe an exchange of ideas is necessary so that 
parliamentarians can express their views on the relevance of the 
Canadian government's past and future actions abroad.
<P>
	We must look at the Canadian government's goals and 
policies on diplomacy, foreign aid, security and international 
trade, to name but a few. The Bloc Quebecois thinks that the 
time has come for a comprehensive review of Canada's foreign 
policy.
<P>
	On the other hand, we are puzzled by the government's 
proposal to create a special joint committee. The Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade already 
seems to fulfil the role and mandate proposed for the new joint 
committee. The standing committee has the power to send for 
persons, papers and records, to retain the services of experts, to 
travel to gather the information it deems necessary, and to make 
recommendations on Canada's foreign policy.
<P>
	Why create a joint committee with the same mandate as the 
standing committee? Does the government realize that it is 
hampering not only the decision-making process but also the 
implementation of its foreign policy, and that it might make the 
committee less efficient in the process?
<P>
	As for the presence of senators in the foreign policy review 
committee, we believe, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed 
out, that major foreign policy directions must be defined by 
elected representatives. The members of the other place were 
not elected and do not represent anyone.
<P>
	Of course, we could also talk about waste and duplication but 
I realize that one more committee will not shake the temple of 
bureaucracy and waste. No matter. In this period of budget 
restraints, the government could have avoided this duplication 
of committees.
<P>
	Moreover, the Official Opposition wonders why the Canadian 
government has already undertaken a review of its national 
defence policy before even defining its policy of involvement on 
the international scene. The foreign and defence policies are too 
closely related to have committees work independently from 
one another. It is  to be hoped that the two committees set up by 
the government will consult each other as soon as possible. But I 
am probably dreaming!
<P>
	I could go on and on, but I will take this opportunity to discuss 
specific issues of Canadian foreign policy.
<P>
	As I pointed out earlier, we feel that an in-depth review of that 
policy is in order. Over the years, Canada has made a reputation 
for itself which, we are told, is envied by many. We have to ask 
ourselves why this is the case and try to see if we can be as 
successful in the future by pursuing the same direction, or if we 
should change our way of doing things.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Three activities have enabled Canada to gain this enviable 
reputation on the international scene: the participation of 
Canadian troops in peacekeeping missions, Canada's aid to 
development and, more recently, our efforts regarding human 
and democratic rights.
<P>
	However, Canada's reputation in these sectors could be in 
jeopardy. For example, we were supposed to allocate 0.7 per 
cent of our gross domestic product to development assistance 
programs. The fact is that successive cuts were made by the 
government, so that this aid now represents only 0.4 per cent of 
the GDP. As soon as it took office, the Liberal government 
started implementing the same policy as the Conservatives, 
proposing an additional cut of 2 per cent in the budget for 
international assistance in the coming year.
<P>
	At the rate things are going, Canada's reputation as a generous 
country with poorer nations could be a thing of the past, or at 
least somewhat tarnished. In spite of its enormous problem with 
public finances, Canada remains one the richest countries. The 
Bloc Quebecois does not believe that we will solve our current 
problems by penalizing the poorest people in the world. In the 
context of this review, the Canadian government should ensure 
that the money allocated to international assistance is really 
used to help the poorest.
<P>
	As the Auditor General indicated in his recent report, 
Canadian assistance is neither very efficient, nor very effective. 
Canada must define its objectives and its priorities regarding 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2306"> 2306 </A></B>
<P>
this aid, and it must ensure that these objectives are reached at 
the best possible cost.
<P>
	We, on this side of the House, do not believe that the waste of 
public money is a justification for withdrawing our assistance. 
The process must be maintained and improved, and we should 
even increase aid to poor countries because their needs are as 
pressing as ever. Indeed, in spite of the efforts made, the 
situation of the poorest countries has not really improved.
<P>
	As the Minister of Foreign Affairs mentioned this morning, 
the gap between rich countries of the North and poor countries 
of the South is even wider now. Excessive debt, overpopulation, 
poverty, abusive development of natural resources, inadequate 
education,  high infant mortality rates, as well as reduced life 
expectancy, are all part of daily life in these countries.
<P>
	For example, the World Bank has indicated that the external 
debt of all developing countries has increased from $62 billion 
in 1970 to $1,703 billion in 1992. Moguls and multinational 
corporations are often the ones to benefit the most from such a 
situation. These businesses can take advantage of the extremely 
difficult situation in the poorer countries by overusing human 
and natural resources. In the meantime, the poor countries are 
getting poorer and poorer.
<P>
	One of the most dramatic problems caused by such extreme 
poverty is one of overpopulation. The annual rate of population 
growth reached 2.9 per cent in Africa, compared to 1.1 per cent 
in North America and 0.3 per cent in Europe. This means that the 
fertility rate is higher in Africa than in North America and 
Europe. Developing countries account for 95 per cent of the 
overall growth of the world's population.
<P>
	There are 1.18 billion people living in the industrialized 
world, compared to 4.3 billion in developing countries.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Estimates show that the population in developing countries 
will have increased by 3 billion to reach more than 7 billion by 
the year 2025, compared to an increase of 0.15 billion people in 
the rich countries which would then have a population of 1.35 
billion.
<P>
	Sub-Saharan Africa, already one of the poorest regions of the 
world, will have posted the highest growth rate. A demographic 
explosion is also expected in Islamic countries where it could 
intensify the problems linked to political and economic 
restructuring.
<P>
	Too often, such rapid population growth in the poor countries 
leads to more poverty and overuse of natural resources. If 
projections prove to be accurate, and the world population 
doubles half-way through the 21st century to reach ten billion, 
economic development will need to increase anywhere from 
fivefold to tenfold to satisfy needs. That would have tragic 
implications for the global environment.
<P>
	Health conditions in poor countries are also disturbing. In 
spite of all efforts, a young North American can expect to live 23 
years longer than a young African. In 1970, the difference in 
terms of life expectancy was 25 years.
<P>
	Moreover, 14 million children die each year from poverty, 
sickness and malnutrition. AIDS could also affect development 
and cancel out the effects of several years of assistance. Of the 
estimated 10 million cases of HIV in the world, more than 65 per 
cent are in Africa. Without our assistance, developing countries 
will not be able to stop the spread of the virus, or deal with the 
consequences of this terrible sickness. Canada must be a leader 
in the strategy to solve the problem.
<P>
	We should also mention that the development of poor 
countries is highly desirable, for the welfare of the countries of 
the South as well as our own. We benefit a great deal when these 
countries increase their revenues. The North-South Institute 
estimates that, during the 1980s, the sharp decline in the 
purchasing power of developing countries was responsible for 
the loss of 180,000 jobs in Canada. Development assistance 
cannot be viewed simply as an expenditure. It must also be seen 
as an investment.
<P>
	Moreover, in 1986, the Winegard report reminded us that 
Canadian aid is too closely linked to diplomatic and trade 
interests and not concerned enough with the effective 
development of poor countries. This same report also indicated 
that the primary goal of public aid to development should be the 
development of human resources in poorer countries and that 
this aid must be concentrated in countries which need it the 
most. In fact, it recommended in particular that this goal be part 
of a legislative mandate.
<P>
	The 1988 Canadian policy paper entitled <I>Sharing Our Future</I> 
attempted to answer the concerns expressed in the Winegard 
report, but without achieving the fundamental redirecting which 
had been recommended. The main reason for this failure, we 
were told, were the budget cuts that were applied at that time and 
the fact that CIDA was unable to truly become an organization 
dedicated to help the poor because it was too preoccupied with 
its political and bureaucratic influence.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	In spite of all the government's speeches and papers, public 
assistance still does not get to the poorest countries, regions and 
people. It is estimated that less than 10 per cent of the Canadian 
budget for development assistance is directed to priority areas 
like medical care, basic education, water systems and public 
health. Compare that with the 62 per cent of development aid 
money spent right here in Canada.
<P>
	In tabling its last budget, the Liberal government which 
talked of greater openness in the development and 
implementation of the new Canadian foreign policy, presented 
us with a fait accompli. Indeed, on February 22, the Minister of 
Finance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2307"> 2307 </A></B>
<P>
announced that Canadian assistance would be reduced by $400 
million over the next three years.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians will have to ask themselves an 
important question: ``Do we want to continue enjoying our 
excellent reputation in the world? Have we become so obsessed 
with our problems that we have lost all compassion for the most 
deprived people in the world?''
<P>
	The geocentrism that seems to appeal to some ignores the 
dependency existing between rich and poor nations. This 
interdependency is particularly noticeable in matters of peace, 
environment and population explosion. If today we stop 
showing human solidarity and gradually  withdraw our aid, we 
might well have to face much more serious problems tomorrow.
<P>
	I would like to elaborate further on the thorny issue of world 
environment. In 1972, environmental issues were raised on the 
world stage in Stockholm on the occasion of the United Nations 
Conference on Human Environment. In 1983, the UN General 
Assembly established the World Commission on Environment 
and Development to investigate major environmental and 
developmental problems and to formulate proposals for better 
international co-operation in that area.
<P>
	The Brundtland Commission, as it is called, tabled its report 
entitled <I>Our Common Future</I> in 1987. This report emphasized 
how urgent it was to act on a global scale. It reminded us that 
desertification was increasing at the rate of 6 million acres a 
year, that 11 million acres of rain forest were destroyed 
annually, that global warming might have been as considerable 
during the last fifty years as it had been in the preceding 10,000 
years, and that fuel consumption has increased more than 
30-fold over the course of the last century.
<P>
	This report came to the conclusion that human progress had to 
be promoted in a durable and sustainable way. That is where the 
concept of what we now call sustainable development comes 
from; it means meeting present needs without jeopardizing 
those of the future.
<P>
	Since then, Canada signed five international environmental 
agreements, during the Earth Summit held in Rio in June 1992. 
Canada must continue its efforts to promote sustainable 
development internationally.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to talk briefly on another subject 
which is closely related to all the previous ones. It is the 
protection of human rights in poor and developing countries 
where Canana is involved through aid or trade. Human rights are 
multi-faceted, the main ones being related to basic needs like 
food, housing, health and education. Several countries are way 
off the mark.
<P>
	Canada is among the very active countries in the field of 
human rights, and we hope that it will remain so.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs this morning shared a 
beautiful dream with us. He dreamed of a world, and I quote him 
almost verbatim, ``where there will be no more arsenals, no 
more famine, no more economic plundering, where children 
would go to school, have a roof over their heads and enough to 
eat''.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	I would like to share the minister's dream, but unfortunately 
the means announced in the Main Estimates quickly brought me 
back down to earth.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my colleague's comments about 
Canada's reputation in the world and the fact that it might be 
threatened. She listed in her arguments what we might call a 
tripod of this recognition  of Canada's contribution to the world 
being foreign aid, peacekeeping, and respect for human rights.
<P>
	Then in her remarks she simply addressed herself to one of 
those three issues, making clear that on the basis of the fact we 
have fallen short of our .7 per cent target in foreign aid somehow 
our reputation is about to be greatly threatened and undermined.
<P>
	Could I remind the hon. member that we are second to none in 
the world today in our efforts in peacekeeping. We ought to be 
very proud of that fact, and I am sure we all are. In the matter of 
human rights, again Canada has a loud voice and is a champion 
for better human rights both at home, as we have heard day after 
day in the responses of the minister of immigration to certain 
sentiments that we do not share on this side of the House about 
welcoming people to Canada, and in our efforts to encourage 
other governments to respect human rights where it is not the 
case in their own countries. Just a few days ago I raised in the 
House the matter of the situation in Chiapis, Mexico, and the 
concern of many Canadians about it.
<P>
	The hon. member has made reference to these three points. 
She castigated the government in saying that we were only at .4 
per cent and that somehow this was threatening our reputation in 
the world. She then went on to speak about interdependency 
among countries, what one might call supranationalism.
<P>
	I applaud that and I certainly second her sentiment there. 
However it is amazing to hear that from a member of a party 
with a political agenda to return to the petty nationalism of the 
19th century which preached that a nation must be based solely 
on the fact that those who speak a language must therefore in and 
of themselves become a nation and would seek to destroy the 
new experiment in nationalism represented in Confederation, a 
neo-nationalism that Macdonald and Cartier along with many 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2308"> 2308 </A></B>
<P>
other Canadians had the vision to put forward in this great 
country.
<P>
	I listened with interest to the hon. member and to the leader of 
her party earlier today. I was saddened to hear their arguments 
based on a type of nationalism that is at least a century and a half 
out of date. Indeed it was the dream of the 19th century and 
became the nightmare of the 20th century with some of the most 
destructive wars in the history of mankind. It is amazing to me to 
hear such sentiments of interdependency of nations, which I 
applaud, coming from someone who is a member of a party with 
such a destructive political agenda, at least very destructive for 
this country.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not believe that if the Bloc's agenda 
was achieved and Quebec did tear itself apart from the rest of 
Canada, Canada without Quebec and Quebec without Canada 
would certainly fall far short of what we would achieve in the 
world by being together as a nation? Does she not see that as 
perhaps the greatest threat to our reputation in the world, and it 
comes from her own party?
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member touched on 
many of the points I just made. I am not sure he understood very 
well what I said. As a matter of fact, I praised Canadian foreign 
policy in many areas without making any reservation or 
omission in that regard. I think I was fair in my remarks because 
I am here to speak in good faith of our foreign policy and tell the 
government what I think that policy should be. I will keep this 
same attitude for as long as I sit in this House.
<P>
	There is another point on which I would like to comment. The 
hon. member seemed to imply that, among the very few 
reservations I had, I criticized the government for spending only 
a small percentage of our GNP for official development 
assistance. I was referring to a Liberal commitment in the red 
book saying that Canada would renew its promise to allocate 0.7 
per cent of its GNP for ODA. That was the gist of my criticism: I 
simply said an election promise was broken. As to the rest, I feel 
I was very kind in my assessment of Canadian foreign policy.
<P>
	As to what the hon. member labelled as the narrow 
nationalism of the Bloc Quebecois, I would say nationalism is 
not only a matter of language. He is the one who made a link 
between nationalism and language. I think nationalism is much 
more than that. It is a culture. The Leader of the Opposition was 
perfectly clear on that this morning. I will also point out to you 
that in his speech this morning, the minister of Foreign Affairs 
referred to nationalism, rather ultra-nationalism, which in my 
view is not consistent with the ideas of the Bloc.
<P>
	If we look at globalization of trade and markets, despite this 
phenomenon of globalization, we still are confronted-the 
minister of Foreign Affairs said it this morning-by the 
nation-state, and you know that Quebec considers itself as a 
nation. It is in that sense that we talk about nationalism, because 
we consider ourselves as a nation, a nation with a culture, with a 
language, with a history which, from the outset, was different 
from that of English Canada.
<P>
	It is in that sense that we feel that a nation-state may very 
well-and its has been clearly demonstrated recently-we feel, 
I repeat, that a nation-state, however small it may be, may very 
well survive among nations increasingly interdependent. This 
is, in my view, the idea that the Bloc has always been trying to 
defend. That does not mean a nation closed to the world, that 
does not mean that we are going to apply the geocentric theory 
which I mentioned earlier. On the contrary. In my view, Quebec 
has always been very open to the world, hoping to become a 
nation one day and to remain a nation.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to the last few 
moments of debate. I believe Canadians are proud of the 
country's role on the international stage. They see it as a role of 
an honest broker, as a role of a middle power, as a role of a force 
of goodwill and civility. It is also a symbol that has acted as a 
beacon of hope to those who unfortunately find themselves 
displaced. We are particularly proud of the role our immigration 
and refugee policies have played in helping to establish our 
international reputation along the way.
<P>
	Canadians have historically had a humanitarian response to 
people fleeing persecution, whether it was the open arms that 
Canada extended to the United Empire Loyalists or Hungarians 
fleeing communism, whether it was the innocent families 
escaping a murderous dictator in Uganda or most recently the 
helpless Vietnamese boat people who were cast adrift.
<P>
	In a world of dramatic change, however, we can no longer 
view immigration and refugee policies simply as a sporadic 
domestic response to occasional international  crises. Migration 
and refugee issues must be at the forefront of our foreign policy 
concerns for Canada and on the foreign policy initiatives agenda 
of so-called developed countries.
<P>
	In addition, I believe we need to come to grips with and create 
a coherent international population policy to address the 
important issues and challenges raised on the floor of the House 
of Commons today.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe this foreign policy review is a very welcome 
initiative. It coincides with a national consultation on the future 
of our immigration program which we had occasion to launch on 
March 6 and 7. I believe that these two initiatives should not run 
on a parallel playing field, but rather at some point converge into 
one through the many inextricably linked issues.
<P>
	It is very true that immigration programs must be developed 
with an eye to both domestic priorities and domestic concerns. 
That goes without saying. It must take stock of world 
conditions, world pressures and world changes. We cannot 
isolate our national programs from our hope for a saner, more 
gentle international community.
<P>
	We also need a wide breadth of vision in recognizing that 
whenever we try to extend help to humanity in some corner of 
this globe, we are at the same time putting in the first footings of 
the foundations of bridges that will one day transport more than 
just goodwill, but be transformed into social and cultural and 
economic advantages for both countries.
<P>
	I believe that in eastern Europe where the Berlin wall has 
come down that immigration can be one of those bridges, not to 
try to have a brain drain when those countries are trying to find a 
footing and develop a dynamic and exciting new society, but 
rather to try to meet some of the aspirations of those people who 
wish to immigrate to Canada where there is already a history and 
a proud tradition of that. I believe that it goes beyond just 
immigration.
<P>
	With respect to eastern Europe and some of the countries 
therein, we need to show our support now during this difficult 
transition time and not later on in the next generation when 
obviously we will be seen to be trying to reap the rewards of a 
consuming society.
<P>
	What steps then must a democratic, pragmatic, fair-minded 
country like Canada take to help find new answers in a new 
world? Recent years have seen a sharp rise in the number of 
global migrants. There are as many as 100 million migrants on 
the move around this globe. There are almost 19 million 
refugees, double the number in 10 years. There are almost 20 
million individuals displaced in their own countries, including 
some four million individuals from the former Republic of 
Yugoslavia. Therefore, there are many root causes for all the 
migration. We need to understand and analyse the forces at play 
that mobilize this colossal movement of humanity.
<P>
	My hon. friend from the other side touched on some of these: 
civil wars, deep and persistent poverty, mass violation of human 
rights, environmental degradation, lack of solid, viable long 
term economic opportunities, globalization, uncontrollable 
urbanization, better communication and easier transportation 
and, of course, the global recession that has touched both 
developed and developing countries.
<P>
	There are some who would close their eyes and others who 
would want to close their borders. I suggest that neither of those 
actions will stop the problems nor the solutions from coming 
forward. As a modern society we cannot afford to have an 
international corridor of locked doors. We know that to be the 
case. An international corridor of locked doors will only reroute 
the traffic through our back doors and through our side windows.
<P>
	Of course Canada cannot solve the problems alone. However, 
by working in co-operation with other countries, clearly we can 
help to find international solutions to what is an international 
phenomenon, that of migration. We as a country can offer that 
leadership because we are truly an international country if we 
stop to think about the kinds of exciting characteristics that 
define Canada.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2310"> 2310 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	We are an international country. Canadians have roots in 
every corner of the world. Therefore we should take heart about 
that dynamism and ask ourselves what country is better poised 
in this new global village to try to seek to mobilize the 
leadership for such an international consensus. We should not 
sell ourselves short. One of the criticisms that we sometimes 
hear is that we are too meek on the international stage. Yet, on 
this issue of global migration, we have offered leadership. It is 
there, it is documented and it is a source of pride.
<P>
	In my few remarks I do not wish to try to predetermine the 
outcome of the foreign policy review as it deals with migration 
pressures. Rather, I would like to raise some serious questions 
and issues which I hope will receive the careful reflection of this 
joint committee and of the speakers subsequent to my 
deliberations.
<P>
	For instance, while Canada has been a forceful advocate of 
individuals' ``right to leave oppressive regimes'', can we go one 
step further and become a forceful advocate of people's right to 
stay in their homelands? What can we do to make emigration a 
matter of choice and not simply a matter of desperation and lack 
of options? How can Canada help strengthen the role of the 
United Nations High Commission for Refugees that is looking 
for assistance to strengthen its resolve?
<P>
	When most refugees selected by our western world happen to 
be men, what can we do to recognize and balance the reality that 
most refugees in the world overwhelmingly are women and 
young children? How can we encourage international 
co-operation to address the root causes of involuntary 
migration? Can we find  new means of fostering economic 
development, human rights, conflict prevention, population 
planning and environmental sustainability?
<P>
	What role can international fora such as the Commonwealth, 
la Francophonie, the OECD, or the G-7 play in developing a 
much needed integrated population policy which currently has 
gone by the wayside and which leaves a large, large vacuum?
<P>
	What role can and should our trade policy play in the 
reduction of migration pressures? What role can Canada's 
immigration program play in helping developing nations 
strengthen their own countries and develop their own human 
resources to the fullest of their potential?
<P>
	What is the role that technology can play in this equation of 
migratory pressures? Have we reached the point where we must 
consider migration impact like environmental impact questions 
in the development of our foreign and aid policies?
<P>
	These are some of the questions and issues that I would like to 
put on the table for further discussion because in the red book in 
the last election campaign we pledged as a party to adopt a more 
comprehensive strategy toward national and international 
security, including sustainable development, global economic 
prosperity, support for democracy and solving problems through 
multilateralism.
<P>
	As Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, I increasingly 
see how critical our success in developing such a comprehensive 
strategy will be to the future manageability and success of our 
own domestic immigration programs.
<P>
	I believe and I urge that migration issues and migration 
pressures must be a central focus of Canada's foreign policy 
agenda as we move together toward the next century. They will 
be on the agenda, for instance, at an important United Nations 
conference which will take place this September in Cairo, 
entitled the United Nations Conference on Population and 
Development.
<P>
	At this particular forum, and at gatherings subsequent to this 
forum, we need to search and find new kinds of world-wide 
co-operation to ensure that migration is a positive force, not a 
destructive force, and an engine of development serving the 
interests of migrants as well as the aspirations of both the 
sending and the receiving countries alike.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	We must seek co-operation to establish stronger international 
regimes and strengthen an international resolve to address the 
force of world migration, to encourage conditions to permit 
people to remain in their homelands and to ensure that when 
people are forced to seek refuge that there is an international 
community that is not oblivious or indifferent, but receptive to 
their plight.
<P>
	It is through this working partnership to achieve this objective 
that Canada's foreign and immigration policies can indeed find 
common cause and common ground.
<P>
	If one looks at public opinion surveys, and I think a few 
minutes ago my colleague touched on this nerve, Canadians are 
looking for symbols, institutions and initiatives that give a sense 
of pride, meaning and purpose to our country called Canada. I 
think the element of this debate is such a useful exercise because 
an exercise such as this, that goes beyond our own domestic 
borders and looks internationally abroad and talks about the 
dreams that the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about earlier, 
is the vacuum that Canadians want us to fill. It is a unifying 
force.
<P>
	We may have differences in how we approach these individual 
international problems, but it is a force that unites us as opposed 
to a force that divides. It is a reputation that not only would give 
us a sense of pride but would reinforce the reputation that we 
have developed as a caring and compassionate country. Those 
are not empty words or empty rhetoric when one tries to fashion 
a domestic policy that is in keeping with an international dream 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2311"> 2311 </A></B>
<P>
or a more gentle version of a world that sometimes is more filled 
with disorder than order.
<P>
	Every time we make a ripple in the world it sends out a signal 
and an example to other countries. That is what multilateralism 
is all about. What we seem to be doing on this issue is not only 
important domestically, but given that we have had a track 
record and a leadership role it becomes doubly important. What 
we do in this area, speaking quite modestly, can have an impact 
on how other countries view the problem.
<P>
	It is not a question of trying to preach or lecture to other 
countries or try to say that we preach from a pulpit of perfection 
where we have a monopoly on virtue. Not at all. Some 
Canadians would say that we have our challenges from within. 
The poor, ravaged by the recession, would argue: ``Why are you 
spending a day in Parliament talking about problems that seem 
so far away? Why do we not take care of the problems here at 
home first?'' Other voices would suggest: ``Why are we 
allowing the doors to still remain open for those seeking refuge 
when there are individuals here who are not meeting their own 
dreams and never mind the dreams of a very complex, confused 
world?''
<P>
	We hear those voices. Those are tough questions. Those tough 
questions do not always have easy, ready made answers do they? 
I think we feel and we sense as members of Parliament that on 
the one hand we need to listen to those concerns because without 
being rooted in that reality we are lost in this place. This place 
means nothing unless this debate becomes realistic and people 
out there connect with us and through us.
<P>
	In the other sense, we also feel that when we come together as 
members of Parliament in the institution of democracy in 
Canada and where our constituency all of a sudden becomes 
national, we have a responsibility to go  beyond our riding 
boundaries and also consider the international plight of our 
fellow brothers and sisters. Do we not? Our work as members of 
Parliament would be less if we simply thought of what could be 
good parochially speaking for each of us or each of our ridings.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	We have to go beyond that. We have to try to broaden and 
elevate the debate to see that the world's problems are really 
problems for us indirectly. We can reach out and build those 
bridges and seek those solutions. If we stop to think selfishly for 
a moment it is beneficial for this country as well.
<P>
	Linkages in the world today are absolutely vital. McLuhan 
talked about the global village and it is certainly here. The 
rapidity of technological and communications change links us 
whether we like it or not.
<P>
	The global marketplace will belong to countries that are 
forward thinking, that are creative in trying to come to grips 
with old problems. It will belong to countries that seek the 
pioneering work which is very difficult but reaps benefits.
<P>
	As fellow human beings we owe it to the world to try to make 
it a better place. Most of those people on the move would rather 
not be. Most immigrants to Canada, including my parents, 
would rather have stayed where they were. However they were 
compelled and forced to pack their bags and move without really 
knowing where the train would take them.
<P>
	However ask those individuals today what the best decision 
was in their lifetime. Nine out of ten will say it was packing 
those bags. As painful as it was then, the best decision was to 
pack their bags and to adopt a new country, Canada. Those 
individuals are prepared to line up to defend and to stand on 
guard for thee.
<P>
	We should not forget that because those movements still exist. 
Individuals look to Canada, look to the United States, look to 
Australia, look to New Zealand and other countries that ought to 
be in this group for a beacon of hope.
<P>
	I hope this foreign policy debate will view immigration and 
refugee policies as an extension of that foreign policy, in how we 
deal with those people on the move and how we position our 
country for the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Madam Speaker, I was most 
interested to hear what the minister of immigration had to say. I 
am sure that the people of Chambly and the people of Quebec 
and Canada are thinking along lines that are not too far removed 
from the points the minister is trying to make.
<P>
	In this House and elsewhere, unfortunately, the minister is 
asking questions and I hope he is willing to hear the answers or 
at least our attempts at providing answers because in our society, 
there are some subjects that are taboo. Today, we cannot talk 
about capital  punishment or immigration or other topics that are 
not considered politically correct in our society, even if we just 
want to obtain information and perhaps come up with the same 
solutions or objectives as the minister.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The minister asked us some questions. He said: ``Canadians'', 
and this includes Quebecers until further notice, ``must take a 
position and do some serious thinking''. However, when we do 
that, we are not always politically correct.
<P>
	The minister approached this subject by tugging at our heart 
strings. Of course there are some sad situations in the world and 
there are people who really have a lot of problems. However, I 
would have appreciated it if, for once, the minister had not 
played on our emotions, because at times we have let our 
emotions go beyond what we could afford. I wish that, for once, 
the minister would show us some figures and prove his point this 
way, and I am sure he would succeed, but I wish he would stop 
playing on our emotions and use scientific and economic data to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2312"> 2312 </A></B>
<P>
give us some hard facts that prove what he thinks and what I 
think, namely that these are issues that will benefit Canada. 
There is no doubt that immigration benefits Canada. Our 
country is where it is today thanks to immigration.
<P>
	However, to satisfy people who sometimes argue on the basis 
of false premises, I would have liked the minister to explain 
from the mathematical point of view how he reached this 
conclusion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Madam Speaker, the member raises an 
interesting point. The whole matter of immigration and refugee 
migration is a very emotional subject to start with. Some 
members have accused me of being over-emotional at times. I 
suppose I am at times but that is the nature of this federal public 
policy area.
<P>
	I would go out on a limb and suggest it is probably the most 
emotional area of federal public policy. It deals with people 
wanting to come here. It deals with people being denied the 
chance. It means there is only room for so many individuals and 
family reunification individuals feel that very emotionally.
<P>
	On the one hand the issue is emotionally charged. On the other 
hand the hon. member is right. Our challenge as government and 
as a Parliament when dealing with immigration and refugee 
migration movements whether it is to Canada or internationally 
is to divest ourselves as much as we can of our emotionalism and 
to talk about it rationally. That is very much the object of the 
exercise I launched on March 6 and 7.
<P>
	What did I say when we announced the immigration levels for 
1994 back in February? In addition to the numbers, we talked 
about a new way of consulting and engaging Canadians. It was 
not an attempt to superficially massage the issue. Rather it was 
to go beyond that and to engage Canadians on the facts and 
numbers and on what  the member referred to as the 
mathematical or scientific equation of immigration refugee and 
migration. I welcome that thinking because that is what those 
consultations are about.
<P>
	I was accused today for example during Question Period of 
calling people ignorant when they perhaps had a thought that did 
not agree with mine or with government policy. I made no such 
categorization of individuals. I repeat what I have said in this 
place before. It would be too easy to dismiss individuals who 
have concerns and we should not because those concerns are 
genuine.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that we assume and accept any perception 
people have about immigration or refugee or migration 
movement. There is a middle ground. In a sense we can try to get 
to that common ground and try to learn from each other and 
allow the facts to be distilled. Let us put emotion, perceptions, 
myths and fiction to one side and let us talk hard numbers. I do 
not fear that kind of debate. That kind of debate brings to the 
fore the true values which have shaped immigration in the past. I 
am confident of that.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	If I have one negative criticism of my predecessors in the last 
10 years of Tory administration it is that they legislated on 
fiction rather than fact. They led with the negative only. They 
did not talk about the positive.
<P>
	Sure there are problems and of course there are concerns. For 
example, it drives Canadians up the wall when a convicted 
murderer makes a refugee application at a Kingston 
penitentiary. It drives this minister up the wall too. There is due 
process. I am trying to make the system fairer but I am also 
determined to close the loopholes which make our tolerance the 
object of ridicule and undermines those who seek to come here 
legitimately.
<P>
	I welcome a discussion based on fact and not fiction, one that 
is rational and not emotional. We would be doing honour to the 
subject matter at hand.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Madam Speaker, 
when I listened to the hon. minister earlier, I was reminded of 
Martin Luther King many years ago. He spoke with a great deal 
of magnanimity and emotion, except that while Mr. King was a 
preacher, the minister holds a position of power. Yet, when a 
very honourable family asks to stay in Quebec , we see that even 
with all the power he wields, he has to tap dance around the 
issue. Clearly this is unacceptable, because he certainly has 
ways to get results.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I do have a question for him. My constituency 
of Matapédia-Matane is as vast as an entire country. My 
question is this: Why is it that new immigrants to Canada 
usually settle in the large cities rather than in the regions? Is it 
because the  unemployment rate is higher in our regions, or is 
there some other reason?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Madam Speaker, it is rather unfair that the hon. 
member tried to categorize this government as being unfair with 
this case or another.
<P>
	One of the realities of this portfolio I am trying to correct is I 
am trying to improve the system by pulling back the system 
from the hands of government and the minister. Right now all 
negative refugee claims whether they are through members of 
Parliament, NGOs, church groups or the media, land on the desk 
of the minister. I do not subscribe to the policy that the minister 
knows best.
<P>
	When we get thousands of cases, how do we begin to 
intervene and make it rational and fair across the board? Do I 
react because an issue was simply in the pages of <I>Le Devoir</I> or 
the Toronto <I>Star</I>? Keep in mind there are 700 other cases that 
could not get on the front pages of <I>Le Devoir</I> or the <I>Star</I>. Do I 
react when someone goes on a hunger strike? Do I move when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2313"> 2313 </A></B>
<P>
someone seeks refuge in a church? Or do we try to have a policy 
that is fair for one and all and that provides adjudication more by 
the system rather than the minister? I have the commitment from 
my caucus and cabinet colleagues to do just that.
<P>
	The member touches on another issue. Largely speaking 
Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver are seen as our chief magnets 
for immigrants and refugees. One of the challenges we can 
address is that if immigration is positive, then it flows logically 
that some of the economically depressed regions could certainly 
use the advantage immigrants bring. The challenge is how to 
encourage immigration to those parts of the country and balance 
that with the mobility rights they obviously enjoy under our 
charter. It is a challenge I hope we come to grips with.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is unfortunate that I did not get an opportunity to question the 
minister following his comments. It was a dynamic question. 
The minister is going to have to wait until another day.
<P>
	Before I start into my main point, I believe no one party has a 
monopoly on love for Canada, for patriotism, for a concern for 
the improvement of the system. When we on this side of the 
House ask questions I hope the minister takes them in the spirit 
they are intended. We may not be as slick as some in the way we 
can present questions and we may not have the years and years 
of experience. However, the love for Canada and a belief that the 
system may need to be improved are part of what we hope to 
have in all our questions, comments and speeches in these 
debates and reviews.
<P>
	There have been a few surprises since I came to Ottawa. I am 
surprised that it can be this cold. I have come during the coldest 
winter in living memory. I guess  I could expect that. I am 
surprised that the salt stains on my shoes never come out. I am 
surprised at the cost of an apartment and I am surprised at the 
workload of an MP.
<P>
	I am also surprised in some ways to find that there are many 
fine MPs on all sides of the House and I commend them for their 
concern in debates such as this as we review important policy 
and try to set the policy that will lead us into the 21st century.
<P>
	I have also experienced one of my greatest surprises during 
the last few days while sitting as a member of the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade. I want to 
pass on some of this astonishment to the House and to anyone 
else who listens today. Hon. members will be more than a little 
surprised to hear some of the things that have come up in the last 
few days in this important committee.
<P>
	Our committee is undertaking a sweeping foreign policy 
review. Part of that is happening here today. Over the next few 
months we will begin comments on foreign policy from this side 
of the House, talking about an agency I would like to focus on 
today, integral to Canada's foreign policy.
<P>
	This agency is responsible for delivering 80 per cent of 
Canada's foreign aid and dozens of other nations shape their 
concepts of Canada through their contact with this agency. Its 
budget is huge and the very lives of thousands and sometimes 
hundreds of thousands of people depend directly upon it. CIDA, 
the Canadian International Development Agency, is a very 
important agency, an organization in our foreign policy.
<P>
	Let me say a little bit about CIDA. It falls under the authority 
of the Department of Foreign Affairs. It began in 1968 with a 
budget of $279 million. Today its budget is over $1 billion. It has 
1,300 employees and is involved in 115 countries around the 
world. These facts do not surprise me.
<P>
	What I find truly incredible are the very basic things that we 
do not know about CIDA. What is the mandate of this 
organization? We do not know. How many and what kind of 
countries is it supposed to work in? We do not know. What kind 
of aid is it supposed to deliver? We do not know. Is it doing a 
good job? We do not know that either, we have no idea.
<P>
	The few answers we do have are just as surprising. What 
legislation brought CIDA into existence? There never has been 
any legislation. CIDA is a creation of cabinet. Is it directly 
accountable to Parliament for the billion dollars it spends every 
year? Not at all. Is there the political will to make it 
accountable? The answer is a simple no. I found that out from 
the minister last Thursday.
<P>
	The minister appeared before the foreign affairs standing 
committee to present the estimates and I asked him if he felt it 
was a problem that there was no legislation spelling out CIDA's 
mandate. With some characteristic, political caution he said that 
laws are  useful but not necessary. Then he added that laws could 
become an impediment.
<P>
	I could read between the lines of these statements. I think he 
meant the government may not want to bring CIDA under the 
direct control of Parliament because legislation by its very 
nature is restrictive. It says that there are some activities that we 
cannot do or that we cannot take part in. Or it could mean if we 
create legislation that gives CIDA a humanitarian mandate, for 
instance, we will not be able to use the organization as a political 
tool of foreign policy or an economic tool of Canadian 
commercial interests. We would restrict our freedom to 
manipulate CIDA by introducing legislation.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2314"> 2314 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	This would be a bit more acceptable if there were not grave 
problems with CIDA, problems that can only be solved by 
legislation. The Auditor General included an entire chapter on 
this organization in his last report and he exposed fundamental 
shortcomings which could be mitigated by enacting appropriate 
legislation.
<P>
	The Auditor General says that the first problem is one of 
conflicting objectives. Some see CIDA as an instrument of 
Canadian business, others as an agent of humanitarian aid. 
CIDA does not know what it is supposed to do. It stumbles along 
trying to please both sides but pleasing neither very effectively.
<P>
	CIDA, very simply, is overextended. Its activities are spread 
too thin, we are in too many countries doing too many things to 
be much help in any one place. We need to have a sharper focus 
to our foreign aid.
<P>
	The Auditor General says that CIDA is also too bureaucratic; 
is it any wonder when we realize that it has 1,300 employees but 
only 125 actually work overseas? I was astonished to learn this. 
That is an average of only one CIDA representative per country 
that we are represented in.
<P>
	CIDA's management style is also inappropriate. In the past it 
undertook more physical projects like building bridges or 
building roads. Its project managers knew a lot about how to 
build bridges and how to build roads. Today CIDA is involved in 
a far wider range of activities such as policy advice and human 
resource development. Its managerial expertise, though, has not 
changed to match its new activities and the result is that CIDA 
has not been able to properly dovetail its current staff to the new 
and evolving tasks which it has been asked to accomplish.
<P>
	The Auditor General says that CIDA needs to be more 
accountable. I could hardly believe it when I read that when 
CIDA signs an agreement with a foreign government to 
complete a project there are no required results set out in the 
agreement. There is no independent on site monitoring of the 
project and there are no clear budgetary limits. There is no 
legislative requirement to evaluate CIDA's involvement and 
report those results directly to Parliament.
<P>
	These are all very theoretical. In a practical sense what kind of 
problems result from these types of inadequacies? I will cite just 
one example.
<P>
	The Auditor General took pains to tell us about Bangladesh 
where Canada has spent approximately $2 billion over the last 
25 years. In one village officials counted more than 80 separate 
international aid groups and the Auditor General said: ``That 
country could not possibly absorb and use in a cost-effective 
way all the development assistance it was already getting from 
the multiple donors''.
<P>
	Bangladesh still receives 40 per cent of all CIDA funding. It is 
no closer to being self-sufficient than it was 25 years ago, and 
there seems to be no process for deciding if it should remain 
Canada's top priority.
<P>
	These are very significant problems. If they were ever to be 
resolved we as Canadians should consider a deeper, more 
philosophical question about CIDA, one that goes to the heart of 
our national character. Before we enact legislation to enable 
CIDA to solve its own problems we must answer this basic 
question or it will be impossible for CIDA to become effective.
<P>
	For a quarter of a century CIDA has been the arena of a great 
struggle within Canada, a struggle about Canada's motives for 
giving foreign aid. The problems exposed today earlier in my 
speech are just symptoms of this greater struggle. Should our 
motive be to help poor people, with no strings attached, or 
should our motivation be to profit commercially in some way 
through aid for trade arrangements?
<P>
	If our motives are to help the poor, we must realize that we 
will not be repaid in an economic sense. If we want to benefit 
Canada's economy through foreign aid, we will likely turn away 
from the poor and divert those resources to richer nations with 
potential for increased trade with Canada, thereby increasing 
our own wealth.
<P>
	In 1987 the standing committee on external affairs authored a 
very popular report called the Winegard report which recounted 
many of the administrative problems that I have already 
discussed and also tackled this deeper question about CIDA's 
role. The report was entitled ``For Whose Benefit?'', which 
implies the question who are we helping. Do we really want to 
help others, or is giving aid just another way of helping 
ourselves?
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	That same committee in 1987 made it clear where it stood on 
the humanitarian versus the market orientation question. Its 
very first recommendation was that the government adopt a 
development assistance charter as part of a legislative mandate 
for Canada's development assistance program.
<P>
	It recommended legislation and stated as the first principle of 
that legislative charter that the primary purpose of Canadian 
official development assistance is to help the poorest countries 
and the people in the world.  The committee acknowledged and 
upheld that humanitarian concept of foreign aid and the 
government of the day, the Conservatives, paid lip service to 98 
of the 115 recommendations found in the Winegard report.
<P>
	During the last election the Liberal Party also spelled out a 
continuing commitment to humanitarianism. Government 
seemed to be consistent in its support of humanitarian goals and, 
to that end, consistent in its desire to reform CIDA. Nothing is 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2315"> 2315 </A></B>
<P>
ever actually accomplished because the underlying question has 
never been resolved through legislation.
<P>
	The continuing struggle was echoed just one week ago and 
addressed to our standing committee by the president of CIDA. I 
sympathize with her. She is trying hard to please two masters 
here. On the one hand she attempts to please the humanitarians 
in the crowd by telling about CIDA's accomplishments with the 
poorest of the poor, and there are some very positive 
accomplishments and achievements there. On the other hand she 
also tries to please the more market oriented people by noting 
with some pride that 60 per cent of CIDA's foreign aid is 
actually spent right here in Canada to support Canadian 
businesses. That is a direct contradiction and that is where this 
needs to be settled.
<P>
	It is no wonder that members of the global aid community 
shake their heads in disbelief. Obviously there are internal 
pressures to make CIDA an instrument of Canadian commercial 
interests.
<P>
	The so-called Carin paper leaked from the Department of 
Foreign Affairs in late 1992 saw CIDA as a means to promote 
Canadian interests and values abroad. It advised the government 
to shift aid toward richer nations like Russia where we might 
have the chance to develop stronger economic ties. This report 
was never implemented but the trend is clear.
<P>
	This problem and the administrative ones I have highlighted 
are obvious and long standing. The problems and many of the 
solutions were clearly laid out in the Winegard report nearly a 
decade ago. When one reads the latest Auditor General's report 
much of it sounds like the reiteration or the reinvention of that 
same Winegard report.
<P>
	There is a continuing lack of political will in the government, 
as revealed by my conversation with the minister last week, 
because of the competing philosophies about CIDA's most basic 
role, aid or trade. I have heard that two successive ministers, the 
past two, have tried to change CIDA and have failed. I have also 
heard that numerous, well intentioned and influential people 
have run into a brick wall trying to reform the system for the 
sake of the Canadian taxpayer and the sake of hungry people 
abroad. We need leadership or the problems will continue.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada is willing to offer leadership in 
this respect. I want to clarify the Reform position. The Reform 
Party of Canada, as members know, has called for a reduction in 
foreign aid funding  simply because Canada no longer has the 
money to spend like it once did. Reformers are concerned about 
the poor but they are unwilling to ignore the larger context of our 
ability to pay and they are unwilling to overlook the reforms that 
CIDA so urgently needs.
<P>
	The Reform Party is well aware of the plight of a full third of 
the world's nations. In them, 34,000 children die of hunger or 
illness each day; 800 million people are malnourished. On the 
opposite pole, we are all well aware that on the United Nations 
index of human development Canada sits second out of 172 
nations. This position of privilege carries with it a unique 
weight of responsibility and we as Canadians must not close our 
eyes to the grim realities faced by others.
<P>
	It is therefore our recommendation that CIDA be clearly 
mandated to assist-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member. We will proceed with his debate once the 
House resumes its business.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell)</B> moved 
that Bill C-214, an act to amend the Criminal Code (hate 
propaganda-age group), be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am honoured and privileged to 
have the opportunity today to present to my colleagues in 
Parliament and to commend Bill C-214, the purpose of which is 
to amend the Criminal Code of Canada to render it impossible to 
import a product known as the serial killer board game.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to start by describing the serial killer board game 
for all hon. members. This is a Monopoly-type game that comes 
in a child-size body bag. It contains 25 baby figures and four 
killer figures. The purpose of the game is, of course, to commit 
as many murders as possible to tally up the largest number of 
baby corpses and win the game. The winner is the best killer.
<P>
	The game also includes a map of the United States where the 
states without capital punishment are in a different colour. For a 
big murder, the killer gets three baby corpses and, for a smaller 
murder, only one corpse.
<P>
	Here are some of the cards a player can get in this game.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Hitch-hiking is dangerous. Someone should have told this 
girl''. Here is another quote from one of these  little 
Monopoly-style cards: ``The quiet dorm could turn into a house 
of horrors when you visit. This campus is crawling with cops 
though. Beware''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2316"> 2316 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This game is based on the actions of John Wayne Gacey, who 
was found guilty of 35 murders in the United States.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words about public opinion on this 
game. I humbly submit to this House that Canadians do not want 
this product. Most Canadians are reasonable people and want to 
ban this game. I have presented over 105,000 petitions in this 
House in recent days. Several other members have also 
presented such petitions. In Quebec, in particular, many 
teachers and school boards are passing around the petition I 
drafted myself two years ago.
<P>
	I have several more petitions in my office and I intend to table 
them as soon as the Clerk of Petitions has had a chance to review 
and approve them for presentation in this House.
<P>
	At this time, there is nothing preventing the importation of 
this game into Canada. In 1992, after complaints in this House 
and demonstrations by many Canadians, Diamond Comic 
Distributors, the company that distributes the serial killer board 
game in Canada, decided to stop distributing this game or to give 
up its distribution rights. I think the reason for this is obvious. 
After all, it would be unwise for a distributor of comic strips to 
antagonize parents. So, in the face of controversy, the company 
decided to give up all rights to distribute this product. But you 
just wait and see. If there is a profit to be made, sooner or later 
another distributor will show up to ensure the large-scale 
distribution of this product here in Canada.
<P>
	The former Minister of National Revenue, Otto Jelinek, even 
admitted in a letter-as I told the hon. member of the Official 
Opposition-that nothing in the Criminal Code now prevents 
the importation of this product into Canada.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Customs officials have no law that would allow them to stop 
the game from crossing the Canadian border. Therefore I 
humbly submit to this House that there is an urgent need for a 
law to stop imports of this game.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On February 11 I tabled in the House Bill C-214, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code of Canada. That is the bill we are 
debating this afternoon. It is through that bill I propose to ask 
my colleagues to take the necessary measures to prevent the 
importation of the serial killer board game.
<P>
	The bill that I offer to the House is very simple. Basically it 
adds one word to the Criminal Code. I will explain that in greater 
detail. Bill C-214 proposes to amend the hate propaganda 
provisions of the Criminal Code. Presently-and this is no 
surprise to anyone-if the  serial killer board game advocated to 
destroy, physically harm or murder people on the basis of race, 
colour of skin, religion and so on, obviously it would not be 
allowed to enter our borders.
<P>
	However, because babies by definition come in all races, 
colours and everything else, that particular criterion does not 
work to stop the importation of the serial killer board game. By 
definition right now the hate propaganda provision says that 
hatred cannot be promoted against an identifiable group. 
Identifiable group is then further defined as a group that can be 
distinguished by sex, colour of skin, ethnic group, religion and 
so on. Obviously there appears to be no way at the present time 
to stop the importation of the serial killer board game.
<P>
	My bill would add another category. It would add an age 
group as an identifiable group. The word age would be added. In 
other words babies by definition are relatively the same age. 
Otherwise they would not be babies. This age group would then 
become identifiable and jurisprudence would develop when a 
baby is a baby for the purpose of the bill. Nevertheless, 
jurisprudence would determine when this criterion could be 
used.
<P>
	In any case advocating violence, promoting violence or 
glorifying violence against babies would be prohibited under the 
measure I am proposing to the House this afternoon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Now, as I said, section 318 of the Criminal Code forbids 
anyone to promote genocide, and that is what we are talking 
about. If hon. members have a copy of the Criminal Code in 
front of them, they will see that subsection 318(2) reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>- ``genocide'' means any of the following acts committed with intent to 
destroy in whole or in part any identifiable group, namely, (<I>a</I>)killing members 
of the group; or (<I>b</I>)deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life 
calculated to bring about its physical destruction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	``Identifiable group'' means any section of the public 
distinguished by colour, race, religion or ethnic origin. Of 
course, as I just said, I propose adding another category to this 
section of the Criminal Code, namely age group.
<P>
	In conclusion, because I would like to make my comments a 
little shorter than the 20 minutes allotted to me so that more 
members can speak, this is not a partisan issue today but an 
important social issue and I think that as many parliamentarians 
as possible should be able to speak on this subject.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I would like to say to you and to my 
colleagues that on many occasions I have told the House of 
Commons my opinion on importing the serial killer board game. 
I say and I repeat that I find the idea of this  game, which is to 
collect the largest number of baby corpses, repugnant.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2317"> 2317 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	Not only I, but all parliamentarians and all Canadians are 
disgusted by this game.
<P>
	Finally, I want to leave you something to think about. Madam 
Speaker, imagine that you are a parent of a newborn child and 
your next-door neighbours are having fun playing the serial 
killer board game and collecting baby corpses. Would you not 
want the government to ban this game!
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Madam Speaker, hate 
propaganda is one of the most despicable forms of human 
foolishness. Those who use it without thinking have not learned 
anything from history, while those who spread it wilfully 
commit a crime against humanity.
<P>
	Hate propaganda can easily be concealed in the most 
seemingly harmless comments; it goes against the 
constitutional protection afforded to freedom of expression, and 
those who use it do not care about public opinion, which 
disapproves of its use.
<P>
	In fact, you cannot define hate propaganda; you see it, you 
hear it, and you measure it by the provocative effect of the words 
and actions of those who use it. It defies definition under our 
democratic law. Every time we legislate to combat hate 
propaganda, it resurfaces in a new, unsuspected, active form.
<P>
	Our Criminal Code has included a few minor provisions on 
hate propaganda since 1970. Sections 318 and 319 deal with 
advocating genocide and with public incitement to hatred 
against groups which the law calls ``identifiable''. The Code 
currently defines the offence based on the group to which the 
victim belongs. This does not take into account historical and 
social realities.
<P>
	Any form of hate propaganda against any social group, by 
anyone, should be strenuously opposed. The current Criminal 
Code only includes acts against certain groups, distinguished by 
colour, race, religion or ethnic origin.
<P>
	For example, the age, language, sex, sexual orientation, social 
environment and condition, political convictions, profession, 
marital status or lifestyle of individuals forming a social group 
are not elements of identification of victims of hate propaganda.
<P>
	I think that restricting potential victims to a few groups is not 
justified when we are dealing with a crime against humanity as a 
whole. Instead of designating a few ``identifiable'' groups, the 
law should prohibit any form of hate propaganda against any 
group. Public incitement to kill women, welfare recipients or 
homosexuals is no different than inciting people to kill Jews, 
Catholics or Muslims. Social hatred, in its expression and in its 
effects, is akin to universal hatred.
<P>
	Consequently, I agree with the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell on the spirit of his proposed 
amendment to Bill C-214. However, I cannot support the bill 
itself, because it implicitly recognizes that  the law would only 
protect certain groups of people, when it should include 
everyone.
<P>
	This bill is similar to Bill C-204 tabled on December 18, 
1988, and Bill C-207 tabled on April 7, 1990, which also 
provided for the inclusion of age as a distinguishing factor. Bill 
C-326, tabled on June 27, 1990, also added sex and sexual 
orientation to the list of factors.
<P>
	The bill tabled by the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell adds age as a distinguishing 
factor for a group of victims, but what we have to do is abolish 
these restrictive designations of ``identifiable groups'', in order 
to extend the protection of the law to society as a whole. Again, 
this bill confirms the restrictive nature of the current legislation.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	On the other hand, this bill gives us an opportunity to debate 
in this House the effect our legislation really has on hate 
propaganda in light of the decision rendered by the Supreme 
Court in the Zundel case, last year, and the Keegstra case, in 
1990. As we know, the Alberta Court of Appeal was scheduled to 
hear another appeal from Keegstra on February 2, 1994, and has 
not yet issued a ruling.
<P>
	While Keegstra was charged under the hate propaganda 
provisions, Zundel was charged under old section 181 on 
spreading false news. As we all recall, Zundel denied the Jewish 
holocaust ever happened and his comments were tinged with 
racism.
<P>
	Zundel's motives could have been examined as part of mens 
rea determination. However, in the majority jugement of the 
Supreme Court, section 181 was invalidated by the Charter and, 
whatever his motives, Zundel had to be acquitted. In its ruling, 
the court mentioned it had ruled a few years earlier, in the 
Keegstra case that hate propaganda was protected under section 
2(b) of the Charter, and added that all communications that 
convey or intend to convey a message fall under section 2(b) of 
the Charter, with the only proviso that the material transmission 
of the message be otherwise acceptable.
<P>
	Unfortunately our Charter of Rights and Freedoms is 
protecting fanatics and eccentrics like Zundel who can spew out 
their insanities with complete impunity. As the law now stands, 
how would the Supreme Court react to section 318 which has not 
yet been tested, as we know?
<P>
	I also know that this bill is premised upon the alleged 
impending importation in Canada of a game I prefer not to 
mention. No one has seen this game yet. I think that the panic 
stirred up by certain watch groups is actually playing into the 
hands of the game's promoters who are benefitting from an 
incredible amount of publicity. If there is such a game, it is 
shameful and should be stopped at the border or seized by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2318"> 2318 </A></B>
<P>
police. I think that other provisions of the Criminal Code, if 
amended, could in fact allow such action.
<P>
	Without getting into a legal debate on notions which elude the 
public, I want to call the attention of the hon. member and of this 
House to the fact that the Code contains provisions which 
prohibit the distribution of crime comics under offences tending 
to corrupt morals.
<P>
	Pursuant to section 163(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, a person 
who circulates a crime comic commits an offence. However, I 
would agree with the hon. member that the definition of the 
scope of the offence is far from perfect and that customs officers 
and the police would not be able to act easily.
<P>
	The game targeted by this bill depicts through drawings or 
photographs the serial killings of children. I would propose, as 
an alternative, that the definition in section 163(7) be amended 
to include any material that depicts pictorially the commission 
of criminal acts. I think that, from a constitutional standpoint, 
these provisions would be more effective and more valid in 
terms of stopping the distribution of this kind of game than the 
addition to the restricted categories of clauses respecting hate 
propaganda messages, as these categories are already protected 
under the Charter.
<P>
	Finally, I am by no means convinced that even with the 
amendment put forward by my colleague, this type of game 
would fall under the definition of hate propaganda covered in 
section 318 or section 319.
<P>
	For these reasons, and although I agree completely with the 
spirit of what the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is trying to do, I cannot support 
the amendments he is proposing and I fail to see how they would 
be useful from a practical standpoint. Since the legislator cannot 
pass legislation for no reason, I think that Bill C-214 should, 
quite simply, be deferred.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to speak in support of private member's Bill C-214. My hon. 
colleague who just spoke may be accurate in that there are some 
deficiencies in this bill. At the same time we cannot amend the 
total Criminal Code and rectify the problems within the criminal 
justice system in one fell swoop.
<P>
	I support the private member's bill. However I do so with a 
degree of regret. It saddens me to think that we would have to 
debate such an issue, whether or not we should amend the 
Criminal Code to stop the proliferation of what I consider to be 
obscene and immoral.
<P>
	I would like to briefly describe what I know about the serial 
killer board game. It was invented by Tobias Allen of Seattle, 
Washington, and inspired by John Wayne Gacey, a serial killer 
on death row for the murder of I understand 33 children in the 
United States. The object of the game is to kill as many children 
as possible. The game comes in a body bag and the pawns to play 
the board are in the shape of dead babies.
<P>
	In my mind there is no debate. The answer is a given. I believe 
from the volume of mail and petitions received by past and 
present members of this House that there is no debate in the 
minds of Canadians on this issue. We should stop the serial 
killer board game from reaching Canadian stores and the 
impressionable minds of our children.
<P>
	I will never understand what kind of sick mind devises such a 
despicable and horrifying game, one that glorifies the killing of 
babies, the most vulnerable and precious treasure we have in this 
world, innocent victims of some of the most heinous crimes 
committed in this and other countries.
<P>
	Are we not here to protect our children from the senseless hate 
and violence that exists throughout the world and which is 
increasing in our own country? How anyone finds entertainment 
in playing a game that depicts the slaughtering of babies is 
beyond me and everything I have ever held dear in my life. How 
anyone could condone the importation and sale of such an 
outrageously immoral game is beyond comprehension.
<P>
	I stand here today to support an amendment that demonstrates 
to the U.S. originator and manufacturer of this game that there is 
no place for it in a country whose standards in regard to morality 
will not tolerate the exploitation of children and to reinforce the 
commitment I have made to my constituents to help put some 
sanity back in the justice system that no longer protects our most 
valuable possession, our children.
<P>
	The hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell has 
tabled private member's Bill C-214 to amend the Criminal Code 
to include age which appears to be the only effective means to 
stop the importation of the serial killer board game as it would 
constitute importing hate propaganda.
<P>
	Currently under subsection 318(4) of the Criminal Code 
regarding hate propaganda, children or seniors are not protected 
because they do not constitute an identifiable group. Within this 
section the application of the Criminal Code only applies to hate 
propaganda that advocates or promotes the physical destruction 
of persons distinguished by colour, race, religion or ethnic 
origin.
<P>
	This serial killer board game which establishes the winner as 
the person who collects the most dead babies would not be 
permitted in Canada if the babies were of a particular race or 
colour. Obviously white Anglo-Saxon is not included in the 
definition of race under subsection 318(4) of the Criminal Code 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2319"> 2319 </A></B>
<P>
and has an awful lot to say about the state of our Criminal Code. 
Otherwise Revenue Canada officials could have prohibited 
entry of this game into our country.
<P>
	I would like to point out that similarly women would not be 
protected under this section of the Criminal Code as gender does 
not fall within the confines defining what constitutes hate 
propaganda.
<P>
	Therefore if the dead bodies were that of white Canadian 
women the game would also be acceptable to pass through our 
borders under subsection 318(4) of the Criminal Code. How 
have we regressed to the point where we have no equality before 
the law? It is no wonder this country cannot eradicate the 
problem of violence against women and children when sections 
of the Criminal Code such as 318(4) provide no protection for 
them.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	I understand that under tariff code 9956 of schedule 7 to the 
Customs Tariff, Revenue Canada can prohibit the importation of 
certain material into Canada. Material suspected of being 
treasonable, seditious, obscene or hate propaganda is inspected 
by Revenue Canada officials and if it is determined to come 
within the terms of tariff code 9956, its importation is 
prohibited.
<P>
	According to the Minister of National Revenue, his officials 
have reviewed a version of the serial killer board game and 
determined it did not fall within the confines of tariff code 9956 
which has necessitated private member's Bill C-214.
<P>
	I do not know what obscene means to revenue officials but to 
me and as is defined in the dictionary it means highly offensive. 
If the game depicting the murder of babies is not highly 
offensive, I do not know what is. Anything that glorifies killing 
and depicts serial murders as victorious is very offensive to me 
and the people I represent. I really do not understand what is 
happening in our country, what is happening to the sense of 
decency and morality that was once so indicative of a country 
whose values were second to none.
<P>
	What kind of a message are we sending people when we allow 
a game of this nature to enter our country? It is the same message 
we send when we allow a murderer serving a life sentence to be 
eligible for parole after 15 years, when we give a convict a day 
pass to rape and kill again, when we pay a serial killer 
handsomely to provide law authorities with information 
regarding the location of his victim's bodies or when we permit 
a person in prison who was a partner of one of the most horrific 
sexual slayings in this country to own a microwave, a television 
set, take university courses and to decorate her cell with 
whimsical cartoon characters when law-abiding Canadians 
struggle to obtain similar assets.
<P>
	Another major area of concern, of course, is the Young 
Offenders Act which is currently ineffective in stopping the 
growing number of youth engaged in criminal and violent 
activities. There has been considerable discussion regarding this 
area of law and private member's Bill C-217 is currently before 
the House. The purpose of this bill is threefold. To lower the age 
limits that define who is a young person for purposes of the 
Young Offenders Act, to allow the publication of the name of a 
young offender who has been convicted of an indictable offence 
on two previous occasions and to  increase the maximum penalty 
in the Young Offenders Act for first and second degree murder to 
10 years.
<P>
	I commend the hon. member for York South-Weston for his 
initiative in this area. I cannot say at this time that I agree 100 
per cent with the suggested amendments, however I do believe 
they warrant discussion and analysis.
<P>
	Stopping the importation of material such as the serial killer 
board game or serial killer cards is a necessary component in 
providing the proper environment for our children to grow up in. 
How can we expect them to adhere to a prescribed set of rules 
and moral conduct if we have games or literature that are 
contradictory? How will they ever understand wrong from right 
if we say one thing and our store shelves are filled with games or 
literature that defies what we have told them?
<P>
	We know a world of corruption lies beyond our front doors. 
Every day in this country Canadians are warned of the 
unspeakable things that can happen to their children and they are 
urged to make their children street smart.
<P>
	Allowing the serial killer board game into this country goes 
against the moral conscience of Canadians and everything we as 
parents are trying to do to raise our children to be morally 
correct human beings.
<P>
	Our job as legislators is to provide leadership and direction 
through our laws. If we do not amend the Criminal Code we will 
be telling our children that we believe killing babies, killing 
innocent and defenceless members of society, is all right even if 
it is only in a game.
<P>
	In conclusion, when we do this we are allowing violent and 
immoral behaviour to further proliferate in this country. I stand 
in support of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity this evening to 
speak to Bill C-214 introduced by the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	This bill proposes to amend the existing Criminal Code 
definition of identifiable group which is found in that part of the 
code dealing with hate propaganda so as to include the term age. 
The new definition would apply to all of the hate propaganda 
offences.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	The search for the proper role of the law in respect to hate 
propaganda is especially difficult because it forces us to review 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2320"> 2320 </A></B>
<P>
the conflict between freedom of speech and the interest of the 
state in criminalizing speech injurious to the public.
<P>
	Before proceeding to speak to the bill it is important to say a 
bit about the current law. At the present time the Criminal Code 
prohibits, first, advocating or promoting genocide against any 
section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion or 
ethnic origin. That is section 318.
<P>
	Second, it prohibits inciting hatred against a protected group 
by communicating in a public place statements which are likely 
to lead to a breach of the peace. That is subsection 319(1).
<P>
	Third, it prohibits communicating statements, other than in 
private conversation, which wilfully promote hatred against a 
protected group. That is subsection 319(2).
<P>
	Fourth, the Criminal Code provides for the seizure and 
forfeiture of hate propaganda kept on the premises for sale or 
distribution. Those are subsections 320(1) and (4).
<P>
	Fifth, it provides that a person charged with advocating 
genocide is liable to five years imprisonment if charged with the 
offence of public incitement, or hatred, or the offence of 
communicating statements which wilfully promote hatred. A 
person is liable to two years imprisonment if prosecuted by way 
of indictment or to six months and/or a $2,000 fine if prosecuted 
by way of summary proceedings.
<P>
	The Criminal Code also provides for four special statutory 
defences which an accused may raise if prosecuted for wilfully 
promoting hatred: if the statements communicated were true; if 
the statements expressed or attempted to establish by argument 
in good faith an opinion upon a religious subject; if the 
statements made were on a subject of public interest which on 
reasonable grounds were believed to be true; and pointing out in 
good faith for the purpose of removal matters producing or 
tending to produce feelings of hatred.
<P>
	Except for the offence of public incitement to hatred, the 
consent of the provincial attorney general is required to obtain a 
seizure or to initiate a prosecution under the Criminal Code's 
hate propaganda provisions. The hate propaganda provisions of 
the Criminal Code were examined by the Supreme Court of 
Canada in the case of Regina v. Keegstra. The judgment was 
rendered in December 1990.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada determined that 
communications which wilfully promote hatred against an 
identifiable group conveyed a meaning and were thus an 
expression within the meaning of paragraph 2(b) of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	The court further noted that the prohibition set out in 
subsection 319(2) of the Criminal Code was directed at words 
that have as their content and objective the promotion of racial 
or religious hatred.
<P>
	Inasmuch as the purpose of the provision was to restrict the 
content of expression ``by singling out particular meanings that 
are not to be conveyed'', the Supreme Court of Canada 
determined that subsection 319(2) infringed the guarantee of the 
freedom of expression in paragraph 2(b) of the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	The court ruled that the presence of hate propaganda in 
Canada was sufficiently substantial to warrant concern. The 
court recognized that hate propaganda could cause two types of 
injuries: first, harm done to the target group by for example 
provoking a retaliatory response or causing the target group to 
avoid activities and withdraw from participation in activities 
with non-group members and, second, influence upon society at 
large by attracting individuals to hold these views and to create 
discord and disharmony among these groups in society at large.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	The court upheld subsection 319(2) of the Criminal Code 
which deals with wilfully promoting hatred. It upheld it as a 
reasonable limit on the guarantee to the freedom of expression 
within the meaning of section 1 of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Subsection 318(4) defines the expression identifiable group 
as meaning ``any section of the public distinguished by colour, 
race, religion or ethnic origin''. Expanding the definition would 
broaden the type of speech that would be caught by the hate law 
and therefore could potentially put the hate propaganda 
provisions at risk. This is very significant.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada noted in the Keegstra case that 
subsection 319(2) was designed to extend a measure of 
protection to visible and religious minorities so as to prevent 
their being exposed to hate messages and to promote racial and 
religious tolerance.
<P>
	Expanding the definition of identifiable group to include 
another characteristic such as the one proposed in Bill C-214 
would undoubtedly broaden the narrow purpose of protecting 
visible and religious minorities approved by the Supreme Court 
of Canada in the Keegstra case. It is not clear to me whether 
adding what is proposed in Bill C-214 would have the effect of 
protecting children from killer cards and board games as there 
must be shown an incitement to hatred or promotion of hatred.
<P>
	The proposed change here would broaden the definition of 
identifiable group without succeeding in its attempt to protect 
children from nefarious materials. As a result, the hate 
propaganda provisions as amended by Bill C-214 could be more 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2321"> 2321 </A></B>
<P>
vulnerable to a finding by courts that they constitute an 
infringement of the charter guarantee of freedom of speech and 
that they are not a reasonable limit prescribed by law in a free 
and democratic society.
<P>
	The hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is 
attempting to do something which should be supported. We all 
support his aim. The problem is how best to do it. Is it with Bill 
C-214? We have to be careful, as I have stated, that we do not 
weaken the law as it exists at the present time and that we 
perhaps find another way of dealing with if.
<P>
	The Department of Justice at the present time is looking into 
the matter. Hopefully it will have something to recommend. I 
say this with all deep appreciation to the  member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. With the co-operation and work 
of all members of the House, we will find the best way possible 
to deal with this despicable practice, which certain people are 
using to make considerable sums of money at the expense of our 
young people.

<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANFOREIGNPOLICY">CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to see that after the short break to reconsider 
their position members are coming in droves to hear the end of 
my speech.
<P>
	Before the break I had been talking about an important part of 
our foreign policy review. That is the position we should take as 
we study and review the position the Canadian International 
Development Agency should have in this foreign policy review.
<P>
	I have heard that numerous well-intentioned and influential 
people have run into a brick wall trying to reform CIDA's system 
for the sake of the Canadian taxpayer and the sake of hungry 
people abroad. We need leadership or the problems will 
continue. The Reform Party of Canada is willing to offer 
leadership in this respect. I want to clarify the Reform position.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada has called for a reduction in 
foreign aid funding simply because Canada no longer has that 
money to spend. Reformers are concerned about the poor, but 
they are unwilling to ignore the larger context of our ability to 
pay. They are also unwilling to overlook the reforms that CIDA 
so urgently requires.
<P>
	The Reform Party is well aware of the plight of one-third of 
the world's nations. In them 34,000 children die of hunger or 
illness each day. Eight hundred million people are 
malnourished.
<P>
	On the opposite side we are well aware that on the United 
Nations index of human development, Canada sits second from 
the top out of 172 nations. This position of privilege carries with 
it a unique weight of responsibility. We as Canadians must not 
close our eyes to the grim realities facing others.
<P>
	It is our recommendation that CIDA be clearly mandated to 
assist the poorest of the poor to become self-sufficient. We 
recommend that this mandate be enshrined in legislation. This 
would be legislation that protects CIDA from the political 
pressures that divert its energies toward other tasks. It would be 
legislation that includes a project by project evaluation 
mechanism and budgetary sunset clauses. It would be 
legislation that  controls CIDA by requiring it to justify its 
actions to Parliament on a regular basis.
<P>
	A scaled down CIDA should concentrate on working at the 
grassroots level with the poorest of the poor. It should give less 
bilateral or government to government assistance, because that 
is where the corruption and the greed too often frustrate our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2323"> 2323 </A></B>
<P>
efforts. It should concentrate instead on its efforts to forge more 
partnerships with community based non-governmental 
organizations where help goes directly to needy people. 
Currently only 9 per cent of our foreign aid budget is used in that 
way.
<P>
	CIDA should follow, as an example perhaps, Sweden's lead 
and reduce its focus from 115 countries to just a handful, making 
a significant impact on poverty and health in each one of them. 
An example of this can be found in the latest years for which 
figures are available.
<P>
	The statistics show that Indonesia which is classed by the UN 
as a middle income developing country received $40 million in 
aid under CIDA. Haiti, sitting at the bottom rung of the world's 
ladder, received just $6 million. By shifting priorities we could 
have a real impact on a country that is the poorest of the poor 
through our non-governmental organizations.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	CIDA must take a long term view by making the poor 
self-sustaining rather than allowing them to become dependent 
on continuing foreign aid.
<P>
	Canada enjoys an unprecedented position of respect in the 
world today. Other rich nations do not enjoy the same level of 
international esteem. Why is this? In large measure it is because 
Canada has reached out with benevolence. We have given 
generously to nations like Bangladesh and Pakistan knowing 
they may never be able to repay us.
<P>
	The world has recognized that our motives for giving are 
generally altruistic and for that we are rewarded with global 
goodwill. At the world table we have substantial bargaining 
power for a nation of our size. This is possible because we back 
up our words with tangible assistance.
<P>
	The vehicles for enhancing Canada's trade already exist. The 
industry and international trade departments are well suited to 
serve Canada's commercial interests. However we ought to 
separate our economic interests from our humanitarian motives. 
The overt promotion of Canadian trade is a worthy and 
necessary endeavour best left to he departments of industry and 
international trade. I believe our integrity is somehow 
diminished in the eyes of the world when we quietly couple 
commerce with humanitarian relief.
<P>
	It is impossible to estimate the value of our good international 
reputation in monetary terms. The good seeds we have sown in 
the fields of the poor may well bear the future harvest of 
increased trade. Whether this happens or not let us move now to 
enact legislation  recreating CIDA as a vehicle that can deliver 
aid with efficiency and purpose.
<P>
	In case the government is not contemplating such legislation 
at this time, I intend to introduce a private member's bill in the 
coming weeks that will incorporate the principles I have 
addressed. It can serve as a starting point for a non-partisan 
effort that I believe all members could support.
<P>
	Within our ability let us give freely to the poorest of the poor 
without ulterior motives but in the spirit of generosity and 
compassion that marks each member in this House as truly 
Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I compliment the hon. gentleman on the tenor of the latter part of 
his intervention which I heard. It certainly exemplifies some 
very commendable views about Canada and its role in the 
international sphere.
<P>
	I am a trifle confused however by his reluctance to see the 
relationship of both objectives. The commercial side reflects 
Canadian interests as they might develop anywhere in the world. 
That might reflect positively on the more humanitarian or 
altruistic-if he would accept that term-side of the equation as 
it more appropriately relates to Canada's political and 
humanitarian objectives everywhere in the world. I do not 
understand why one must preclude the existence of the other.
<P>
	I accept that we should renew and continue to reinforce those 
initiatives which have made Canada stand out for its 
humanitarian or relief work, which is the term I think the 
member used. However Canadian interests are served on both 
the philosophical side and the strictly pragmatic business side 
when the two interests are married under one administration.
<P>
	I am wondering whether the hon. member would clarify that 
for me. I have difficulty understanding why we would have to 
separate the administration of two departments under one roof 
when the objectives of both give us the results Canadians seem 
to want.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, the problem is twofold. One is 
the idea of separating the mandate or giving CIDA a mandate. 
What is the purpose of CIDA? The management of CIDA has 
been flipping every 18 months. It is in a total state of turmoil not 
knowing what its mandate is, which should be to protect the 
purpose of our humanitarian aid and to help the poorest of the 
poor.
<P>
	That was the mandate suggested by the Winegard report. We 
need to focus in on what is the role of CIDA. That role should be 
brought under the authority of Parliament through enabling 
legislation.
<P>
	I also have budgetary concerns. CIDA's budget is too large. 
There are too many tentacles, too many countries, too many 
purposes. It needs to be restricted and that is another reason to 
focus our attention on a few countries.
<P>
	On the other question of whether commerce and humanitarian 
aid would be looked after together, I  believe that may be 
possible. As one parliamentary secretary mentioned earlier 
today it is almost impossible to dissociate international trade, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2324"> 2324 </A></B>
<P>
foreign policy and defence policy. All of them go together often 
under trade policy which is really the commerce aspect of what 
the member was talking about.
<P>
	Trade must be left to the international trade people. We need 
that commercial process to develop arrangements, agreements, 
free trade agreements and so on with other countries. It would 
allow them to pursue trade opportunities in Canada and would 
allow Canadian businesses to pursue trade agreements with 
those countries. It is a trade issue.
<P>
	Our humanitarian efforts need to be focused without 
expecting commercial return. In that sense we target our money 
and say that whatever the amount is, the money is given without 
strings attached. It is done as a humanitarian gesture because we 
want to help that country so that in the coming years it is not 
dependent on foreign aid.
<P>
	One of the critiques in the Auditor General's report is that 
countries that have received $1 billion or $2 billion from Canada 
over the last 20 years are as dependent or more dependent on 
international aid now than they were when we started what we 
thought was going to be short term assistance.
<P>
	We need to focus our humanitarian aid for that reason. 
International trade is a separate issue. Although sometimes it 
will overlap and it is a good thing if it does that should not be the 
focus of CIDA. It should be a foreign aid and humanitarian 
gesture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to clarify one further item 
with the hon. member.
<P>
	We do not differ on the philosophy but I think the member is 
aware when he speaks on the question of giving aid especially 
through CIDA we are not talking ultimately of a cash transfer. 
We are talking about providing a service. We are talking about 
providing goods. We are talking essentially about purchasing 
the same for the benefit of a third party. That does not 
necessarily mean we are taking a large budget item and 
transferring it in cash to a recipient country.
<P>
	Because of that I do not see why we would want to separate 
from the philosophical objectives of any of our activity the 
possible consequences which can all be positive.
<P>
<B>(1915 ) </B>
<P>
	The fact that we would be giving aid does not necessarily 
mean that there are no commercial benefits or that there are 
commercial benefits that we should eschew. The fact that we 
would be providing or stimulating trade does not necessarily 
mean that we would not be disposed to providing further 
assistance because it is not a question, unless the member's 
understanding of the Auditor General's report is different from 
mine, of taking dollars out of our pocket  and handing them over 
to somebody else whom we have defined as needy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	I realize that often it is not just money that is being transferred 
in our bilateral systems. Often money is part of it. There was a 
budgetary figure not this year but last year or two years ago 
where we spent tens of millions of dollars in direct transfers to 
help other countries with their national debt problems, for 
example.
<P>
	To me that is not a purpose for CIDA. That is not something 
that Canada should be doing at this time, giving other countries 
direct assistance to help with their national debt problems when 
we have the biggest national debt problem we have ever had in 
our history. There are times when direct money is transferred. In 
those cases we have to restrict the mandate of CIDA through 
legislation to eliminate that abuse.
<P>
	Second, there are times when instead of thinking of strictly 
humanitarian reasons, we start to think of Canada's commercial 
interests. Madam Labelle mentioned the other day that 60 per 
cent of our money is spent here in Canada, sometimes for buying 
foodstuffs and so on but sometimes for reasons that are more 
commercial in nature and not particularly geared for the poorest 
of the poor whom we should be helping.
<P>
	In those cases, I am concerned. The Auditor General this year 
did not specifically identify any horror stories. He tried to zero 
in on the process and the problem within CIDA that he identified 
by a lack of legislation and some other things but tried to avoid 
the horror stories as I have tried to avoid them today in my 
presentation. However those horror stories still exist. We can go 
back through the last 10 years of Auditor Generals' reports to 
see them in their fullness.
<P>
	That is why we need to restrict it to humanitarian aid. I realize 
that sometimes it is goods and services that are also exchanged 
but by and large we need to restrict it to the poor, make the 
mandate strict in legislation and we will not only enhance 
CIDA's reputation within Canada, which is very important at 
this time as it is flagging, but improve our opinion abroad as 
well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Madam Speaker, I enjoyed that last exchange 
between the hon. member for Eglinton-Lawrence and the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley East because both members are on the 
foreign affairs committee and in developing an independent 
Canadian policy on foreign affairs.
<P>
	This is the kind of interchange we need on the floor of this 
House. Therefore I congratulate the two gentlemen for 
contributing to the debate and to helping us develop an 
independent Canadian foreign policy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2325"> 2325 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians have seen the world change dramatically in recent 
years. In many ways change has been the defining characteristic 
of this decade. Nowhere has this been more  true than in central 
and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
<P>
	The fall of the Berlin wall, which I witnessed personally, the 
collapse of communism and the Soviet military threat and the 
emergence of the new independent states have reshaped Europe. 
We are faced with challenges and opportunities unparalleled 
since the end of World War II.
<P>
	The last five years have shown that the first dramatic steps are 
sometimes the easiest to take. The hard work begins when ideas 
must be transformed into reality. Democracy cannot simply be 
proclaimed. Free markets cannot just be willed into existence. 
Fundamental reform requires courage and patience. Canada has 
an important role to play in central and eastern Europe. We must 
seize this tremendous opportunity.
<P>
	I would like to focus my statement today on Canada's foreign 
policy challenges in that part of the world. It is obviously in 
Canada's best interests that reform in the region succeed. The 
opportunity to build a more stable world order based on 
democratic governments and free market economies cannot be 
squandered.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	Central and eastern Europe is a new economic frontier. Trade 
is the lifeblood of the Canadian economy. The region's largely 
untapped markets represent an exciting opportunity to generate 
exports and create new jobs and prosperity in Canada.
<P>
	Canada's historic, cultural and human links to eastern Europe 
are an advantage that few of our so-called competitors, 
European or otherwise, possess. We must use our advantage 
wisely.
<P>
	Almost 20 per cent of the constituents in my constituency of 
Parkdale-High Park and 10 per cent of Canadians generally 
across Canada can trace their roots to central and eastern Europe 
and the former Soviet Union. This is an unparalleled bond. We 
have tried to foster relationships with these countries. A number 
of Canadian entrepreneurs or academics have gone there to offer 
their expertise and knowledge, to offer training and assistance. 
It is a difficult task where progress is measured in little steps, 
but whose rewards for Canada are great.
<P>
	The linguistic skills and the cultural ties of Canada's 
ethnocultural communities enable us to support a number of 
people to people initiatives, to bridge cultural barriers and to 
deliver training and assistance. The impact of this direct contact 
cannot be overestimated. I know from years of personal 
experience working with the Canadian Polish community, with 
travel study programs for Canadian students in Poland, how 
personal links can bring countries together.
<P>
	The countries of central and eastern Europe and the former 
Soviet Union are trying to create in months and years 
institutions and systems which have in some cases developed 
over centuries in the west.
<P>
	While we should seize the opportunities presented by change, 
we must recognize that there will be setbacks and avoid 
impatience and unrealistic expectations. Political and economic 
reform take time.
<P>
	Last week the President of Georgia was in Ottawa, Mr. 
Shevardnadze. I had the honour of greeting him at the airport 
and bringing him to meet the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs. I asked Mr. Shevardnadze if he had an 
opportunity to relive his life would he again push the economic, 
political and democratic reforms as he did with Mr. Gorbachev. 
He thought about it for a while and said: ``Yes, but I would do it 
much more slowly''. His argument was that the problems they 
were having in many of the east European countries today were 
because they were not ready for such rapid change.
<P>
	Therefore, if we want Canada to have a prosperous and 
beneficial relationship with central and eastern Europe then we 
must start today and patiently wait for the results. In countries 
like Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, the 
memory of democracy and market economies have survived 45 
years of political repression and state control. But in what 
shape? There is enough intact to provide the basis for a 
successful transformation but the task remains daunting. With 
strong support and investment from the west we are seeing 
encouraging signs.
<P>
	Poland became the first country in the region to record growth 
in gross domestic product with an increase of 4 per cent last 
year. It was Europe's fastest growing economy in 1993. Who 
would have predicted that 10 years ago?
<P>
	In Hungary the private sector generates close to 45 per cent of 
the country's GDP. The Czech Republic has low inflation and 
unemployment rates and has launched a second phase of a 
successful privatization program.
<P>
	In the former Soviet Union the first steps have been taken, but 
with virtually no history of democracy and free markets to draw 
on we should not be surprised that change is slow and difficult. 
The challenge is large but it is not insurmountable. Countries 
such as Russia and Ukraine are central to the historic 
transformation of Europe. Canada must make a commitment for 
the long term.
<P>
	We are encouraging Russia's president, government and 
parliament to work together to develop a new reform consensus. 
Canadian assistance remains contingent on a continuing 
commitment to democracy and economic reform. I should draw 
to the attention of newer members that the foreign affairs 
commit-
<P>

<P>
tee was in the former Soviet Union, Russia and Ukraine twice. 
Maybe it is time to revisit that region.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday I had a lengthy meeting with the new ambassador of 
Ukraine, Ambassador Batyuk, to discuss Canada's special 
relationship with Ukraine. About two hours ago the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs met with the  Ukrainian Canadian Congress 
under the presidency of Oleh Romaniw to discuss such matters 
as political issues, technical assistance, trade and economic 
issues, consultations with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
immigration issues as they pertain to Ukraine.
<P>
	This is the kind of input that we welcome, not only input 
through parliamentary standing committees but meetings such 
as the minister had just prior to my speaking here.
<P>
	Government commitment to enhancing this relationship is in 
every spirit political, economic and social. We will be at the 
forefront of helping Ukraine in its democratic and economic 
transformation. A stable, secure and prosperous Ukraine is vital 
for European security.
<P>
	We are encouraged by President Kravchuk's desire to submit 
the non-proliferation treaty to his Parliament for ratification.
<P>
	Since 1989 Canada has provided substantial support to central 
and eastern Europe in the form of technical and humanitarian 
assistance. It is important that we continue to do so. The people 
of the region must clearly see that the west is supporting them in 
practical and direct ways during the difficult period of 
transition.
<P>
	That is why one of the major components of Canadian 
assistance to the region is an ongoing program designed to 
promote democratic development, to support the transition to 
market economies and to increase Canadian trade and 
investment links with the region.
<P>
	In pursuing these objectives we have adopted a partnership 
approach both with recipient countries and Canadian partners. 
This is partly a reflection of limited resources. It is also a 
recognition that government does not have all of the answers. 
The program draws on the expertise to be found in all sectors of 
Canadian society.
<P>
	The assistance program matches Canadian skills and 
technology with the priority needs of partner countries. We have 
done this successfully in fields such as energy, agriculture, 
private sector development and the environment. Our 
sophisticated financial and legal systems and our respected 
public service have also provided unrivalled expertise.
<P>
	This approach not only ensures that Canadian assistance is of 
high quality but also helps to develop long term commercial 
opportunities for Canadian companies.
<P>
	Canadian assistance is having a practical impact on the 
process of reform. It supports the transfer of critical knowledge 
and technology and fosters the emergence of small and medium 
sized enterprises. Western economic practices are being adopted 
and democratic institutions are being strengthened.
<P>
	The assistance program also increases the capacity in 
Canadian firms to compete effectively in central and eastern 
European markets. Two examples of projects in my parents' 
homeland of Poland illustrate the range of  our involvement and 
give us a good reason why we should continue to be involved in 
the region.
<P>
	One, a Canadian company advised the Polish Ministry of 
Health on health care reform in 1992. It subsequently won a 
World Bank contract to manage a $200 million U.S. health 
sector loan in Poland. Another example, more than 100 Polish 
dairy farmers and veterinarians have so far upgraded their skills 
and received management training in an ongoing program at the 
international livestock management school in Kemptville.
<P>
	There are those who think that Canada spends too much on 
foreign aid, as we heard from some of the Reform Party 
speakers, and that it is a waste of money. As we embark on this 
foreign policy review process we will have to look at our aid 
programs, but aid is not simply money. It is also expertise, 
knowledge and skills that we can share with those who are 
seeking to build in modern society.
<P>
<B>(1930 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me cite a few examples of where Canada has taken the 
lead in setting up successful programs with very little money. 
The Federal Business Development Bank took the lead in 
establishing an independent Romanian loan guarantee fund for 
small and medium enterprises in 1993. A contribution of 
$775,000 will provide on site staff and management training 
until June 1995. Canada without providing capital in the fund 
has provided much more: a credible reputation and confidence 
in the abilities of its managers. Thanks to this the fund has 
attracted a $5 million contribution from Germany.
<P>
	In Hungary we are establishing regional vocational and labour 
retraining centres. Our involvement in the project started in 
1991 with a $400,000 contribution to the Association of 
Canadian Community Colleges for one pilot project. The 
association and an Irish partner then secured a $1.5 million 
World Bank contract to establish close to 20 such centres in 
Hungary.
<P>
	Just yesterday Ambassador Gedai of Hungary was in my 
office expressing appreciation for the co-operation and 
assistance from Canada.
<P>
	Russian oilfield workers and managers are benefiting from 
training in Russia and Canada. A $10 million Yeltsin democracy 
fellowship program managed by the University of 
Saskatchewan in my province brings Russian officials to Canada 
to work in ministries at all levels of government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2327"> 2327 </A></B>
<P>
	In Ukraine Canadian support for a professional public service 
training institute is helping to build the institutions that modern 
independent states require.
<P>
	Canada is contributing its expertise in agricultural 
economics, social policy planning and communications. 
Already 21 deputy and assistant deputy ministers from Ukraine 
have participated in Canada in a two week executive 
management program at the Canadian Centre for Management 
Development.
<P>
	Canada's assistance program also provides funding to 
Canadian business on a cost shared basis to develop joint 
ventures in trade and investment opportunities. As a result 
Canadian companies have established a strong presence in 
Russia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Ukraine. Trade and 
investment are key to the long term growth of these fledgling 
market economies.
<P>
	As I said earlier, and my colleagues have also pointed out, 
trade is also essential to Canada's continued growth in the next 
century. Canada is encouraging collective, decisive action on 
the part of the west. The government supports stronger links 
between NATO and central and eastern Europe through the 
partnership for peace program. Canada has encouraged the 
CSCE to play a more active role in central and eastern Europe, 
particularly in the area of conflict prevention and crisis 
management.
<P>
	We are proposing to focus high level G-7 attention on 
Ukraine. Already Canada is playing a leading international role 
in assisting Ukraine in its upcoming elections through technical 
assistance and election monitoring.
<P>
	I am pleased to announce that the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
has asked me to lead a delegation to Ukraine on its request to 
monitor the elections there.
<P>
	Canadian soldiers are serving as peacekeepers with the United 
Nation protection force in the former Yugoslavia and the 
government increased Canada's contribution to relief 
operations there with the announcement of a $10 million 
package of humanitarian assistance in November 1993. This 
brings Canadian contributions of humanitarian assistance for 
the war affected populations of former Yugoslavia to $50 
million since 1991. We will continue to monitor humanitarian 
needs throughout the region and to respond generously and 
compassionately.
<P>
	Had the former Yugoslavian conflict been resolved in an 
institutionalized way through compromise, tolerance and 
agreement, as recommended by Lester B. Pearson, billions of 
dollars could be used today for development rather than for 
humanitarian assistance. Again, in response to the people who 
say we should focus on only giving assistance to the poorest of 
the poor, if we only give humanitarian aid when do the countries 
get assistance to develop so that they can stand on their own 
feet? Our ideology should be to help the people in those 
countries to help themselves.
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
	The course of reform in central and eastern Europe and the 
former Soviet Union may continue to be unpredictable and 
fraught with danger but we cannot withdraw. Canada must play a 
role in turning this period of turbulent change into an 
opportunity to create a more stable and prosperous world. The 
government is committed to providing creative international 
leadership to ensure that we achieve this vital goal.
<P>
	I am very impressed with the work of the parliamentary 
standing committee represented by the  three parties sitting in 
this House and I am looking forward to criss-crossing Canada, 
hearing views from grassroots Canadians in helping us develop 
a unique, independent Canadian foreign policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Madam Speaker, I have one 
question for the hon. member.
<P>
	During the election campaign I heard from people in my 
constituency, and I think others did across Canada, that 
Canadians want this country to take care of Canadians first. 
They said we have to cut down substantially on the amount of 
money spent on foreign aid. That is what recent polls have 
shown as well.
<P>
	I want to know how the member would answer these people 
when they ask if that is what this government will do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Madam Speaker, this is a question that we as 
parliamentarians get. I get it in my own riding and it is a very 
fair and honest question, knowing the deficit and the public debt 
we have. The comments I get are that charity begins at home.
<P>
	We have to point out to Canadians that we are all brothers and 
sisters on the same planet. When someone says charity begins at 
home, Somalia, Ethiopia, Cambodia are also home for 
Canadians.
<P>
	I was in Cambodia observing its elections. I learned that only 
one in five children reaches the age of five and the lifespan is 
only around 50 for adults. How can we say no?
<P>
	Those are our neighbours. When we hear charity begins at 
home I have to remind myself that is part of my home as well and 
I have to help those children so that they can live past the age of 
five.
<P>
	The other answer that we can give our constituents is that if 
we had global security we would spend less money on defence, 
we would spend less money in humanitarian aid. That money 
could go toward helping these countries develop their 
economies rather than looking for handouts.
<P>
	I concentrated on central and eastern Europe because I believe 
very strongly that with a little help there it is more an investment 
for the entire world. These countries that I have mentioned will 
and some are already helping the developing countries. Poland, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2328"> 2328 </A></B>
<P>
Hungary, the republics of Czechoslovakia and others are already 
helping third world countries.
<P>
	That will ease the burden on Canadians. Canada cannot do it 
alone, whether it is in peacekeeping, whether it is in 
humanitarian aid. That is why we have to look for partners 
around the globe.
<P>
	It is a tough question. We will get this as the committee 
travels across Canada. We have to look at it as investment for the 
future. We have to look at it as global security.
<P>
	When I was in Honduras recently with our overseas 
assistance, we brought in a water system to a rural community 
fed by gravitational force, no motors, no engines.
<P>
<B>(1940 ) </B>
<P>
	I was there talking to the barefoot children and to the local 
inhabitants surrounding me and I said that we were pleased that 
Canada could help in a small way. I said I was sure that if 
disaster struck Canada those people would be the first to come to 
our help and they all applauded.
<P>
	I saw the coffee and the bananas growing in the fields. I am 
sure these same countries we are helping, should a disaster 
strike Canada tomorrow, we do not know, would be the first to 
come to our assistance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Madam Speaker, I have two 
questions for the hon. member.
<P>
	He has made comments that I find very inspiring and 
uplifting. At lunch we have a meal served here and we do not pay 
for it as members of Parliament. At supper I understand there is 
a meal out there and we do not pay for it although we are being 
paid to work through these hours.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member if he would be willing to 
pay a small fee for the food we eat here and have that given to 
countries that are in need.
<P>
	My second question to the hon. member is what does he feel 
will be the impact on our foreign aid program as a result of the 
addition of $100 billion to our national debt over the next three 
years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Madam Speaker, in answer to the first question, I 
was on duty all day today. I paid $76 for my lunch today. How 
much did the hon. member pay?
<P>
	I think these are piddly little things that we bring in as red 
herrings to take us off the real issue. The real issue here is 
developing an independent Canadian foreign policy, not 
whether we are spending $2 or $5 on our lunch. I do not want a 
free lunch. I happened to take some of my constituents out for 
lunch today to the tune of $76.
<P>
	As I say, let us not waste taxpayers' money by pulling in these 
little red herrings to deflect us from the real issue.
<P>
	The second question is the real issue and if he would look at 
our budget we are trying to reduce the deficit. We are trying to 
reduce the public debt but gradually so not to hurt Canadians too 
much.
<P>
	If he looks closely at the budget over the next three years we 
will be reducing the deficit by over $3 billion just in the way we 
are operating the government.
<P>
	In the PMO and in the ministers' offices, et cetera, I feel the 
pinch now. I was parliamentary secretary in the 1980s and when 
I became parliamentary secretary I received additional staff and 
resources. Right now I am not receiving anything extra.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister told me to go to Hungary to 
represent Canada at a state funeral because its Prime Minister 
suddenly passed away, I was a one person delegation. Normally 
there would be three people representing each party. I was a one 
person delegation. We cannot run government any leaner than 
that.
<P>
	A month later the minister asked me to go to Norway for 
another state funeral. I was a one person delegation.
<P>
	I went to the inauguration in Honduras. I could not even take 
my wife. It was embarrassing because representatives from all 
the countries were there with their spouses being presented to 
the president. I was there all alone, a one person delegation.
<P>
	If the Reform Party cannot accept that I would say it is at the 
wrong level. It had better go to municipal politics because it 
does not know what international politics is all about.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the hon. member. I would 
like to fill him in a bit in that I know something about Russian 
history too. Those are my roots. My great-grandfather fourth 
removed negotiated the land deal with Catherine the Great for 
the Mennonites to move to the Soviet Union. I know what a 
prosperous country can look like. That country was the land of 
milk and honey as far as the Mennonite people were concerned 
at that time. They prospered tremendously but corruption and 
mismanagement set into the Czarist regime and finally some of 
the people started immigrating to the United States.
<P>
	In 1874, when the first Mennonite people came to the United 
States, they brought new strains of wheat along with them which 
were used pretty well until the 1930s. That was a prosperous 
country but now it has turned around. Through mismanagement 
they have lost everything. This is what Reform is really worried 
about, that this not happen to our country. That is why we are 
concerned that we have decent management, that we look after 
the wealth, and that we share it with other people.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Madam Speaker, I am glad the hon. gentleman 
shared his experience and his roots because it is members like 
him who understand.
<P>
	We are not here to throw money around. My parents came 
from Poland in 1930, right into the Depression. They had no 
handouts. Because they had no relatives they had to work for two 
years on a farm in Saskatchewan and they ended up working for 
22 years. They know what it is like to save for the future, to 
tighten the belt. Our party knows it too, but we also have to think 
of the over one million people who are looking for jobs.
<P>
	I am sure for that member like myself the hardest thing is 
when someone comes to his constituency office and asks for 
help in finding a job and there are not any  around. I see a lot of 
members nodding their heads. I thank the hon. member for 
sharing that with us.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to advise 
the House that prior to the vote I recognized two members of the 
Official Opposition.
<P>
	I am now going to recognize the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister for International Trade and revert to the 
government for this part.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Madam Speaker, I am honoured to be 
speaking in the debate on foreign policy. I want to congratulate 
all the men and women who are serving our country abroad in 
different capacities, whether in peacekeeping or in a foreign 
post trying to represent our great country.
<P>
	I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate the 
government, the Prime Minister, the Minister for International 
Trade, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of 
National Defence for undertaking this initiative to conduct both 
a foreign policy review as well as a national defence review. I 
am delighted to see that at some point in time both the foreign 
affairs policy and the national defence policy would go hand in 
hand. A number of groups have made presentation to me and to 
many of my colleagues. One issue they have raised with us is 
that they want some sort of connection between the review of 
foreign policy and that of national defence.
<P>
	I quote the National Forum on Canada's International 
Relations in the second part wherein it is indicated that the 
government is committed to reviewing the two hand in hand. 
There will be public hearings across Canada by parliamentary 
committees on Canada's foreign and defence policies. This is 
excellent. It is extremely timely in many ways.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	We are approaching the 50th anniversary of the United 
Nations. It is timely for a country such as Canada that has always 
been on the leading edge internationally to be reviewing its 
policy in terms of national defence and its foreign policy at the 
same time. It will coincide with the review of the United Nations 
policy on its 50th anniversary.
<P>
	I am confident that once again Canada will play a leadership 
role on that front and will be on the leading edge when it comes 
to the international scene in trying to ensure, as the 
parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs has indicated, that 
the global village lives in peace and harmony and that 
humankind never sees the suffering we have seen in past 
decades.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I will take a few minutes to address another 
issue in this area, and I am referring to trade and the review of 
our foreign policy. As you know, Madam Speaker, we are all 
aware of the extent to which trade, and especially international 
trade, contributes to Canada's economic prosperity. Nearly 
one-quarter of  Canada's GDP is generated by our exports of 
goods and services. One out of five Canadian jobs is directly or 
indirectly linked to international trade. Each billion dollars in 
Canadian exports creates between 12,000 to 15,000 jobs in 
Canada. This means that exports are extremely important to us 
as a country.
<P>
	We have every reason to be proud of our export record, 
because our exports have continued to post good results despite 
a slowdown in the world economy in the early 1990s. Finally, in 
1993, our monthly exports to the United States, for instance, 
reached new highs. The latest figures are expected to show that 
in 1993, exports to our principal trading partners rose 15 per 
cent over 1992 levels. Canada's exports to the United States are 
worth $268 billion annually, which means that in 1993, our 
exports to the United States were worth $4 billion more than in 
1992.
<P>
	However, in an increasingly competitive market, we cannot 
afford to merely repeat our past results. We have been 
successful, but we must do better. Intensifying our efforts in this 
area will create jobs in Canada and stimulate domestic growth.
<P>
	If we are to maintain our competitive position on 
international markets, we must act quickly to take advantage of 
opportunities offered by trade agreements like GATT and 
NAFTA. We have a chance to strengthen our service sectors, 
which represent more than two-thirds of our national economic 
activity, and also to improve our service exports.
<P>
	As we know, about 75 per cent of our trade is with the United 
States, and five groups of products represent more than 70 per 
cent of all exports of goods. We must continue to develop these 
exports while increasing our market share in other areas as well.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2330"> 2330 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	Asia, for instance, has become our second largest market after 
the United States. It has strong potential and poses a big 
challenge to Canada's competitiveness.
<P>
	We must also work with small and medium-sized business to 
develop an export mentality. As you know, only 15 to 16 per cent 
of our manufacturing industries export their products, and that 
is what happened if we look at the large number of businesses 
here in Canada.
<P>
	I cannot overstate the importance of exports for Canada, but I 
would be wrong to suggest that we should concentrate solely on 
exports. The international business climate changes rapidly, as 
you know. Businesses must now also consider international 
investments, capital flow, technology, research and 
development in developing their international marketing 
strategies.
<P>
	We are facing some challenges. We have a $9 billion to $12 
billion trade deficit in high-tech products, and our research and 
development results are less than those of the other G-7 
countries and OECD members.
<P>
	In addition, international business investments greatly help to 
create jobs and improve the competitiveness of  
Canadian-based companies. In this regard, we are fiercely 
competing with other countries to attract scarce investment 
capital.
<P>
	I see that I am almost out of time and I would like to know 
whether I have 10 or 20 minutes. Ten minutes?
<P>
	So, with all these issues, we must see if we have partners. We 
have banks, various businesses and manufacturers, and our role 
as a government is to work together, as a team, to develop the 
economy for the benefit of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to ask a question to the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Centre.
<P>
	He had started discussing the importance of international 
trade and I wonder if he could, in the few minutes at his disposal, 
elaborate a little more on Canada's important role on the 
international scene, as well as on the usefulness of trade to 
stimulate employment, support foreign aid and all those other 
issues raised by the hon. member this afternoon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Madam Speaker, this is a very important issue. 
Unfortunately, given the time left, I cannot provide a fully 
satisfactory answer to the hon. member. I will simply tell him 
that, as I indicated earlier, each billion spent on foreign trade 
results in the creation of at least 12,000 to 15,000 jobs.
<P>
	Every time we talk about job creation in Canada, we have to 
take into account the fact that we must do our best to encourage 
companies to do business abroad, not only because of the better 
opportunities, but also because only 10 to 15 per cent of 
Canadian companies are currently doing business abroad. 
Consequently, our government should continue to encourage 
more and more Canadian companies to do business abroad.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, as you know, we have a problem in Canada 
with private sector investments in the field of research and 
development. If we compare Canada to other countries, we see 
that our government invests a lot, or at least enough, in R and D, 
but that the problem is the inadequate contribution of the private 
sector.
<P>
	This is very important, and our government is sending a signal 
to the private sector. If we want to gain a reasonable momentum, 
the private sector must invest more in research and 
development.
<P>
	As you know, over 80 per cent of new jobs created in Canada 
are created by small business. So, our government took that into 
account and developed a policy to support small business.
<P>
	In response to my hon. colleague's question, when we talk 
about government policy in the area of job creation, it is very 
important to bear in mind that we believe in import. It is one of 
the best ways not only to create employment here, in Canada, 
but also to generate additional revenue in Canada. To fight a$38 to $40 million deficit and a debt now totalling over $500 
billion, funds must be generated. And there are two main 
sources of funds. One source is taxation, and as my hon. 
colleagues know, Canadian taxpayers have had it up to here with 
taxes. So, other means of generating revenue must be sought.
<P>
	In the end, these means of generating revenue will be 
provided by small and medium-sized businesses which will 
create jobs for Canadians here, in Canada, and export their 
products in other countries.
<P>
	I hope to have answered the question of the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it rather telling that today's debate is the fourth 
major debate on Canada's international relations in the first two 
months of this new Parliament.
<P>
	I am no stranger to this House. Having taken part in debates 
for the past 20 years, I can attest to the fact that I have never 
before had or been given so many opportunities to debate these 
issues.
<P>
	Therefore, the government is taking a new, very important 
approach at a critical point in our country's history. Against 
what backdrop is this debate taking place? In my view, there are 
many great reasons why we have to have this debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First, to state the obvious, we live in a very different period of 
world affairs from the rather more predictable one of almost a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2331"> 2331 </A></B>
<P>
decade ago. That was when the last comprehensive updating of 
Canada's foreign relations policies was undertaken.
<P>
	Then we wondered whether Mikhail Gorbachev was for real. 
Almost no one would have believed or predicted the German 
reunification at that time, or for that matter the swift collapse of 
the Soviet power. As Mr. Gorbachev, the last President of the 
Soviet Union observed rather wistfully during the final throes of 
that momentous upheaval: ``Once again history has accelerated 
its pace''.
<P>
	In retrospect it is clear that the international community was 
not prepared for so much unprecedented change so soon. There 
was hardly time to rejoice at the fall of the Berlin wall and to 
embrace the prospect of the so-called peace dividend when the 
rhetoric of the gulf war and the new world order took over.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	That too proved to be ephemeral. As sober second thoughts set 
in other conflicts flared. Foreign policy analysts and pundits 
turned their attention to the new security risks of the post cold 
war era.
<P>
	Most hopes of the 1990s had been pinned on developing new 
multilateral arrangements and on strengthening forms of 
economic and political co-operation. However even at this level 
as we approach the midpoint of this decade there are still many 
questions awaiting answers.
<P>
	The United Nations for example will mark its first half 
century next year as a financially strapped organization that is in 
demand in a positive sense and more embattled and in need of 
reform than ever.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians understand that difficult choices are needed in 
order to formulate a rational plan for managing our common 
future which is at risk. This brings us to a second important 
reason for reviewing Canadian policy.
<P>
	Before the government proceeds to make these choices, as it 
will have to do sooner or later, Canadians will have to reflect on 
this issue and share with members of Parliament their views on 
our country's foreign policy.
<P>
	Before decisions are made on important aspects of the 
management of public affairs, Canadians are entitled to be heard 
in an open and democratic consultation. When institutions 
responsible for foreign affairs spend Canadians' money, the 
members of this House, elected to represent their interests and 
their values, have a responsibility to demand results in return.
<P>
	We in the Liberal Party were aware of this attitude of 
Canadians when we began a consultation process several years 
ago to develop a renewed, more democratic and more 
independent foreign policy. I hope that such dialogue will 
enable us to find a consensus among all Canadians on the nature 
of Canada's key international interests, on what Canada can 
afford as a nation and on the best way to meet the challenges of 
the 1990s and of the next millennium.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I only have a few minutes but I would like to elaborate on what 
in my view is a balance of caution and inspiration in this 
populist approach this government has taken in terms of 
consultations with Canadians. There is caution because we have 
to be careful not to give the impression of doing all things in all 
places.
<P>
	This morning the minister responsible for foreign affairs 
commented that we must learn to do better with less. Canada as 
we all know has been spending about $12 billion a year on 
defence matters and about $4 on foreign affairs and trade 
programs. Given the constraints on those budgets in the 
foreseeable future it becomes even more important to me to look 
closely at where and how the dollars are allocated and to get the 
best value for that in terms of clearly defined, clearly identified 
priorities and objectives.
<P>
	Inspiration will be needed. In doing this we will need to look 
at how key trade-offs should be made and how the different 
strands of foreign policy can be tied together. How for example 
should aid, trade, human rights and environmental policies be 
interrelated? It will be an interesting debate and one that I hope 
will give us some direction. However it is going to be a tough 
debate.
<P>
	Do we have the right structures and institutions for 
implementing these policies? It may be time to rethink how we 
organize our foreign policy machinery and processes to meet the 
new challenges.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs told us that he wanted public 
consultation to be as broad and as thorough as possible.
<P>
	I am sure that I speak for all hon. members when I say that we 
approach this review with an open mind and the desire to hear as 
many Canadians as time and resources will allow.
<P>
<B>(2010) </B>
<P>
	As Chairman of this committee responsible for consulting and 
listening to Canadians, I personally undertake, along with most 
of the members of the committee I think, to do my best to 
understand where we are going and to explain in a report to be 
tabled in this House by the end of October what we will have 
heard and understood from testimonies and how we see things.
<P>
	Let Canadians be warned however that we will not be able to 
meet all expectations. That is impossible. We will do our best 
however to meet as many as possible and to take as much time as 
possible to look for a fair and equitable solution. As I said 
earlier, we cannot please everybody. When all is said and done, 
we are the ones who will have to set priorities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2332"> 2332 </A></B>
<P>
	When I say we, I mean all of us Canadian parliamentarians. 
We will be the ones who will have to take into account the 
representations made to us, the values, the special interests, the 
day-to-day concerns of Canadians about employment, security, 
well-being, all of this within the framework of a fair and 
equitable foreign policy.
<P>
	That is the challenge facing the members of the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade if we 
want to lead the way for Canada's international relations at a 
time when world events not only happen much faster but are 
sometimes very troubling.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To quote an ancient Chinese curse, we live in interesting 
times. In this high risk, multi-choice world decisions will have 
to be taken. That is why it is so important to use this review to 
prepare ourselves well. We are counting on the knowledge, 
experience, common sense and the goodwill of Canadians to 
help us as their elected representatives to carry out this task.
<P>
	I hope we are successful. I pray we will be successful. I will 
give it my best.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Madam Speaker, I first want to 
congratulate the committee chairman, the member for 
Ottawa-Vanier, on an excellent speech. I commend him for his 
commitment to the cause of Canada here and abroad.
<P>
	The committee will be travelling from one end of the country 
to the other. Representations will be made by groups interested 
in the issues of foreign aid, foreign policy and so on. At what 
point in time will the committee which is dealing with defence 
policy issues and other international and foreign affairs issues 
present its report to the House of Commons? Will the members 
of the committee be the same members who are now sitting on 
the foreign affairs committee or will others be joining it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> Madam Speaker, some of 
the answers I will be giving are my own. The steering committee 
of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade has not yet set its agenda for work and consultation.
<P>
	I hope we will be ready to go by the end of this month. We will 
be consulting with Canadians as individuals but also as groups. 
There will be interest groups and people with a special message 
to give us. The schedule of meetings has not been established as 
yet. I wish I could give that schedule tonight. It would save some 
money on advertising.
<P>
	The second question was on the work of the defence 
committee which is presently holding its meetings. It has started 
work on its order of reference. I believe there are areas which 
overlap.
<P>
	Foreign policy first and foremost is the why issue of this 
exercise. Why Canadians would like to participate in 
peacekeeping rather than peacemaking is a debate; why 
Canadians tie environmental issues to the questions of aid and 
human rights and so on.
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	Defence is more or less the how we do things and that is a 
special study that defence will be doing as to how best to put into 
effect the why decision, the policy issues, decided by 
government and proposed by parliamentarians. I see foreign 
affairs as the committee that decides why we should be doing 
these things and defence on matters of defence telling us how 
best to do that.
<P>
	I see all the other agencies such as CIDA telling us also as 
professionals in the field how best to put into action the why 
decision, the policy issues, that this House will recommend in 
its report.
<P>
	I do not know if I answered the member in a satisfactory 
manner but I tried to address some of his points.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank the hon. member for the confidence he places in the 
committee and the members on that committee.
<P>
	I have one question. How are we going to prevent as a 
committee the dominance by special interest groups, the sort of 
overwhelming influx of special interest groups in many areas 
and how are we going to actually get down to the grassroots of 
this thing?
<P>
	I wonder if the member could address that question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
very hard question to answer.
<P>
	I believe there are two aspects to our study. One of them is the 
collective aspect of interest groups that have a particular 
message to put to the committee. We would invite those people 
to send us their written presentations and we could go through 
them. I expect the committee will get many of those.
<P>
	The other aspect is the individual approach, the grassroots 
approach, the individual Canadian who has ideas and who wants 
to put them to the committee. We will have to hear those 
persons.
<P>
	I am going to propose that we hive off smaller subcommittees 
of this large committee of 22 people. I do not know yet and I may 
be doing this in anticipation of the decision but the proposal 
before us today is that there be 15 members of the House and 
seven senators. I take it if that happens then we could hive off 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2333"> 2333 </A></B>
<P>
smaller groups of say five or six parliamentarians and really go 
into the grassroots areas of this country, the communities, and 
hear how they see our direction in the coming few years and 
possibly into the next century.
<P>
	Having said that, it will be up to us to give them a fair chance 
to be heard but as far as the groups are concerned I see them 
presenting us briefs, as we call them, memoirs-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the 
member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I will be splitting this 20 minutes segment with my colleague, 
the member for Saanich-Gulf Islands.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want first of all to urge the people of Canada to accept the 
offer made by the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier, who chairs 
the committee, to listen to what you have to say because it is 
essentially the point of my speech today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I do welcome the opportunity of addressing the House on the 
topic of Canada's foreign affairs policy.
<P>
	My feeling is that the more our foreign policy is reviewed 
publicly, such as in this discussion, the more the policy will be 
understood and supported by the public. To go a step further, if 
the discussion is carried outside the House in communities 
across the country the more accurately will our foreign policy 
reflect the majority opinion of the electorate. This is 
particularly important, in my opinion, when it comes to revising 
or formulating defence policy, which should be a subset of 
foreign policy.
<P>
<B>(2020) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian public is very supportive of its armed forces in 
time of war, but it is less interested in time of peace. However, 
what Canada has experienced in the  nearly 50 years since the 
end of World War II cannot properly be called peace. We have 
had relative peace within our boundaries but that was so, in large 
part, because Canadian troops were engaged overseas in smaller 
wars such as in Korea and in the cold war.
<P>
	Throughout this half century as well Canadian forces were 
engaged, as they are at the moment, in peacekeeping operations 
around the world. The public must realize, therefore, that the 
terms war and peace are subject to redefinition. It should also 
accept the responsibility for engaging in this debate on foreign 
policy including defence and peacekeeping.
<P>
	In asking for public consideration and input, it might be 
helpful to do several things. We should probably define 
peacekeeping, then examine what we have been doing in that 
field. We should also postulate our ideals of foreign policy. 
What should Canada's policies be and why? It might then be 
instructive to compare the ideal with current policy to see if 
there are anomalies or gaps in our policy.
<P>
	Finally, we should zero in on defence policy and the specifics 
of peacekeeping.
<P>
	Concerning definitions, the Canadian public should at least be 
aware of the difference between peacekeeping and 
peacemaking. Peacekeeping implies that there is an agreement 
in place, as is the case between Serbians and Croatians in parts 
of the former Yugoslavia. Peacemaking implies an action to 
bring hostile parties to agreement, which is the case in Bosnia.
<P>
	In reviewing our foreign and defence policies, the public 
should decide if it supports both activities and under what 
circumstances.
<P>
	If we examine Canada's participation in peacekeeping and 
peacemaking operations over the years, we find that changes in 
operations and our commitments have taken place without our 
necessarily having changed policy. Through an apparent zeal to 
participate in all peacekeeping operations, we have gradually 
become immersed beyond the intent of our policy and almost 
beyond our resources.
<P>
	We have also learned some lessons over the years. I cite as an 
example our experience in Indo-China. Canada was part of a 
moribund commission there for many years. It was a wasted 
effort. However, when it came time to help the Americans 
extricate themselves with their prisoners of war from Vietnam in 
1973, Canada wisely joined the new commission with much 
revised terms of reference but pulled out after six months when 
the main part of the job was over. It made good sense.
<P>
	We said that we should postulate our foreign policy ideals. 
What do we believe in as Canadians and therefore what should 
our foreign policy be?
<P>
	I believe that we are a generous people who believe in 
democracy and the rule of law. We do not believe in imperialism 
and we do have strong humanitarian feelings.
<P>
<B>(2025 ) </B>
<P>
	We are also pragmatic enough to believe in collective 
security. All of these beliefs shape our foreign affairs and 
defence policies. I do encourage the public to think about these 
basics and to add its own ideas.
<P>
	A comparison of our ideals with what we have been doing as a 
country in peacekeeping should tell us how far off our policies 
are. My personal conclusion would be that we are fairly close 
but that a review is very necessary. As said earlier, the public 
should participate to the maximum extent in that review.
<P>
	In addition to encouraging public participation in the review 
process, I would like to leave the House with these thoughts. 
First, the Canadian forces, through years of efforts overseas, 
have created for Canada an international reputation of real 
value. We should do more as a country to capitalize on our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2334"> 2334 </A></B>
<P>
standing by taking a greater leadership role in the shaping of 
international peacekeeping policy and procedures.
<P>
	Second, in reviewing our foreign and defence policies we 
should take full account of the work of previous House standing 
committees. Some of the reports I have read have been excellent 
and should not be wasted.
<P>
	Third, if as expected the review reaffirms the role of aid of the 
civil power for the Canadian forces, it must be confirmed that 
the forces are of sufficient strength to meet that commitment as 
well as their other obligations.
<P>
	In a similar manner, the equipment state of the forces should 
be checked after the forthcoming review to ensure that it is 
adequate to perform the given tasks.
<P>
	Finally, policy review of foreign affairs and defence, 
including peacekeeping, should be an ongoing process by the 
departments concerned, by Parliament and by the public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate 
the member on his comments, many of which this government 
subscribes to in the sense that from time to time we have to 
revisit any policies in order to ensure they truly reflect the 
modern age and the needs and aspirations of all those who are 
affected.
<P>
	My question to the member is quite specific. Could he tell the 
House and all Canadians what percentage of assistance his side 
of the House would support in terms of gross domestic product, 
in terms of foreign aid that Canada should give to other 
countries around the world, taking into consideration Canada's 
position internationally as a member of the United Nations 
where we have a commitment to fulfil when it comes to the 
international scene? Also, would his party support the 
continuation of that level of aid?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, in responding to the question, my 
address was specifically on peacekeeping. The question directs 
itself to foreign aid as well as peacekeeping and so I will try to 
respond to those two issues.
<P>
	First, consideration of foreign aid should not be done in 
isolation of the fact that Canada is spending a great amount on 
peacekeeping. That should be part of balancing the ledger for us.
<P>
<B>(2030 ) </B>
<P>
	On foreign aid, I will not give it as a measure of percentage of 
the gross domestic product but my reckoning is that $2.5 billion 
per year at this moment with Canada's vulnerable economic 
state is too high.
<P>
	We must continue to give foreign aid, there is no question, 
particularly for some of the things that we have heard of today 
such as pure water systems and the like. That is good. That is 
direct aid to people and we need that.
<P>
	What we must get away from is some of the government to 
government aid which finds its way into bottomless ratholes. 
That we do not need. My response in summary is keep up the 
peacekeeping. Bill it as part of foreign aid. Cut foreign aid by a 
measure below $2.5 billion a year and direct it in the right 
channels.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too want to address the foreign affairs review from the 
standpoint of its relationship with and to defence 
considerations.
<P>
	As we have heard before in this place, the end of the cold war 
and the reduction of the antagonism it engendered between the 
two superpowers has unhappily not resulted in a world that 
could look forward to an extended peaceful coexistence.
<P>
	The world today is probably more volatile and unstable than it 
was when the Warsaw pact and the iron curtain were alive and 
well. As a result there continues to be a need for effective 
defence forces and co-operation in defence matters between 
like minded people.
<P>
	There are those who would disagree with this assessment, 
those who think that Canada should show the world the way by 
dramatically reducing the Canadian Armed Forces and 
concentrating those that are left on peacekeeping and 
community assistance projects.
<P>
	As idealistic as I am, I cannot agree with this philosophy. 
Canadians enjoy an excellent way of life and an excellent 
standard of living. One of the reasons this is so is that over the 
years we have been willing to commit Canadian support to assist 
in maintaining democracy and freedom not just at home but in 
almost every part of the world.
<P>
	As my colleague pointed out earlier, we are involved in 
several such endeavours at this moment. Unhappily there are 
those who mistakenly think that the people in the armed forces 
tend to be war minded and supportive of belligerent or strong 
arm policies.
<P>
	I am here to assure members that while they may be many 
things, Canadian service men and women are not stupid. They 
are fully aware that if as a result of deliberate escalation or 
inadvertent error, a shooting war  should develop they as trained 
members of the armed forces will be first in the line of fire.
<P>
	No, the men and women of the Canadian forces are very much 
in favour of keeping the world at peace. They also know that the 
awareness developed between people in co-operative defence 
forces often spills over into many other aspects of international 
relationships.
<P>
	Thus defence considerations can have considerable impact on 
foreign relations. As evidence let us examine some of the 
relationships that have come about as a result of our 
participation in two world wars, the Korean war, NATO, 
NORAD, the gulf war and other co-operative military efforts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2335"> 2335 </A></B>
<P>
	In so doing, we find that these affiliations have enabled or 
helped to enable a level of trust and comradeship which has led 
to a better relationship between our countries, to increased 
interest in our problems, to more understanding and willingness 
to accept our position even on matters totally unrelated to things 
military and finally to increase trade and co-operation between 
the nations concerned.
<P>
	For instance, although it is now 50 years since Canadian 
forces liberated Holland toward the end of the second world war, 
there is still a special place and warmth in the minds of 
Netherlanders when they think of, relate to and deal with 
Canadians today. This special relationship extends beyond those 
who were physically there during the liberation. It has been 
taught in school and passed down, so that no matter the age that 
good feeling is there.
<P>
<B>(2035) </B>
<P>
	This does not mean that the hard-nosed Dutch businessman or 
woman will not attempt to drive the hardest bargain and extract 
the best deal when dealing with his or her Canadian counterpart. 
It does mean that there will be an underlying warmth and some 
assurance of fair play in the negotiations.
<P>
	Moving north, our relationship with Norway is favourably 
affected and influenced by the many Norwegians who took their 
flying training in Canada during World War II. Not only did they 
take their flying here, many of them took Canadian wives back 
to Norway with them after the war.
<P>
	Unquestionably, these experiences have resulted in a far 
better relationship between our two countries than would have 
prevailed had they not occurred. These relationships have been 
further deepened and strengthened by our mutual participation 
in NATO. In fact, it would be fair to say that Canadian defence 
forces operating with or in some cases against other countries 
have substantially enhanced Canada's stature in the world.
<P>
	While we are examining how we should shape and conduct 
our foreign affairs, it would be an expensive and ill-advised 
oversight to overlook the lucrative  opportunities and benefits to 
be achieved through military co-operation.
<P>
	Ideally this foreign policy review should have been 
completed prior to the commencement of any defence policy 
review. After all, defence policy should be a logical and 
supportive extension of foreign policy.
<P>
	Because it has been necessary to convene and conduct these 
two studies concurrently, it is vitally important that the two 
committees work closely and co-operatively with each other, 
exchanging information and keeping updated as the reviews 
progress.
<P>
	Moving away from North America and Europe for a moment, 
I am certain that in their considerations the joint standing 
committee on foreign affairs and international trade will 
appreciate that not all democracies are the same and that unlike 
Canada, in many countries the military is an integral part of 
government. For example, this is so in Tanzania.
<P>
	When Tanzania was first establishing independence and 
requested assistance, Canada dispatched a Canadian forces 
training team to Tanzania to carry out in-country training there 
and brought the Tanzanian peoples defence force members to 
Canada to attend Canadian military training schools here.
<P>
	Many of those Tanzanian trainees are now experienced senior 
officers who have considerable influence in their government 
and who still harbour feelings of warmth and respect toward 
Canada as a result of their experience with our military 
personnel. Although now on a much smaller scale, this 
co-operation continues today.
<P>
	Make no mistake. These people are Tanzanians first and 
foremost but a good relationship has been established which can 
positively influence any negotiations between our two 
countries.
<P>
	Considering our interest in and increasing trade with the 
Pacific rim, it would seem appropriate for the committee to look 
carefully at the utility of establishing mutually advantageous 
defence relationships with the countries there. The same 
rationale applies to our relations with Central and South 
America.
<P>
	Whether it be an exchange of military attachés, making 
training teams available, or opening Canadian forces training 
schools to their use, good military contracts are an excellent way 
to improve understanding and co-operation between countries.
<P>
	One of the often overlooked benefits Canada reaps from 
Canadian forces involvement overseas is the ambassadorial role 
that our personnel play. They and in turn our country are liked, 
respected and in many cases emulated by those they encounter. 
Also, because these military interrelationships occur across the 
rank spectrum and thus involve all social walks of life rather 
than just the relatively high diplomatic level, the effects are far 
more broadly based.
<P>
	The results, advantages and benefits of such programs can 
often far exceed the costs of participation.
<P>
	To a large extent Canada's prosperity and way of life depends 
upon international trade and thus on world stability. No one can 
say that world stability is totally dependent on military defence 
or assistance pacts. But history has shown that such agreements 
and particularly those in which Canada has been involved have 
fostered a better, more predictable and more secure world. In 
conclusion, while it would be a mistake for the foreign affairs 
review to concentrate too much attention on defence related 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2336"> 2336 </A></B>
<P>
activities, it would be an even bigger mistake to overlook their 
value.
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	To reiterate, it is vital that there be continuing close contact 
between the joint standing committee on foreign affairs and the 
joint standing committee on defence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a very 
important debate and the review which it launches will be 
among one of the most important tasks which Parliament will 
face in the upcoming term.
<P>
	I am pleased to be able to speak in this debate and to be a part 
of the process of this review as vice-chairman of the foreign 
affairs and international trade committee under the direction of 
the chairman, the member for Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>
	The minister and others who have spoken before me have set 
out the broad policy issues which we must examine in this 
review. Having listened to them I will not repeat their points. 
My contribution to this debate will be more modest. I hope to 
add some personal reflections which will highlight the 
considerations which I believe will be relevant to this review.
<P>
	When my former colleague on the faculty of the University of 
Toronto, Marshall McLuhan, coined the phrase ``the global 
village'' which was used tonight in this debate, it seemed like an 
exaggeration but developments since that time have made that 
statement resonate more truthfully.
<P>
	My own professional experience prior to being elected to this 
House led me to work and teach in many countries, the United 
States, Africa, the Middle East, China and Latin America. In the 
course of my work it became quite clear to me why it was a 
Canadian who came up with the phrase global village.
<P>
	Unlike our neighbours to the south, Canadians have long been 
conscious of our place in the world. We are more dependent on 
other nations and peoples by virtue of our trade. Thirty per cent 
of our economy is dependent on our exports.
<P>
	We are more aware of the outside world by virtue of the great 
number of new Canadians who have retained the diversities of 
their culture while at the same time contributing to our unique 
Canadian identity.
<P>
	Our outside activities to which some of the other speakers in 
the House tonight have referred have brought consciousness to 
Canadians of the importance of our  participation in the United 
Nations and other peacekeeping activities.
<P>
	We are also aware, I dare suggest, of the nature of the world 
outside because of the federal institutions which have allowed in 
this country a realistic and flexible sharing of powers between 
various levels of government, a federal arrangement which I 
would suggest is compared and analysed as a model in many 
other places in the world, particularly the European union which 
is now examining how to deal with exactly that problem and also 
the problem of globalization which was referred to by the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs earlier today.
<P>
	When we look at our great cities such as Vancouver, Toronto, 
and Montreal, we see features which make them in and of 
themselves global players by virtue of their trade and 
communication links, the diversity of their populations and 
their existing and future infrastructure.
<P>
	Canadians are interested in and determined to fashion a 
foreign policy which will determine the place which this country 
and they themselves will take in a rapidly evolving world.
<P>
	Canadians are aware of the fact that the former distinction 
that prevailed between foreign and domestic policy objectives 
have been blurred. As the Minister for International Trade put it 
this morning there has been a blurring of these distinctions or as 
my colleague at the University of Toronto, Sylvia Ostry, puts it 
``there is nothing more domestic than international trade 
policy'' a matter which we learned in this House when the matter 
of article XI of the GATT was discussed with great intensity 
early on in your term, Mr. Speaker, and in my first term in this 
House.
<P>
	We learned it in the 1988 election when people said to me that 
international affairs are not of interest to the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	Then we were into an election on an international agreement. 
The 1988 election was fought on an international agreement 
which had incredible domestic political consequences. It was 
the failure of the government of the day to recognize the 
importance of those domestic consequences that caused them to 
lose the last election.
<P>
	In this party we did not lose that perspective. We always 
argued in favour of a coherent policy, the need for domestic 
adjustment policies, to accompany the international economic 
reality that was being imposed by that agreement. I and other 
Canadians look forward to having the chance to focus on how 
our domestic and international policies will be co-ordinated. 
We will have many chances to do so in the House.
<P>
	The first speech I had an opportunity to make in the House 
was on social policy review. There was some question as to what 
it had to do with international affairs. Even a matter seemingly 
as domestic as social policy review must be considered in light 
of the international  reality in which we live. If we believe in 
globalization we cannot formalize social policies which do not 
take that reality into account.
<P>
	Next month there will be a labour market summit in the 
United States led by the President of the United States in which 
we will be participating. Labour policies will shortly be on the 
list of issues to be co-ordinated along with many other issues, if 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2337"> 2337 </A></B>
<P>
we are to survive in this integrated world in which we are going 
to live.
<P>
	As Canadians we must participate in these activities and 
ensure that our values are reflected in the social charters which 
will arise in the NAFTA, GATT and World Trade Organization if 
we are to avoid having solutions imposed upon us from outside. 
We have a population uniquely qualified in the world to 
participate in this discussion. This has been brought home to me 
many times since the election, but I would like to cite a couple of 
examples.
<P>
	Recently a constituent of Vietnamese descent from Rosedale 
came to my Hill office. He was a refugee to this country of only a 
few years who now has a successful business. He came to say 
that he had been to the Vietnamese embassy. He wants to get 
back to Vietnam. He wants to get trade going with Vietnam. He 
speaks the language and he knows the culture. He is eager and 
many of his colleagues are eager. With that eagerness comes 
some extraordinary opportunities. As the secretary of state for 
Asian affairs said today, we must take a pragmatic approach to 
human rights when we are looking at these issues.
<P>
	My friend who came to speak to me in my office is anxious to 
go back and trade with Vietnam, not only for the commercial 
purposes that will enable him to do so but because it will enable 
him to bring some form of relief to the family and friends he left 
and to encourage an evolution of human rights in that country 
which he believes will benefit everyone.
<P>
	We need to have mechanisms in place that will facilitate that 
reform. It will be our job in committee to examine and to ensure 
that when the day is done the Government of Canada has created 
the instruments necessary to enable people like the constituent 
of whom I spoke to participate in the world in a way that would 
enrich him, enrich us and enrich the world.
<P>
	That example is not just one of commerce. I was at a 
conference at the University of Ottawa last week. I learned that 
traces of the pollution being produced in the Sea of China, 
adjacent to Vietnam, are actually being found in our Arctic 
waters. If we do not trade with Vietnam, if we do not send our 
expertise there, if we do not deal with the problems of pollution 
in Vietnam, it is not a Vietnamese pollution problem we will 
have; it is a Canadian Arctic pollution problem that we will 
have. We must address this issue. We have the means and we can 
contribute to finding a solution.
<P>
	There are Chinese Canadians and Filipino Canadians. I do not 
mean to hyphenate the term Canadian, but there  are Canadians 
from every walk of life who have experience outside this 
country that they are eager to bring to bear to enrich the country 
and to enrich our experience. Those people are insisting we craft 
or create a truly Canadian foreign policy which reflects our 
values and impresses our neighbours. They also recognize that 
our neighbours have an interest in us.
<P>
<B>(2050 ) </B>
<P>
	Recently I had the privilege of going to Vancouver with a 
parliamentary delegation. Some members of the House were 
also on that trip. As I sat in a helicopter flying over Clayoquot 
Sound looking at clear-cuts with a communist deputy from 
Sardinia on my left and an English MEP on my right, I said to 
myself: ``What am I doing looking at clear cutting in Clayoquot 
Sound with these gentlemen?'' One might ask: ``What business 
is it of theirs?'' The fact of the matter is that they were saying 
they were not going to buy our tree products if they did not come 
over to Canada and become satisfied as to how we were doing 
business.
<P>
	We can say we do not like it, but it is a fact of the new life. We 
can call it a loss of sovereignty if we like, but the lesson we 
learned from that trip was the following. We agreed with those 
people in the end that we should create an international 
agreement which would set up objective rules, which would lay 
out an objective and a scientific way in which we could 
determine whether or not clear cutting was being properly 
conducted, whether or not we were being environmentally safe.
<P>
	That is the way we will have to go in the future. We will have 
to craft rules and we will have to craft institutions. Nowhere will 
it be more important in the matter of institutions than in dealing 
with our neighbours to the south, the United States of America. I 
will leave you, Mr. Speaker, with this last thought: Nowhere 
would I suggest we must be more vigilant in ensuring that we 
have proper institutions than when dealing with our neighbours 
to the south.
<P>
	In that respect we had an interesting witness before the 
parliamentary committee last night who told us a very important 
truth. He said the United States was a great nation and it did not 
respect servile allies. It respects those who stand up for their 
rights.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has made it clear that we will craft an 
independent foreign policy. That independence is not just 
because we want it as Canadians. It is also the best strategy to 
pursue in dealing with an ally like the United States which is 
powerful and strong but willing to respect the strong opinions of 
others.
<P>
	In conclusion, we live in an interdependent world. We have in 
our own ridings, each one of us here, the expertise and 
knowledge of Canadians. John Polanyi was speaking on 
peacekeeping just two nights ago in my riding. All of us in the 
House have a great wealth of expertise in our ridings.
<P>
	As a member of the committee I look forward to an 
opportunity of hearing from Canadians. In so doing we  will 
learn about ourselves and how we can best contribute to a 
peaceful, sustain-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2338"> 2338 </A></B>
<P>
able, prosperous world which we now share with those who were 
once foreigners but today are our neighbours.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was tempted to ask my venerable colleague why he stopped 
when he did. I realize he had about 25 pages of material, as is his 
wont as a university professor and an expert on international 
affairs. However I realized that with the time constraints 
imposed upon him by the hierarchy in this place he had to cut 
short his deliberations.
<P>
	I will try to take up where he left off. I hope I will be forgiven 
if I am a bit more humble in my approach to this topic, not 
having the erudition and background demonstrated by my 
esteemed colleague or his outstanding eloquence on the topic.
<P>
	I do not want to make light of it because my colleague from 
Rosedale said something that is extremely important for each 
and every one of us to consider. In the context of an evolving 
Canada we now have the kinds of expertise for which most 
countries lust and literally spend hundreds of millions of dollars 
to develop. I am referring to the human resources afforded us by 
people from all over the world. They come here with a cultural 
background that gives them an opportunity to understand the 
societies, the political systems and the economic systems 
throughout the world. They also have the networks and the 
dispositions to take advantage of those opportunities for the 
greater good of Canada.
<P>
	One might deduce that perhaps my particular disposition is 
one that would accord more attention to the international trade 
side of a foreign affairs and international trade review.
<P>
<B>(2055 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not want you to fall into a trap, Mr. Speaker. I believe it is 
absolutely crucial for the well-being of our country to exercise 
its dynamics on the world stage, to ferret out if need be all the 
opportunities that will allow for the flourishing of Canadian 
economic potential and for the capitalization of all the resources 
we have in great quantity and quality. However, I am first and 
foremost concerned that Canada takes its rightful place on the 
world stage as a country or as an entity that will play its role as a 
leader in social development and will understand the values of 
social and cultural organizations permeate virtually everything 
we do and that all our neighbours, all our allies and all our 
trading partners should emulate.
<P>
	Therefore I take my lead from my colleague who just finished 
a most studied presentation before the House and from my other 
colleagues both on the committee and in the departments as 
secretaries of state and ministers. These people have served with 
other members of the House in other capacities. They have 
learned from those experiences and through that learning have 
developed an appreciation of what the country ought to do.
<P>
	Each and every one of them has pointed out a specific, it is 
almost de rigueur to say, niche in foreign policy and 
international trade of particular interest. They wanted to give an 
indication to the House and to all citizens watching the debate 
that the country never needed as much as it does now a new 
examination of and definition for its role on the world stage.
<P>
	That means we have to take to heart, with the kind of energy 
that only the House can provide, the initiative of our ministers to 
undertake a studied, thorough, analytical review. It must be as 
critical as it can to derive all elements which will formulate a 
policy that is truly reflective of the Canadian entity not only in 
the latter part of the 20th century but one that will lead us, I dare 
say, into the 21st century.
<P>
	The challenges are many. Many of the debates we have in the 
House on occasion seem to be separated and distinct one from 
the other, but they are all interrelated. On many occasions, and 
even today during the course of debate, we talked about the 
importance of Canada's new policies on the environment, a new 
definition of international human rights, and the impact of 
expanded trade agreements on goods, services and the 
exchange. Even some of our colleagues on the opposite side of 
the House have pointed out that there are enormous changes in 
the concepts and definitions of peacekeeping and peacemaking 
and the consequences that come to bear on domestic policy as a 
result of those emerging definitions.
<P>
	They have also acknowledged that there are many 
consequences and implications for military and civil 
considerations, police selections, environment and 
surveillance. These obligations the Canadian people through 
their representatives, through their government and through the 
House, accept as part of a leading western society, a leading 
progressive society and as the leader in social integration and 
social harmony.
<P>
	That is no longer a question of domestic policy. It is no longer 
merely a question of determining priorities in a budget 
environment. It is no longer merely a question of determining 
how much money we shall accord here and how many such 
resources we shall accord there. Rather it is a question of how in 
their comprehensive total they will contribute to stamping a 
character which can be defined and sum totalled with one word, 
and that is Canada.
<P>
<B>(2100 ) </B>
<P>
	We need public consultation. We need public input. 
Colleagues from both sides of the House agree that if we are to 
develop a proprietorship in a policy each and every one of us on 
both sides of the House and through us the people who elected us 
have an opportunity to shape the views of the government of the 
day and governments to come.
<P>
	Foreign policy is not merely the reflection of the individual 
on the moment for the moment. It is the vision of a people who 
decide in total what avenues will be pursued, what goals will be 
developed and what  objectives will be realized in the medium 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2339"> 2339 </A></B>
<P>
and long term. They can only do that if all the Canadian public 
has had an opportunity to wax their views in an environment 
where those who will put those views into effect listen, shape 
and then implement those views.
<P>
	In the course of this debate some members have reflected on 
the problems associated with mixing what seemed to be 
different objectives, commercial and humanitarian. I said 
earlier in the debate with colleagues from the Reform Party that 
I was not sure that the two had to be mutually exclusive.
<P>
	If Canada is to play a leadership role it is going to exercise 
influence. Some of that influence will be translated as internal 
meddling because influence means we will have others accept 
our values in life, our political values, our cultural and social 
values as they pertain to organization, development and 
integration. If we are going to truly exercise that kind of 
influence then we must be prepared to engage in productive 
relationships with other countries.
<P>
	In the past we have focused on Europe and the United States. 
We have omitted ourselves from other areas such as South 
America. We have omitted ourselves from the tiger economies 
of Asia. We have essentially taken a one dimensional approach 
to our relationships with developing and underdeveloped 
nations.
<P>
	Now is the time to approach this in a more comprehensive 
fashion and through it to have an influence on domestic policy. 
It is becoming more clear that the primary focus of our 
government should be one that gives its attention to a policy that 
expands beyond our borders. Then we can see ourselves not only 
as we would like to see ourselves but as others would recognize 
us to be.
<P>
	I urge all members to support this initiative and then to engage 
themselves in the review that will follow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member referred to the input by the people of Canada into this 
process of developing international affairs policy. The member 
also referred to Canadians influencing people from other 
countries through this policy.
<P>
	Our country has a tremendous debt. Do we have the money to 
try to influence others outside this country? In my constituency 
and across the country Canadians have been saying we should 
spend less on external affairs and on foreign aid in particular. 
Over the last couple of years polls have shown people across the 
country believe this.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	If we are going to ask Canadians for their opinions in terms of 
foreign aid, is the hon. member willing to vote the way his 
constituents tell him to vote and reduce the amount of money 
Canada spends on foreign aid?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe: </B>Madam Speaker, I do not see why you have a 
problem recognizing me; after all, we have known each other for 
five years now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In response to my hon. colleague opposite when constituents 
vested their confidence in me and other members on this side of 
the House and I dare say even on that side of the House, they 
thought: ``I look at the candidate and the party. I want that 
individual to stay abreast of all the issues on which he or she will 
have an impact. I expect that individual to stay informed. I 
expect that member of Parliament will exercise decisions in the 
best interests of the country first and foremost, and second in the 
best interests of all citizens''. Sometimes they are exactly the 
same thing.
<P>
	The question of whether Canada at this moment in its history 
has the resources to engage in foreign aid ought to be addressed 
in the specifics of the analysis. To suggest that is the foremost 
question today is to negate that we are talking about a 
comprehensive review of foreign affairs and international trade. 
Foreign aid is but a portion. Whether it is large or small is 
immaterial; it is but a portion of that review. It is but an aspect of 
the obligation we impose upon ourselves under the two headings 
of international trade and foreign affairs.
<P>
	It also negates the importance of the commercial aspect when 
we consider that international trade. Foreign relations and 
foreign affairs are part and parcel of an economic strategy that 
will also bring wealth to the individual Canadian citizen, to the 
individual Canadian entrepreneur, or to groups thereof.
<P>
	To say that perhaps we should not be focusing on this at this 
time or to suggest or even to allow others to infer it from what 
we say damages the comprehensive economic policy that could 
emerge from a proper analysis and review of international trade 
and foreign affairs.
<P>
	I know my colleague opposite would not want us to do any of 
that. In fact, I am sure he would encourage us to promote any 
kind of activity that would encourage the development of 
economic benefits for Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Madam Speaker, the end 
of the cold war represents an incredible change in the 
international order. It is the last episode of an era which will 
disappear forever. However, the new emerging order is 
characterized by a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2340"> 2340 </A></B>
<P>
great instability, and is jeopardized by new threats such as 
environmental disasters, the demographic explosion, the 
wasting of resources, financial crisis, and particularly the 
impoverishment of people living south of the tropic of Cancer, 
which is three quarters of the world population.
<P>
	From a safety standpoint, the increase in the number of 
problem areas throughout the world compels the international 
community to search for regulating  mechanisms which fit 
current political and economic realities. We must no longer 
merely avoid war: We must also seek peace.
<P>
	With the 21st century looming ahead, peace is a big challenge 
for the international community, because everywhere there are 
conflicts which seem more and more difficult to solve.
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	It is in this context that the Canadian government is 
undertaking a review of its foreign policy. In the coming weeks 
and months, parliamentarians will have to decide what the new 
policy should be. We will have to ask ourselves what Canada's 
role in the new world order should be.
<P>
	I want to mention a few ideas to think about in the course of 
the debate on the foreign policy review.
<P>
	Apart from the violence which, too often, characterizes 
relations on the international scene, economic activity also 
influences those relations. In that regard, the globalization of 
economic activity is one of the outstanding features of the last 
few decades.
<P>
	The growing internationalization of goods and services 
production, distribution and marketing that characterizes this 
tendency was influenced by the following factors: the lowering 
of tariff or other trade barriers, the gradual elimination of 
controls over capital flows, progressive deregulation in many 
countries, the reduction in transportation and communications 
costs.
<P>
	The powerful forces of market globalization strongly 
influenced by the actions of multinational corporations give us 
the impression that we are ushering in an era where the worst 
kind of economic selfishness takes precedence over solidarity 
and sharing.
<P>
	In recent years, the gap in the standard of living between the 
rich countries and the poor countries has become wider. 
According to the United Nations, this gap has doubled in the last 
30 years. As victims of war and the international financial crisis, 
the people of the third world have become increasingly 
marginalized.
<P>
	Malnutrition, the lack of democratic rights, the denial of basic 
human needs and the 17 million refugees in 1991, in addition to 
the 30 million displaced people, prevent us from turning a blind 
eye to the inappropriate development of the southern 
hemisphere countries, as our reality will be affected if only with 
respect to immigration and the environment.
<P>
	Most developing countries were hurt by the economic crisis in 
the current global climate. In the 1980s, the reduced terms of 
trade were accompanied by the debt crisis and the 
overexploitation of natural resources to resolve this crisis. 
Caught in a vicious circle, the countries of the south cannot find 
a solution to this situation that has become intolerable for their 
population.
<P>
	Partly responsible for this drama since they created the global 
economic configuration inherited from colonialism, the 
industrialized countries are also its  victims as they will have to 
pay for environmental disasters, which do not recognize 
political borders.
<P>
	We can no longer try to solve these problems without thinking 
that sustainable development is the cornerstone of the global 
socio-environmental chessboard. What does the Liberal 
government think of this?
<P>
	Since a lot of people still believe in the old saying charity 
begins at home, the Canadian government has shown a tendency 
in recent years to reduce its development assistance budget. 
Unfortunately, this tendency is shortsighted and based on a 
erroneous assessment of the global situation as the millennium 
comes to an end.
<P>
	It would be appropriate to briefly examine the evolution of aid 
to developing countries to show Quebecers' and Canadians' 
solidarity with their disadvantaged brothers and sisters 
throughout the world in the last 40 years.
<P>
	In 1950, the external aid office, the ancestor of CIDA, had a 
development assistance budget of $11 million. By 1967, its 
budget had grown to $279 million. In 1968, the Canadian 
International Development Agency was created. CIDA never 
became a separate department. It was created without an 
incorporating act and comes under a statutory authority that 
gives it the power to spend money.
<P>
	In his last report, the Auditor General of Canada points out 
CIDA's uncomfortable position under the sometimes undue 
pressures exerted by several departments such as foreign affairs, 
international trade, and national defence, not to mention 
Canadian businesses involved in international activities.
<P>
<B>(2115) </B>
<P>
	Legally, CIDA reports to the Department of Foreign Affairs, 
but its mandate has never really been specified. In principle, it 
should advise the government on co-operation issues; in 
practice, we have the impression that it responds to influence 
more than it really influences others.
<P>
	Since it is not a department and since there is no minister with 
a mandate only for development assistance, Canadian ODA has 
never reached the internationally recognized standard of 0.7 per 
cent of GDP. In 1993, Canada spent only 0.4 per cent of its GDP, 
which is much less than what many industrialized countries 
spent on development assistance, as the following figures show: 
Norway, 1.16 per cent; Denmark and Sweden, 1 per cent; the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2341"> 2341 </A></B>
<P>
Netherlands, 0.86 per cent; France, 0.63 per cent; Finland, 0.62 
per cent; Canada, 0.40 per cent.
<P>
	While the federal government spent hundreds of millions of 
dollars on advertising Canada's 125th anniversary and sending 
its propaganda to all Canadian households, at the same time, it 
lowered the aid budget for developing countries.
<P>
	The early 1990s marked the end of any measure to achieve the 
goal of 0.7 per cent. The 1991 budget not  only further restricted 
development assistance but it extended aid to include the 
countries of eastern Europe and of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States.
<P>
	In his 1992 economic statement, the then Minister of Finance 
cut international aid by $50 million. The last budget reduced the 
international aid envelope by 2 per cent and it will be cut by the 
same amount again in 1995.
<P>
	Canada's aid strategy will soon be at a crossroads.
<P>
	To this decrease in aid for developing countries must be added 
something else that reduces the impact of Canadian ODA: the 
scattergun approach. This approach no doubt confirms the many 
influences that turn CIDA away from its objectives. The charter 
of official development assistance from <I>Sharing Our Future</I> 
bases Canadian aid on the following four principles:
<P>
	First, the fight against poverty; the main objective of 
development assistance is to help the poorest countries in this 
world; second, aid must seek to strengthen the human and 
institutional resources of developing countries so that they can 
solve their problems themselves; third, development needs must 
take priority in setting goals for official development 
assistance; fourth, development assistance must help to 
strengthen ties between Canadian institutions and citizens and 
those of third world countries.
<P>
	Despite such clear objectives, the Auditor General, no offence 
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, points out major 
shortcomings in what CIDA is doing: lack of clear, precise 
objectives and lack of coherence; dispersion and chronic lack of 
focus in CIDA's objectives; red tape favoured to the detriment of 
development content. On this point, I add that it is embarrassing 
to recall that for bilateral aid or the geographic program, CIDA 
uses 600 people to supervise the work of 125 people in the field. 
At the same time, a small organization like CECI sends 250 
co-operants to carry out specific small projects.
<P>
	The final shortcoming mentioned by the Auditor General is 
the limited knowledge of and minimal learning ability for 
accountability with respect to results.
<P>
	On the other hand, the Auditor says he is sympathetic to 
CIDA, since it is subject to many constraints and influences. So, 
what is at issue is not so much how CIDA is managed as the lack 
of legal framework which makes it vulnerable.
<P>
	In fact, Canadian development assistance increasingly finds 
itself torn between assistance and foreign trade. Which is to be 
favoured? This question sums up pretty well the whole problem. 
Again, the old saying ``grasp all, lose all'' is rather appropriate 
with regard to CIDA.
<P>
	Let us not forget that Canada's ODA encompasses several 
programs which further dilutes goal attainment by involving 
more and more people. Although the figures do not apply 
specifically to Canada, the 1992 report on the United Nations 
development program is particularly bleak and calls into 
question ODA practices in developed countries.
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	In spite of these flaws revealed by the UNDP, definite 
progress have been made over the past 40 years in developing 
countries: life expectancy went from 40 to 63 years; the infant 
mortality rate dropped from 190 per 1,000 to 80 per 1,000 and 
the ratio of deaths of children under five years of age from 300 to 
120 while, between 1970 and 1990, literacy grew from 23,8 to 
48 per cent in Africa, from 44 to 64 per cent in Asia and from 73 
to 84 per cent in Latin American and the Caribbean.
<P>
	Yet, absolutely scandalous gaps continue to exist in terms of 
the per capita GNP for instance. Here are a few examples: in 
sub-Saharan Africa, the GNP was $120 in 1968 and reached 
only $330 in 1988; in South Asia, it was $100 in 1968 and $320 
in 1988; in East Asia and Asia-Pacific, it was $100 in 1968 and 
had grown to $550 in 1988. Meanwhile, in Latin America and 
the Caribbean, it varied from $490 and $1,850 and in the Middle 
East and North Africa, it went from $220 in 1968 to $1,210 in 
1988.
<P>
	During that time, in OECD countries, the per capita GNP 
jumped from $2,750 in 1968 to as much as $17, 468 in 1988. In 
1993, OECD nations allocated about $71 million to official 
development assistance, while a 2 per cent annual growth in the 
economy of poor countries would cost industrialized countries 
$200 billion a year. When faced with needs of this magnitude, 
we all too often give up. I remind members that these same 
OECD countries spent in excess of $370 billion on national 
defence in 1992.
<P>
	Therefore, the problem is not one of resources, but rather of 
resource allocation. Canada's defence budget for 1994 is $11.5 
billion, while $2.8 billion has been budgeted for assistance to 
developing countries. One can assume that the powerful defence 
industry lobby has a great interest in seeing this budgetary 
structure remain in place.
<P>
	The Canadian government, cannot, however, continue 
indefinitely to support these questionable choices. By 
maintaining the gap between defence spending and development 
assistance spending, we perpetuate the belief that if poor 
countries cannot climb out of their state of poverty, the only 
solution left is for us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2342"> 2342 </A></B>
<P>
to arm ourselves to ensure our security in the face of a future 
revolt. Are we being foolish or reckless?
<P>
	Any future foreign policy should settle this debate and come 
down on the side of government funding for development 
assistance. Canada could take on a leading role in this area and 
map out a new course to follow in the field of co-operation and 
development in the 21st century.
<P>
	Moreover, Quebecers and Canadians are keenly aware of this 
new world vision which is tied not to the arms race, but to 
solidarity and sharing. It is no coincidence that roughly 250 aid 
agencies are members of the Canada Coucil for International 
Co-operation, the CCIC, and the Association québécoise des 
organismes de  coopération internationale, l'AQOCI. These 
NGOs are driven by the generosity and dedication of thousands 
of volunteers who donate their time and money to help and ease 
the suffering of the poorest and most destitute men, women and 
children in the world.
<P>
	In its foreign policy review, the Government of Canada must 
consider the objectives pursued by NGOs. It is generally 
recognized that these agencies are the most efficient channels 
for development assistance.
<P>
	In the years to come, the Canadian government, as stated by 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the House on February 9, will 
be expected to increase its support for NGOs. At the present 
time, NGOs receive only 10 per cent of the ODA budget. This 
percentage must increase, especially since amounts allocated by 
the Canadian government are matched by the substantial 
amounts invested by development co-operation agencies in 
their development projects.
<P>
<B>(2125) </B>
<P>
	Because NGOs have no political ties with the often 
illegitimate governments of poor countries, they are unlikely to 
be obliged to abandon their activities in countries with a record 
of gross human rights violations, since their assistance is always 
directed to people, which unfortunately is not always the case 
with bilateral aid.
<P>
	If we consider the fourth main principle of the ODA charter, 
which is that development assistance must help strengthen ties 
between Canadian citizens and institutions and those in the 
Third World, I think it is clear that the best vehicle for achieving 
this objective is the NGOs, whose workers merge with the social 
and cultural fabric of the people they help.
<P>
	At the other end of the spectrum, we find large Canadian 
companies carrying out turn-key projects in developing 
countries which preclude this merging with the population, 
create even greater dependency and, in the final analysis, 
guarantee maintenance contracts for these companies. Our 
foreign policy review should stress these major issues: Does 
Canadian ODA serve the interests of a few Canadians rather than 
those of the poorest countries? These are a few of the aspects of 
development assistance which the Bloc quebecois would like to 
see considered in the context of a foreign policy review.
<P>
	In concluding, I want to express my disapproval of the fact 
that the House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade is being merged with that of the 
Senate. I object on several grounds. In the light of budgetary 
cutbacks, I think such concerns should be reflected in all 
decisions made by the government. In this case, having senators 
on the joint committee will add to operating expenses if the 
committee plans sittings away from Parliament Hill.
<P>
	Furthermore, I also see this as a sign of panic on the part of the 
Liberal Party, which is afraid to see the party it resembles most, 
the Conservative Party, disappear altogether. To ensure the 
Conservatives are represented,  the Liberals are prepared to 
appoint committee members from their supply of federalists. 
This means putting elected and non-elected members of 
Parliament on the same footing. This is unacceptable in a 
society that is proud of its democratic roots.
<P>
	A survey conducted across Canada last summer indicated that 
more than 60 per cent of Canadians were in favour of abolishing 
the Senate outright. It is certainly not appropriate at this time to 
give the senators a legitimacy they have already lost as far as 
public opinion is concerned.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. member's 
comments and I am impressed with his generosity.
<P>
	I would like him to answer a question. I produced grain and 
livestock on my farm for years and years and I am producing 
more every year and it does not seem to keep up with the bills.
<P>
	I am now at the stage at which I am old enough and fortunate 
enough to have some grandchildren. Every time I welcome one 
of them into this world I have to tell them they have $24,000 of 
debt. The next one has more debt.
<P>
	How am I going to convince my grandchildren that I have 
spent their fortune already by being so generous. Can the 
member answer that for me? I have a great problem with 
spending somebody else's inheritance before I look after my 
own.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré:</B> Madam Speaker, I, too, have grandchildren. I do 
not want to leave them a country such as Canada the way it is 
now. However, I do not think that it is Canadian assistance to 
developing countries that put Canada in this situation. I simply 
want to point out the incredible gap between the nearly $12 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2343"> 2343 </A></B>
<P>
billion we invest in national defence and the $2.5 billion to $2.8 
billion we spend on aid to developing countries.
<P>
	We must realize that what we do not do for developing 
countries in the coming years is precisely what our children and 
grandchildren will criticize us for in 20 years, as the world order 
will be completely destroyed and the developing countries, the 
third world countries, will end up by imposing the law of the 
majority.
<P>
<B>(2130) </B>
<P>
	I think we must clearly agree that it is necessary to increase 
our aid to developing countries and that the arms race taking 
place around the world is just about the most stupid thing we 
have seen in the 20th century.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a great privilege today to speak on a subject that is 
close to my heart and the most valuable thing we possess beyond 
our good health. That is human rights, the right to live in peace, 
say, do and go where we want  within the confines of a fair, 
compassionate legal system, free of harassment and secure in 
due process. As the name implies, they are not a privilege but an 
undeniable right as a member of the human race.
<P>
	We in this beautiful country are very fortunate to be in one of 
the few countries where its people can express their human 
rights to their fullest potential. Tragically the same cannot be 
said for most countries in the rest of the world.
<P>
	The end of the cold war with its two warring superpowers has 
given rise I think to an environment of greater political 
instability and has unleashed decades of seething ethnic and 
tribal tensions; for example, Yugoslavia, Somalia and, right 
around the corner, South Africa.
<P>
	This will give rise to more bloody regional or civil conflicts 
and the rise of smaller, non-functional or poorly functional 
nation states with their nationalism, tribalism and, at times, 
intolerant attitudes and behaviours.
<P>
	Added to this melting pot of troubles are a number of other 
factors. Developing nations economies are either stagnant or 
have regressed dramatically over the past 20 years. Corrupt 
leaders have throttled and pillaged their economies for their own 
ends, pocketing foreign aid for themselves. Foreign 
governments in many cases have given aid for prestigious 
megaprojects that have often wound up being megaflops instead 
of concentrating on small scale rural projects.
<P>
	I will give an example. Sub-Saharan Africa, exclusive of 
South Africa, will take 40 years to get to the same level of 
economy that it had in 1970. If we take Nigeria out of that 
equation, it is going to take 100 years for that part of the world, 
that represents a population twice the size of America, to get 
back to where it was in 1970.
<P>
	Another factor is a world population that is spiralling out of 
control. In fact by the year 2050 we will have a population that 
will exceed 10 billion or more than twice what it was in 1990. 
These numbers will outstrip, I feel, the ability of this planet to 
adequately provide for its inhabitants and leave the majority of 
people with an appalling quality of life on a planet that is 
suffering from a significant amount of environmental 
degradation. Examples of this we can currently see.
<P>
	I would suggest that we would in part concentrate our efforts 
on providing aid in conjunction with population control in many 
of these third world countries.
<P>
	When we put all these factors together we have a climate that 
is ripe for conflict, struggle and human rights abuses. Although 
we may say we live in a beautiful and big country with a small 
population and that many times the situations seem far distant 
from us, make no mistake about it, what happens half a world 
away will sooner or later wind up on our doorstep.
<P>
	As has been mentioned here before by some hon. members, I 
like to think of ourselves not necessarily as Canadians first but 
as citizens of this planet. If we all  practised that perhaps we 
would be able to engage in a little bit more tolerance between 
each other.
<P>
	Abuses of human rights such as detention without trial, 
torture, rape, extrajudicial executions are commonplace and 
occur in such diverse countries as Iraq, China, Liberia, Brazil, 
Egypt, El Salvador, Angola and Burundi, just to name a few.
<P>
	My first personal experiences with gross human rights 
violations came when I was working in Africa in the 1980s. Here 
I saw people who had had chunks of their flesh torn out, whose 
human rights were trampled, who were tortured with hot irons, 
who were gang raped, who were brutally beaten and who were 
murdered. Once you see this first-hand you cannot turn your 
back on it. You feel compelled by every part of your soul to do 
something about it.
<P>
<B>(2135) </B>
<P>
	The response of the international community has in many 
cases been abysmal, particularly with smaller countries where 
people tend not to care too much about what happens. The world 
and the international community seem to deal with human rights 
violations in other countries only when it is politically 
expedient or when the media has thrust it on to the front stage so 
that it cannot be ignored.
<P>
	Self interest has directed many governments' response to 
human rights and violations of friends of a country are often met 
with silence while those that are enemies of a country are 
publicly and vigorously castigated. This shows a terrible lack of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2344"> 2344 </A></B>
<P>
political integrity, foresight and compassion with respect to 
foreign policy.
<P>
	What can we do about this? I should say that I am proud that 
we are one of very few countries in the world, one of only a 
handful I think, which can actually speak credibly on the matter 
of human rights which makes it more imperative that we do so.
<P>
	First, I suggest that we publicly castigate countries that 
commit gross human rights abuses. We must take a lead role in 
mobilizing other nations to force the country in question to 
mend its ways. International co-operation is the most 
expeditious way of dealing with this.
<P>
	There are certain techniques we can use and some that have 
been underutilized in the past. Most of them involve economic 
levers against the guilty party, for example, via the World Bank, 
the IMF. I think country to country loans are a powerful and 
often underutilized technique and can be very effective.
<P>
	We also need to tie economic aid and trade packages to human 
rights. Sports sanctions and the freezing of state assets are two 
other options that can be utilized under certain circumstances.
<P>
	A second thing that we as a country can do is to start looking at 
the United Nations and help to mobilize the countries in the UN 
to utilize it as the primary force to act as the advocate for human 
rights in the world.
<P>
	The following are some of my recommendations. First we 
have to define the various courses of action that we can take 
against states which commit gross human rights violations and 
get the acceptance of the UN body at large to follow suit when 
this occurs.
<P>
	Second, we must put forth an early, firm and decisive action 
on the part of the UN against brutal regimes and anticipate 
problems before they occur. We must anticipate these trouble 
spots and act early. A couple of examples might be Mr. 
Zhirinovsky and his so-called democratic group in Russia. 
Another one that is happening very close is South Africa. I just 
would make an aside and say that we as a country have to support 
democratic reform in that country. If South Africa falls and falls 
into the same morass and quagmire as has occurred in most 
sub-Saharan African countries after their independence, then 
we will lose the whole southern half of the continent for the next 
50 to 100 years. I think it is very important that if we invest now 
it will pay off amply in the future. An ounce of prevention, as 
they say, is worth a pound of cure. Yugoslavia is an excellent 
example where we did not take the initiative early enough and 
now we are paying for it in spades.
<P>
	Another thing we need to push for on the world stage is to 
support the international tribunal against war crimes. We must 
make it known on the public stage that individuals who commit 
gross human rights violations are going to be met with the full 
and effective force of the international community.
<P>
	As an aside I would also push for this country to press for the 
banning, as I have said before in this House, of anti-personnel 
devices world-wide. These devices have no role to play in war. 
They are meant purely to maim innocent civilians and 
destabilize a country for decades to come, even after peace has 
occurred.
<P>
	For us to do these things and to forge a consensus among other 
countries and to stop flagrant abuses of human rights will 
require clarity of vision, unshakeable determination and 
backbone. When you look, as I have said, into the terror-filled 
eyes of innocent civilians who have had their basic human rights 
trampled and see the despair and suffering they are enduring, 
you cannot turn your back on it. In fact, with every fibre of your 
heart and soul you are compelled to help them.
<P>
	It is our moral obligation to this beautiful, cruel, frustrating 
world that we live in to provide the international leadership to 
fight for one of mankind's most basic needs.
<P>
<B>(2140 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Madam 
Speaker, since 1982 the Department of Foreign Affairs has 
administered the federal government's program for the 
promotion of Canadian exports.
<P>
	In recent years this program has been criticized by academics, 
the private sector, provincial governments, government 
employees and others for the following reasons.
<P>
	First, employees and the workings of the TCS have been 
integrated only imperfectly into the culture and operations of 
the Department of Foreign Affairs. The pursuit of mundane 
commercial interests is not a natural activity of individuals who 
joined foreign affairs and were trained to become diplomats 
dealing with international politics, war and peace and the 
nation's external security. While there are many career officers 
who work hard on their assignments in the commercial field, 
such assignments continue to bring little prestige and 
opportunities for advancement in the institutions hierarchy.
<P>
	Second, the private sector has expressed discontent with the 
lack of input into the work of the federal trade promotion work. 
The Department of Foreign Affairs is heavily bureaucratized 
and never has had a tradition of working with the private sector 
in the pursuit of its traditional mandate.
<P>
	Efforts to rectify this situation through the creation of 
consultative committees have not been a great success. One 
aspect of the criticism by the private sector is that the 
operational objectives of the trade commissioner services are 
often linked with political goals.
<P>
	The promotion of political and military alliances, of human 
rights and democratization and of international development 
efforts can and often do interfere with the promotion of 
international trade.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2345"> 2345 </A></B>
<P>
	Third, the work of foreign affairs duplicates and overlaps with 
that undertaken by provincial governments. In major countries 
abroad, trade representatives from the two levels of government 
compete with each other. Further duplication occurs as federal 
trade offices throughout Canada deal with the private sector and 
promote exports in competition with provincial officers.
<P>
	Fourth, even within the federal government there are at least 
15 other departments that undertake trade promotion activities 
of their own. CIDA-INC as it is known is one of them. In some 
instances its activities are better financed than those of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Efforts to co-ordinate the different federal departments' 
offices through foreign affairs have not been totally successful. 
Time does not permit me to dwell further on the negative 
assessments of the Department of Foreign Affairs trade 
promotion efforts.
<P>
	Instead, I must now turn to some positive suggestions for 
reform of Canada's program. Suggestions for change involve 
different models of organization based mostly on real world 
experiences. There is a proposal to create a crown corporation 
independent of direct political influence.
<P>
	The Government of British Columbia recently created such a 
crown corporation. Another model envisages the complete 
privatization of the service. This best describes the system used 
by Britain where executive agencies with independent 
management have been established on a contractual basis.
<P>
	The removal of the bureaucratic culture from these agencies 
has resulted in substantial performance increases. This 
precedent can be applied to the trade commissioner service 
offered by our federal government. However there is also great 
merit in an approach I am investigating now in the context of 
preparing a private member's bill. The approach involves the 
use of a commercialized service to deal with the problems of the 
present system.
<P>
	The following represents my preliminary thinking on the 
subject and I welcome suggestions for improvement from 
anyone interested in the subject.
<P>
	I propose to call the new organization the Canadian Trade 
Organization. Let me call it CTO for short. Its headquarters in 
Canada will be located in one of the large commercial centres 
like Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver with branches in other 
cities. The CTO will have offices in foreign countries with 
headquarters in the capital like Rome and subsidiary offices in 
major cities like Milan.
<P>
<B>(2145 ) </B>
<P>
	The responsibility for the Canadian operations will be in the 
hands of a board of directors consisting one-quarter each of 
representatives nominated by the federal government, the 
provincial governments, private sector organizations like theCanadian Manufacturers' Association and the Exporters' 
Association, and general membership consisting of Canadian, 
foreign and multinational firms.
<P>
	The day to day operations of the CTO are undertaken by a 
private staff, the executive director of which is also on the board 
of directors. Governments can have liaison officers on the 
operational staff.
<P>
	Financing of the CTO will come one-quarter each from the 
four groups represented on the board of directors. In addition the 
organization is required to sell its services to private firms and 
administer Canadian involvement in trade fairs throughout the 
world. This is important.
<P>
	Profit sharing or bonus payments to employees successful in 
such private sector sales will assure that the CTO is responsive 
to market needs. Such needs often involve Canadian 
governments in their roles as diplomats and makers of industrial 
policies. The proposed links of these government offices with 
the CTO through the board of directors and liaison officers 
assures that the public interest will adequately be reflected in 
the employees' work.
<P>
	Periodic meetings, the publication of a newsletter and social 
affairs arranged in different cities will provide a constant link 
among directors, staff and the private sector in Canada. Contacts 
through such arrangements will provide the proper environment 
for the flourishing of commercial activities of CTO.
<P>
	I now turn to the business offices of the CTO abroad. They 
will have advisory councils consisting of  representatives from 
the local Canadian embassy or high commission and from local 
industry. The latter will most likely consist of multinational 
corporations, Canadian firms with representatives abroad and 
local firms interested in trade with Canada.
<P>
	The operations of the foreign business offices will be in the 
hands of Canadian managers who work with staff consisting 
predominantly of persons who speak the local language, have 
local contacts and are familiar with the country's business 
practices.
<P>
	Financing for these offices will come from the same sources 
as that for the operations located in Canada, that is federal and 
provincial governments as well as interested parties in the 
private sector.
<P>
	In addition special efforts will be made to obtain financing 
through contracts with private sectors abroad and in Canada. 
These contracts will involve market research, establishing 
commercial contacts, assuring representation at fairs and 
exhibits, keeping an eye on technological and product 
developments and many other activities that would help 
promote international trade and Canadian competitiveness.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2346"> 2346 </A></B>
<P>
	In many smaller countries CTO offices will be attached to 
local embassies or consular offices. In larger countries they will 
be housed in separate quarters though a close link with the 
diplomatic representative is essential.
<P>
	The preceding is only a rough and preliminary sketch of the 
institutional, financial and operational characteristics of the 
proposed replacement of the international trade promotion 
system which is presently operated by the Department of 
Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	My sketch should suffice to show how the commercialization 
of these trade promotion services will first, eliminate the 
currently existing duplication of government services. Second, 
it will permit its governors and operators to concentrate on 
commercial issues while it retains the benefit of access to and 
advice from Canada's professional diplomats in foreign affairs. 
Third, it creates private sector incentives for professional staff 
to serve the needs of Canadian business. Finally, it removes 
domestic and international political agendas from the trade 
promotion program.
<P>
	In conclusion, I note that it should be possible to structure the 
CTO so that the government cost of providing trade promotion 
services will be lowered considerably. Such savings should be 
welcomed by the federal and provincial treasuries and 
departments like foreign affairs during this period of extreme 
financial restraint.
<P>
	The commercialization of the service would permit 
governments to focus better on the delivery of services in which 
they have a competitive advantage. The financial and 
operational involvement of the private sector would increase 
operational efficiency of the service. It would also raise general 
interest in international trade.
<P>
	I believe that out of the shortcomings of the current trade 
commissioner service in foreign affairs arises an opportunity for 
change that will produce nothing but winners.
<P>
<B>(2150 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member welcomed 
suggestions on his concept of a Canadian trading organization. I 
am wondering whether he is familiar with a parliamentary task 
force that submitted a report over 12 years ago now. It was not 
called a Canadian trading organization. It was called a national 
trading corporation.
<P>
	This all-party task force which travelled across Canada and 
actually through Europe, looked at trading houses, looked at 
bartering, et cetera. The whole idea was that if we could help 
small and medium sized businesses increase their exports by 10 
per cent and if we could get some firms that were not exporting 
into the export business, we could generate $10 billion worth of 
additional trade. That was back then; it would be more like $100 
billion now.
<P>
	The concept was that this national trading corporation would 
be funded 50 per cent by government and 50 per cent by the 
private sector. As we know, many countries today will not trade 
with another unless there is some government involvement and 
that was the idea of the 50-50 per cent.
<P>
	Unfortunately on the day when the special parliamentary task 
force tabled its report the Conservatives at the time submitted a 
minority report and shot down the main report. They agreed with 
the recommendations. Actually, many of the recommendations 
came from the Conservatives. Unfortunately on the day that the 
report was tabled it was not supported.
<P>
	I recommend it to the hon. member. I believe there will be a 
copy of the report in the parliamentary library. I know it would 
be of great interest to him because I think that is the kind of 
foreign affairs, independent Canadian foreign policy, that we 
should be looking at.
<P>
	I really appreciated his creative suggestions. It is too bad that 
he was not here 12 years ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank very much the hon. 
member for pointing out the existence of this report and my 
executive assistant will go after it tomorrow morning. Perhaps 
we can speak a little bit more about my ideas.
<P>
	I have already been invited to send my concept to a number of 
private sector groups and government people for comment. 
Then perhaps something can develop out of it with the hon. 
member's support, maybe a private member's bill. If he wishes I 
will happily give all of these ideas to the government to do 
something good for Canada.
<P>
	I am most pleased with the hon. member's comments and 
thank him very much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> If we have some time, Madam Speaker, I do want to 
caution the hon. member that in our findings the trade 
commissioners were the most efficient and the most effective in 
promoting export trade.
<P>
	That could have changed over the 10 years, but we 
complimented the trade commissioners in our report because we 
got very positive feedback on their service and their 
effectiveness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank again the hon. member 
for his comment.
<P>
	I want to make sure that I am not ever wanting to depreciate 
the efforts that people make. I believe, however, that the 
effectiveness of efforts made by individuals is determined by 
the institutions and the incentive structures in which they work.
<P>
	It has been suggested to me by people who are intimately in 
contact with this that we can bring the system we now have into 
the next century by looking at what other countries have done. 
They have removed it from their foreign affairs departments 
where the culture simply does not seem to be functioning as well 
as it does when the institution is separate, profit motivated and 
the private sector has a direct stake in it. That is my basic 
concept.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for 
the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The question is on the 
amendment.
<P>
	Pursuant to order made earlier this day, the recorded division 
is deemed requested and is deferred until the end of the time 
period for government business on Wednesday, March 16, 1994.
<P>
	Accordingly the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 
p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 9.55 p.m.)
