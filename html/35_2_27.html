<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TEENAGESUICIDE">TEENAGE SUICIDE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada's teenage suicide rate is alarmingly high 
compared with other industrialized countries. From 1979 to 1991 
suicide by young people from 15 to 19 doubled to 13.5 per 100,000, 
making Canada third behind New Zealand and Finland. When this 
occurs in a nation that is constantly rated as the world's best, we 
must ask ourselves what has gone wrong.
<P>
	I urge my fellow members of Parliament to become more aware 
of this problem and to support the efforts of this government to turn 
this tragic statistic around. Our efforts must reflect the need to 
communicate a message of hope to Canada's youth. We must not 
fail in our commitment to create jobs and to create a society where 
hope for a better tomorrow is the trademark of our efforts.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on April 26, the Académie des grands Montérégiens will 
pay tribute to five personalities of our great region, including 
someone who is well known in Saint-Hyacinthe, Claude 
Marchesseault.
<P>
	In the last three decades, Mr. Marchesseault has been involved in 
areas as diversified as economic development, recreation, 
exceptional children, the agri-food industry,  the arts, philanthropy 
and municipal affairs, while at the same time holding an important 
position at the Fédération des caisses populaires Desjardins.
<P>
	Since its founding, the Académie des grands Montérégiens has 
honoured a number of outstanding people from our region, 
including Raymond Lévesque, Arlette Cousture, Juliette Huot, 
François-Albert Angers, Yves Beauchemin and Louis Laberge.
<P>
	I salute the invaluable contribution made to our community's 
development by the indefatigable Claude Marchesseault, who 
cannot be ignored and who has now joined the ranks of the great 
men and women honoured by the Académie.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1996CENSUS">1996 CENSUS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one 
month from now Canadians will be asked to identify themselves by 
race in the 1996 census. We have the option of classing ourselves as 
white, Chinese, Asian, black, Arab, Filipino, Latin American, 
Japanese, Korean, or other. We do not have the option of skipping 
the question.
<P>
	If an employer or a landlord demanded to know a Canadian's 
race, they would bear the full weight of the human rights law which 
prohibits racial discrimination and so they should. Yet incredibly 
the federal government requires the very same racial identification 
by law.
<P>
	I would urge all Canadians to send a message to the federal 
government that in Canada we believe in the equality of all 
Canadians regardless of the country of their birth or the colour of 
their skin. Identifying our ethnic origin as Canadian on question 19 
of the census will tell this Liberal government that Canadians want 
to be known as Canadians, nothing more and nothing less.
<P>
	Census by race, what a disgrace.

	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, gasoline prices in the region recently soared to their 
highest level since the gulf war. The average price in Ontario last 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1582"> 1582 </A></B>
<P>
Friday was over 58 cents per  litre. That amounts to an increase in 
just one week of as much as three cents a litre.
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday a senior citizen in my riding came into my 
office very concerned and anxious about a letter he had received 
from the Council of Canadians. Basically this letter was nothing 
short of a scam and fear mongering against one of our most 
vulnerable groups in society, our seniors.
<P>
	By distorting and misrepresenting the true facts, this Council of 
Canadians plays on the fears of our seniors and attempts to extort 
money from them. This group wants the seniors of Canada to pay 
for what they are entitled to get for nothing: a petition presented to 
the government on behalf of seniors. Every member of Parliament 
provides that service free of charge. I know from the past three 
years in this House that we all present all constituents' petitions on 
a regular basis.

cannot commit to paying monthly contributions to this group, then 
$35, $50 or $75 now will protect their hard earned pensions.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-bilingual or trilingual democracies have measures to ensure that their 
language communities will live together in harmony. It is what we have in 
Canada. We are very proud of it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the flurry of attempts to come up with a vocabulary more

he thinks the concept of a Quebec people to be nothing more now 
than a language community?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the official opposition seems to want to play 
dictionary games. What counts, and I have been saying this since I 
arrived in this House, is substance. Substance is what counts.
<P>
	And the substance that Quebecers want to keep for the most part 
is a Quebec identity and a Canadian identity; a Quebec pride and a 
Canadian pride; a Quebec solidarity and a Canadian solidarity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the minister wants to play, I am going to talk scrabble. 
There is a six letter word in scrabble, spelled ``verity''. This is what 
we in the opposition are after.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said himself that 
there is a reality beyond words. Would he tell us whether, in reality, 
he thinks, as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, that 
Quebecers constitute a people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition, whom I thank for his 
questions, seems, surprisingly enough, not to understand one thing.
<P>
	It is an extraordinary opportunity in today's world to be born a 
Quebecer and a Canadian. I am a Quebecer and a Canadian and I 
would fight with every means democracy puts at my disposal 
anyone who tried to take away my Canadian identity.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr.

about him.
<P>

distinct society-Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport would

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the Minister of 
Transport. It is the Minister of Human Resources Development 
who never listens and never understands anything in this House.
<P>
	Let me get back to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, 
who, while he does not answer, at least listens. I would ask the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs if he would acknowledge, 
after switching from the reality of the Quebec people to the idea of 
a distinct society, to that of the homeland of the French language 
and culture and finally to that of linguistic community, whether the 
Liberal Party of Canada's search for new terminology continues to 
be with the intent of diminishing the status and the role of the 
people of Quebec within Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to finally be able to express the truth 
about the status and the role of the people of Quebec, because it is 
not being expressed by the opposition and never will be.
<P>
	The people of Quebec enjoy the greatest possible autonomy 
within Canada as regards their own institutions. Of all the 
federations in the world, it would be difficult to find one more 
decentralized than Canada. Canada's provinces have a higher status 
than American states, Swiss cantons or German l«nder. This is 
what Quebecers enjoy. They also enjoy Canada.
<P>
	We are not saying that everything is perfect. Things have to be 
improved. The reality of Quebec in Canada and in North America 
must be recognized, but to move from that fact to endlessly 
describing Quebec as suffering to the point where only such an 
extreme solution as secession will suffice is stretching the truth to 
the breaking point.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There seems to be a lot of

everyone's co-operation in making questions and answers a little

Speaker, first of all, I am sick and tired of hearing the minister 
tell us that we Quebecers are lucky to enjoy our institutions within 
Canada. That is appalling.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs can go ahead and try, 
as he has yesterday and today, to dissociate himself from the 
Liberal Party of Canada's resolution adopted this past weekend, but 
the fact remains that he voted in favour of this demeaning concept.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that it is a cause for alarm that a concept 
as important as the one adopted by the Liberal Party for its new 
orientation has been endorsed by the Prime Minister, without the 
minister responsible for this having any opportunity to say 
anything about its content beforehand?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, in his preamble, the hon. member spoke of 
``we Quebecers''. I would remind him that I am as much a 
Quebecer as he is, and that no one here has the right to speak as if 
he were the one and only spokesperson for Quebecers. I feel 
obliged to remind him that Quebec is a pluralistic society.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Second, concerning the motion on which I voted, I would repeat, 
for what I believe is the third time in this House, that what it says is 
that the Liberal Party of Canada supports the enshrinement in the 
Constitution of the principles recognized in the Parliamentary 
resolution defining the distinct society, which was adopted in 
December, 1995. That is precisely why I voted in favour of the 
resolution.
<P>
	Third, the Liberal Party of Canada is a highly democratic party. 
Sometimes democracy has such surprises in store for us, and we 
shall always be most pleased to acknowledge and accept, for what 
they are worth-I repeat, for what they are worth-the lessons on 
democracy offered us by a party whose leader was elected by the 
astronomical number of 150 members, and one of whose leading 
members was quoted as saying that the choice of a leader did not 
concern the public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not my fault that the minister felt excluded from the 
``we'' in my reference to Quebecers.
<P>
	What credibility can be given to a new minister of 
intergovernmental affairs, when it took the unanimous 
denunciation of the National Assembly to reveal to us the full 
extent of his feelings on this proposition which, just hours before, 
he was trying to sell us on right here?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I am delighted with the hon. member's 
commitment to never again  identify himself and his party as the 
sole Quebecers. That in itself is very good news.
<P>
	Second, and I have always said the same thing about this, there 
may be disagreements on the choice of words, but what counts is 
the substance. I would advise the hon. member to go easy on 
ridiculing the people of Quebec, who have always acted from the 
heart, sometimes less than successfully but always admirably, in 
seeking paths toward reconciliation, so that they might preserve 
Canada.

explain to the House exactly what is his understanding of 
ministerial accountability, particularly in relation to events

<P>
	We received the weakest answer that any minister has given to a 
question in this House since the 35th Parliament began, so we want 
to try again.

responsibility extends to situations where there is a serious 
dereliction of duty by an official of the minister.

serious dereliction of duty by somebody in his department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the 
leader of the Reform Party thought the answer was weak. Perhaps 
that reflected the weakness of the question.
<P>
	The question cannot be answered because all of the assumptions 
in the question are totally false.
<P>
	I have to reiterate that a commission of inquiry is looking into all 
the matters that concern the hon. member so much. That 
commission of inquiry should be allowed to do its work. We should 
not be playing a political game in the House of Commons that 
could injure the process of justice, that could further injure the

and perhaps even injure the reputation of Parliament.

That occurred under another government and led to the 
establishment of this inquiry. That is not the dereliction of duty 
I am talking about.
<P>

Somalia inquiry, a cover-up that occurred under this government 
and under this minister. I am referring particularly to the alleged 
scheme by the public affairs branch of DND under General Boyle 
to rename, hide and even destroy important Somalia documents.
<P>
	I ask the minister again. Does he accept that this attempted 
cover-up constitutes a serious dereliction of duty by officials 
responsible to him in the department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again the 
hon. member is so concerned about the public affairs issue. Last 
week the commission chief, Justice Létourneau, said that he would 
set aside two or three weeks to look at this specific question. He 
starts those hearings on Monday. That is where all the questions 
should be answered. That is where all the evidence should be 
placed, not in the House of Commons.

talk about dereliction of duty I will, but of the dereliction of duty of 
him and his colleagues.
<P>
	Yesterday the hon. member made a grave allegation on the floor 
of the House and went outside where parliamentary immunity was 
no longer present and that allegation evaporated. His defence critic 
has had so many positions on the inquiry that his credibility has 
evaporated.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if these remarks constitute the minister's understanding of 
ministerial accountability, no wonder his department is in a mess 
and no wonder he is failing.
<P>
	This minister was the Minister of National Defence when the 
military hierarchy initially tried to whitewash this whole Somalia 
affair. He was the Minister of National Defence when these vital 
documents were tampered with. He was the Minister of National 
Defence when his officials deliberately tried to block inquiries to 
the Somalia inquiry.
<P>
	Whether the minister likes it or not, the buck stops with him. I 
ask him one more time: Does he accept responsibility for any 
wrongdoing that the Somalia inquiry determines took place while 
he was Minister of National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has become 
patently obvious that the hon. leader of the Reform Party has never 
read the terms of reference of the Somalia inquiry. The inquiry is to 
look into cover-up. The inquiry is to look into the destruction of 
documents. The inquiry is to determine if there is wrongdoing. 
That is the forum, a neutral place with three independent observers, 
not a partisan inquisition on the floor of the House of Commons.

<P>
	In 1993, Corporal David Gunther from Quebec died in Bosnia. 
Once again, the department of defence found a way to come up 
with two conflicting stories to explain to his family how he had 
died.
<P>
	In the first statement dated June 18, 1993, DND said Corporal 
Gunther had been killed by fragments from a mortar shell that blew 
up near his vehicle, while a second statement dated the same day 
listed the cause of death as an anti-tank missile that made a direct 
hit on his vehicle.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	On October 24, 1995 at 8.40 a.m., Nancy Fournier, a clerk of 
DND's public affairs branch, was interviewed by the military 
police about her refusal to destroy documents related to the 
Somalia affair. Let me quote: ``She can recall on numerous 
occasions being told to destroy files but specifically recalls a senior 
officer saying to her `had you got rid of this stuff like I told you this 
wouldn't be happening now'''.
<P>
	According to the commission counsel on Monday they said: ``the 
minister and the department did not deem it necessary to go any 
further''. Why not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the hon. 
member and the Reform Party is doing is absolutely reprehensible 
and it is contemptuous-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is contemptuous of the three 
people who are charged with heading this inquiry.
<P>
	Justice Létourneau has set aside two or three weeks on this 
specific case. Everybody concerned, including the chief of defence 
staff, will have an opportunity to make their views known and to 
give their points of view. Then people can judge accordingly.
<P>
	For the hon. member to read selective quotes from certain 
documents into the record, some of which may be germane to that 
investigation, to create a certain impression is absolutely and 
totally unacceptable. I would say it is unparliamentary and it is 
even un-Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister is trying to twist this, as the Liberals do 
so well, and is shirking his responsibility as a minister of the 
crown.
<P>
	Canadians and armed forces personnel are tired of this minister's 
lacklustre performance.
<P>
	I will state again, ``he did not deem it necessary to go further''. 
The minister had to know that senior officials at DND were defying 
the minister's own order of a year ago to turn over documents to the 
Somalia commission.
<P>
	How can the minister continue in his job knowing that the 
officials at DND defied his orders?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member is becoming so incoherent he is choking on his rhetoric. 
By and large I answered that question in the first response.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about morale in the armed forces. Let me 
tell him and his colleagues-I am sure that his colleagues have had 
the same calls-that members of the armed forces and their 
families have been outraged by the conduct of the opposition on 
this matter.
<P>
	It is the opposition that is trying to discredit the armed forces and 
undermine the morale of the armed forces.
<P>
	This matter should be dealt with in a calm and rational manner 
before the inquiry that members in the Reform Party sometimes 
support. They support it one week, they support it another week 
and in between they are not so sure, they want it wound down. They 
have no credibility on this issue whatsoever.

offence at being asked about events that call into question our

<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	When the minister of defence mentions families that, in his 
opinion, are outraged by the opposition's attitude, he should 
perhaps consider the members of Corporal Daniel Gunther's 
family, who were told by the Information Commissioner of Canada 
that documents were missing from the corporal's file and that he 
could not explain why these documents were still missing. This is

questions about UN Ambassador Bob Fowler.
<P>
	However, I remind him there have been clouds over Mr. Fowler 
for over two years. I remind him Mr. Fowler was deputy minister to 
the present defence minister, deputy minister during the Somalia 
affair. He was hustled out of town on December 23, 1994. He is a 
well connected Liberal.
<P>
	Will the minister not agree that the allegations raised by the 
media, by former Prime Minister Kim Campbell and by Colonel 
Geof Haswell constitute a serious cloud of controversy that must be 
dealt with immediately?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me first clarify that I was not feigning indignation; I 
really was upset by the hon. member's remarks.
<P>
	To suggest that being a deputy minister of defence, while it is a 
very difficult job, is somehow the reason why someone should be 
asked to be pulled back from a diplomatic post simply does not 
stand up to much credibility.
<P>
	As we have repeated many times, the reality is there have been 
allegations made. I have not yet had the pleasure of reading Ms. 
Campbell's book. I may never have the pleasure of reading her 
book; in fact, I am almost sure I will not have the pleasure of 
reading her book. However, it is an allegation.
<P>
	As the Minister of National Defence has explained many times, 
we have set up an inquiry to look into all allegations, to ensure that 
all information is given, to make sure all testimony is heard and 
that we will not prejudge any of the results of that inquiry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not talking 
about some clerk here. We are talking about Canada's 
representative to the world at the UN. This guy was around as a 
DND deputy minister for seven years. He is a Liberal friend. It is

question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, why will the minister not do 
the right thing and put Canada's interests higher on his priority list 
than defending a well connected Liberal appointee and recall Mr. 
Fowler until these allegations are cleared up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as is so often the case, the Reform Party tries to intrude its 
own somewhat undercover form of politics in the debate of the 
House.
<P>
	Mr. Fowler is a long time public servant. He has had no 
affiliation with any party as far as I know. He has worked in a 
number of posts with great distinction. He is continuing to play that 
role at the United Nations where he was fundamentally responsible 
in helping put together a Haitian rescue force which has helped the 
island. He has represented us effectively in the reform of the United 
Nations. He is responsible for providing a new budgetary formula 
for the United Nations. He is doing his job well.

<P>
minister tell us what the  government and the RCMP were doing 
during all that time?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to say that we share the member's 
concern about the serious situation Mr. Quan is in. But it is 
incorrect to say that the government did not act on this matter. We 
did take several steps.
<P>
	The Prime Minister took the matter up with the prime minister of 
Vietnam. The former Minister of Foreign Affairs also raised the 
question. I myself discussed the matter with the ambassador.
<P>
	This week, the Minister of Finance, who was in Vietnam, 
expressed our government's concerns to the deputy prime minister 
of Vietnam and asked that Mr. Quan be released. Meanwhile, I 
wrote Mr. Christopher requesting co-operation on the part of 
Vietnamese authorities in sharing information. At that time, We 
spoke with Mr. Morgan's lawyers with a view to getting the 
information and sharing it with the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, around 
noon today, one of the foreign affairs minister's own colleagues 
stated that the government would not act.
<P>
	Now that it has been revealed that CIDA recently granted $7.5 
million in assistance to Vietnam through the good offices of 
lobbyist Marc Lalonde, does this not prove that trade relations 
clearly take precedence over human rights in the eyes of the 
Government of Canada, even when the rights in question are those 
of a Canadian citizen?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the position of the Canadian government has been to 
ensure that the assistance it gives goes to help the people of 
Vietnam in their development.

<P>
	I do not think the hon. member or the members of the Bloc

serious war situation and who are trying to rebuild their country.
<P>

others have been trying to perpetrate that action has not been taken 
on behalf of Mr. Quan. There has been a wide variety of 
representations. We have been working with Vietnamese 
authorities and American authorities to get the information.

within prison are demanded. We made the representations as

agreements, as seen in the Nisga'a agreement in principle. The 
overwhelming majority of British Columbians object to a racially 
based, separate commercial fishery. The native only fishery is not 
supported by either the Constitution or the decision of Canada's 
courts.
<P>

downsize by 50 per cent? Will he abandon this bizarre policy of 
two commercial fisheries in British Columbia separated by race?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>

really took place.
<P>
	In the consideration of the Nisga'a agreement in co-operation 
with all the partners in the resolution of an issue ongoing for 100 
years, it was agreed the food fishery would stay in the Nisga'a 
agreement in principle and that the commercial harvest for the 
Nisga'a nations would give the Nisga'a less than they would have 
if they had ratcheted it up in succeeding years. It was put in the 
agreement in principle not specifically as commercial fishing but 
to be included in a harvest agreement to be looked at specifically.

<P>
	The hon. member and members from both sides of the House 
will want to encourage small businesses in their areas to connect to 
the Strategis web site which is the largest business information web 
site on the Internet. It is where they can find everything from 
33,000 licensable technologies to 50,000 company profiles, 
companies they can trade with, suppliers, partners, joint ventures, 
and sources of trade opportunities elsewhere in the world.
<P>
	The hon. members in the Reform Party are concerned about 
time. This is a real time saver for small business.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	It was brought to my attention a couple of weeks ago that the 
Minister of Industry contacted the MP from an abutting riding in 
my area and asked him to submit a list of names for the census 
taking. When I called the minister's office and questioned this, he 
stated: ``Send your names in. Send them to Halifax. You do not 
send them to my office''.
<P>
	There are two lists, <I>a</I> and <I>b</I>. I was told my list could not be used 
until list <I>a</I> was used up at the minister's office.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Industry justify such a political 
patronage system when he and his government ran on jobs, jobs, 
jobs for all Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad I did not leave at three o'clock.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that it was the Mulroney government 
in 1984 that ran on jobs, jobs, jobs and it only got two of them in 
the last election. Had the member been in the House in the weeks 
before the Easter break she would have heard my assurance that if 
she had names which she wished to submit to Statistics Canada for 
census representatives, we would ensure they were submitted.
<P>
	If she has some problem with that she should certainly follow it 
up with me. I will be glad to investigate this because I did give her 
that assurance.

	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-15, an act to amend, enact and repeal certain 
laws relating to financial institutions be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-15 at 
third and final reading in the House. This is the sort of workaday 
legislation that may lack drama but remains vitally important to 
Canada because it will enhance the safety and soundness of the 
country's world class financial system.
<P>
	May I begin by reminding hon. colleagues that this legislation is 
the product of extensive consultation. I would like to take this 
opportunity to again extend the government's thanks to the many 
industry participants and other stakeholders that provided such 
constructive and insightful advice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to thank the Standing Committee on Finance 
for having decided to hold hearings on the bill during the summer 
recess. The comments gathered by the committee constituted 
invaluable preliminary work prior to the clause by clause study of 
this major piece of legislation. We can rest assured that the bill we 
are going to pass will serve the best interests of consumers, 
financial institutions, our constituents, and the Canadian economy 
as a whole.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is no question that sound, secure financial institutions are 
a fundamental requirement for national well-being. As I said at the 
start, Canada is blessed with a world class system. The financial 
sector is very much a part of a world of dynamic and dramatic 
accelerating change driven by new technology, globalization and 
new customer demands. All these factors culminate in  heightened 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1595"> 1595 </A></B>
<P>
competition. That is why we are moving ahead with the measures 
contained in Bill C-15.
<P>
	This legislation is timely not because the system suffers from 
any critical weakness. It does not. But to make sure we maintain a 
dynamic, competitive financial sector and regulatory system we 
must respond to market trends and recent experiences without 
unnecessary delay. Bill C-15 will do this.
<P>
	Let me emphasize that these are not patchwork, band-aid 
measures. They flow from a series of basic principles outlined in 
the white paper the government issued over a year ago. These 
principles include the following: first, that ownership of financial 
institutions is a privilege, not a right. Second, early intervention in 
and resolution of institutions experiencing difficulty should occur. 
Third, that financial institutions must operate with sufficient 
incentives to solve their problems in a timely manner. Fourth, there 
must be appropriate transparency and accountability in the system.
<P>
	We have discussed the details of this legislation at some length 
in committee and the House. Today I simply want to remind us all 
of some of the more important changes that the House should 
approve.
<P>
	First, the bill establishes an enhanced system of early 
intervention on behalf of troubled institutions. The legislation will 
allow the office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions to 
take control of a troubled institution earlier than at present. It also 
provides greater transparency in the supervisory process by 
establishing guides to supervisory intervention. The intent here is 
clear, concrete and constructive.
<P>
	Early resolution of an institution's difficulties is the best way to 
prevent substantial losses to depositors, policyholders or creditors 
and potentially to shareholders.
<P>
	This legislation states clearly that if an institution is facing 
difficulties, owners do not have the right to continue in business 
until they hit the brick wall and cannot pay liabilities as they come 
due. Institutions will now understand that OSFI will take action if 
its concerns are not dealt with promptly. That is a major 
improvement.
<P>
	This is not a punitive step. By increasing OSFI's scope for early 
intervention, the legislation provides a new incentive for managers 
and directors of troubled institutions to undertake early problem 
solving for themselves.
<P>
	The second element I would highlight in Bill C-15 is the 
expanded role for the superintendent in the governance of troubled 
financial institutions. In this case, the superintendent will have the 
power to designate certain directors as affiliated and also veto the 
appointment of directors and senior officers in troubled financial 
institutions.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	These additional powers reflect our appreciation of the 
importance of effective, independent corporate governance. They 
also stress that it is the boards of directors that represent the 
ultimate frontline for problem resolution and good management.
<P>
	Before concluding I should address a criticism of the legislation 
levied by the official opposition related to jurisdictional issues.
<P>
	The clear and certain benefits of this bill notwithstanding, the 
official opposition has chosen so far not to support its passage. The 
main criticism relates to the claim that the powers proposed for the 
Bank of Canada, to mitigate systemic risk in clearing and 
settlement systems, infringe on provincial powers over regulating 
security matters. This is not the case.
<P>
	The opposition's problem and misunderstanding of the goal of 
this legislation begins with its failure to understand the nature of 
systemic risk itself. This is the risk that one institution's inability to 
settle a large value transaction could have a domino effect among 
other participants.
<P>
	In the proposed legislation the government is acting to provide a 
formal oversight role for the Bank of Canada and to enhance its 
powers to require appropriate risk control in payment, clearing and 
settlement systems.
<P>
	The bill provides the Governor of the Bank of Canada with the 
powers necessary to control systemic risk. This can be achieved by 
issuing directives to clearing houses, or where necessary, 
participants in a clearing house, requiring them to cease a 
particular course of conduct that results in systemic risk being 
inadequately controlled.
<P>
	I want to emphasis that dealing with systemic risk issues is 
traditionally a matter for central banks, not just in Canada, but in 
other developed countries. If there is ever a day when the failure of 
a large financial institution at home or abroad threatens the stability 
of the financial system, it will be the central banks of industrialized 
countries, including the Bank of Canada, that will be called on to 
deal with the fallout.
<P>
	I also want to note that in committee the government moved 
amendments to further clarify that the powers of the Bank of 
Canada with respect to systemic risk do not infringe on traditional 
areas of concern to provincial regulators about the health of 
individual securities firms.
<P>
	Specifically, the bill now provides greater certainty that the 
governor may not issue directives in respect of matters directly 
related to the participation of securities firms or other individual 
participants in the clearing and settlement system. This includes 
the corporate governance of the participant, its relations with its 
customers, capital adequacy or the management of its investments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1596"> 1596 </A></B>
<P>
	We fully understand that these aspects of business fall under 
the purview of the principal regulator of the institution such as 
the provincial securities commissions. We have made it clear that 
these are not matters for the central bank. For these reasons I reject 
the notion that this legislation infringes on provincial jurisdiction. 
It does not.
<P>
	In closing, I want to say that Canadians have come to expect a 
sound and stable financial system. This is one of our most enduring 
and sustaining economic strengths. That is why we must ensure 
that we sustain and evolve the appropriate mechanisms needed to 
manage and minimize risks. Bill C-15 honours that obligation with 
positive, forward looking measures.
<P>
	I have no hesitation in calling on my colleagues to pass this 
important legislation. I hope that all members of the House will 
join with the members on this side of the House in doing so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today at third reading to speak to Bill 
C-15, an act which concerns several acts regarding financial 
institutions and the banking sector.
<P>
	This bill concerns the Bank Act, the Trust and Loan Companies 
Act, the Insurance Companies Act, the Cooperative Credit 
Association Act, the Winding-up and Restructuring Act, the Office 
of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act, the Canada 
Deposit Insurance Corporations Act, the Canadian Payments 
Association Act, and the Canadian Investment Companies Act.
<P>
	This is a wide-ranging piece of legislation. This is a preview of 
the major changes the Liberal government is getting ready to make 
to the Bank Act before March 31, 1997.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	It is also, first and foremost, a bill that gave us a general idea, as 
early as June, as my colleague from the finance committee already 
said, so that when we began the clause by clause study of the bill in 
August, we had some indication as to the government's intentions. 
And these indications were confirmed, a few weeks ago, when the 
government made its intentions known in the throne speech and the 
budget speech.
<P>
	With this bill, the government is intruding, roughly and 
high-handedly, in an area which comes exclusively under the 
jurisdiction of Quebec, Ontario, and all other provincial 
governments. The area I am talking about is that of securities.
<P>
	With the single clause extending the regulatory mechanisms to 
the securities sector and implementing a Canadian clearing system 
controlled by the Bank of Canada, the government is betraying the 
1982 Constitution. Not only did the government patriate the 
Constitution against Quebec's will, but now it does not  even abide 
by the provisions of that Constitution any more.
<P>
	Quebec's jurisdiction over securities is based on section 92(13) 
of the Constitution Act, 1982, which grants provinces jurisdiction 
over property and civil law. What complements these provisions? It 
is the case law of the Supreme Court of Canada, which has attached 
the securities market to this initial area of jurisdiction, through the 
provinces.
<P>
	So, when we look at what is presented to us, when we look at the 
clearly defined intentions set out a few weeks ago in the throne 
speech and in the budget speech regarding the total and complete 
intrusion of the federal government in the securities sector, we can 
only confirm our opposition to this provision of the bill.
<P>
	It is not that the bill's objectives are bad. The bill is aimed at, 
among other things, reducing what are known as systemic risks in 
the Canadian financial system, to avoid the so-called domino effect 
in the financial sector that would occur, for instance, when one 
institution is unable to meet its commitments towards another 
institution. There would be a domino effect on the financial sector 
as a whole. Everyone, sovereignists as well as federalists, 
Quebecers as well as Ontarians, people from the maritimes or from 
western Canada, agree on that: we must put in place a system that is 
efficient and that reduces the likelihood of a financial crisis and of 
systemic risks in the financial sector.
<P>
	But we must totally reject the means taken by the government. 
When the government, under the pretext of reducing systemic risk, 
creates new and costly overlap for taxpayers as a whole-new 
overlap that Quebecers as well as Canadians will have to pay 
for-because it intrudes in a sector that is already very well served 
by provincial institutions, there is a problem.
<P>
	The Commission des valeurs mobilières du Québec and the 
Ontario Securities Commission are completely disregarded and, 
through this bill, the federal government is allowed to interfere 
more and more in this area under the provisions of a bill enabling 
the Governor of the Bank of Canada to seriously interfere in this 
area. At the same time, there is talk of creating a Canadian 
securities commission, as mentioned in the speech from the throne 
but not in the bill. This will not do.
<P>
	How can you justify having provincial and federal institutions 
that overlap like that? How do you expect to give a clear signal to 
the financial community?
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Which policy directives should financial institutions in Quebec 
and Canada follow? Those coming from a federal entity, as set out 
in Bill C-15, or those coming from organizations and institutions 
already well-established in the securities industry, such as the 
securities commission, the Quebec inspecteur général des institu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1597"> 1597 </A></B>
<P>
tions financières, the Quebec government or even the Montreal 
stock exchange?
<P>
	How do you hope to create stability in this area when, by 
interfering this way, although such interference is allowed under 
Bill C-15, you are sending out potentially conflicting signals to the 
same institutions? That does not make sense.
<P>
	What justifies the federal government in telling the Government 
of Quebec and the Government of Ontario: ``We have decided to 
cast aside the institutions you are involved in, even though you 
have successfully controlled the securities industry for many years. 
In the future, we will be in charge''. The federal government has no 
expertise in the area of securities since, under the very terms of the 
Constitution Act of 1982, this is an area that falls under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	The second aspect of Bill C-15 that we cannot support has to do 
with using this bill to amend the prerogatives of the Superintendent 
of Financial Institutions and the Winding-up Act. Bill C-15 gives 
more powers to the Canadian Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions, who, in the future, will be able to interfere directly in 
the business of provincially chartered institutions.
<P>
	Such an extension of the prerogatives of the federal 
superintendent of financial institutions will result once again in 
costly duplication and inefficiencies in the system. On the one 
hand, according to the legislation and the remarks made by the 
minister and the parliamentary secretary, they want to introduce 
efficiency and reduce duplication, but on the other hand, they 
create duplication and inefficiencies with such a provision. Why? 
Because, once again, the Quebec inspector general of financial 
institutions as well as his Ontario counterpart are doing exactly the 
same work and have exactly the same responsibilities as the ones 
the government wants to give to the superintendent of financial 
institutions of Canada.
<P>
	Why this duplication? Why create new structures when we 
should instead eliminate duplicating structures? When we ask the 
government to study and review duplication and overlap, we are 
not asking it to create some more but to eliminate what there is. 
Yet, with this legislation, it is creating more, with all the resulting 
additional costs to taxpayers and all the resulting problems in terms 
of signals on the securities market.
<P>
	I believe Bill C-15, through this provision as well as the first 
one, will inevitably create instability and uncertainty on the 
financial markets. Contrary to what the government representatives 
say, I do not believe that stakeholders in the securities industry all 
across Canada generally want the federal government to get 
involved in that area, that they want it to set up a securities control 
commission or that they want that the federal superintendent of 
financial institutions to push aside the provincial officials working 
in this area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction in favour of federal 
authorities.
<P>
	That is not the message I am getting from the financial sector, 
and more particularly from Quebecers and some Canadians in these 
institutions.
<P>
	In the last fifteen years, I would say, provincial participantsin the securities sector have developed a great deal of expertiseand knowledge in this field. But most importantly, they have 
introduced a harmonizing mechanism in order to reduce systemic 
risks, and bring about efficiency gains in the securities sector. With 
the new SEDAR system, they will soon be able to reduce from 
eight or ten to only one the number of prospectuses required. That 
will make for a better allocation of funds available on this market, 
and a better use of financial resources on the securities market.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	So why has the federal government chosen this time to introduce 
such a piece of legislation? Under the pretext of reducing the 
systemic risks that have already been reduced thanks to measures 
taken 10 or 15 years ago in this area, the federal government does 
not hesitate a minute to say: ``From now on, I will oversee the 
securities industry and ensure that resource allocation is efficient''. 
That is unacceptable.
<P>
	You either believe in a constitution, as the Liberals tell us, or you 
do not. You either believe in the stability of our financial industry 
or you do not. You either believe in a better allocation of all the 
risks involved, and especially of systemic risks, or you do not care 
at all. And that is the impression we get from the actions of the 
current government.
<P>
	When the only thing you do is increase the tension, the insecurity 
and the instability on the market, instead of reducing them, you 
either do not understand what is going on, and that shows how 
incompetent you are, or you want more powers or more visibility 
for the federal government. You are ready to give up efficiency in 
order to be more visible and that is not good. That is not what you 
need to do if you want to be up to the challenges awaiting you in the 
securities industry and the financial sector during the nineties and 
the year 2000.
<P>
	The third reason why we cannot support Bill C-15 introduced by 
the government concerns the amendments to the Canada Deposit 
Insurance Corporation Act. Bill C-15 proposes to change the 
current deposit insurance system. Right now, financial institutions 
pay deposit insurance premiums based on the volume of deposits, 
but under Bill C-15, premiums will be based on the risk that a 
financial institution represents.
<P>
	Since first seeing the provisions of Bill C-100, which is now Bill 
C-15, last June, we have been questioning the secretary of state 
responsible and the finance minister who, ultimately, is also 
responsible for this legislation, about the impact of this new 
provision. Up until now, that is almost nine months after the first 
bill was introduced, our questions have yet to be answered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1598"> 1598 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, we do not know what criteria will be used to 
assess the risk that a financial institution represents. These criteria 
will be defined in the forthcoming regulations, and the government 
refuses to make these regulations public. One can wonder if these 
criteria will respect the specific character of Quebec's financial 
institutions. We have questioned the secretary of state responsible 
and the finance minister many times on this subject, but we still 
have no answer. We have no answer either to a question such as 
what impact will a federal risk assessment as proposed in Bill 
C-15 have on the financial community and how will this risk 
assessment be interpreted by the financial markets.
<P>
	On the one hand, there is talk of interference, inefficiency, waste, 
duplication, overlap, all costly to Canadian taxpayers, and on the 
other hand, when a clause is unclear and we ask for clarifications, 
we get no reply. What kind of government are we dealing with 
here?
<P>
	In short, this bill is another illustration, first and foremost, of the 
centralist dynamic inherent in the constitutional status quo. Bill 
C-15, particularly in its creation of Canada-wide clearing and 
settlement systems, encroaches on areas already covered by the 
Commission québécoise des valeurs mobilières and the Inspecteur 
général des institutions financières du Québec. This leads not only 
to an overlap that is costly to the taxpayer, but also to 
administrative inefficiencies, because financial institutions in 
Quebec, as in Ontario and the other provinces, will be subject to 
dual controls.
<P>
	Second, Bill C-15 constitutes unacceptable interference in the 
securities area. The various governments of Quebec have always 
vigorously defended the prerogatives of Quebec concerning 
securities.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	If I may, I would like to quote from a letter dated February 16, 
1994, and addressed to the then President of Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Minister 
responsible for Public Service Renewal by former Quebec premier 
Daniel Johnson. Its subject is securities, for even that long ago the 
federal government had indicated its great interest in securities.
<P>
	The letter starts as follows: ``Mr. Minister, as I indicated in my 
letter of February 15 on the entire process of improving the 
efficiency of the Canadian federation, this letter more specifically 
concerns your proposal regarding the regulation of securities''.
<P>
	Mr. Johnson goes on to say: ``Allow me first to remind you that 
the Quebec government never advocated-never advocated-an 
increased federal role in the securities sector, which is a matter of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. On the contrary, it has 
consistently expressed its opposition to federal initiatives in this 
regard''.
<P>
	These are not the words of the current premier of Quebec, of 
either Mr. Bouchard or Mr. Parizeau. They are the words of Daniel 
Johnson, written from one federalist to another.
<P>
	He goes on: ``In her five-year report to the National Assembly 
last December, the Quebec Minister of Finance, reiterated the 
concerns about the federal regulation of securities that would result 
from this legislation expressed by a number of other provinces at 
the time of the recent reform of federal legislation on financial 
institutions. She said-and we are talking about a current federal 
minister-that federal regulation would be inappropriate in 
constitutional terms and from the standpoint of efficiency. It would 
lead to duplication of rules of supervision and inevitably to a 
heavier administrative and financial burden for issuers, investors 
and intermediaries''. End of the letter from Daniel Johnson to the 
current President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada.
<P>
	When you are reduced to quoting letters from federalists- It 
seems to me that the analysis presented by a federalist to another 
federalist should be understood. It seems just an excuse to say: 
``We know, you are a sovereignist. You want Quebec to be 
sovereign. You refuse all interference. You fight against all 
interference''. Yes, it is our job to do so, and I think Quebecers are 
proud of that. But when one comes out with implacable arguments, 
the same as those used by great federalists such as Daniel Johnson, 
it seems to me that somehow the Liberal government should realize 
that there is a certain consensus in Quebec. Moreover, I think they 
are starting to get the picture as far as the homeland and the 
linguistic community are concerned. They should also understand 
that there is also a strong consensus to jealously protect Quebec's 
prerogatives concerning securities.
<P>
	I also think that it should be easy to understand, when the 
president of the Montreal exchange himself tells us he does not 
agree either with the idea of federal interference in securities. As 
well, when we questioned the Minister of Finance, after the speech 
from the throne, and all the more so after the budget speech, in 
which he mentioned the federal government's intention, now 
openly admitted, to interfere in matters of securities, he told us the 
Quebec business community, major stakeholders in Quebec were 
unanimous on the need for federal interference in the securities 
market. After hearing several stakeholders, and the Montreal 
exchange's president for one, we have to conclude that the Minister 
of Finance has no idea what he is saying in this regard.
<P>
	Let me quote Mr. Lacoste, the Montreal exchange's president, 
when he appeared, on February 20, before the Senate Standing 
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1599"> 1599 </A></B>
<P>
	Concerning a better harmonization among provinces and greater 
efficiency in the stock exchange, Mr. Lacoste said, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Yes, there must be better co-ordination, but better 
co-ordination must still allow for regional disparities. I always use 
the example that if we had a national or a single commission in 
Canada in the 1980s, there would not have been a QSSP type of 
program. There would not have been labour sponsored funds in 
Quebec. Now they exist, so there is a need to preserve that. 
However, I agree there must be better co-ordination''.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Clearly, with such significant arguments, Mr. Lacoste, the 
president of the Montreal exchange, has just told the federal 
government in polite but firm terms to stay home. He has just told 
the federal government to mind its own business, not to interfere 
with the securities business.
<P>
	I believe that when the president of the Montreal exchange says 
such a thing, adding that if it were not for the fact that the 1982 
Constitution gave the Quebec government exclusive jurisdiction 
with regard to securities, we would not have had workers' funds 
such as the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs et travailleuses de la 
FTQ, because there would have been a coast to coast policy, and 
major lobbies and decisions would have been increasingly 
concentrated in the Toronto area, he is contradicting in a big way 
what the finance minister has been saying so far.
<P>
	There is definitely no consensus in Quebec to the effect that the 
federal government must interfere in this area. Indeed, there is a 
consensus in Quebec that the federal government should stay where 
it is, deal with its own affairs, and not create costly inefficiencies, 
overlaps and duplications for the taxpayers of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	This being said, and considering that the government did not 
respond in any way to our expectations, since it refused to accept 
any of the amendments we proposed, to avoid three of the negative 
aspects of the bill, I have to ask my colleagues from the official 
opposition to vote against this bill. We will do so with energy and 
conviction, and then start working against it, given that the federal 
government has firmly decided, first in June last year and then with 
the speech from the throne and the budget provisions, to interfere 
in a very cavalier and cynical way in the area of securities.
<P>
	I am convinced that, over the next few weeks, the main 
stakeholders in Quebec, just like the official opposition, will 
oppose vigorously this interference by the federal government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-15, 
an act to amend, enact and repeal certain laws relating to financial 
institutions, is a continuation of the old Bill C-100 before 
Parliament prorogued. The government is bringing it back 
substantially in the same form as Bill C-100. That is why we are at 
third reading now.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to make many amendments and 
changes to financial institutions and to do a lot of fine tuning. This 
act is a result of a review of the safety of financial institutions.
<P>
	It comes about as a response to the failures of a number of 
financial institutions and is essentially the government's response 
to concerns regarding these same institutions. The bill is also a 
prelude to the Bank Act review due in 1997. That review promises 
to be much wider in scope.
<P>
	I will go through some highlights, some objections and some 
deeper facts on some of the aspects of the bill. It is very 
complicated and complex. It covers a lot of areas. I will not touch 
on all of them, but I will try to hit on some of the points I feel the 
Canadian public should be aware of. I will also try to enlighten 
people interested in this debate.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	The bill rejects deposit co-insurance, and we do not know why. 
Since the introduction in 1967 of 100 per cent deposit insurance up 
to a maximum dollar value which is currently $60,000, 30 financial 
institutions have failed, with 20 failures in the last 10 years. This 
has cost the CDIC, the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
about $5 billion as of March 1994.
<P>
	Interestingly, in the period proceeding 1967 there were no bank 
failures. Governments over the years have exhibited reluctance to 
institute market based measures of reform such as co-insurance, 
instead opting for more regulation and oversight. The use of the 
market through the implementation of co-insurance and market 
based criteria as early warning signals would alleviate the 
problems in the financial system in a less costly yet more effective 
manner than proposing further regulatory change.
<P>
	Regulatory attempts to mimic the efficient results achievable 
only by the free market will always be more costly for all parties 
involved and will rarely if ever achieve the same quality of results.
<P>
	Under the proposed system depositors are only encouraged to 
seek out the best rates regardless of the risk profile of the 
institution in question since they know they will be fully 
compensated by the CDIC in the event of a failure. This facilitates 
the entrance, growth and eventual failure of risky and recklessly 
managed institutions. It also discriminates against healthy, strong  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1600"> 1600 </A></B>
<P>
financial sector players who minimize risk by conservative lending 
and borrowing policies.
<P>
	I sure have a tough time making a loan. They are always tough 
on me.
<P>
	The act does set the stage for risk based CDIC premiums. 
However, premium levels for different institutions will not be made 
public. Again this gives the appearance designed to protect weak 
institutions. As mentioned earlier, it also keeps the regulation of 
financial institutions under too large a veil of secrecy. A 
willingness to provide more information to the public would be a 
positive move.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not support the bill because the 
government could have done much more in conjunction with 
financial institutions to make it an open system, an accountable 
system, a system that would work. Then Canadians would know 
what is happening and would have some faith in it.
<P>
	The bill proposes rated premiums for the CDIC and the 
premiums will be according to the risk. As I mentioned, the bad 
thing is that the CDIC intends not to make the Canadian public 
aware of the particular potential risk involved in any particular 
financial institution. This is a veil of secrecy and the taxpayers will 
be left with the bill when large institutions collapse, as we have 
seen in Barings' $1 billion loss and in Alberta's Principal Savings 
and Trust Company.
<P>
	That is why it is important for the government to consider what it 
has unfortunately rejected, co-insurance as a partial solution. By 
perhaps insuring up to only 90 per cent rather than 100 per cent of 
deposits, investors having a 10 per cent stake in what they are 
investing in, a 10 per cent stake in what is going on, would know 
they have a potential exposure.
<P>
	The advantages of this exposure would make the public more 
interested in its money and it would do a little more research on the 
financial institution. The competition and knowledge that this 
would bring out would bring out the best in business among those 
institutions. Just to have a monopoly, big is not necessarily better.
<P>
	Also recent claims, as I have pointed out, have cost. When they 
go into receivership these losses cost the taxpayers money, which 
gives this guarantee by the government and CDIC which is really 
backed by the taxpayers, and the big banks love it.
<P>
	I will continue in this vein and discuss some facts on 
co-insurance basically for future consideration, to lay it on the 
record. There are some strong advantages in considering 
co-insurance.
<P>
	One hundred per cent coverage creates an incentive to place 
funds with high risk institutions. With 100 per cent insurance risky 
institutions can attract deposits by offering slightly higher rates.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	Depositors are willing to use these institutions because they 
know the CDIC safety net up of to $60,000 will be there if anything 
goes wrong. This has enabled risky and uncompetitive institutions 
to enter the marketplace, grow and ultimately fail and distort the 
marketplace.
<P>
	The consumers who bear the cost of deposit insurance. 
Depositors of stable institutions suffer the most. They do not get 
the higher interest rates and yet they still have to pay for the 
damage caused by risky institution failures.
<P>
	Therefore, as recognized in the just published study by the 
Public Interest Advocacy Centre, the irony is that it is the very 
group that co-insurance is intended to benefit, the average 
consumer, that subsidizes the risky activities of the more 
sophisticated who know how to take advantage of the inefficiencies 
embedded in the system as a result of 100 per cent deposit 
insurance.
<P>
	There is almost universal consensus and support for 
co-insurance. Talk about having committee meetings, listening to 
witnesses and acting in conjunction with what you hear, despite 
diverse interests from the banks, the insurance industry, both 
present and past superintendents, the chairman of the CDIC, the 
Canadian Institute of Actuaries, academics including most recently 
PIAC which studied the issue from the consumers point of view, 
and the Senate banking committee, all supporting co-insurance, 
this bill and these changes do not include it.
<P>
	Consumers can judge risk. Consumers do not use the vast 
amounts of disclosed information because without co-insurance 
there is no incentive to do so. Why worry? Why bother? Why read? 
Why care? Just put in your money, it is guaranteed anyway. Look 
for the best advertisement, the highest rate of return and away you 
go.
<P>
	The extremely high percentage of insurance deposits in failed 
institutions illustrates that consumers are making accurate 
judgments. For example, a recent failed institution, Income Trust, 
had 99 per cent of deposits insured versus the 50 per cent industry 
average.
<P>
	Countries such as the United Kingdom and Ireland have forms of 
co-insurance with no evidence of widespread demand for 100 per 
cent coverage.
<P>
	The secretary of state argued on August 15, when this bill was 
still Bill C-100: ``The measures included in Bill C-100 flow from a 
series of basic principles as outlined in the white paper issued last 
February. Our subsequent consultations have left me more 
convinced than ever that these principles and the fundamental shift 
in the philosophy that some of them represent make this legislation 
a vital and valid turning point in our approach to regulation''.
<P>
	The secretary of state went on to point out there are are four key 
principles underlined in this bill: ownership  of financial 
institutions is a privilege, not a right; early intervention in and 
resolution 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1601"> 1601 </A></B>
<P>
of institutions experiencing difficulty should occur; financial 
institutions must operate with sufficient incentives to solve their 
problems in a timely manner; there must be appropriate 
accountability and transparency in the system.
<P>
	Those are tremendous underlying key principles. How could one 
in the financial sector argue with those principles? I support 
satisfying those principles, but this bill falls far short of the 
accountability and transparency in the system. It is still veiled in 
secrecy and by not considering co-insurance it denies the consumer 
the opportunity to make some rational judgments for himself.
<P>
	There has to be a greater review. Financial institutions of all 
types, the four pillars, must come under a serious review, not 
separately but collectively. We must do a massive evaluation. It is 
time to stop and take a good look at the financial sector.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Okanagan Centre, who is the 
Reform Party's industry critic, wrote this brief paper. I would like 
to read it into the record to give him credit for it because if we truly 
wish to satisfy the four principles which the secretary of state has 
stated in terms of evaluating financial institutions, then I feel that 
my colleague's recommendations are worthy of consideration.
<P>
	The paper states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Finance Minister Paul Martin surprised many in his 1996 budget speech by 
assuring Canadians that banks would not be allowed to sell insurance through 
their branch networks this year. This softball so deftly tossed our way neither 
eased our concerns nor addressed the issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The real issue is not whether the banks should be allowed to sell insurance or 
enter into the car leasing business, but whether true competition exists within 
the financial sector and, thus, whether the consumer and the economy will 
benefit if banks are allowed to enter other markets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The banks assure us that their own industry is competitive and not the 
oligopoly that Canadians suspect. This is difficult to believe when the six largest 
banks in Canada move en masse to raise or lower interest rates every time the 
bank rate so much as twitches. The only competition in this case is who will 
move first.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Yet none of them have moved very quickly to change interest 
rates down on the personal credit cards that everybody has through 
Visa and MasterCard, et cetera. One would think someone would 
drop the rate to get more business.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The four pillars of the financial sector, banking, insurance, trust companies and 
security dealers, have crumbled as deregulation and technological progress has 
blurred the lines of distinction. The banks have been applying pressure ever since 
to sell insurance in their branch networks, enter into auto leasing and increase their 
interest in the securities market. Further  deregulation and the subsequent increase 
in the size of banks, however, could reduce competition in the financial sector and 
hurt consumers. These are perennial issues in the Parliament of Canada, 
particularly when a review of the Bank Act is scheduled. Major reviews are 
conducted every ten years, interspersed with minor reviews every five years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1997 brings a minor review, but it is a major review that is required. We need 
to know a good many things. How do our financial institutions interact? How do 
they operate in relation to other sectors of the economy? What are the strengths 
and weaknesses of the current regulatory structure? Not only will the answers 
reveal whether or not true competition exists within the banking sector and, 
thus, whether or not they should be allowed to expand into other financial 
services, the answers will determine the veritable strength of our financial 
sector as it heads into the 21st century. Until such a review is completed, a 
moratorium should be placed on making any further decisions about financial 
institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Furthermore, Parliament must be the venue, perhaps in the form of a joint 
committee of the finance and industry committees. It is the only way we can 
assure that all interests will be recognized and the process will be both 
accessible and transparent. Canadians must be able to see the process in order to 
put their faith in it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As lobbyists from all sides pressure members of Parliament to take sides and 
others try to frame the issue within the overtly political constraints of a war 
between big and small business, the challenge will be to keep our eye on the ball. 
That is, to ensure true competition exists and is free to function within the 
marketplace, that stability is maintained in the respective financial sectors and a 
prudent regulatory structure is in place to protect the consumer. If the bottom 
line is met, Canadians and the economy will indeed emerge as the winners.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Before I conclude, I have one thing to say about financial 
institutions and, more specifically, the banks.
<P>
	There is concern among a lot of people, especially people who 
are left wing political animals, who feel that the banking 
institutions are taking advantage of them. I have some good things 
to say about big banks and some criticisms as well. Since we are 
dealing with financial institutions, I would like to take the 
opportunity to touch on two points.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	A lot of people are criticizing the banks for not paying their fair 
share or they are saying they should be embarrassed by their huge 
profits. I know that the banks, although some may make a billion 
dollars in profits, also pay a billion dollars in taxes. Profit is not a 
dirty word. Profit means jobs. Losses mean lack of jobs. Losses 
means subsidies; grants from governments; subsidization by 
taxpayers; losses mean rewarding failure.
<P>
	Let us reward and encourage profit and stop criticizing 
companies that make a profit. That is no business of the politicians. 
It is the business of businesses. Businesses should be encouraged to 
grow, prosper and expand the economy. They should be given 
compliments when they do so and government should stay off their 
backs and out of their pockets so that they can create jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1602"> 1602 </A></B>
<P>
	How many pages does this bill contain? All these regulations 
have to be read and interpreted by somebody. This is a cost. It is an 
expense to business. This is not an inducement to improve business 
or hire more people and increase employment. We need fewer 
regulations. Good regulations, yes, but fewer. We need to get the 
government out of the business of being in business.
<P>
	There are many financial institutions. I am looking for a 
document that lists the number of institutions and their assets. I 
was shocked to see how much these institutions control. But it 
looks like I will not be able to find it at the moment so I will not be 
able to quote from it.
<P>
	One criticism I have of the banks is that they are quick to fiddle 
with certain prime rates but have not looked at the rates of interest 
on consumer loans or credit cards. I feel that sometimes they 
encourage indebtedness by sending letters to university students 
giving instant credit of $1,000. I know that happened to my 
daughter when she graduated a couple of years ago. A bank sent her 
a credit card and guess what? Within 30 days she was in debt to the 
tune of $1,000. I do not feel that is a practice I would like to see. As 
a parent I know I did not like it but it is done. There is nothing 
illegal about it, but I feel that some people get themselves into 
financial difficulties when that happens.
<P>
	The problem with government tinkering with regulations and 
trying to establish a level playing field among the four pillars of 
financial institutions is that it keeps attempting to amend the 
definition of a bank. In the Bank Act the definition of a bank is 
something like ``a bank is what a bank does in Canada''. 
Governments keep changing what a bank does. Therefore, other 
financial institutions have a hard time competing because they are 
at a disadvantage.
<P>
	The thorough and proper review which is scheduled for 1997 
should lead to some positive results. I sincerely believe that once 
again this is an example of a Liberal government which uses all the 
right words even when it describes the budget. It has the rhetoric 
down, but the reality and what it is doing does not match the words. 
The words are greater than the actions it takes.
<P>
	As I have pointed out, the four key principles which the secretary 
of state believes he is accomplishing with these new regulations for 
financial institutions is honourable. But he is ignoring completely 
and avoiding the issue of co-insurance which would clean up a lot 
of the failures in these institutions and introduce responsibility to 
investors. It has so many advantages. With so much support from 
all the institutions and groups, at the very least this could have been 
done. I believe we introduced it either in the standing committee or 
in the House at an earlier stage as an amendment which was 
defeated. I know we talked about it as a party.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	This measure would eliminate the burden on taxpayers. It would 
reduce the risk for high risk institutions. We must have high risk 
investments. We must have somebody to take them. We must 
encourage them. The best person to take that risk is a person who 
can afford to take the risk. We should not be putting all the 
taxpayers' money at risk.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This concludes the first 
round of 40-minute speeches. We now enter the next stage of 
debate which has 20-minute speeches subject to 10 minutes of 
questions or comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-15 
amending and enacting certain laws relating to financial 
institutions is, in our estimation, a new attempt by the federal 
government to control the provinces, and especially Quebec, 
which, for the last 30 years, has developed several original tools of 
economic and financial development.
<P>
	On the economic and financial side, the federal government's 
control is increasing daily. On the constitutional side, the Quebec 
wing of the Liberal Party of Canada proposed last weekend that 
Quebec now be recognized as ``the principal homeland of French 
language, culture and legal tradition in North America''.
<P>
	The distinct society concept, which was part of the political 
landscape since the Meech Lake accord and was the subject matter 
of a motion in this House last December, and which the 
government seemed to want to enshrine in the Constitution, is 
suddenly put off indefinitely following some prevarication by 
certain premiers.
<P>
	After the second world war, women were sent back home. Some 
right wing groups still regularly send women back home. 
Optometrists will often tell us whether bifocals will improve our 
sight. But what does this vague concept of homeland have to do 
with the constitutional issue and the recognition of a people?
<P>
	Today, no longer sure about what to do with it, the federal 
Liberals are sending the Quebec issue back home. Even the leader 
of the official opposition in Quebec City tells us this has no legal 
meaning; it is like saying that Newfoundland is an island and that 
the Rocky Mountains are in the west. There are no intellectual 
giants in this government.
<P>
	This whole farce of a principal homeland in America shows once 
again the true face of the federal Liberals and how little they know 
and understand modern Quebec. Less than six months after the 
Quebec referendum, the Prime Minister is once again going back 
on his word.
<P>
	What are we discussing these days in the House? Homeland 
rather than distinct society, the importation of cheese made from 
raw milk, our soldiers' lack of  discipline, the Somalia affair, the 
lightning search for missing documents ordered by the defence 
minister. Once again, our play soldiers, who still cost Canadian 
taxpayers $11 billion a year, are once again making fools of 
themselves. It is a good thing that ridicule does not kill. Is this why 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1603"> 1603 </A></B>
<P>
Canada still has armed forces, to protect the country from ridicule? 
If so, they are not doing a very good job.
<P>
	After nearly three years in power, the Liberal government has 
gone back on its promises to Quebec. They are making fools of 
themselves in the rest of Canada, in terms of both imports and 
defence matters. The Prime Minister has lost control of the 
situation. There is no leadership left in this government. Worse, 
there is no vision as to the future of this country.
<P>
	This government, which is unable to renew the Canadian 
Constitution, to manage its armed forces in a modern and 
professional manner, to set credible import policies in a 
globalization context, is putting forward Bill C-15, which shows its 
inability to manage the federation at the economic and financial 
levels.

	This bill contains a number of scattered, apparently unrelated 
measures whose only purpose is to strengthen the monitoring and 
regulation of financial services in Canada. Once again, the federal 
government is trying to take control, to increase its powers.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to the principle itself of Bill 
C-15, but rather to some of the proposed measures, which encroach 
on major areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The most important measure in this bill would extend the Bank 
of Canada's payment settlement mechanism to the area of 
securities.
<P>
	In fact, this initiative duplicates the clearing systems already 
regulated by the Quebec securities commission and allows the 
federal government to interfere in the regulation of securities, 
which is an exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Under this bill, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation will 
be setting the participation premiums according to the risk a 
financial institution represents. This includes Quebec chartered 
institutions already regulated by the Régie de l'assurance-dépôts 
du Québec, where the deposit volume is the criterion. Thus, there 
will be two standards of evaluation, and the one based on risk could 
put Quebec institutions at a disadvantage.
<P>
	The powers of the superintendent of financial institutions will be 
increased so that he may request the winding-up of Quebec 
chartered institutions. This duplication of services could lead to 
numerous disputes between the different bodies.
<P>
	As we mentioned during the debate at second reading, this bill 
amends nine acts: the Bank Act, the Trust and  Loan Companies 
Act, the Insurance Companies Act, the Cooperative Credit 
Associations Act, the Winding-up and Restructuring Act, the 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act, the 
Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act, the Canadian 
Payments Association Act, and the Investment Companies Act, 
which is being repealed.
<P>
	This bill is a new indication of Ottawa's centralizing attitude. By 
establishing Canada-wide compensation and payment systems, Bill 
C-15 infringes on the authority of the Commission québécoise des 
valeurs mobilières and of Quebec's Inspecteur général des 
institutions financières. This results in costly overlap and 
structures. Quebec's financial institutions will be subject to two 
monitoring systems.
<P>
	Therefore, Bill C-15 is an unacceptable intrusion into the 
securities industry, which comes under provincial jurisdiction. In 
Quebec, the various governments have always strongly defended 
Quebec's jurisdiction over the securities industry. Even Daniel 
Johnson reaffirmed that position in a letter to the federal 
government on February 16, 1994, when he was Quebec's premier.
<P>
	The authority given to the Governor of the Bank of Canada to 
issue directives or orders to financial institutions goes squarely 
against that traditional Quebec position.
<P>
	This bill will result in even more unacceptable overlap. Beyond 
the issue of jurisdiction, the fact is that Quebec's financial 
institutions and individual savers will suffer from the duplication 
Ottawa is seeking to impose. This will result in additional costs and 
in a lack of consistency in government policies.
<P>
	Let us now take a look at the clauses of Bill C-15 I feel will 
create the most serious problems.
<P>
	The Bank Act will be significantly affected. Clause 12 of Bill 
C-15 provides that banks will have to disclose additional 
information. The various provincial securities commissions 
already request this type of information to banks and to other 
companies listed on the stock exchange. Therefore, this is a new 
type of duplication.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act is also being 
amended. Clause 21 of this bill defines the notion of ``affairs'' and 
of the affiliates of the member institution. For example, if even one 
of the institutions affiliated to Desjardins is a member of the 
Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, the federal government is 
entitled to give direction to all of Desjardins' affiliates.
<P>
	Clause 22 will give the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation 
the opportunity to be instrumental in the promotion of standards of 
sound business and financial practices for members institutions. 
This is a good thing in itself, but it is also a kind of duplication in 
the case of provincially chartered financial institutions that are part  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1604"> 1604 </A></B>
<P>
of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, since the province of 
Quebec already has regulatory control over these institutions.
<P>
	Clause 27 will allow the board of the Canada Deposit Insurance 
Corporation to establish a system of classifying member 
institutions according to the risk each of the institutions represents. 
Hence, the federal government will have no other choice but to set 
up a supervisory and monitoring system for these members 
institutions. Again, this will mean some duplication for the 
provincially chartered institutions, since Quebec already has a 
control and examination process in place for these institutions. 
Besides, such a classification system will put the smaller 
institutions at a disadvantage. We will have to see how the 
Mouvement Desjardins is reviewed. Will it be branch by branch or 
as a whole?
<P>
	The purpose of clause 34 of the bill is to determine the 
parameters of the examination mentioned in clause 27. For the 
provincially chartered institutions, this is already done by the 
provincial authorities. Why the duplication?
<P>
	Clause 60 of Bill C-15 specifies the circumstances under which 
the superintendent may take control of an institution in difficulty. 
Moreover, the superintendent has the obligation to notify the 
provincial minister responsible of the takeover of a central of a 
co-operative credit association which is incorporated under 
provincial legislation. Thus, the provincial authorities are 
completely pushed aside and the regulatory control a province has 
over its co-operative credit associations becomes practically 
irrelevant and even null and void.
<P>
	The Insurance Companies Act is also affected by this bill. Once 
again, the bill gives more power to the superintendent to step in if 
an institution is in financial difficulty. Provincially registered 
insurance companies are not beyond the superintendent's increased 
powers of intervention.
<P>
	According to section 66 of the same bill, the definition of 
businesses to which the law applies is also amended to include 
fraternal societies and provincial companies. The bill encroaches 
upon the powers of Quebec, which already regulates provincially 
registered institutions. Consequently, we are opposed to the bill's 
measures which apply to companies registered in Quebec and we 
are also opposed to all the sections relating to monitoring of 
provincially registered companies by the superintendent.
<P>
	Section 93 will also allow the superintendent to make public the 
information gathered pursuant to the new law. It will force 
provincially chartered insurance companies to publicly disclose 
information concerning the compensation of their executives, as 
well as their business and internal affairs. Since provincial 
securities commissions already require that information, there will 
be more duplication. Furthermore, the federal government has no 
legal right to regulate provincially chartered companies.
<P>
	Moreover, clause 95 provides that the superintendent will have 
his say on the composition of the board of directors of provincially 
chartered insurance companies in financial difficulty. There is 
already such a control system in Quebec. What then is the 
usefulness of clause 95?
<P>
	The main objective of clause 103 is to allow the superintendent 
to impose standards of sound business and financial practices to 
provincially chartered insurance companies. Another unjustified 
encroachment on provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act is 
also amended. Clause 105 clarifies the new objectives of the 
superintendent, stating in black and white that the purpose of the 
act is to ensure that financial institutions in all provinces are 
regulated by an office of the Government of Canada. This could not 
be clearer; the federal government has decided to gain the upper 
hand over the provinces.
<P>
	As for clause 106, it gives more detail on the federal 
superintendent's objectives. No distinction is made between 
institutions with federal charters and institutions with provincial 
charters. Only federally chartered institutions ought to be covered 
by this clause.
<P>
	Finally, clause 62 indicates that a totally new act, the Payment 
Clearing and Settlement Act, is being created here to allow the 
federal government to gain control over this area of provincial 
jurisdiction. The Canadian Payments Association Act is therefore 
done away with.
<P>
	These amendments and creations of new acts, all of this 
legislative process is put into place in order to once again hem in 
the provinces. The government's throne speech could not have 
been clearer on this. It intends to create a national securities 
commission, one which will directly invade the area of jurisdiction 
and the activities of the securities commissions in the Canadian 
provinces. In this context, Bill C-15 lays the ground work for the 
arrival of this national securities commission which the federal 
government intends to create.
<P>
	Once again, the government's firm intent is to establish 
wall-to-wall national standards, and financial institutions cannot 
escape from this unwavering trend. With Bill C-15, the government 
is expanding this principle of national standards to the financial 
institutions. It has now come full circle. The federal government 
has extended its grasp to the financial institutions, while on the 
constitutional level there are making a mockery of the historical 
demands of Quebec, by reducing it to the homeland of cultural 
survival in America.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-15 and to talk about financial 
institutions.
<P>
	This may seem like a fairly dry debate to many people but I think 
it is an important piece of legislation and it is important to talk 
about it. Perhaps it is important to talk about it in the context of 
what Canadians want with respect to financial institutions.
<P>
	There is a lot of talk today about financial institutions. When the 
banks announce their profits we hear a lot about it when we go on 
our tours throughout our constituencies.
<P>
	There are two things Canadians want with respect to their 
financial institutions. First is stability. They want to know their 
money is secure in those institutions whether they be banks, trust 
companies and so on. Second, they want to know those institutions 
are accountable, that they are open through the process of 
competition. There are a number of reasons for that.
<P>
	People want to know that service fees for instance are as low as 
they possibly can be. They want to know they are getting the best 
possible return on their money. They want to know on the other 
hand that they are being charged the lowest possible interest rates 
when they borrow from the banks.
<P>
	The idea is to balance the two as best we can so that we do not 
end up with the situation which occurred in the United States. 
There was the savings and loan debacle where a lot of people 
potentially could have lost billions of dollars until the United States 
government stepped in. On the other hand we want enough 
competition to hold all these various financial institutions 
accountable.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	The one area where Bill C-15 really falls down in my estimation 
is that it simply does not offer co-insurance. Co-insurance is simply 
an insurance scheme which would replace CDIC insurance as it 
presently is now. It would on the one hand still provide insurance 
for possibly up to 90 per cent of people's money through the 
government but it would leave a certain amount that would have to 
be covered by the banks or the financial institutions themselves. In 
my judgment this would be very good. It would hold those 
financial institutions accountable.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that before 1967 when CDIC insurance 
was put into place this country did not have a single bank failure. 
After 1967 when CDIC insurance came in, 30 financial institutions 
ended up failing in this country.
<P>
	What CDIC insurance unwittingly did is it gave people a false 
sense of security in those institutions. Consequently, they were not 
held accountable. People did not really know what kind of inherent 
risk there was in putting their money into them. As a result they 
folded.  The government was on the hook for them through CDIC 
insurance. The result was something like $5 billion being paid out. 
In fact at this very point something like $1.7 billion is still owed to 
the federal treasury from CDIC insurance. It is a very serious 
situation. In the past we have had many failures and it has cost 
taxpayers a lot of money.
<P>
	The really important issue here is that this bill does not provide 
co-insurance. There is wide support for the idea of co-insurance. 
Several different groups have come out in favour of co-insurance, 
not the least of which are the banks themselves. People as diverse 
as those from insurance companies, the superintendents of 
financial institutions, the chairman of CDIC, the Canadian Institute 
of Actuaries and all kinds of academics have come out in favour of 
co-insurance, as has the Senate banking committee. There is 
widespread support for the idea of co-insurance. That is why it is 
very disappointing that Bill C-15 does not have any mention of 
co-insurance.
<P>
	It is important when we are talking about something which is a 
new idea or concept that we be able to look either in Canada or 
elsewhere in the world for examples of whether or not this will 
work. There are some examples right now in the U.K. and Ireland 
where there is co-insurance and it works extremely well. We should 
use that as an example to guide us. Unfortunately, that is not 
available in Bill C-15.
<P>
	One very positive thing in Bill C-15 is the fact that premiums are 
going to be charged on the basis of risk for CDIC insurance. The 
negative side of that is the public is not allowed to know which 
institutions are being charged higher premiums because of the 
degree of risk. If they have a riskier loan portfolio and people's 
money is more at risk, unfortunately, for reasons that are not very 
apparent to me, the premiums are not made available to the public. 
Therefore the public cannot take the proper steps to protect 
themselves, particularly if they have an investment of over $60,000 
in one of those institutions.
<P>
	What Canadians really want are institutions that on the one hand 
are safe and provide that security and on the other hand are 
competitive enough to ensure that all those service fees and interest 
rates on charge cards are as low as they possibly can be. People 
want to know they are being charged the lowest possible interest 
rates on all the various personal loans. This is a hot issue in the 
country today and it is an important issue for the government to 
deal with.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	One thing we have been talking about lately is the issue of auto 
leasing and insurance and whether or not the banks should be 
allowed to move into those areas. The answer has to be no until 
such time as we see some real competition in the banking industry. 
We have to see some competition in terms of deregulating the 
banks and allowing some foreign competition so that there can be  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1606"> 1606 </A></B>
<P>
real competition to hold those banks and financial institutions 
accountable. This is critical.
<P>
	When the government looks at this again I do encourage it to 
seriously consider the issue of co-insurance. It would bring some 
real accountability to financial institutions and hopefully, would 
give the public confidence in those institutions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have heard 
Reform members one after the other talking about co-insurance. 
The reality is that depositors are not interested in co-insurance, just 
the financial institutions. The reason is that co-insurance would 
require depositors to have knowledge of the credit worthiness of 
the institutions in which they are depositing their money.
<P>
	That sounds fair and reasonable. But the reality is that the ability 
to understand a balance sheet, et cetera, is not well understood by 
some members of the public. I know this because my wife runs a 
financial company which sells GICs and uses a deposit insurance 
corporation for that reason. The average investor or depositor 
simply does not have that skill. If we brought in co-insurance, the 
reality is that those people would simply make their deposits with 
larger institutions and we would end competition in the financial 
sector.
<P>
	Co-insurance is not something that is specifically desired by the 
average person, only by the large financial institutions. I would 
suggest that is who the member is speaking for. He is not speaking 
for the average Canadian who would not understand the concept of 
co-insurance and which would probably prevent them from making 
deposits.
<P>
	The member also went on to say how co-insurance exists in a 
number of other countries and in Europe. He failed to mention that 
in United States the insurance is $100,000 per deposit, not $60,000. 
I only say this because the Reform Party is constantly saying how 
we should be like the United States, yet in this case the member 
decided not to use that example.
<P>
	I would simply ask the member, can he not see that co-insurance 
is not something which is supported by the average Canadian?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member sells the 
public short on this issue. People buy all kinds of insurance for all 
kinds of reasons every day. I do not think the hon. member is 
saying that the public is too dumb to figure out insurance on their 
automobile or their homes or anything else. At least I hope he is not 
saying that.
<P>
	The fact is that people make very sophisticated investments 
every day ranging from investing in the stock market where they 
certainly have to judge risk to investing in mutual funds. We have 
seen a tremendous growth in the investments in mutual funds. 
People are very well acquainted with the risk of investing in those 
things.
<P>
	The member is selling the public short on this whole issue. The 
public has a very good idea of exactly what they would be getting 
into and are quite capable of understanding co-insurance. The 
Public Interest Advocacy Centre is a supporter of co-insurance. 
The public is very well acquainted with insurance and with putting 
money into investments that carry an element of risk. The member 
is way off base by making that judgment about the ability of the 
public to understand.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Bill C-15 is now at third reading stage. This 
legislation is practically a jumble of disparate measures aimed only 
at increasing surveillance and regulation of the financial services 
sector in Canada. This bill amends several acts relating to financial 
services and repeals the Investment Companies Act.
<P>
	Though we do not oppose the principle of this bill, we have 
several concerns regarding the federal government's true intent. In 
fact, this legislation brings us one step closer to a control of the 
securities sector in Canada. This control will eventually be 
exercised by the Bank of Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-15 uses the excuse of controlling systemic risk to allow 
Ottawa to impede on a purely provincial jurisdiction. We have 
discussed this point last year when Bill C-15 was Bill C-100. These 
are examples reported by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. This bill impedes directly on an area of 
jurisdiction which is exclusively provincial, namely the securities 
sector under which come all liquid assets, shares, certificates and 
also bonds, to name but a few.
<P>
	Yet, two sections of the Canadian Constitution empower 
provinces to regulate securities. The first one, section 92.13, deals 
with property and civil rights in the provinces. In Quebec, 
securities are regulated under the Civil Code. The second one is 
section 92.16, which states that all matters of a merely local or 
private nature fall under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Quebec is already involved in the area of securities, through the 
Commission des valeurs mobilières du Québec and the Inspecteur 
général des institutions financières. Bill C-15 will create useless 
and costly new overlap-goodness knows how many instances we 
have reported already-by subjecting Quebec financial institutions 
to orders and directives from the Bank of Canada.
<P>
	In addition, by implementing a Canadian clearing system, the 
Governor of the Bank of Canada retains the right to issue directives 
not only to clearing houses, but also to participating financial 
institutions, regardless of their charter. The bill will therefore 
enable the governor to issue orders and directives to institutions 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1607"> 1607 </A></B>
<P>
such as the  Fiducie Desjardins, and to some extent, this is a strange 
twist of fate.
<P>
	It will be remembered that, if I am not mistaken, before founding 
the caisses populaires in Quebec in the early 1900s, Alphonse 
Desjardins had served as clerk in this House and later at the 
national assembly in Quebec. Alphonse Desjardins decided to start 
this co-operative system because there was a problem with the 
banking system in Quebec. The banks, which were predominantly 
English at the time, refused to make loans to French speaking 
Quebecers. Also, there were no banks in rural areas. All banks were 
concentrated in major financial centers. That is why Quebecers did 
not deposit their money in banks that refused to loan them money, 
and how the Quebec tradition of stashing one's savings in a wool 
sock came about.
<P>
	In response to this situation, Alphonse Desjardins decided to 
establish a financial institution to provide Quebecers with those 
services not provided to them by banks. He came to Ottawa to 
apply for a charter, which he was denied, because the banks were 
afraid such an institution would be in competition with them. His 
application for a federal charter was therefore rejected. That is why 
Alphonse Desjardins finally established his caisses populaires 
under provincial charter. Banks resisted this idea for years.
<P>
	I remember that, up until the early 1960s, banks refused to cash 
cheques drawn on caisse populaire accounts. It was a long battle 
before Quebec got a first-rate economic tool: credits unions, called 
caisses populaires in Quebec. We accomplished this all on our own. 
I recall that this was achieved with people getting fully involved, 
and working out of church basements.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	A lot of people worked on a volunteer basis for many years to 
develop this economic tool. We did it on our own despite early 
opposition. Now that this tool is in place, the Government of 
Canada wants to regulate this tool we developed ourselves. This, of 
course, is unacceptable.
<P>
	The bust of Alphonse Desjardins is now on display in the CN 
Tower in Toronto, since he is recognized as one of 10 great 
Canadians. The fact that visitors to the CN Tower can see it has not 
prevented the government from trying to regulate this institution, 
even though it was almost opposed to its founding.
<P>
	May I remind you that the bust of Joseph-Armand Bombardier is 
also displayed in the CN Tower in Toronto, which did not prevent 
the federal government from taking over all his patents in 1945.
<P>
	Another thing that bothers me in this bill is the concentration of 
power in the hands of a few individuals. This is what this bill does. 
It amends certain laws, including the Winding-up Act, to give the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions even more powers. This 
bill and  all the federal bills that have been tabled since this 
government came to office are aimed at concentrating even more 
power in the hands of those who already have it, be it a minister or 
the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.
<P>
	In any case, broadening the powers of the federal Superintendent 
of Financial Institutions will only lead to costly duplication, for 
which taxpayers will have to pay once again. Considering how long 
we have been talking about it, the government should have 
understood that federal intrusion in a sector which comes under 
provincial jurisdiction only generates inefficiency and useless 
costs. Not to mention the debates that will follow between the 
federal and provincial governments, at a time when constitutional 
talks are scheduled to take place in the months to come, at least 
according to the 1982 Constitution. The Prime Minister assures us 
that, under these conditions, the federal government is prepared to 
withdraw from those fields which come under the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the provinces. Is it not true that the Prime Minister 
takes with one hand what he is willing to give us with the other? 
This situation is unacceptable.
<P>
	What this government does is to stimulate competition between 
levels of government. But let us not forget that such competition 
between governments is never beneficial to ordinary citizens. Just 
think of manpower training, to which we refer daily because 
Quebecers notice it more and more. In Quebec, there is an obvious 
consensus regarding the need to patriate manpower training. This 
consensus among all the stakeholders goes back several years, but 
the issue remains unsettled. Meanwhile, this overlapping of 
jurisdictions costs over $250 million every year.
<P>
	The expanded authority delegated to the superintendent provides 
boundless power to a single person and could well trigger a legal 
battle between Ottawa and Quebec. Should this be the case, it 
would adversely affect financial institutions that are in difficulty as 
well as individual investors.
<P>
	I cannot understand what motivates the federal government. 
Why does it want to control a sector which has been very well 
monitored in Quebec for a long time now? I conclude that the 
federal government wants to find a way to interfere in the 
administration of the various provincial institutions, particularly in 
Quebec, for it clearly senses that federalism as it currently exists is 
about to become uncontrollable.
<P>
	It is also preparing for the next round of constitutional talks, 
which will come along eventually, by seeking out powers it can 
later return to the provinces, saying: ``Look how generous we are, 
giving you what you want''. They are withdrawing from certain 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, while on the other side of the coin 
they will in fact have lost almost nothing, because they will have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1608"> 1608 </A></B>
<P>
acquired other means of control, other levers of  power, taxation in 
particular. Such is the case with the bill we are looking at today.
<P>
	We can, therefore, predict that there will, in fact, be nothing but 
cosmetic changes. The Bloc will never agree to give up an area of 
jurisdiction that is, and always has been, exclusively provincial. As 
my colleague has already pointed out, even Daniel Johnson, when 
he was premier of Quebec in 1994, said there was no question of 
the Liberal government in Quebec's accepting encroachment by the 
federal government in securities matters.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	He added that the Government of Quebec would refuse and 
would jealously guard its prerogatives in this area. As we saw very 
recently, Mr. Johnson is opposed to what is happening in the 
House. Today he is dissociating himself from the idea being 
promoted in recent days of Quebec's being a homeland.
<P>
	The government in Ottawa appears to stuck in an impasse where 
it cares little about contradicting its allies in Quebec, who, are 
increasingly in agreement-and are forced to be-with the claims 
of the sovereignists, regardless of what the Prime Minister and his 
ministers may say.
<P>
	But, worse yet, the government is mocking the basic provisions 
of the Constitution, the very Constitution it so often preaches and 
talks about. The cost of Bill C-15 goes even beyond areas of 
jurisdiction. As I said earlier, the financial institutions of Quebec 
and investors will be the victims of the duplication of roles Ottawa 
wants to impose, because securities officials need coherent and 
stable legislation, as in the case of other sectors involved in 
financial markets.
<P>
	Instead of maintaining stability and consistency, two attributes 
highly prized by global financial markets, the federal government 
tells us, through Bill C-15, that it wants to establish its own 
institutions and allow the Bank of Canada and the federal 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions to intervene in the area of 
securities. The government's attitude is unacceptable.
<P>
	When the secretary of state responsible for Canadian financial 
institutions testified before the finance committee last August, he 
failed to answer the Bloc Quebecois' questions about the federal 
government's encroachment on the area of securities, which, 
according to the Constitution, comes under the exclusive 
jurisdiction of Quebec, as we pointed out earlier. He tried to evade 
the issue, as can be seen from the minutes of the committee 
proceedings. It seemed to us that the secretary of state did not even 
know what was in his bill.
<P>
	The secretary of state denied at the time that his government 
intended to encroach on the area of securities. We were sold a bill 
of goods, as the recent throne speech clearly referred to the 
establishment of a Canadian securities commission.
<P>
	We opposed the government's amendments, because they did not 
meet expectations in any way, just as Bill C-15 does not meet 
Quebec's expectations. This bill is written in a very technical 
language, of course, because it deals with technical matters, and it 
is very thick. This leads us to believe that the government is trying 
to confuse the opposition and the public, since the amendments in 
this bill, which are supposedly minor in nature, in fact have very 
serious consequences.
<P>
	We can only lament the fact that, almost every time a 
government bill is introduced, we in the Bloc are always led to 
condemn the same things. The government is using every means 
available in an attempt to centralize ever more. There is always a 
good excuse: market globalization, international competitiveness, 
systemic risks or what not. It is a real shame to see that, at a time 
when the government claims publicly that agreements can be 
reached with the provinces, it is doing exactly the opposite in 
legislation. They are not entering into any agreements with the 
provinces, they are centralizing.
<P>
	Four times already since the last federal budget was tabled, 
Ottawa has introduced a bill affecting federal-provincial relations, 
without even consulting the provinces. I am referring here to Bill 
C-76, implementing the budget and imposing national standards; 
Bill C-88, to implement the agreement on internal trade, which 
gives retaliatory powers to the federal government; Bill C-91 on 
regional development, which enables Ottawa to sign agreements 
with local authorities directly, without regard for provincial 
governments; and of course the bill before us today, Bill C-15.
<P>
	It is incredible. The government says agreements can be reached 
with the provinces and it talks about decentralizing, while its 
actions are to the contrary, and history has taught us these past 30 
years or so that actions speak louder than words.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	We will recall the commitments made by Mr. Trudeau in 1980. 
There is no need for me elaborate on this, since we are all quite 
familiar with these promises. ``We are putting our seats on the line 
to ensure changes take place'', they said. It is now 1996. In the 
meantime, the Constitution was patriated in 1982, but nothing 
changed for Quebec. These were all empty words and meaningless 
commitments. Today, they are talking about decentralizing, but 
every bill they introduce in this House contradicts the 
commitments they had made.
<P>
	We all remember the commitments made by the current Prime 
Minister in the final days of the referendum campaign, when he 
said: ``We will see to it that Quebec is recognized as a distinct 
society''. Already this promise has been forgotten. Through all 
this, we realize that commitments are meaningless, because there is 
never a real will to honour them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1609"> 1609 </A></B>
<P>
	The only things that are decentralized are of course the cuts. 
I want to talk about one of them, in the energy sector, since it was 
mentioned yesterday and today. Over the last 20 years, the federal 
government has invested $12 billion in Ontario for atomic energy 
research. It is also investing, of course, a few billions in the 
Hibernia project, in Newfoundland. However, in Quebec, the 
government cut the Tokamak nuclear fusion research project, in 
Varennes, in which $7 billion was invested annually until now.
<P>
	So, the government invests billions elsewhere, but any cut made 
affects Quebec of course. The government uses words which are 
meaningless or which say the opposite of what it intends to do.
<P>
	Remember, in 1980, we were told: ``If Quebec becomes 
sovereign, you will end up with a huge debt, high taxation and high 
unemployment. You, little Quebecers, cannot achieve 
sovereignty''. And what did we get since 1980? That year, the 
federal debt stood at $80 billion. Today, it is close to $600 billion, 
in spite of the fact that taxes and unemployment have never been so 
high. In other words, what we feared we would lose in 1980 by 
becoming a nation we lost by remaining in the Canadian 
confederation.
<P>
	Recently, before the last referendum, we were told: ``If you 
become sovereign, you will lose all your dairy subsidies''. Yet, we 
were just told in the last budget that all dairy subsidies in Quebec 
would be eliminated over the next five years.
<P>
	So, these are meaningless commitments. The government uses 
the pretext of a systemic risk to introduce Bill C-15 and get 
involved in the securities industry, even though the Governor of the 
Bank of Canada himself stated last summer that such risk could be 
controlled through increased monitoring of the major payment 
transfer system.
<P>
	Obviously, this bill is totally unacceptable to us, since it merely 
seeks to allow federal intrusion in areas which come under 
Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before moving to questions 
and comments, it is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to 
inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time 
of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Shefford-Canadian armed forces; the hon. member for 
Bourassa-immigration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask the member about his understanding of the whole area of 
international trade, exactly what is the reality of our joining the 
WTO and what that means to us in the world for the future. 
Obviously our future will be as a trading nation in dealings around 
the world.
<P>
	Whenever I hear somebody talk about the need for supply 
management and actually believe that will be something we could
<P>
ever hold on to in the future and still be a world trader, I am very 
surprised. Does the member not feel the dairy industry in Quebec 
would not be able to modernize and become a competitive producer 
in the world market without depending on government subsidy?
<P>
	I would like him to address that in the context of the World Trade 
Organization and what that will mean to us as Canadians, 
particularly if we have 30 million Canadians dealing in an 
international global market.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat taken aback by the 
question of my colleague from the Reform Party. Basically, he is 
asking me whether Quebec could survive without the dairy subsidy. 
We all know the Canadian government announced in its last budget 
the elimination of this subsidy. In the last two years, it has already 
been reduced by 15 per cent, and it will be completely eliminated 
within three to four years.
<P>
	In the meantime, billions of dollars have been invested in 
western Canada, where the elimination of the grain transportation 
subsidy has been compensated by other payments.
<P>
	The hon. member spoke about international relations. When 
Quebec becomes a country, it will have to make international 
commitments just like any other country, just like Canada, 
Singapore, France or Italy. It will then need the necessary tools to 
do so.
<P>
	For the time being, Quebec is under the Canadian Constitution 
and is a part of Canada, and it has to abide by federal regulations. 
Ever since Confederation, the federal government has felt the need 
for a complete centralization of economic and political powers in 
Ontario. It may be a fundamental need for Canadians, and a matter 
of survival for them. But this centralization is effectively depriving 
Quebec of its economic infrastructure and political power.
<P>
	Surely, my colleague realizes that a country can have, on 
international markets, facilities a province cannot have.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I come back to this concept 
that Quebec is paying out so much more. In Alberta, for example, 
we have paid $145 billion more than we have ever received as a 
province.
<P>
	Talking about the Crow rate being a subsidy, the Crow rate is an 
agreement made with the agricultural sector and the farmers now 
will not receive any transportation subsidy.
<P>
	The $1.6 billion was a pay-out of this contract negotiated to be 
worth somewhere in the neighbourhood  of $18 billion. Therefore 
$1.6 billion is simply a one time pay-out. It is gone. They will now 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1610"> 1610 </A></B>
<P>
have to compete in the international marketplace in the World 
Trade Organization.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course, this amount of money, 
$1.6 billion according to the hon. member, is to replace a subsidy 
previously granted to the farmers, but the milk subsidies will be 
completely eliminated in the province of Quebec. They will 
completely disappear.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Without any compensation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Without any compensation, as one of my 
colleagues puts it. So, 25 per cent of the $1.6 billion paid to western 
Canada comes from Quebec. We provide money to pay 
compensation elsewhere in Canada, while cuts are being made in 
our province, as was the case with the Tokamak project. We paid $3 
billion or $4 billion out of the $12 billion granted to the province of 
Ontario. We paid 25 per cent of the $3 billion spent on Hibernia. In 
the meantime, cuts are made to the Tokamak project. The province 
of Quebec is a net loser under the Canadian Confederation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A lot of people in Canada believe in those three assumptions, 
some for good reasons. If we are a bunch of trouble makers 
politically speaking, which is absolutely true, if we receive in 
Quebec much more money than we put in, then support the 
sovereignty of Quebec because the day we leave will solve the 
problem and you will make money from it. That is the reason.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this debate 
could very quickly leave Bill C-15 and get on to areas of national 
unity. I will refrain from doing that and I will get back to the topic 
at hand, recommendations in terms of changes to financial 
institutions.
<P>
	More specifically, I am interested in the CDIC aspect of the bill 
and where the bill proposes rate premiums for the CDIC. The 
premiums will be according to risk. We, the public, will not be able 
to know what the risk rating is at the various institutions. It is 
covered by a veil of secrecy. I want to know if this member 
believes that is a just action.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Also, if it is the objective of the government to make financial 
institutions more transparent and hold them more accountable, how 
does he feel about the speech I gave earlier this afternoon on 
co-insurance? Perhaps there is a need to look at co-insurance. 
Rather than having 100 per cent deposit insurance, perhaps there 
should be a 90 per cent guaranteed share along with a 10 per cent 
share by the investor.
<P>
	There is a perverse sense of fairness in the current system where 
lower risk or more successful institutions that do not go into 
receivership, that do not go broke,  that do not cost the taxpayers 
money actually have to help pay for the ones that do and ultimately 
taxpayers end up paying.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, on the issue of co-insurance, 
I must say that I am not sure I understand what my hon. colleague 
meant to say. Unfortunately, I did not listen to the speech he made 
earlier this afternoon and I do not feel I have all the information 
needed to answer his question.
<P>
	However, as regards the government's transparency, we have 
noticed not only in this document but also in the debate 
surrounding the upcoming tax reform, scheduled for the end of the 
year, that there is no transparency. For example, tax reform will be 
considered behind closed doors by a committee made up of the 
biggest users of tax havens in the world, who have institutions in all 
of these tax havens.
<P>
	The hon. member is right to remind us that, where transparency 
is concerned, the government has not seen the light so far, if I can 
put it this way. It is kind of opaque. You only have to remember the 
recommendations made on the Pearson airport, where everything 
was to be resolved in the minister's office behind closed doors. 
These last few years, we have criticized the government for its lack 
of transparency, and I think my hon. colleague has every right to do 
the same.
<P>
	As for co-insurance, I am sure my colleague and I will probably 
have the opportunity to meet in the future to review this technical 
issue in detail and in private.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the subject of Bill 
C-15 certainly is not the area of my expertise. I want to approach 
this from the standpoint of the lay person, talking about the 
banking system, the insurance system and what they mean to 
Canadians.
<P>
	We all recognize the value of a stable banking and insurance 
system. That is necessary in our society. If we look at the disruption 
the United States has in its fiscal system, none of us would want to 
ascribe to it.
<P>
	When we look at this bill we find that there are a number of key 
problem areas. The key to monitoring our financial institutions and 
ensuring their financial health is the question we should be 
addressing.
<P>
	Ensuring Canadians do not get conned into putting their money 
into shaky financial institutions which go on to collapse is of 
extreme importance to us. Every time one of these financial or 
insurance institutions goes under we all feel the repercussions. It 
costs millions of dollars to insure this does not happen, and over 
the years there have been a great many problems.
<P>
	The CDIC has often had to step in to cover the $60,000 insured 
limit on deposited moneys.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1611"> 1611 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	I think back to my experience in Alberta. When the Principal 
Group went under the grandmothers, the farmers and the general 
public that had put their money into that institution were left not 
knowing if they would get 10 cents on the dollar or 50 cents on the 
dollar or what would happen to them.
<P>
	Many people at that time said that was greed, that those people 
invested in the Principal Group because it paid one per cent more or 
one-half per cent more. I would not call that greed, I would call that 
human nature. People will look at institutions with a view to 
putting money into them based on what kind of return they can get. 
Seniors are most affected, as they were in my community by the 
collapse of the Principal Group. That is what we have to address. 
We must ask how much information the general public should have 
on all our financial institutions.
<P>
	Let us examine Bill C-15. It seeks to improve the rules regarding 
financial institutions. Unfortunately it does not deliver on this very 
well. Like so many of the bills we have had before us in the House, 
it goes part of the way in doing the job but does not go far enough. 
That is either because of political reasons or because of lack of 
information. Perhaps there is too much reliance on the bureaucracy 
and not enough on the hard work of committees and of the minister.
<P>
	Anyone leafing through the bill will notice it is quite complex. It 
runs 136 pages. When we take this amount of legal jargon and add 
it to the existing legislation we get an almost indecipherable 
collection of material nobody except a few lawyers really 
understand.
<P>
	Over the three years I have been here I have noticed that when 
we do this to bills, we leave things open to interpretation, we leave 
things open to confusion. Many people will look at it differently. 
The government has to return to communicating with people in 
people's language. Lawyers, accountants and bankers have created 
an industry out of complexity.
<P>
	Whether our tax system, our banking system or any of these 
systems, we are looking at getting legislation back to the people so 
the people can understand it and can deal with it. We should not 
have to hire experts. When we do that we leave ourselves open to 
the abuse we so often hear about from our constituents.
<P>
	The bill is very complex. It is an opaque bill and does not 
address the fundamental problems surrounding financial 
institutions. That is why my colleagues and I are not supporting the 
bill. We do not think Bill C-15 is evil or malicious, but we do not 
think the government has taken the right approach of putting it in 
language people can understand. I do not believe it could be that 
difficult to express the bill in a legalese we could understand and 
approach.
<P>
	What is this simple approach we are talking about? It is very 
important the system be understandable, open and accountable to 
Canadians. This is the exact opposite of what I see when I try to 
read Bill C-15.
<P>
	The current system is so arcane that no ordinary person can make 
head or tail of it. Even if some brave soul wanted to find the various 
ins and outs, the information simply is not available. It is 
confidential, it is off limits, it is out of bounds and it is something 
individuals should not have. In other words, there is no 
transparency and no accountability. It is no wonder Canadians do 
not have much faith in the way things are going and are currently 
being done.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	I come back to the tax laws as an example: 2,100 pages of 
gobbledegook. I look at our Constitution and see more 
gobbledegook. We have to relate to clause this and clause that as of 
this date and that date and so on. Businesses and individuals cannot 
understand it. Accountants have to take courses every month just to 
understand the changes that are being made.
<P>
	Let me relate one of the proposals in Bill C-15 that has some 
potential. It suggests that risk should be a determining factor in 
assessing premiums for the CDIC. That seems to be a really good 
idea. Everyone in this House understands that a high risk company 
should pay higher premiums. The inverse of this is true as well. 
The more secure the institution, the less the premium should be. 
This is common practice when it comes to insurance.
<P>
	Unfortunately though, the CDIC would not make these risk 
assessments available to the public. If this were open, transparent 
and made available, then people could plan their investments 
accordingly. They would know the level of risk they were taking 
and it would be totally up front. They would have no one to blame 
but themselves if they decided to make that riskier investment with 
the higher premium rates.
<P>
	There is no transparency. The way it is now is secretive which 
makes it impossible for Canadians to make informed decisions. I 
think we hear that no matter what area we talk about. Canadians 
need things to be transparent and open.
<P>
	I know many of the hon. members on the government side have a 
fair amount of money. We have heard that mentioned on occasion. 
Many of them are even what we might call wealthy. I would like to 
ask those people, if they were putting their hard earned dollars into 
a particular bank or trust company and they knew the CDIC had 
done a risk assessment on that institution, would they not want to 
know what the assessment said? Does it not make common sense 
that it would be public information that one institution was riskier 
than another?
<P>
	That sort of thing should be public information. That is why the 
public loses confidence and trust in politicians and in politics itself. 
We do not seem to open up this  information to assessment. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1612"> 1612 </A></B>
<P>
public has a right to have that assessment and to have it made 
public. We need to know who is reliable and who is not.
<P>
	When there is one of these big financial collapses and the 
taxpayer is left holding the bag, would those people who have made 
that decision not be angry if they realized that CDIC had known all 
along the company was a risky bet? Would people not wonder why 
the CDIC had kept that secret?
<P>
	I think back to what I talked about earlier, the example in Alberta 
where the grandmothers, the farmers and so many other people lost 
their savings. We heard that the experts knew it was risky, but that 
little grandmother out there sure did not know it was risky. How 
could she know since that information is confidential? It is secret 
information. As I pointed out at the start, if nothing else, just to get 
this into the layman's language so the layman understands it we 
have to open it up and make it transparent.
<P>
	I would like to go back to what I earlier called a simple approach 
to this. It involves a transparent and accountable system. One of the 
best ways to build accountability into a system is through 
co-insurance. This has been introduced but has not been followed 
up on. It is not part of the bill and was rejected.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	How can this be? It would seem everyone agrees that we need 
transparency, accountability and a right to know when a company 
is a risk and when it is not. What is wrong with co-insurance? Why 
is it not there? Again it comes back to the fact that we are not going 
far enough. We are just touching the edges.
<P>
	Many of the things we do are little political decisions where we 
said we would do a little bit, so we do a little bit. There is no vision, 
no long term plan. There is nothing there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Where are they on the GST?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> A member mentions the GST. Obviously 
we had a promise on the GST. A major change was promised, but 
what is going to happen? The name is going to be changed. It will 
be called the ABC tax and will be 15 per cent. That certainly 
sounds like a major change to me. It certainly destroys the 
accountability we are all talking about. Again I come back to 
mistrust of politicians and the political system.
<P>
	Canadians are responsible people and they would make sure they 
knew about the risks of particular financial institutions if some of 
their savings and retirement money was on the line. Under the 
current system though the first $60,000 is 100 per cent covered if a 
financial institution fails. What incentive is there to find out about 
these institutions? We must look at the whole area of co-insurance.
<P>
	With a 100 per cent guarantee it only makes sense for Canadians 
to put their money where they get the best deal and where they will 
receive the highest interest rate regardless of the financial health of 
the institution. It would only be human nature that when most of 
the members on the other side get their MP pensions they will put 
them into any kind of institution because of this 100 per cent 
guarantee. Believe me, we on this side will have to be much more 
careful because we are not getting the MP pension. We are not at 
the trough, as are so many others.
<P>
	With co-insurance we would have a shared risk and it would 
encourage accountability. It would force people to choose between 
the higher interest rate or the security. Those of us who have been 
in business have had to make those choices. We are saying that the 
bill should reflect this.
<P>
	It is not greed that causes people to go for the highest interest 
rate. Much of it is a lack of understanding of the system. Many 
people risk their life savings. They are not greedy; they are simply 
following human nature.
<P>
	Choice is good. Personal responsibility is also a good thing. I 
know some of my colleagues opposite would disagree but I feel 
strongly about this. I know the tradition of this place is to legislate 
away all choice to protect Canadians who were arrogantly assumed 
to be incapable of looking after themselves.
<P>
	Many of us came here because we got angry. We would send 
good people here and they would come back in six months and say: 
``We know better than you because the party told us that this is how 
we should think''. There is a member opposite who after yesterday 
I am sure will go back and say: ``Well, I voted against my party 
because I was honourable, because I did what I knew I had to do''.
<P>
	We often hear this message coming from on high, here in 
Ottawa. It is called Ottawa fever. That is where the party runs the 
show, not the people; the people do not bring the message this way, 
it goes in reverse. We are sick and tired of that.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians say: ``Be accountable. Put in some legislation. Do 
some of the real changes we have been demanding''. The people 
are ahead of the politicians. They are way ahead of the politicians. 
They understand risk. They understand the banking system. They 
are where it is at.
<P>
	Let us get back to the bill. Much of what we have been talking 
about is wound up in complexity, the banking industry, the legal 
industry, the bureaucracy. We are saying instead of the 136 pages, 
we can solve the problems much more easily. Bill C-15 should be 
scrapped and the whole issue should be looked at in a totally new 
light. The underlying principle for any future legislation should be 
openness, accountability and choice.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1613"> 1613 </A></B>
<P>
	Some members across the floor will say that I am saying 
competition is not good. I am saying that competition is where 
it is at but there has to be a level playing field. The problem with 
banks is they do not have a level playing field. There is no 
openness. There is no accountability. That is why we have the 
present problems. That is why the people have such doubts about 
banks, about insurance companies and about politicians. They 
have those questions because of the lack of accountability.
<P>
	It is good to go home and realize the support we have is from the 
grassroots. It has grown dramatically in terms of membership and 
in all kinds of ways. It makes us feel really good because we know 
we have taken the message the right way. The message has come 
from the people to this place. They are demanding that we put it 
into a much simpler, understandable way.
<P>
	In closing, Bill C-15 is too complex. It does not deal with the 
issues of accountability and transparency which people demand. 
We are voting against this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want 
to stand in defence of grandmothers. It seems to me that the 
members have been castigating grandmothers. I have met many 
grandmothers in my life who are very astute investors.
<P>
	Beyond that, it is getting back to the whole question of CDIC and 
the purpose for CDIC insurance. CDIC is not a bond rating 
company. Reformers want the CDIC to divulge this information to 
the general public. That is not its purpose. If a bond rating is 
wanted, they would go to Dunn and Bradstreet.
<P>
	Finally, I want to quickly say that the whole concept of 
co-insurance in the member's argument is in defence of the large 
financial institutions that allow them. The junior financial 
institutions will not be able to compete if the concept of 
co-insurance is brought in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, that was a fairly confused 
question but I will try to deal with it. First, we are all for 
grandmothers. We all agree with that so let us clear that away.
<P>
	With respect to CDIC, we do not expect it to be a bond rating 
agency. However when problems are found in a financial 
institution, we do expect that to be transparent. We do not expect to 
have a situation which occurred in our province with the Principal 
group. The company went under and the information was known 
but was not made public. It is not fair to the very grandmothers we 
are trying to protect. That is what we are talking about. We could 
have bond rating agencies. We do not expect CDIC to do that. 
CDIC is an insurance company. It is important to get this back to a 
transparent and accountable situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to compliment the member for Red Deer on his speech. He said 
that this was a topic about which he  really did not know much. 
However, after listening to him I find that his comments and 
opinions even improved on the speech which I gave on this topic. 
He did an outstanding job. It just shows the quality of the members 
over here in the Reform Party.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member for Red Deer-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Calgary Centre will 
be sorry to know that his time is up.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the

with specific legislation, in which case it would have been a bill.
<P>
	I want to quote from Reform's agricultural broadsheet which 
was printed prior to the 1993 election and which also supports this 
principle. It states: ``The Reform Party believes that producer 
organizations, including marketing boards, commissions and 
co-operatives, should receive their direction from producers who 
should structure their organizations in any manner in which they 
believe will best serve their interests. In consultation with 
producers, Reformers will seek to provide for a viable, self-reliant 
market driven industry to create an environment in which 
producers make their own decisions on how products are 
marketed''.
<P>
	This was the policy our party membership approved in 1992 
prior to the 1993 election. It was these principles and others like 
them on which we campaigned and on which we were very 
successful in many rural ridings.
<P>
	This is an issue today with regard to the Canadian Wheat Board. 
It is an issue in supply managed industries. It is an issue pervading 
much of agriculture.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1614"> 1614 </A></B>
<P>
	This principle was one Reform took before there were any 
plebiscites of producers such as the one in Alberta, before some 
of the data that is more scientific was done by polling 
organizations. It proves that Reformers have their ear open to the 
public, have their ear open to businesses and in this case, have 
their ear open to what those in the agricultural sector are saying. 
We have been proved to be correct by recent developments in the 
industry. Therefore I would hope that the speakers that follow me 
will endorse the principle I have put forward in the motion.
<P>
	The industry sectors which producers are debating are about 
having more input and influence over the marketing of grain and 
also in the supply managed sector. This includes the matter of pork 
marketing. It has become an issue in Manitoba whether producers 
should have new marketing options and who actually calls the shots 
when it comes to marketing pork in that province.
<P>
	Far too often the operations of marketing boards and 
commissions become removed from the individuals they are meant 
to serve. As a result the decision making process is left in the hands 
of individuals who do not necessary have the best interests of the 
producer at hand or share the need for good timely decisions on 
marketing that are required. Many producers feel that they need 
more options for their marketing. I want to focus my comments 
primarily on the Canadian Wheat Board. One of my colleagues will 
follow and spend a bit more time dealing with the supply managed 
area.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	There has been controversy regarding the Canadian Wheat 
Board during the past few months even though the controversy in 
general has raged on for as long as I can remember. It seems to be 
increasing in intensity and often even makes the news today.
<P>
	A plebiscite was held in the province of Alberta last year. The 
results of that plebiscite on the marketing of wheat and barley 
clearly indicates a growing trend toward a system in which 
producers will have the opportunity to decide how their products 
will be marketed.
<P>
	In the Alberta plebiscite 66 per cent of barley growers voted in 
favour of having the right to sell barley to any buyer. That is 
two-thirds of the barley producers in Alberta. Sixty-two per cent of 
wheat growers voted in favour of having the option to sell wheat to 
any buyer. That is a substantial majority and must be taken heed of 
and not cast aside. It is an important factor.
<P>
	The producers were asked: Are you in favour of having the 
freedom to sell your barley to any buyer, including the Canadian 
Wheat Board, into domestic and export markets? Are you in favour 
of having the freedom to sell your wheat to any buyer, including the 
Canadian Wheat Board, into domestic and export markets? The 
answer was a resounding yes. Participation in the plebiscite was 
extremely high with thousands of voters  taking the time to cast 
their ballots because they felt the issue was important.
<P>
	That is Alberta and Alberta may not represent the views of all of 
Canada. I know that Albertans' views are important but I happen to 
represent a riding in Saskatchewan and so the province of 
Saskatchewan is important to me. My colleague from 
Lisgar-Marquette has to have his ear open to what producers in 
Manitoba are saying.
<P>
	The Government of Saskatchewan did a scientific poll of its 
producers, asking their opinions on the Canadian Wheat Board. 
From this survey some interesting statistics are available to us.
<P>
	Approximately 80 per cent of Saskatchewan producers indicated 
some level of support for the board. This does not surprise me 
because there has always been strong support for the Canadian 
Wheat Board in the province of Saskatchewan. I happen to be one 
of those 80 per cent. My party is part of that 80 per cent that 
supports the Canadian Wheat Board. Some people have indicated 
otherwise but that is simply not true, and we have not said that in 
this House. We did not say it in our campaign material and we are 
not about to change our minds unless our members tell us we are on 
the wrong ground and our constituents tell us we are not moving in 
the right direction.
<P>
	On further study of the survey some very interesting opinions are 
expressed by Saskatchewan's producers. For example, while a 
majority of producers believe that the monopoly powers of the 
Canadian Wheat Board give it market power internationally, 
producers are divided on whether or not the Canadian Wheat Board 
gets the highest price. There is a saw-off on that one.
<P>
	More significantly, 58 per cent of Saskatchewan producers 
believe that participation in the Canadian Wheat Board should be 
made voluntary. This is not some cooked up poll. This poll was 
done by the Government of Saskatchewan, probably the provincial 
government in Canada that most strongly supports the Canadian 
Wheat Board. Its survey which it commissioned and paid for 
suggests that 58 per cent of producers in Saskatchewan want to see 
selling to the Canadian Wheat Board be more voluntary.
<P>
	A major of producers were in favour of selling grain to the 
domestic food markets without having to go through the Canadian 
Wheat Board. They were about equally divided but a small 
majority in favour of being allowed to make direct sales into the 
United States.
<P>
	A majority of Saskatchewan producers were in favour of the 
federal government having less control and influence over the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	There was a breakdown of the demographics with regard to this 
survey. It indicated that younger producers were more open and in 
fact even requesting change than were older producers. It tells us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1615"> 1615 </A></B>
<P>
that those who will be  farming in the future are in the majority in 
wanting to see changes to the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	It is interesting that they want to see structural changes to the 
board. They talked of discussing a dual market, domestic versus 
export and how that would be handled. The primary focus during 
the last election campaign was that the Canadian Wheat Board 
needs to be made more accountable and it needs to be more 
responsive to the producers it is supposed to serve. There is 
overwhelming support in this survey for the Canadian Wheat Board 
to be made more accountable to the producers that it is supposed to 
serve.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Currently the Canadian Wheat Board is controlled solely by the 
federal government. It is answerable to the minister of agriculture 
and, by extension, to the Privy Council. The commissioners are 
appointed by the Privy Council. Their term lasts until they reach 
the age of 70. Their benefits are extremely luxurious and in their 
jobs there is little for which they can be held accountable. It is not 
what the producers are calling for.
<P>
	Two-thirds of the respondents to the survey said that the federal 
government should have less control and influence over the 
Canadian Wheat Board. That aligns perfectly with the motion I 
brought today. The producers should be able to make their own 
decisions on how their products are marketed.
<P>
	Farmers may recommend that certain alterations be made to the 
Canadian Wheat Board, but the decision to implement those 
changes is still solely at the discretion of the federal government. 
Farmers are powerless. The wheat board advisory board is 
powerless to make changes to the board, even though it is supposed 
to be the elected body which has influence over the board.
<P>
	The board is a crown corporation and the government retains the 
power to direct the board with respect to the manner in which any 
of its operations, powers and duties are performed.
<P>
	More recently, a number of occurrences involving the Canadian 
Wheat Board have called into question the ability of the board to 
represent the interests of all producers. I could talk about its 
mishandling of the fusarium disease in southern Manitoba, its 
mishandling of frozen durum in southern Saskatchewan and its 
mishandling of the export of barley in the last crop year, just to 
mention a few.
<P>
	This has created a lot of unhappiness in the farming community. 
A few farmers want out from under the jurisdiction of the Canadian 
Wheat Board. However, the way the wheat board act is written they 
are not allowed any freedom whatsoever.
<P>
	A group of farmers called ``The Farmers for Justice'' has been 
formed. I am not in the House to condone some of the things which 
that group has done. However,  I would say that the reason we have 
a group of farmers in the prairies that goes under the banner of 
``The Farmers for Justice'' is because they feel they would like to 
have the ability to market their produce outside the board. 
Currently, the way the wheat board act is written, they are 
restricted. They cannot export their wheat into the United States 
without a Canadian Wheat Board export permit even though they 
might not have a wheat board permit or a contract with the board.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that farmers should break contracts. If a 
farmer contracts with the Canadian Wheat Board, they should live 
up to that contract. Farmers across the country accept that. When 
farmers make a deal, for the most part, they stick with it. However, 
these farmers have no choice in this matter. If they choose not to 
contract with the Canadian Wheat Board, their wheat is not their 
own. They have no choice in the matter but to apply to the board for 
the right to market their wheat.
<P>
	These farmers are asking that this be changed but they are not 
getting any co-operation from the government. They are taking 
steps that are beyond what we would like to see. They are doing 
things I cannot condone. However, they are frustrated, simply 
because there has not been any movement either within the board 
or within the Liberal government to correct the situation.
<P>
	I belong to a political party. Many Canadians support my party. 
If they want to get involved they can buy a $10 membership and 
they will have a voice in the way my party functions. They can 
have an equal vote on the policies which my party espouses and 
they can have a choice in the selection of candidates. If they are not 
happy with the Reform Party and they want to join another political 
movement of lesser quality, such as the Liberal Party, they have the 
right to buy a membership in that party. If they are not happy with 
my party I would rather they were in the Liberal Party because I 
would like to see them involved in a way in which they are 
comfortable.
<P>
	The farmers in western Canada do not have that choice. They are 
bound by the Canadian Wheat Board Act to market through a board 
in which they have no voice. They have no ability to assist in the 
formulation of the board's policies. They have no ability to select 
the commissioners who sit on the board. There is no democracy in 
the board. It has become a very political institution.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	There have been some reports and studies done on the Canadian 
Wheat Board in recent months. One was recently commissioned by 
the board, the Kraft report. This report is called the performance 
evaluation of the Canadian Wheat Board. It was commissioned by 
the board and paid for with the farmers' money. It was apparently 
given confidential information to determine whether the Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1616"> 1616 </A></B>
<P>
Wheat Board was doing a good job. That is fine. The board should 
be looking at itself  internally and evaluating itself. I do not find 
fault with that.
<P>
	However, the problem is there was another study commissioned 
by the board, the Deloitte &amp; Touche evaluation, which was kept 
under raps and never revealed to farmers until a copy was made 
available through Reform a few weeks ago. This was a 1992 study 
which found many serious deficiencies in the Canadian Wheat 
Board.
<P>
	I hear the member for Kingston and the Islands agrees with me. 
He is also concerned about these deficiencies in the board because 
he seems to be very interested in the matter.
<P>
	As a result of the hiding of this study, we have no idea 
whatsoever whether the board has acted on the recommendations 
made by its own auditors.
<P>
	We had another study commissioned by the Government of 
Alberta, pushing for dual marketing in wheat. It is the government 
which launched the plebiscite and did a study called the Carter 
study. It comes to an opposing position to the Kraft report. The 
Carter report suggests the wheat board is a more costly institution 
than it has been letting on and it costs more to market through the 
wheat board than we have been led to believe.
<P>
	Because producers do not have any direct say in the board it is 
hard for them to determine whether the board is being run 
efficiently. Because it is not transparent, they cannot tell how good 
a job the Canadian Wheat Board is doing. They also have no option 
to market outside the board.
<P>
	It is good to do these studies but it is much more important to 
give this board to the producers it is supposed to serve.
<P>
	The Ontario Wheat Producers Board serves much the same 
function as the Canadian Wheat Board expect that it is controlled 
democratically by Ontario farmers. Ontario farmers elect the 
directors of the board. They divide Ontario up into districts. They 
have an organization and the wheat producers in Ontario choose the 
directors who serve on the board.
<P>
	They do not have to go to the Government of Ontario or come to 
Ottawa because they can choose those directors themselves. Prairie 
producers do not have that opportunity. They have no voice 
whatsoever in selecting the commissioners.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> They have a wonderful minister of agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> I can tell the member for Kingston and the 
Islands does not understand prairie agriculture one iota. He 
probably would not even know what a sheaf of wheat looked like or 
which end of a combine the grain entered.
<P>
	However, these are issues of vital concern to prairie producers.
<P>
	There was the experiment with the continental barley market that 
was taken at the end of the Conservative term. A very interesting 
thing happened. The Canadian Wheat Board members said they can 
function under this scenario, a form of a dual market. They said 
they were happy because they knew the regulations had been 
changed. They were not about to fold up their tents and go home. 
They were prepared to compete. That opened a lot of farmers' eyes 
to the fact that perhaps the Canadian Wheat Board would not 
disappear under a dual marketing system. That again increased 
their discontent with not having a voice in how their products are 
marketed.
<P>
	We could argue for quite some time whether a single desk seller 
is better than an option or a dual market system. I do not think 
members on the Liberal side should be making that decision. To be 
quite honest, I do not think members on the Reform side or the 
Bloc side should be making that decision. The producers should be 
making that decision.
<P>
	It is very interesting that prior to the last election and prior to the 
reversal on the continental barley market the Prime Minister and 
his key agriculture people said the producers should make that 
decision. The Prime Minister said there should be a plebiscite. 
Suddenly the tables are reversed and a plebiscite is out of the 
question. ``Well, the farmers may not be able to understand the 
question''. Imagine the insult of the Liberals saying farmers would 
not understand the question. I would like members opposite to 
know farmers are very intelligent and would not have survived this 
long in Canada under some of the burdens they have faced had they 
not been extremely intelligent. Give them a chance a the tools to do 
the job and they will do extremely well.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	The western grain marketing panel is the tool the minister of 
agriculture has set up to review all the marketing of western grains. 
The panel members are supposed to look under every rock and find 
out what course of actions to recommend to the minister of 
agriculture.
<P>
	Much of the work has already been done and measured through 
the plebiscite, the polls and the surveys done by the province of 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The member for Lisgar-Marquette did a survey of his 
constituents and found the majority of them wanted a plebiscite, no 
matter which side of the issue they were on. In the riding of 
Kindersley-Lloydminister over 70 per cent of respondents wanted 
a plebiscite. That coincides with the scientifically accurate poll 
done by the province of Saskatchewan which lends credibility to 
the survey we are doing of our constituents.
<P>
	That survey really bothers the member for Kingston and the 
Islands. He does not like to deal with the facts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1617"> 1617 </A></B>
<P>
	I ask the House to seriously look at the motion. I would be 
extremely disappointed if any member of the House would not 
agree we should support the creation of an environment in which 
agriculture producers make their own decisions about how their 
products are market.
<P>
	I appreciate the time to speak on behalf of Canadian farmers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to respond to Motion No. 176 on behalf of the 
government.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminister moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House support the creation of an environment in which agricultural 
producers make their own decisions as to how their products are marketed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is not clear from the wording of the motion exactly which 
commodities or marketing systems he is referring to. However, 
through his comments now and through his statements in the past 
we can assume it is wheat and barley he is targeting in western 
Canada.
<P>
	The debate over the Canadian Wheat Board and current grain 
marketing systems has been going on for many years, with a wide 
range of opinions from status quo to the abolition of the board. 
Some are saying farmers are better off dealing with the single desk 
of the Canadian Wheat Board while others say farmers would 
benefit from being able to market their grain when and where they 
want.
<P>
	The assumption that dual market and Canadian Wheat Board 
could co-exist has not been proven. The board says dual marketing 
cannot work because it must make an initial payment. If initial 
payments are too low compared with spot price, it will not get any 
wheat or barley. If the payments are too high, farmers will try to 
deliver all of their product to the board.
<P>
	Furthermore, the free trade agreement and NAFTA both rule out 
re-establishing single desk marketing after an experiment with dual 
marketing unless United States interests are not hurt.
<P>
	As the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has said, you 
cannot put Humpty-Dumpty back together again. If we move off on 
an experiment the Reform Party is suggesting, we may endanger 
the marketing system throughout the rest of history in Canada.
<P>
	Those who favour dual marketing want the wheat board to 
behave like a grain company. The Canadian Wheat Board cannot be 
a grain company like any other. It is a marketing agency. It does not 
buy grain from farmers, it sells grain on their behalf. It does not 
make a profit. All the revenues from sales are returned to the 
producers. If markets fall, the board does not take the loss, farmers 
do.
<P>
	There have also been public demonstrations against both 
options. In general, the demonstrators have been shouting at each 
other, not trying to persuade each other of the rightness of their 
views.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	What has been missing from the discussion is a thoughtful, face 
to face, factual examination of the issues. There has been a lot more 
heat than light spread on the issue. There have been calls for the 
federal government to hold a plebiscite. The problem with that 
option is that complex questions on marketing structures or 
compatibility of different systems is difficult to address with a 
simple yes or no that a plebiscite would only allow them to say.
<P>
	For example, while an Alberta plebiscite produced a vote in 
favour of dual marketing, many producers said they would have 
voted differently if it meant the end of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	It must be recognized that making significant changes to a 
marketing system to accommodate the wishes of one group of 
individuals may damage the financial returns and continued 
operation of a preferred marketing choice of the majority of 
farmers.
<P>
	To help focus this debate, last July the minister put a grain 
marketing panel in place to look at all facets of grain marketing in 
Canada. That panel has now completed its town hall meetings and 
formal hearings and is now preparing its written report. One of my 
colleagues will have more to say on this subject later in the debate. 
This process is providing grain farmers, industry and other 
stakeholders an opportunity to participate in a number of grassroots 
discussions. I believe this is far more productive than passing a 
vaguely worded motion on this decision.
<P>
	In a previous debate in the House the hon. member complained 
that producers had no say. He also made that complaint today, that 
producers have no say in how solutions would be reached in this 
problem. The grain marketing panel has given them that input. It 
has also allowed other interested parties to be heard.
<P>
	He appeared before the panel on March 18. I was at the panel the 
day he appeared. Usually people take part in a process only if they 
believe it is valid. I congratulate the hon. member for recognizing 
the minister has the right to appoint a panel and explain his 
viewpoints at the table.
<P>
	I wonder why the member is not prepared to wait for the panel 
presentation when it makes its report. To pass this motion would be 
to repudiate the grain marketing panel before it is finished its work.
<P>
	I urge my fellow colleagues and members of the House not to 
support this motion. Instead they should allow the grain marketing 
panel to complete its hearings and produce its report. Then the 
Minister of Agriculture and  Agri-Food will be able to make a 
decision on the future of grain marketing. Then we can all be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1618"> 1618 </A></B>
<P>
confident in the knowledge that producers have spoken and have 
been heard.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak today on Motion No. 176 put forward by my 
colleague for Kindersley-Lloydminster, who is urging this House 
to support the creation of an environment in which agricultural 
producers make their own decisions as to how their products are 
marketed.
<P>
	First, let me point out the vagueness of the motion. Its purpose is 
not easy to identify but I will nonetheless try to bring out what, to 
me, are its most important features.
<P>
	First, I am very proud to quote the example of Quebec where 
farmers are largely responsible for the marketing of their products. 
Obviously, this is possible because they are well organized and 
well represented.
<P>
	That is why there are, in Quebec alone, 34,600 agricultural 
producers who are members of agricultural co-operatives. I think 
we, Quebecers, get a great sense of pride from this. The 
Coopérative fédérée and Agropur, to name but a few, have a 
turnover that is more than 50 per cent of that of all non-financial 
co-operatives put together, that is, more than $3 billion. The 
mandate of the Union des producteurs agricoles or UPA is to 
organize and represent all Quebec agricultural producers, whatever 
the size and structure of their farms, the nature of their production 
and the place they live.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Obviously there is no problem as far as representation is 
concerned and members of these cooperatives seem satisfied with 
the mandates of their organizations. We could mention as an 
example the dairy producers of Canada and Quebec who, after 
evaluating changes in international trade, felt compelled to put in 
place a market sharing quota for exports in order to take advantage 
of new opportunities. This is a good example of producers making 
their own marketing decisions. This was made possible by the fact 
that the marketing board gave these producers a powerful 
marketing instrument: supply management.
<P>
	Another advantage that marketing boards give the producers is 
that not only do they control marketing decisions, they also control 
the cost of inputs since prices negotiated for the marketing of their 
products are based on production costs.
<P>
	The motion certainly has the merit of recognizing that producers 
must have a say in the marketing of their products but, as I have 
demonstrated, it is already the case in Quebec. Therefore, I wonder 
if, by bringing forward this motion, my colleague from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster wants western producers to be given 
the same environment that dairy, egg and poultry  producers enjoy 
for the marketing of their products. If so, I have to congratulate the 
member for recognizing that the Quebec model could be applied to 
agricultural products in western Canada.
<P>
	In this context, it is easy to understand the criticism expressed in 
western Canada with regard to the Canadian Wheat Board, for 
example. Members of the board are appointed by the government 
without producers having anything to say about it.
<P>
	It has often been proposed that the advisory committee be 
composed mainly of producers, and that applies to both elected and 
appointed members. Maybe it would be interesting to propose that 
the appointments be submitted to the standing agriculture 
committee. It would certainly give some independence to the 
appointment process.
<P>
	Western producers feel uncomfortable with the Canadian Wheat 
Board. Indeed, some argue that the commission does not advocate 
farmers' interests anymore because it refuses to change an obsolete 
management system that is more than 60 years old. Moreover, the 
recent plebiscite in Alberta has shown that more than 60 per cent of 
farmers think their ideas are not taken into consideration or are 
bluntly disregarded by the commission. That could easily be 
explained.
<P>
	The farmers' concern is easy to understand, considering that the 
commission controls or greatly influences all aspects of grain 
marketing, transportation and handling, that it controls the price 
and sale of wheat and barley, the allocation of cars, the decisions on 
storage and shipments by grain companies, the value added 
processing and resource allocation. I believe we have reason to be 
concerned because the commission, which is not accountable, 
could make an improper use of its power. The risk is that an 
organization which exercises so much regulating control could be 
accused of patronage.
<P>
	Do not get me wrong, we are not accusing the Canadian wheat 
board of incompetence and of misuse of power; rather, we are 
trying to show that the risk of abuse exists and that it might be 
preferable to review the process of appointing commissioners, who 
are designated by the gouvernement, and of members of the 
advisory board, who are designated by western farmers, in order to 
ensure a more equitable representation of the interests of western 
farmers.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the interests of farmers and producers are often 
neglected, and not only in the west. We need only to look at the 
consultation process of the government to realize that, more often 
than not, the government consults only for show. Take for instance 
the recent cuts in dairy subsidies. Of course, the government 
consulted dairy producers in Quebec and Canada, but they were 
nevertheless faced with a done deal. No more subsidies, period. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1619"> 1619 </A></B>
<P>
Now, what arrangement would be the least painful to you? 
Decision: spread the cuts over five  years. Conclusion: the 
government consults, fine, but does what it wants anyway.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Another more recent example is the issue of raw milk cheese. I 
cannot resist this little aside, given my background. The 
government is preparing to propose that the food and drug 
regulations be modified to improve the protection of public health. 
The proposed change involves unpasteurized cheese made from 
raw milk.
<P>
	This would involve requiring all cheeses intended for sale to be 
pasteurized. This would mean that the specialty cheeses would no 
longer be available in our stores. Do you see how absurd this is? 
Just from the health point of view, if raw milk cheese were as 
dangerous as that, why would we have authorized its sale since 
1991? The only case of poisoning linked to a dairy product in 
Canada dates back 61 years.
<P>
	Alcohol and tobacco are hazardous consumer products, yet they 
are not banned from our store shelves. Go ahead and smoke two 
packs a day, knowing that you are likely to eventually get lung 
cancer, but under no circumstances eat raw milk cheese. There is 
no sense to this whatsoever, particularly since it hurts a fledgling 
industry in Quebec capable of developing products that would 
make our European friends green with envy.
<P>
	In fact, the bulk of the raw milk industry is located in Quebec, as 
are most of those who eat raw milk cheeses. We have discovered 
that there is more to life than Kraft cheese, so this is not the time to 
take the pleasures of the table away from us.
<P>
	One wonders if, as the hon. member for Frontenac said recently, 
some sort of excessive fear of food poisoning, or rather pressures 
from large dairy producers afraid to lose their share of the market, 
did not motivate the government to act on this issue. It remains to 
be seen what results the consultation process will bring.
<P>
	Who knows, maybe the government will come to its senses and 
not go forward with its attack against raw milk chees. Today it is 
cheese, but tomorrow it could be chicken salad or tuna which will 
be banned. As a matter of fact, there have been in recent years cases 
of epidemics caused by the same bacteria as the one found in some 
raw milk cheeses.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose 
of this motion is to give Canadians farmers the right which has 
been given to others in Canada and around the world to market 
their products in the way they choose. We would expect the 
government would not have to be asked by farmers for this right, 
but that is exactly what is happening.
<P>
	I will talk briefly before I get into my presentation about one 
farmer who is in the third week of a hunger  strike to get what we 
would expect would be given willingly in this country. Tom 
Jackson, a farmer from Fort Saskatchewan, is continuing to try to 
force the government to change the Canadian Wheat Board Act 
through a hunger strike.
<P>
	This is drastic action, but he feels this is important enough that 
he is willing to take this drastic action to force the government into 
the change that he and the majority of Albertan farmers and 
probably the majority of farmers across the country want for the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	The subject I will deal with in relation to the topic the hon. 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster brought forth today is the 
supply managed sectors of the agricultural industry.
<P>
	Supply managed sectors must be talked about separately because 
unlike all other sectors of the agriculture industry many farmers, 
probably the majority, do not want to have the supply managed 
aspect removed. They are not as willing to have their industry 
opened up to competition and to have that freedom to market in any 
way they want.
<P>
	I would concede that probably the majority feel like that. They 
have done very well under the supply managed system. The reality 
is most likely this will happen anyway. That is, supply managed 
sectors will be opened up to competition from outside the country. 
It is very likely that will happen.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	It is true there are some discrepancies between some Reform 
ideas and supply management. Reform members have been saying 
for some time that they want what is best for the farmers in the 
supply managed sectors of agriculture.
<P>
	It is important, at least for me, to have those involved understand 
what Reform has been saying and what we do want for farmers and 
others in these industries. It is important to give this message 
unfiltered by the media and by some leaders in the supply managed 
sector. So often what Reform MPs actually say and what the media 
portrays can be quite different, interesting but quite different.
<P>
	To relieve stress and anxiety, on Sunday mornings a neighbour of 
mine, a farmer who lives down the road from me, takes his little 
5-speed and works through the gears, gets it up to 120 kilometres 
per hour and accelerates around the curve so he is going out of that 
curve at 140 kilometres per hour. That makes him feel good and 
helps relieve his anxiety.
<P>
	One Sunday morning my neighbour drove out to the end of his 
driveway and started working through the gears, heading down the 
road and saw a car on his road. Then he saw the car swerve. He 
said: ``Oh my gosh, a drunk driver on my road on a Sunday 
morning''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1620"> 1620 </A></B>
<P>
	As the car came closer it slowed down, and so he slowed down 
but did not stop. It was a lady driver. He said: ``Oh my gosh, a 
lady driver on my road on a Sunday morning''. The lady stops 
the car and opens the window. As he goes by he hears the driver 
say ``pig''. He was mad. He said ``sow'' and went speeding down 
the road into the curb at 140 kilometres and hits the pig.
<P>
	This farmer because of his attitude problem refused to notice the 
signals that would have allowed him to miss the obstacles, to miss 
the pig.
<P>
	I will talk about some of the signals I sincerely hope farmers in 
the supply managed sectors of agriculture will not miss. I am 
talking about the warnings of change which would lead to an end to 
supply management as we know it, change which will lead to more 
access to our markets by other countries, especially the United 
States.
<P>
	There is the possibility of Canada's losing the NAFTA chapter 
20 dispute settlement initiated by the United States. If Canada loses 
the U.S. challenge our current system of supply management will 
undergo radical change. Although many farmers and others in the 
industry are confident we will win the dispute, others are less 
convinced. In any case they are concerned about their future 
regardless of the outcome of the panel hearing.
<P>
	Another threat to the supply managed industry is the Chilean 
accession into NAFTA and the opening up of this agreement. The 
Government of Canada has told Canadian farmers again and again 
they do not have to worry about that. It will not open NAFTA up to 
negotiation even if it wants to let Chile in.
<P>
	The government said during the election campaign it would not 
sign NAFTA unless certain criteria were put into the deal. They 
were not put in and it signed it anyway. The government cannot be 
trusted when it comes to promises made about these trade deals. 
We do not know what will happen.
<P>
	Looking ahead a little further, what will happen to our current 
system of tariffication after the next round of negotiations starting 
in 1999? Will the GATT countries continue to allow Europe, 
Canada, the United States and others to keep high tariffs on 
imported dairy, egg and poultry products? I believe this round of 
negotiations will be much shorter than in the past. We are not 
looking at a 5 year to 10 year negotiation period, as happened last 
time.
<P>
	The world and particularly the United States will have more 
access to Canadian markets in the supply managed sector than they 
have now as a result of the negotiations. I believe they will have 
much more access.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	Another signal that I hope farmers are thinking about, which 
might allow them to avoid the pig, is the possibility of bilateral 
trade negotiations with the United States. This is a very real 
possibility.
<P>
	There are several different factors that could spark these bilateral 
negotiations. It could be the result of a panel hearing. It could be 
the result of negotiations with Chile getting into NAFTA. It could 
be that the Americans finally are willing to reduce protection in 
some of the protected areas, like peanuts, sugar and coffee.
<P>
	If the U.S. agrees to make changes in its export enhancement 
program, will the government agree to lower our protective tariffs? 
Who knows? I can honestly say I have more questions than 
answers. In the more open trade environment which is building 
around the world, I can be quite sure that the change will come 
sooner than many would predict.
<P>
	When I mentioned these possibilities at a meeting in Richmond, 
Quebec, the first question was what about another possibility? 
What about the possibility of Quebec leaving the country? That 
would lead to the end of the supply managed sector overnight.
<P>
	In closing, I ask the question, what have I left farmers with here 
today? Nothing really very positive but that is because I have made 
the same mistake that most people make when they talk about the 
possible end of supply management. I focused on the threats 
resulting from the change. What about the new possibilities and the 
new opportunities that farmers in the industry will have? They will 
have more competition in products coming from the United States. 
However, on the other side they will have the huge American 
market open to them. I know Canadian farmers in the supply 
managed sector can compete very well with their American 
neighbours. They will do well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on the private member's motion of 
the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster. It is a pleasure because 
I know my counterparts from Saskatchewan and Alberta have 
farming backgrounds. I am here to represent the point of view of 
farming communities.
<P>
	I come from a rural area in southeast Saskatchewan. The 
concerns they raise are valid. That is why the minister of 
agriculture set up a mechanism to review that forum. Where are we 
going? How will we move into the 21st century if we do not 
understand what are the problems that confront us today?
<P>
	I set up a panel. That panel was allowed to hold hearings in 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. The panel is going to come 
back and report to the agriculture minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1621"> 1621 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me say to my friends opposite that as I travel throughout 
southeast Saskatchewan, there are those on both sides of the issue. 
There are those who would like to see the sale of grains and other 
commodities put through dual marketing. But there are also those 
who are saying that they want the Canadian Wheat Board to stay 
in its present form.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board has to make some changes. Those 
changes have to be done through the proper mechanism, that is, 
through the panel set up to review that.
<P>
	Let us take a look at some of the proposals that the panel is going 
to review. They have merit. What are the nature and the 
requirements of existent potential markets? What do we have? Let 
us review the commodities and products that could be sold into 
these markets. Then let us review the marketing systems that are 
now available or could be available to exploit such markets to the 
maximum possible benefit of western producers.
<P>
	We had stakeholders. Who did we select as the chairman? We 
selected a lawyer from Saskatoon who is well known and well 
respected. Along with that where did we go? We took people on 
both sides of the issue. The agriculture minister said: ``We want 
both points of view''. Those people are going to come forward with 
honest opinions. They may not be the opinion which my friends 
opposite want, but it will be one which is focused, one which is 
right for the time and one which will lead us into the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	There was the suggestion that not every member of Parliament 
takes polls. Every time I go home to my riding I take a poll. I take 
the opinions of those people who are my farming counterparts and I 
listen to them.
<P>
	The folks from Inland terminal have one point of view on how 
we should handle this. The people in southeast Saskatchewan from 
the Redvers area look at dual marketing and are concerned. Other 
groups of farmers are saying: ``I am old, I am established and I 
think the Canadian Wheat Board is doing a reputable job''. It is fine 
to criticize if one does not understand.
<P>
	However, the Canadian Wheat Board is due for some criticism if 
it does not change. Does change mean that the whole system should 
be thrown out? I do not think so. When all is said and done, we will 
find that the support of the people from across the west will be for 
the Canadian Wheat Board as the single desk selling agency that 
performs very well.
<P>
	Let us not fool ourselves. If we get rid of it and we go to a 
marketing system where everybody goes on their own, I would 
venture to say that within five years or less the farmers who wanted 
to get rid of the system will be marching back to the door of the 
agriculture minister  saying: ``What have we done? Let us bring 
that agency back''.
<P>
	A friend of mine recently visited China. He talked to the 
agriculture people over there. He said that our producers are to be 
commended. They produce the best quality grains in the world. 
They have the quantities which China wants and they are delivered 
on time. The Chinese people are going to be the largest buyers of 
our good quality wheat. However, he said: ``If you move away from 
that single desk selling agency, I am telling you now that we will 
have to take a second look at whether we will buy from you''.
<P>
	That is what is happening in the trading world. There are people 
who are concerned that we will move away from that single desk 
selling agency.
<P>
	I would like to commend my hon. friend from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster for bringing forward this motion. This 
is the area in which we want to be able to sit down to discuss 
openly, in a wise manner, what are the options and where we are 
going.
<P>
	I also commend the parliamentary secretary. He brought up a 
very good point, that is, the vote in Alberta was not really reflective 
of the question which was asked.
<P>
	People were asked if they wanted a dual marketing system. They 
said yes. If it means the end of the Canadian Wheat Board they may 
very well say no. It is a very serious argument.
<P>
	I want to say in closing that the results will be reviewed by the 
minister of agriculture. He will take a look at both sides of the issue 
and I am sure he will recommend those things that need to be done 
in the best interests of the farming community right across Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity, in the limited time we have 
left, to say a few words about this motion.
<P>
	I have been listening for the last 50 minutes or thereabouts to 
what members opposite have been saying. I guess they did not 
understand the motion because we have been talking about two 
separate issues. Members opposite are talking about the merits of 
single desk selling versus the merits of dual marketing in the 
Canadian Wheat Board or some such thing. The hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster simply states in his motion that the 
farmers, the producers, should have the right to make the decision 
on how they will market. We are not here to decide how it is to 
happen.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The member for Essex-Kent a few minutes ago questioned the 
ability of farmers to deal with such a complex question. As a 
farmer I am shocked and appalled that a member of Parliament 
would imply that farmers are too stupid to make a decision this 
important.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1622"> 1622 </A></B>
<P>
	He says ``I will make the decision for you. I know what is best 
for you''. Farmers have been living under that system for far too 
long and they will no longer accept it.
<P>
	Let us talk about democracy. Let us look at the history of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. It was established without a vote. The 
wheat board commissioners are appointed by government without 
a vote. The wheat board took barley out of the wheat board and 
brought it back in solely without a vote. Producers could only 
market their canola and other special crops outside the wheat 
board, without a vote.
<P>
	In the 1993 election campaign the government claimed it would 
uphold the high principles of democracy. The minister of 
agriculture promised a plebiscite on barley. It is now two and a half 
years later and nothing has changed-without a vote.
<P>
	There is no democracy in the Canadian Wheat Board. I believe 
there is a strong place for the Canadian Wheat Board, but by doing 
nothing, this producer funded board may well self-destruct from 
within without pressures from outside.
<P>
	I support my colleague from Kindersley-Lloydminister on his 
motion. My only disappointment is that the government has 
deemed it should not be a votable motion. It has seen fit to stifle 
even further democracy by not allowing the House to vote on the 
motion, let alone allowing farmers to vote on an issue that has a 
tremendous impact on their destiny.
<P>
	When will the government wake up and realize producers will no 
longer accept this kind of dictatorial attitude toward their industry?
<P>
	A few weeks ago I was travelling to Moose Jaw and I heard a talk 
show on the radio featuring Nettie Wiebe, the president of the 
National Farmers Union, a strong supporter of single desk, orderly 
marketing. I have no problem with that.
<P>
	She said this is a democracy and the majority of people should 
rule in a democracy. I fully support that. When has the majority had 
the opportunity to make a decision on these types of things?
<P>
	I could go on and on about the importance. Let us keep in mind 
we are not talking about the value of single desk marketing versus 
dual marketing. We are talking only about the issue of producers 
having the opportunity.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Shall we call it 6.30 p.m.?

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANARMEDFORCES">CANADIAN ARMED FORCES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on March 
21, I put a question in the House to the Prime Minister regarding 
events which had taken place in Gagetown, New Brunswick, and 
which included distasteful hazing rituals. These events showed 
once again that Canadian forces commanders have lost control over 
military ethics: the series of events that occurred in Somalia, in 
Petawawa, and at the Citadel in Quebec City clearly demonstrate 
that high ranking officers always manage to get away with things 
and wash their hands of anything that could prevent them from 
being promoted. Being promoted is what matters, often to the 
detriment of the truth, even.
<P>
	Today, in light of all these events, we are wondering who leads 
the forces. Why, when there are unfortunate events such as those of 
late, is no one responsible at the top of the chain of command? If 
this is the case, is there not cause for concern about the success of 
armed forces' undertakings at home and abroad?
<P>
	As you know, before the sad and unfortunate events in 
Somalia-I remind you that people died-Canada enjoyed a 
spotless reputation in the area of peacekeeping. In a peace mission, 
our soldiers represent us. They are our ambassadors and should 
behave in a dignified and professional manner. Their behaviour 
must be exemplary. They are not allowed to let us down.
<P>
	Another event that surfaced was the Quebec Citadel 
manoeuvres, which were authorized by military leaders and which 
could have turned into a blood bath. As elected representatives, 
what should we think of such improvised manoeuvres?
<P>
	At this point, Canadians are increasingly losing confidence in 
the integrity of the chain of command of the armed forces. I would 
remind you that $10.7 billion will be spent in fiscal 1996-97. That 
is an awful lot of money.
<P>
	I invite the minister to assume his responsibilities. He must do 
everything in his power to restore the credibility of the Canadian 
armed forces. He must do everything possible to shed light on the 
unacceptable behaviour of certain members of the forces and cure 
the ills plaguing the army. He must have the courage to go right to 
the top of the chain of command. If he fails to fully restore the 
forces' reputation, he will have no choice but to leave.
<P>
	Nothing, as I speak, indicates to me that the minister is going to 
succeed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member opposite has demanded accountability in 
the Canadian forces. This is one of the cornerstones of the 
Canadian forces.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1623"> 1623 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian forces have a policy of zero tolerance for hazings 
and other related activities which cannot in any way be considered 
soldierly. The policy exists and has been disseminated and 
Canadian forces members are to act accordingly. Like all 
Canadians, they are responsible and accountable for their actions.
<P>
	If a Canadian forces member chooses to ignore the very clear 
direction provided, actions appropriate to the transgression in the 
question will be taken. I assure the hon. member that violations of 
Canadian forces policy are dealt with firmly and effectively.
<P>
	As a result of this incident a number of Canadian forces 
members face administrative and disciplinary measures. Those 
who witnessed the incident will be dealt with administratively, 
receiving formal warnings that they should never again be found to 
be involved in any activity of this nature and severe career action 
will be taken.
<P>
	The remaining Canadian forces members who are found to be 
participants in varying forms and degrees in the events at Camp 
Gagetown will be charged under section 129 of the National 
Defence Act for conduct to the prejudice of good order and 
discipline. A number of punishments are available to the officer 
responsible for trying the accused.
<P>
	The trials of soldiers who were charged will likely be finished in 
the very near future and any actions taken as a result will be made 
public immediately thereafter. I will not comment any further on 
the cases in question, as it is imperative that due process be allowed 
to take place.
<P>
	On numerous occasions opposition members seemingly want to 
taunt the government into bypassing due process in the name of 
political expediency. While the member opposite has stated in the 
House who he believes to be responsible for the incident in 
question at Camp Gagetown, justice will be better served by 
allowing due process to run its course.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on March 
11, I asked the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration a question 
concerning the alleged payment of what the investigator, Roger 
Tassé, calls ``accommodation fees'' and what I call bribes by 
removal officers of her department to foreign officials so that they 
would let their own nationals back in. The minister never took 
action on these very serious allegations, despite our call for a 
special inquiry.
<P>
	The minister should clearly commit herself to following the 
recommendations of the Tassé report. The reprehensible methods 
used by immigration officers for  the deportation of foreign 
nationals must not be allowed to continue. It is inadmissible, and 
even illegal, for civil servants to alter or forge documents in order 
to deport asylum seekers or speed up the process.
<P>
	Moreover, certain removal officers administer tranquillizers to 
deportees. Yesterday, I was made aware of the case of an Algerian 
man, Mr. Bedj, who was told he would be given drugs if he made 
any trouble when it came time to go. The officer opened his travel 
bag and showed him a brand new syringe and some drugs.
<P>
	I also condemn the police attitude of certain removal officers. 
They often use force or unnecessary equipment, without any 
reason, handcuffing the persons in their custody, for example. They 
sometimes violate their civil rights and liberties. A lot of these 
actions are never brought to the public's attention. The CIC should 
make available all information concerning removal matters.
<P>
	As for detention and release of persons in custody, the situation 
is totally arbitrary. Nowhere can we find any precise criteria for 
detention and release. Sometimes, foreign nationals stay months 
and months in detention centres without any justification and very 
often in very poor conditions; men, women, adults and children 
together. In the Mississauga detention centre for immigrants I met 
a Kurdish girl, still a minor, who had been there for more than eight 
months, without any charge being brought against her.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to criticize the people 
responsible for the detention centre situated on Saint-Jacques 
street, in Montreal for their attitude towards me. Despite a 
pre-arranged appointment, my assistant, a representative from the 
refugee assistance committee and myself were kept waiting for a 
quarter of an hour outside, last December, before we were let in. 
We had to wait outside in very cold weather. I have requested an 
investigation into that incident. I am not at all satisfied with the 
explanations of the minister and of the CIC director for Quebec.
<P>
	Furthermore, I ask the minister to reconsider her decision to 
move the detention centre to Laval because that site is too far for 
lawyers, officials and inmates' families.
<P>
	I would also suggest that the minister review the whole 
procedure for escorting deported people out of the country, which 
is costly for the public purse. Why must two or three officers escort 
an individual who is not a criminal?
<P>
	For a few years now, the Canadian and American governments 
have been preparing an agreement in order to control and reduce 
the number of claimants and discourage people from claiming 
refugee status. In November 1995, they signed a draft agreement 
and the final text was to be signed in February, and then in April.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration held 
public consultations on that text.  Almost all the organizations and 
individuals, both from Canada and the United States, who appeared 
before this committee were against this draft agreement.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1624"> 1624 </A></B>
<P>
	Now, Canadian and American governments have decided to 
postpone negotiations on this agreement until next summer, once 
the United States has passed new and even more stringent 
legislation against refugees.
<P>
	I am strongly opposed to this agreement that will keep thousands 
of persecuted people from coming to Canada, through the United 
States, to file a refugee status claim.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that a third of the 20,000 or so refugee 
claimants go through the United States. The level of refugee 
protection offered by our neighbours to the South is considerably 
lower than in Canada.
<P>
	This about-face by the Liberals is incomprehensible and 
unjustified. The minister's predecessor, now the environment 
minister, said in November 1993, just after being appointed to the 
cabinet:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``But any agreement for me would have to pass the test that the 
agreement is on a level playing field that respects our standards''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the first member of Latin American origin elected to this 
House, I am very concerned about the impact this agreement could 
have. In practical terms, persecuted people in Central and South 
America will not be able to come here and ask for Canada's 
protection. There are hardly any direct flights between Latin 
America and Canada.
<P>
	I ask the government to give up and to purely and simply forget 
this draft agreement.
<P>
	Finally, I ask the minister to grant permanent residency in 
Canada to Victor Regalado, a Salvadorian refugee who has been 
living here for 13 years now without any status, who works here 
and who, with his spouse, a Canadian citizen, has had two children, 
born in Quebec.
<P>
	The minister should settle this case as quickly as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member put his question as an extension of a question to the 
minister with respect to the Tassé report and the issue of why it 
refers to them.
<P>
	However, the member spent most of his time talking about all 
kinds of allegations and suggestions of irregularities, in addition to 
talking about business that is in front of the committee, as the hon. 
member very well knows since he is a member of that committee. 
He knows full well that the report is not yet finished and has not  
been tabled in this House. Therefore, it is rather difficult to be 
debating something that is not here nor part of this House's agenda. 
He then brings up individual cases which again are not things one 
should get into.
<P>
	I am going to discuss for a few minutes the hon. member's 
question to the minister in the House which is for what I believe 
this period is intended. It goes back to the hon. member's concerns, 
allegations and suggestions about bribes.
<P>
	The fact is that where there has been sufficient information to 
identify a case we have initiated an investigation. We cannot do 
those kinds of things based on general allegations.
<P>
	The government agrees that the immigration enforcement 
program must be carried out with a high standard of 
professionalism, respect for the person and within the law. That is 
something this government is very committed to. This is why the 
recommendations contained in Mr. Tassé's report are being given 
very serious consideration as we renew and revitalize the 
enforcement function.
<P>
	As I said the last time we dealt with this issue, any instance of 
substantial illegal or improper behaviour is investigated and acted 
on by a departmental official. However, one cannot do an 
investigation just on the basis of allegations. One has to have some 
proof. This is why when the Tassé report was released, the deputy 
minister invited anyone with documented allegations of 
misconduct to come forward. CIC regional directors general will 
investigate and appropriately deal with any matter which does 
come forward, as we have said before.
<P>
	As I have said before, nowhere in the Tassé report is there 
mention of bribes of officials or of anyone else. As a matter of fact, 
the Tassé report mentions a great many things but not those kinds 
of things.
<P>
	I would like to talk about some of the very good things which are 
in the report.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the parliamentary 
secretary's time has now expired.
<P>
	The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. 
tomorrow.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.44 p.m.)
