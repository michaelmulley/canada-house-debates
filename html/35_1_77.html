moved for leave to introduce Bill C-254, an act to amend the 
Interpretation Act (convention on the rights of the child).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I have a few comments to accompany 
what is essentially the introduction of a children's bill of rights. 
This bill would require the Government of Canada to interpret 
all legislation in harmony with the UN declaration on the rights 
of the child which Canada was instrumental in engineering and 
has already signed.
<P>
	We will remember that the House unanimously voted in 1989 
to end child poverty by the year 2000. Since that time child 
poverty has increased. We will remember the UN declaration on 
the rights of the child. This bill will ensure that Canada will 
enforce the concept that Canadian children be free from 
exploitation and abuse, that government action should be 
interpreted with regard to children in the best interests of the 
child, that children should have access to child care, health care 
and a standard of living that at minimum meets basic needs, and 
that disabled children should receive the same level of dignity 
and opportunities as other children.
<P>
	It is important if we are going to put words into action to 
ensure that commitments Canada has made on behalf of its 
children are enforced by the government. At the moment this is 
sadly not the case. The position of Canadian children is getting 
worse.
<P>
	I hope that along with my colleagues from Yukon, from 
Burnaby-Kingsway, from Kamloops and also from 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, who all indicated their support for this 
bill, we will see some action in this regard.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the federal government's ineffective regional 
development interventions, which create overlappings and inconsistencies, 
resulting in administrative chaos that hampers regional economic growth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, opening this supply day on regional 
development is for me a very important opportunity. For some 
Quebecers, their sovereignist commitment comes from the 
desire to maintain the French fact in Quebec, but personally, my 
convictions flow mainly from the general uneasiness prevalent 
in all regions of Quebec, because the inefficiencies of the 
present system prevent it from responding adequately to 
regional development needs.
<P>
	This observation of mine was also made by numerous 
Quebecers, especially during the hearings of the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission. As it travelled the various 
regions of Quebec, it came to the unanimous conclusion that the 
regions had to have control over their own development, and in 
order to do that the existing structures had to be called into 
question.
<P>
	Let us review quickly the history of the federal government's 
involvement in regional development. In the 1960s and 1970s, 
the federal government realized that its programs were hard to 
access and it decided to improve the situation. It created the 
Department of Regional Industrial Expansion which was 
quickly discredited due to the lack of regional participation in 
project development and to the dominance of departmental 
concerns. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of 
Fisheries and others were still acting in an uncoordinated 
manner.
<P>
	This prompted the federal government to try something new: 
regional development agencies. One was created for Quebec, 
another one for Atlantic Canada and a third for the West.
<P>
	Due to these regional agencies, federal government 
interventions have been rather haphazard. Cases in point are the 
Federal Office of Regional Development, the Federal Business 
Development Bank, the interventions of Employment and 
Immigration through the Community Futures Committees and 
the Business Development Centres.
<P>
	All these interventions were made in good faith, but since 
they were not coordinated, they produced limited economic 
development and there was absolutely no coordination among 
stakeholders in various sectors, which led to major errors such 
as investing in the wrong sectors.
<P>
	I will give you an example of this. In my riding of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, they poured money into a new 
armoury.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4735"> 4735 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	I suppose that people in the Reserve are very happy to have an 
armoury now, but I doubt that it was a priority for my 
constituents, at a time when we were desperately in need of 
money to develop Gros-Cacouna harbour.
<P>
	Departments take initiatives, in their own sector, without any 
regard for regional priorities.
<P>
	In the past few months, since the Liberal government came 
into office, the Federal Office of Regional Development has 
taken a back seat to the Department of Industry. Before the 
previous Conservative government, the Department of Industry 
used to intervene in Quebec. But in view of its lack of efficiency, 
it was decided to set up regional development agencies, which 
was equivalent to performing by-pass surgery on a heart patient 
to make sure that his blood kept on circulating. Now, the Liberal 
government is limiting the FORD's mandate and cutting its 
budget in such a way that we are back to a very centralized 
approach which is totally inadequate to meet regional 
development needs.
<P>
	What kind of message is the government sending to the 
regions when in its budget, it cuts funding to the regional 
development agencies to the tune of $13 million in the 
Maritimes, $70 million in Quebec, and $90 million in western 
Canada over three years? In Quebec alone, this will lead to cuts 
in FORD regional development assistance, in the amount of $14 
million in 1994-95, $32 million in 1995-96, and $24 million in 
1996-97. This is a strange way to care for the patient. They have 
decided to choke him to death, as clearly indicated by these 
figures. In april 1994 for example, the official unemployment 
rate was 27 per cent in the region of 
Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine; 17 per cent in the Lower St. 
Lawrence; 15 per cent in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean; 16 per 
cent in Laurentides; 12 per cent in Mauricie-Bois-Francs and 
15 per cent in Lanaudière.
<P>
	Those are very clear indications that the government's action 
has not produced the expected results in spite of all the money 
they spent on the problem. There is a flaw somewhere that 
makes it fail. We have to ask why. What are the causes of such a 
situation?
<P>
	The first cause I can see is that jurisdiction over regional 
development is not specified in the Canadian Constitution. 
Therefore the federal government, because it had spending 
power, seized the opportunity to increase its visibility and its 
influence over the electorate; at the same time, the provincial 
government thought it should act because it had jurisdiction 
over land use planning and found it important to control, at least 
partly, regional development. That sterile war, that futile 
competition, I would even say that unhealthy competition 
between governments, aside from guaranteeing visibility to 
politicians, only resulted in choking the regions. Such wars 
between governments can only produce negative impacts.
<P>
	I would like to mention another example. In the area of 
fisheries in Quebec there were jurisdictional wars  between 
governments, wars to determine who would take relevant 
measures. We can see the results of that today; we ended up with 
a complete moratorium on groundfish fishing. It is due among 
other things to the lack of concerted action on the part of 
governments competing with each other.
<P>
	The ineffectiveness of the federal government's interventions 
could be attributed also to the fact that its initiatives are 
haphazard. Here are a few examples. On the one hand, it creates 
community futures committees which are locally based and help 
members of the community help themselves. I think it was a 
very interesting initiative in itself. But on the other hand, it 
closes post offices. Canada Post Corporation, also subject to 
spending cuts, has decided for its part to close a number of post 
offices in order to increase its productivity. So, it wants to help 
communities take control of their future but it takes away from 
them one of the tools they would need to do so. It is an illogical 
situation which must be denounced.
<P>
	Another example is the decision to create business 
development centres. It says to the regions: ``We are going to 
give you borrowing power and allow you to obtain the capital 
you need in order to use your entrepreneurial spirit'', but at the 
same time, it is systematically dismantling the railway system. 
You may well ask me what is the relationship between the two.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Even if we give tons of money to the regions, if we do not 
maintain at least the development infrastructures already in 
place, we are wasting our time and our money.
<P>
	The third example I want to give is the Eastern Quebec 
Development Plan versus the decision to close the CBC stations 
in the region. The purpose of this plan is to ensure that local 
communities whose livelihood depends on forest development 
have a bright future and are able to develop their territory, and to 
make sure that these communities are viable and enjoy a good 
quality of life. However, we also deny these communities the 
right to express themselves, to talk with one another by 
dismantling their regional communication network. That is 
another example of conflicting and unseemly action between the 
different tentacles of the federal octopus, if I may.
<P>
	Finally, the federal government also acted inefficiently in its 
parallel interventions with other governments. On the one hand, 
in Quebec, a provincial structure was quietly setting up regional 
development councils, which evolved in regional consultation 
and development councils. These councils developed strategic 
plans for every region. All concerned parties in the region were 
consulted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4736"> 4736 </A></B>
<P>
	At the same time, the federal government was creating 
another structure, the Federal Office of Regional Development. 
It was an act of good will intended to inject some money into the 
regions, but it also set up other consultation committees which, 
for years, operated side by side with the regional development 
office. Such a structure does not allow for efficient economic 
management. No coordinated tangible results can be achieved 
this way since there is no structural relationship between these 
organizations. Regions want to stop wasting their energy trying 
to convince governments to act in accordance with their own 
strategic plans. Up to now the federal government has shown no 
sign of being aware of the regions' demands and of trying to be 
flexible enough to meet them.
<P>
	The Gaspé Peninsula and the Lower St. Lawrence regional 
consultation and development councils mentioned tourism as 
one of their top priorities in terms of development. This year, 
one of the first things the Minister responsible for the Federal 
Office of Regional Development announced in the budget 
speech was that no more money would be allocated for bicycle 
paths. Tourism development is, therefore, a priority of the 
regions and the message they are getting from the party opposite 
is that the money earmarked for these priorities is being cut. To 
my mind, this is unacceptable.
<P>
	Still another reason for the ongoing ineffectiveness of the 
federal government's action is the paralysis of sectoral 
departments. Let me give you an example. A number of years 
ago, a wharf was built in Trois-Pistoles to provide adequate 
facilities for fishermen. Over the years, the reason for the 
wharf's existence has changed. Today, the region feels that this 
wharf could play an important role in terms of tourism and 
regional development. It is an important link for the ferry 
between Trois-Pistoles and Les Escoumins and it needs to be 
upgraded. Wharf maintenance comes under federal jurisdiction, 
but we get the feeling that the more the federal government 
spends money on areas which are not necessarily its 
responsibility, the more it neglects to spend in areas for which it 
does have primary responsibility. In this instance, it has refused 
to spend money to renovate wharves. It seems to have forgotten 
about the river for the past 25 or 30 years.
<P>
	When a member tries to navigate through this maze, he finds 
that he must go knocking on the doors of such departments as 
Fisheries and Oceans and Transport. However, development 
priorities of the officials working in these departments are tied 
to the department's mandate whereas the future of the wharf 
should not be tied to regional development objectives, but rather 
to tourism. Existing structures are not flexible enough to 
respond to changing times and to allow the local community to 
take charge of its destiny and make the necessary adjustments. 
Federal sectoral departments are too cumbersome and prevent 
individual regions from having their needs met.
<P>
	This is a rather odd message to be sending out to the regions 
that want to take their future into their own hands and to 
municipalities like Trois-Pistoles which has expressed an 
interest in purchasing the wharf, provided it can be properly 
renovated. They are at a loss as to where to find someone whose 
primary concern is regional development, not simply the 
fulfilment of a sectoral mandate. Another example of the federal 
government's failure to focus on its traditional areas of 
jurisdiction is the lack of vision of pan-Canadian corporations 
in so far as the role of regional development is concerned.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Consider, for example, VIA Rail and the Canada Post 
Corporation. For a number of years now, VIA's policy has been 
to abandon rail lines and eliminate passenger rail services in 
order to save money. Local communities have been telling VIA 
Rail that the train is not only a means of transportation for local 
commuters, but it can also serve a wide range of purposes.
<P>
	This fact was demonstrated most strikingly during the recent 
public hearings held by Rural Dignity in the Gaspesian 
Peninsula, when over 50 participants demonstrated that the train 
serving their region plays a major role in the tourist industry. An 
article was even written and published in 60 American papers, 
saying that this train really had special value; it could easily be 
made profitable, if marketed properly.
<P>
	It is not within VIA Rail's mandate to promote regional 
development in Quebec and Canada. It was established by 
Cabinet to meet the demands of Cabinet. It would seem however 
that Cabinet never gave VIA any responsibilities with respect to 
regional development, judging from all the drastic cuts that 
were made. The Liberal caucus denounced these cuts in 1989 in 
a quality report listing all that should be done, but now that the 
Liberal Party is in power, it has laid this report aside. All we 
have to do, really, is dig this report up, update it a little and tell 
the people from the Liberal Party: ``Now, carry out what you had 
committed to do in this report''.
<P>
	Let me give you another example of a Crown corporation with 
no regional responsibilities: Canada Post. The Canada Post 
Corporation was so successful in fulfilling its expenditure 
reduction mandate, it has stretched the elastic so much that it 
eventually snapped. This government did fulfil one 
commitment: it has put a moratorium on post office closures. 
But Canada Post itself, within its organization under its board of 
directors, has no regional development responsibilities. Its only 
responsibility is to make postal services profitable, and in so 
doing it may not take the wishes of the regions into 
consideration. This is obvious in its day-to-day operations, in 
every community.
<P>
	I think that the federal government should ensure regional 
representation on the board of Canada Post and consideration of 
the economic, social and cultural impact in its decision making. 
I do not think that it is a problem of personalities or people at 
any level, be they federal or  provincial officials or 
politicians--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4737"> 4737 </A></B>
<P>
and the people of eastern Quebec sent a very clear message on 
that. In last fall's election, the Liberal Party had a good 
candidate in Matane, who according to the old tradition said: ``If 
I am elected, I want to be a minister in that government and that 
will give the region all it needs for its development''. The people 
flatly turned down that approach which has been used for 25 
years.
<P>
	Saviours from outside and heroes who will make development 
happen are no longer the way to go. We have strategic planning 
and ways to take charge in our regions and I think that the 
message rural Quebec gave the federal government is this: ``We 
do not want any more fleeting, flash-in-the-pan heroes. We 
want people who will work steadily and make structural changes 
so that the regions can develop''.
<P>
	Given the awful unemployment, exodus of young people, 
aging population and abandoned land, I think that the solutions 
must be drastic and sweeping. Whether in a federal system or a 
sovereign Quebec, it will be important in the short term to 
recognize the driving role of the regions. The organizations 
which arose from people's desire to take control of their own 
lives, like Rural Solidarity, Rural Emergency Coalition, Rural 
Dignity and the Ralliement of Gaspesians and Magdalen 
Islanders, want to ensure that their communities will live, and I 
think that what governments do should reflect that.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	To do so, we must give the envelopes back to the regions. 
Regions must have full control over their envelopes. I will give 
you an example: the $200 million budget of the Federal Office of 
Regional Development could be decentralized by region so that, 
in terms of strategic planning for every region of Quebec, the 
$200 million allocated for all of Quebec could be replaced with 
regional envelopes; every region would then get an extra $10 
million or so to spend on its own development.
<P>
	Sectorial departments should also subordinate their action to 
regional priorities. We must ask the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans and the Department of Transport whether their 
operations have a positive impact on regional development. Will 
the new, clarified air transport taxes hinder or promote regional 
development? We must take such actions. We must also assign a 
regional development mandate to Canadian corporations such as 
VIA Rail and Canada Post, just like the examples I gave earlier.
<P>
	I myself think that the position taken by many 
Quebecers-and it is partly at the heart of our mandate-is that 
what has been done in the last 20 years have convinced 
Quebecers that our economic problems can be solved through 
sovereignty and decentralization. It is important that we have 
control over our own development and that the $28 billion in 
taxes that we pay to the federal government can be transferred to 
the regions so that these taxes can have a major economic  
impact and give the regions control over their own development.
<P>
	If you are wondering why the Bloc Quebecois candidates were 
elected, here is an explanation: to denounce a system that does 
not work, to effect deep changes and to respond to the Prime 
Minister when he says that, to solve economic problems, he does 
not want to talk about sovereignty. In fact, our economic 
problems can be solved through a complete redistribution of 
powers, through decentralization. Our problem is one of 
architecture, of plumbing even, and that is why regional 
development is a major reason to achieve Quebec sovereignty.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not in any way, shape or form 
agree with the member's comments here today.
<P>
	I was elected to the Parliament of Canada in 1988 because I 
opposed the Meech Lake accord. I opposed it for three or four 
specific reasons, one of which was that I believe the only way to 
look after the disadvantaged regions is by having a strong 
national government.
<P>
	I believe that the argument the members of the Bloc are 
putting forward here today reinforces the position I took in 
1988. What they have been saying through their remarks today 
is: ``Decentralize, decentralize. Give us all the money to look 
after the regional development problems. Then we will just 
separate and go our own way''. What kind of logic is that?
<P>
	If you are interested in city politics you run municipally. If 
you are interested in provincial politics you run provincially. 
However, when you are elected to the Parliament of Canada you 
come here to build and promote economic strength in the 
country.
<P>
	Why would we support a motion in this House today which 
promotes dismembering the country?
<P>
	The member mentioned in his speech the importance of 
tourism. I support the fact that we must be much more 
aggressive in marketing tourism in this country. I believe most 
members would support that. One of the difficulties is that we 
are saddled with a very difficult fiscal framework. We are 
saddled with instability. Our economic numbers are not as great 
as they should be because the Bloc is sending out negative 
signals which are hurting the very objectives it is trying to 
achieve.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member's premise has no logic. History will show 
that the best economies that we have had in the history of the 
country, and the best economy ever in Quebec was when we had 
a strong national government.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find those words extremely indicative of the current 
unease in Canada, very indicative indeed.
<P>
	The Liberal Party says that a strong central government will 
solve the problem. It would have us believe that good ideas only 
come from Ottawa and, if Liberals decide everything, Canada 
will withstand any crisis.
<P>
	But, this argument does not wash. Given the current situation, 
the 30 per cent unemployment and the 50-per-cent jobless rate 
in the Gaspe Peninsula, can we truly say that the system is 
working?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I just heard the hon. member 
comment that it is our fault. But, for the past ten years, who has

sovereigntists?

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> The federalists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête: </B>Whether in a federal or a sovereign environment, 
if the federal government maintains its current centralizing 
position, each time such a comment is made, each time such a 
measure is taken, more arguments in favour of sovereignty are 
being given to Quebecers.

I find it a kind of a paradox listening to this this morning. 
Recently a member of the Bloc Quebecois came to my riding in 
British Columbia. While he was there I had a chance to hear a lot 
of their policies. I thought it was really interesting because a lot 
of their ideas are not that different from mine.
<P>
	In fact in identifying the problem and identifying the cause of 
the problem federally we were very much in agreement. Where 
we came to a difference was in the solution. It sounds like we are 
in much the same situation here this morning.
<P>
	We believe that regional development grants are not working 
well, that it is not a good way to redistribute the wealth of the 
country. The Bloc have talked about the failure of a system. We 
agree with that too but where we come to a difference again is in 
the solution.
<P>
	Because regional development grants do not work the Bloc 
feels that this is a reason to separate. We suggest this is a reason 
to come to Ottawa and change the system and that is our purpose 
in being here.
<P>
	Interprovincial trade barriers are also something that cost the 
individual provinces a tremendous amount of money and that is 
in the provincial hands. The amounts of the grants that go to the 
Atlantic region were mentioned. Interprovincial trade barriers 
cost the Atlantic region more than the total value of their  
regional development grants. So there are solutions in the hands 
of the Quebec government at this time.
<P>
	They talked of the VIA Rail system and how there has to be 
more subsidies or the continuation of subsidies in order to 
enhance tourism and passenger travel. In British Columbia VIA 
Rail tried to operate a system that was largely tourist oriented. 
Even though it was hugely subsidized it lost its shirt. Private 
enterprise stepped in and without any subsidies whatsoever is 
now turning a nice profit and causing a tremendous boon for the 
various regions of British Columbia that it travels in without, as 
I said, any subsidy whatsoever.
<P>
	There are any number of things that we can talk about such as 
the post office. I suggest to the Bloc that a solution to part of the 
problems in terms of keeping some of the money at home would 
be to deal with some of the internal problems of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	With regard to the regional development grants, we support 
the idea that we need a lot of these things that become in part 
patronage. Regional development grants do on occasion work. I 
am not suggesting that every time they are used they are a total 
failure.
<P>
	However, the federal government has to stop wasting so much 
money. The only way it will get its deficit under control is if it 
spends less, pure and simple. This is an area where it can cut the 
spending. It could then stop taking that money from the 
individual provinces and they would be more viable.
<P>
	I would ask the Bloc if it has a solution that does not involve 
separation. We certainly do. We think that is the direction it 
should be going in. Give us a solution not an enhancement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I get of lot of sympathy from this 
comment and I want to tell the hon. member that we have been 
trying to change the system for 125 years, and particularly in the 
last 35 years.
<P>
	First, we once gave 74 out of 75 seats to the Liberals, with 
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau at the helm, and even with that 
representation, Quebec was not able to get what it needed.
<P>
	Then, we relied on the Conservatives to regain, with dignity, 
our place within the Confederation, and that was also denied to 
us. We are now at the point where Quebecers feel that a 
structural change is needed. We are told that cuts, among other 
measures, are required to make real savings.
<P>
	Take manpower training, a field in which Quebec and Canada 
together waste $250 million every year. If this $250 million was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4739"> 4739 </A></B>
<P>
available for development, there is a good chance we would not 
have to rely on government initiatives: We would be able to 
promote our own development in other ways.
<P>
	The hon. member asks if there are other solutions, but 
sovereignty means that you pass your own legislation, levy your 
own taxes and conclude all your own treaties concerning 
Quebec's future. If federal legislation and taxes had ensured that 
Quebec got what it needed for its development, and if the federal 
government had been successful in getting what we wanted 
when it signed international treaties, we would stay.
<P>
	However, the current structure has not given any such results, 
and it is particularly noticeable in the case of regional 
development. I might add that where I come from we have made 
a habit-and this may be another difference-of letting people 
who have the right to speak to do just that. It is much more 
practical to do so.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The period for questions and 
comments has now expired. Is there unanimous consent to 
continue for five more minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I therefore give the floor to the hon. 
member for Kamouraska-I mean Madawaska-Victoria.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais 
(Madawaska-Victoria):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is all right, 
Kamouraska and Madawaska are quite close to each other.
<P>
	I think it is very appropriate that a Reform member would 
indicate today to this House that he is on the same wavelength as 
the Bloc and that his party shares the same vision as the Bloc 
partisans about the problems we face and the solution they 
advocate.
<P>
	I also want to mention to the hon. member who put forward 
this motion, in which he expressed his concern about 
overlappings and inconsistencies in the regional economic 
development policies, that we have indeed seen in the past, and 
particularly in the last few years, a proliferation of programs 
with no realistic goals.
<P>
	The hon. member has a point there. However, I want to point 
out to him that, in the last six months, the Liberal government 
has put forth its vision and its action plan. The hon. member 
must recognize the value of the infrastructure program which 
currently involves all levels of government: municipal, 
provincial as well as federal.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The infrastructure program implemented by the Liberal 
government these last few months gives you a concrete example 
of how this government intends to run the country. Nobody can 
say that the infrastructure program we just created is 
inconsistent and does not take into account the needs of the 
provinces and the communities, because there would be no 
national infrastructure program if communities had not 
submitted proposals approved by the provincial as well as by the 
federal authorities.
<P>
	So, I believe that the Liberals in this House have, in fact, 
shown the leadership both Canada and Quebec need at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the infrastructure program mentioned by the hon. 
member is an excellent example. It is a good idea to provide our 
communities and regions with the adequate equipment but, 
when it comes to the Kamouraska sewer system-for which we 
got a very good investment in the infrastructure program; in any 
case, it is a good thing that the regional development critic could 
get it, since it proves that we can also have the true 
power-should we need the authorization of all levels of 
government, municipal, provincial as well as federal, to decide 
if this hamlet of 500 people needs a sewer system?
<P>
	This program was said to be interesting but it is quite 
inadequate regarding job creation. To me, what has much more 
of an impact now is the decision to increase the number of weeks 
of insurable employment while reducing the number of weeks of 
unemployment insurance benefit. This will cut 1.3 billion 
dollars in the Maritimes and in Quebec. As you will see, the 
economic impact will be even greater.
<P>
	Measures might have been taken, in Bill C-17 for example, to 
immediately roll back to $3 the contribution of the small- and 
medium-sized businesses or to provide for the small businesses 
to pay less and for the larger ones to pay more. Agreed, this 
would have insured less political visibility, but the economic 
impact would have been even greater and respectful of the local 
people's entrepreneurship.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think that the 5 minute question 
period is over.
<P>
	You want to ask a question of an hon. member from your own 
party. I would rather avoid this.
<P>
	Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, since we deviated a 
bit from the normal process by allowing the Liberal Party to take 
more time than usual, I hope that hon. members will be given 
enough time to make their comments in a few moments.
<P>
	Since the Liberals were given a five-minute extension, I 
would like the same extension to be given to the opposition for 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Gaspé did not get 
my point when I said that the five-minute period was over. 
Unanimous consent was given for the five minutes.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development, on 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to this 
debate carefully. It reminds me that just last week the United 
Nations development agency, which annually does a survey of 
the quality of life among all the countries of the world, 
concluded that once again Canadians have within this country 
the best, the most tolerant and the most generous system of any 
country in the world.
<P>
	There is a reason for that. It is because throughout our history 
as a country we have learned to share. We have brought forward 
a number of programs in health care and social assistance, 
education and training to ensure there would be some basis of 
standards across the country, that there would not be large 
disparities and that people would feel they were being equally 
treated.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	That fundamental reality seems to have escaped the hon. 
member who has presented this resolution. In fact the benefits 
his and my constituents have been able to enjoy are because we 
live in a country of wide diversity and wide differences of 
interest, but we have been willing to share. We have been willing 
to work and live together to produce a country which has good 
economic and human values.
<P>
	Maybe the unfortunate part of what has happened since the 
last election is that there is now within the House of Commons 
an Official Opposition which does not recognize or even accept 
that fundamental achievement Canadians have been able to 
bring about over the some 130 years of our country's existence. 
Bloc members look only from the point of view of one, narrow, 
limited, regional perspective. They have no sense of what this 
country has been able to do.
<P>
	As a result, they have totally and completely 
forgotten-conveniently, I would suggest-just how important 
federalism has been to ensure that the poorer regions of the 
country are given a real chance. In the early 1980s we wrote into 
the charter of rights the principle of regional equality. We are 
probably the only country in the world that has put that in as a 
basis of its Constitution. We have lived up to that time and time 
again with attempts, not perfect, but attempts to ensure that was 
lived out in practice.
<P>
	I am surprised the hon. member in talking about regional 
economic development somehow conveniently forgot that one 
of the first acts of the Minister of Finance in this new 
government was to substantially change the formula for 
equalization to ensure that those wealthier areas of Canada 
would share more of their wealth with the poorer areas.
<P>
	The hon. member's province was a major beneficiary of that 
program, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. No one 
was carping or criticizing or saying: ``We reject it''. The fact is 
we brought in a program to ensure there would be equal 
treatment across the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I submit that that is a good example of how Canadian 
federalism is a good way to share efforts and goods among all 
Canadians. Unfortunately, the hon. member refuses to recognize 
the value of federalism as a way to share good-will in this 
country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me give another example. The hon. member talked about 
unemployment insurance. I presume he is aware that last year 
the net transfer to the province of Quebec, in the UI system, was 
close to $1 billion from the rest of the country to aid those who 
were facing unemployment in Quebec. It was even of higher 
value than that of the Atlantic provinces or northern Ontario. 
Nobody is criticizing. In fact we say that is the way the system is 
supposed to work. I find it incredible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is unbelievable that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. 
Bouchard-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-is the one, as my colleague has said, who is going around 
upsetting the economy and talking about annexation of western 
Canada by the Americans. He is the one who is fragmenting, 
destroying and dividing the country. He is the one who is 
destroying the idea of equal sharing.
<P>
	When the hon. member gets down from the pink cloud he has 
been living on for so long and comes back to reality, why does he 
not tell us how those transfer payments of equalization, 
unemployment insurance, the Canada Health Act, pension plans 
and student loans would be financed solely by that one province 
under its own resources when in fact it faces major debts?
<P>
	Federalism has worked because we do not see each other in 
fragmentary bits and pieces, region by region. We see ourselves 
as one country. We realize if we can build the strength of all 
regions, we all benefit. That is why we have been prepared to 
share. That is the tragedy. The foolishness and silliness of what 
is going on today is that those members live in a dream world 
thinking that somehow everything would be better if only 
Quebec would separate. The hard economic reality is that is not 
true.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4741"> 4741 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	At some point there will be a reality check and I know where it 
will come from. The people in Quebec will make the very clear 
statement that it is all right for members of the Parti Quebecois 
and the Bloc Quebecois to live in a dream world, but they 
understand the realities of a job and support for their families. 
They understand the decent idea that we can share across this 
country and all benefit from it, not by separating or fragmenting 
the country. That is the reality.
<P>
	In our present system there are many ways in which we can aid 
and assist various regions to develop. The basic transfers I have 
just talked about are a key element of that, but we also have to 
undertake the kind of support for direct intervention, for direct 
development.
<P>
	I listened with some interest to my friends from the Reform 
Party who said they do not like regional development policies 
either and get rid of them all. I heard the member who said get 
rid of them all.
<P>
	Let me just speak for a moment about western Canada. I am 
responsible for the program on western diversification. Over the 
last several years about 40,000 to 50,000 jobs have been created 
in western Canada as a result of the direct support of western 
diversification. We are trying to take an economy that is living 
in the broad global context and give it boosts in technologies. I 
will give an example.
<P>
	We have just completed a revamping of our programs so that 
we can aid smaller business. We will give repayable 
contributions only to those enterprises with less than 50 
employees. It means those very small businesses, which today, 
as the hon. member knows, have serious trouble getting equity 
financing or credit from banks or other financial institutions, are 
being given assistance by the federal government. They will be 
able to expand plants, buy new technology, develop a new 
marketing structure and hire people so that they can compete 
just as well as the big guys.
<P>
	Now there is another party saying to get rid of that program 
for small business support and assistance. Yet we know that 
about 80 per cent of the jobs will be created by small businesses 
with the kind of assistance they need.
<P>
	I want to talk about western Canada because unfortunately the 
hon. member who talked about regional development only 
talked about one region. This debate deserves a somewhat 
broader context than that, because we are talking about Canada 
and all its regions. Let me give one working example which 
illustrates what I mean about how important it is not to deny 
small business the kind of assistance we can supply through our 
regional agencies.
<P>
	Through our efforts we were able to form a consortium of 150 
small food processing companies in western Canada. We 
analysed that in terms of the export market into the United 
States only 3 per cent of imported foodstuffs on American 
supermarket shelves  were Canadian, even though we are their 
next door neighbour. One of the reasons is that much of our food 
processing in western Canada is small. We do not have the big 
Westons and others; we have smaller firms.
<P>
	As the hon. member should know, a whole new series of 
quality tests and nutritional tests have to be met in order to 
export. A wide variety of standards have to be met in the United 
States, Japan and other places. Companies with 15 or 20 
employees making something out of a grain product or a dairy 
product do not have the extra cash to mount that kind of research 
and development and do the testing.
<P>
	We have encouraged those 150 companies to come together 
under the name Food Beverage Canada. We have appropriated 
the name Canada for western Canada but that is always done in 
Ontario anyway. The support supplied to that association 
enables them to undertake marketing, promotion and research 
testing. Those 150 companies can now begin to export into the 
United States on a much more rational and effective basis. Once 
again, it is another example of sharing.
<P>
	It is the same thing with the Beef Export Federation where it 
was trying to develop a market niche in Japan. The hon. member 
knows that people in the western Canada beef industry are the 
ultimate representatives of free enterprise; they do not want 
government assistance. However, that association asked us if we 
would work with it and help develop a major market in Japan. 
That market has increased by 10, 15 or 20 per cent per year as a 
result of intervention by a regional development agency 
sponsored by the federal Government of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They could have done it on their own.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
listen to that. We now have another voice of reform saying: 
``They could have done it on their own''.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that they could not do it on their own. 
They very clearly said that it was not within the cash flow 
position of the companies to develop longer staying power in a 
new market or to be there for a year or two to develop networks, 
develop products and get promotion going. Therefore they came 
together and said: ``Give us a little help''.
<P>
	It has been a good investment because the money is being 
repaid. Last year we recovered $30 million through western 
diversification of the contributions we made.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We are putting people to work too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Yes, we are 
putting people to work. We are sending out flyers and we have 
people working in western Canada. If the Reform Party had its 
way it would still be selling pork chops and beef steaks only to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4742"> 4742 </A></B>
<P>
Calgary and not to Osaka. It is a global marketplace and I wish 
the Reform Party would wake up to that fact.
<P>
	There are areas where there clearly can be substantial changes 
and improvements. We have only been a government for six 
months and I will tell the House what we have done in that six 
months. The hon. member might like to know about this because 
clearly from his speech he does not have the full facts at his 
disposal.
<P>
	We are beginning to work in each province with the 
development of single window delivery systems, both for the 
delivery of manpower programs and business service programs. 
We are setting up combined, integrated programs to bring 
together all federal departments and to provide single window 
delivery to save money. We are doing the same in the area of 
training.
<P>
	Let me use this opportunity to clarify something. I want to be 
helpful; I really do. It is my great interest to try to help inform 
the Bloc Quebecois about reality. One myth it constantly puts 
forward in the House, and I have heard it several times, is that 
there is a $250 million waste on duplication in manpower 
training.
<P>
	Do those members know where the figure came from? Do they 
have any idea? Maybe they read it in a newspaper. Do they know 
where the figure came from? I will tell them. We have analysed 
it very carefully.
<P>
	It was not based on an examination of Canada. They said that 
overall in all 18 countries the average administrative cost was 
about 5 per cent or 6 per cent. Then someone said that it was 8 
per cent in Quebec and therefore that must mean it is $250 
million. That was based purely on the broadest concept. We 
said: ``Let us go back and look at the figures''. At the federal 
level we deliver our programs at less than 5 per cent in the 
province of Quebec, not at 7 or 8 per cent, which is one of the 
lowest figures of OECD countries.
<P>
	Would they get confused by the facts? Should they not base 
their arguments on something that is real? They would prefer to 
live in cuckooland where everything is based on what we want to 
believe. They are the ultimate Alice in Wonderland party of ``let 
us create a world of our own making and then say it is true, that it 
is real''. Then they live in it.
<P>
	The media in the last couple of weeks talked about 
annexations. The member does not belong in politics, he 
belongs in science fiction novels. I think he is missing his 
calling. I think he is a wasted talent. He should be writing 
children's fantasy books or science fiction novels. For goodness 
sake, he should deal with the reality of how the country works.
<P>
	I am quite happy, as I have said throughout, to sit down and 
work effectively on what we can do as a country to eliminate 
duplication.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry is working today on a plan to bring 
down interprovincial trade barriers. If there is any example of 
how to create real wealth in every region of the country, it is by 
bringing down the barriers to trade, regulation and manpower 
mobility. Who is doing it? The federal government is taking the 
leadership, not the individual provinces.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	If the hon. member wants to create real wealth for his region, 
he should stand on his feet and say that he disavows separatist 
positions, that he will go to work to bring down the barriers 
among all provinces, and that is how to create real wealth and 
real jobs for the people in his region.
<P>
	That is a real form of regional economic development, not 
creating more fragmentation, not dividing the country into 
further small pieces with higher walls. A much broader level 
playing field should be provided so that we can create a full 
discourse of commerce, people, capital resources and ideas.
<P>
	We are living in a world where we need a critical mass of 
people and capital. The member is showing me some kind of 
book. I am pleased to know he can read. I appreciate his 
opportunities, but what does it have to do with the debate? He is 
showing us a story in a book called <I>Global Paradox</I> by John 
Naisbitt who is one heck of a good American analyst. I am 
talking about what is happening in Canada, not what the 
Americans say. That is what I am talking about.
<P>
	The sooner members of the Bloc Quebecois stop reading the 
far out speculations of American commentators and get down to 
the hard reality of what is happening in Canada, the sooner they 
might change their position and their views.
<P>
	All I can say to the hon. member is that I fully share the 
concerns.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I share their concern about unemployment and, like them, I 
recognize the need for a solid policy to increase employment in 
the area. But at the same time, we must admit that the best way to 
contribute to regional development is to develop co-operation 
among all levels of government, municipal, provincial and 
federal, great co-operation and to implement one-stop shopping 
for government services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is the way to approach it. We will be dedicating our full 
resources as a government to work at the regional level on 
specific programs with provinces, to ensure that all works of our 
different departments and ministries at a national level are 
dedicated to creating work throughout Canada, and at the same 
time try to ensure the maintenance of full financial equalization 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4743"> 4743 </A></B>
<P>
and sharing throughout the country so that we can all live, as the 
United Nations says, as the best country in the world.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development said that he was happy to know 
that I could read. I want to tell him that I have a bachelor's 
degree in administration from Laval University. I also studied in 
English at UBC, in Vancouver, because I have an open mind and 
I would never make this kind of accusation. I am perfectly able 
to participate in debates on real issues, not on petty statements.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe it is a 
minister who just spoke, and I hope all ministers in this 
government are not the same. However, I would like to say that I 
am glad it is this minister who spoke this morning because he 
represents the kind of federalism Quebecers reject. This 
minister was there at the time of Prime Minister Trudeau. This 
minister was there when Quebec suffered all those rejections.
<P>
	I will try to lower my voice, Mr. Speaker, because it irritates 
my friends across the way to hear the truth. The first thing I wish 
to say, and I noted two or three points, of which the minister 
should also take note, because you must not forget that this 
morning Quebecers are watching you, Mr. Minister, and they 
now see what the Canada you represent is really like.
<P>
	A little while ago, you said that the figures on manpower 
training were not right, etc. I would like to remind the minister 
that it is Mr. Bourbeau, a federalist in the Quebec Liberal Party, 
who mentioned the figure of $250 million. Am I to understand 
that the Liberal minister in Ottawa is calling a federalist 
minister in Quebec a liar? Is that what I must understand?
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	The other point I would like to underline is that this minister 
was there during the Trudeau years. I would like to give him an 
example of duplication between Quebec and Canada. In my 
riding, the province built a $23-million fish plant when there 
was fish-you will recall that before 1984 Quebec shared in the 
administration of fishing permits. Do you know what the 
federalists in those days, who are still across from us, did? They 
built a $16-million plant right beside the one built by Quebec. 
That is what they did. That is their kind of regional 
development. They come and undermine Quebec initiatives.
<P>
	I have a few more questions. I have devastating figures about 
my riding which I would like to quote for the benefit of the 
minister of employment and immigration, even if he does not 
like to hear them. In my riding of Gaspé, the unemployment rate 
is 27 per cent. The labour force participation rate stands at 42 
per cent. That means only four people out of ten are either 
working or looking for a job. What happened with the other six? 
The federalists discouraged them. What does this Liberal 
government have to offer? The recent budget froze the funding 
for help centres. We cannot get any money to  promote the 
innovative suggestions of people in Gaspé and the whole 
province of Quebec. The minister is considering reforms, and, 
meanwhile, he cuts the funding. It does not make sense.
<P>
	What about the Employment Development Program? I remind 
you that my region, with a 27 per cent unemployment rate and a 
42 per cent participation rate, should be considered a disaster 
area, and should get enhanced EDP funding to put people back to 
work. Well, this funding has been cut, and is now reduced to 20 
per cent of what it was before. The Federal Office of Regional 
Development has been subjected to a 25 per cent cut by the 
Martin budget, by the colleague of the minister who just spoke. 
Where are we going? What kind of logic is this? They wonder 
why we move a motion on regional development during an 
opposition day. They are slashing whatever help was left and 
they would like us to believe in federalism. I am sorry, but if the 
minister keeps talking the way he does, things will only be 
easier for us, come the referendum campaign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy: </B>Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to say that I 
was definitely a member of Mr. Trudeau's governement and I am 
very proud of it. It is quite special because at that time, we 
defeated a proposal for the separation of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	And we will defeat it again.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to make sure the facts are on the record. 
I remind members opposite of the impact of the new 
equalization formula with the provinces that we brought in a few 
months ago in the February budget. This is the value of the 1994 
tax base update: Newfoundland, $7.6 million; P.E.I., $5 million; 
Nova Scotia, $.8 million; New Brunswick, $5.5; and Quebec, 
$70.8 million.
<P>
	If there is a testament to the kind of federalism we want to 
build in the country, it is reflected in those kinds of numbers. We 
are prepared as a federal government working on a national tax 
base to bring together the wealth of a country and make sure it is 
divided and distributed in a way that helps regions with real 
needs. This demonstrates to me once again the falsity of the 
underlying premise of the resolution.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Gaspé who just spoke wants another 
testament to what is happening, the people in the Gaspé are 
seriously affected by the downturn in the fishery and their 
resource industries. That is shared by other people in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4744"> 4744 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	What he did not mention with the selective memory that the 
separatists seem to have is that the federal government has just 
introduced a $1.9 billion program for people in the fishing 
industry, including his own riding, through which it will be able 
to have substantial weekly benefits, go back to work, have 
support for training, for self-employment, for economic 
development, for community employment. It will be able to give 
some hope to its children by going back to work in a green corps 
to replace the fishery, enhance the resources, go back to work to 
actually rebuild the resource base of that region.
<P>
	That was a federal program that we introduced and it would 
seem to me that the hon. member rather than complaining and 
carping should get to work and do his job as a member of 
Parliament and help that program work so his own people can go 
back to work.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I see three members rising to ask 
questions. I wonder if there is again a feeling of having 
unanimous consent to prolong this question period by five 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke first. I see no consent to extend the question 
period beyond 10 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I can see after what the hon. member stated that he would not 
wish to extend the period to rebut the statements he made. He 
only wishes to extend it to rebut the statements of others.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite said that the Bloc Quebecois does 
not check into the reality of how Canada works. I would suggest 
that the government has not checked into the reality of why the 
country is not working.
<P>
	If you have a dog named Rory and the dog makes a mess of 
your house, you say you do not want this dog and you kick it out. 
A little while later you bring a dog in, a dog named Brick. Why 
should you be surprised if the dog makes the same mess of your 
house if it is the same dog with a different name?
<P>
	There is a lot of selection going on here today. The hon. 
member talked about the selective memory of the Bloc. I would 
suggest that the hon. member is using selective statistics in 
backing his own arguments. He talks about the 40,000 or 50,000 
jobs created in the west through government grants and 
government funding. How many jobs have we lost in the west 
because of the government's overspending and the taxation of 
all the different businesses and individuals which rob us of the 
ability to do this for ourselves?
<P>
	The government creates the problem. It gave us a small bit of 
a solution to that problem. Then it wants to pat itself on the back 
for it.
<P>
	There is something wrong with a system in which we give our 
money to the federal government and then have to beg and plead 
to get some of it back through whatever program it decides to 
develop. It is very selective how it is given out.
<P>
	The hon. minister talked about 150 companies that get the 
government's benevolent help. What about the companies that 
are not in that group, further disadvantaged because now we 
have government interference stepping in and saying: ``You are 
the good companies so we are going to help you; but we are not 
helping you guys with your taxes because we have to get the 
money from somewhere to give to these other companies in the 
first place''.
<P>
	When he said we want to bring together the wealth of Canada, 
they have sure done that; they have taken all the wealth of 
Canada and brought it here to Ottawa and then squandered it.
<P>
	What we have to do is find some solutions to problems. We are 
getting rhetoric from that side, we are getting rhetoric from 
every side, and I am probably using a bit of it because I get 
caught up in the flow.
<P>
	In terms of regional development, the problem with 
government today and in the past is that it is selective. It makes 
these arbitrary choices of who it is going to help and how it is 
going to help. The Bloc Quebecois is upset about the money it 
pays out and gets back. The west pays out more than it gets back 
and we are tired of that as well.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member that if he is going to use 
statistics, use accurate ones, use ones that reflect the true picture 
and not his own stilted sort of version of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, once 
again we are faced with a kind of cheque book federalism. We 
have on the one hand members of the Bloc saying: ``We do not 
get enough''. The members from the Reform Party are saying: 
``We give away too much''.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	What ever happened to the notion that there is a country that 
tries to share and distribute things? The problem is that we are 
now seeing certainly on the benches opposite this sort of small 
end thinking: ``What is important is only within my own little 
circle''.
<P>
	I thought what we are trying to build in the country is some 
sense of common interest, that we are trying to reach out and 
build some strengths together. Unfortunately we seem to have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4745"> 4745 </A></B>
<P>
two parties which think that their only responsibility is to 
represent very narrow, specific regional interests, that there is 
not such thing called Canada any more. It seems to be forgotten 
in their vocabulary. That seems to be the problem.
<P>
	It is a tragedy that we do not in effect have some groups 
opposite which speak from a national interest point of view, 
which speak from the perspective of how to help build a 
community, how to help pull people together as opposed to this 
notion of how to separate them, divide them and start adding 
things up by some accounting; we transferred 1.5 here and they 
got 1.2 there.
<P>
	That is how you destroy a country. I say in all honesty to the 
hon. member, that is how you destroy a country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has long ago expired. Is there 
consent to have further time on the question period?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Five more minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, he 
talked about squandering and waste but the fact of the matter is 
that all Canadians whether they live in western Canada or 
Quebec fundamentally share a national support for health 
programs so that we have the best health care system in the 
world.
<P>
	We all basically share and benefit by having a program of 
employment education which is one of the best in the world. We 
all share and benefit by having one of the best infrastructures in 
the world which we are now trying to improve even though the 
Reform Party opposes it.
<P>
	Those are things you do not break down by provincial 
boundaries. You look at them from a national perspective and we 
are all winners in it.
<P>
	I would simply say that the next generation of requirements is 
to do what my colleague, the Minister of Industry, is trying to 
do, to break those barriers down further. We are trying in 
western Canada to bring down the barriers among western 
provinces and get away from building up barriers, building up 
protectionisms, building up new walls or frontiers that the Bloc 
Quebecois wants to do and apparently the Reform Party wants to 
do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the minister, earlier, say things that are not 
totally true. He was talking in a lyrical way, but very cynically, 
of his vision of Canadian regional development.
<P>
	The truth is that his government is against regional 
development. His government has just cut, through its budget, 
$5.5 billion in the unemployment insurance fund. At the 
hearings of the sub-committee on Bill C-17, which is the piece 
of legislation that cuts unemployment insurance, people from 
the Maritimes came to tell this government, the members of the 
government, that it was on the wrong track. These people were 
desperate, because they were being cut left and right where they 
should not be cut.
<P>
	That is the government's vision of regional development, to 
totally destabilize communities,  particularly rural 
communities. The federal government should stop trying to 
make us cry with the millions of dollars that it sprinkles over 
Quebec. In case you did not know it, we pay $28 billion in taxes 
every year. So, those millions are no gift. The government 
should undertake a complete assessment of federal transfers, 
instead of looking only at what suits it. For the last five years or 
so, we have been the losers in these tax transfers, given what we 
are paying and what we are receiving.
<P>
	So, the government should stop making us cry with arguments 
that are senseless, and most of all, demagogic arguments coming 
from a minister who is always demagogic anyway. The 
government should stop praising the phantom of the opera, Mr. 
Trudeau.
<P>
	Mr. Trudeau spat on Quebec's aspirations, and if you are 
proud of having been part of his government, that is too bad for 
you. That will just make things clearer for Quebecers. So, is that 
your vision of regional development, to completely destabilize 
rural communities of the Maritimes and of Quebec with such a 
despicable, outrageous and hated bill as Bill C-17? I ask the 
question to the minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me say first to the hon. member that I am really pleased to hear 
that he is concerned about destabilizing the economy. I would 
hope as a result of that at the very first opportunity he will leave 
this Chamber and go to his leader's office and tell him to quit 
making those comments. I guess he is taking my advice, he is 
leaving right now.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> As the old saying 
goes, if you cannot take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that if there is any one person 
responsible today for destabilizing the economy, for causing the 
substantial increase of interest rates which is putting real 
pressure on our international financing-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is the leader of the Bloc Quebecois. He is the worst, when it 
comes to dealing with stability problems of the economy, and 
that is the truth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4746"> 4746 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is the real problem we face. As long as we have the kind 
of sermon of separation that we hear coming time and time again 
from members opposite, we will continue to face economic 
difficulties because the international marketplace is looking at 
that problem.
<P>
	If they were really concerned about the economy and ensuring 
that we can start building a stronger economy, getting our 
financing back in order, helping solve problems of deficits, 
putting more money back into investment, then they would stop 
talking about separation. That would be the one contribution 
members opposite could really make to economic renewal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to support parts of the Bloc's motion. After listening 
to the rhetoric that has gone on here today, I kind of get lost.
<P>
	I enjoy the comments from the other side. I would like to refer 
specifically to two matters that have importance to western 
economic development: first, the federal government's 
prolonged inaction regarding dumping of apples grown in 
Washington state; second, the federal government's seemingly 
perpetual bungling of the handling of grain.
<P>
	On Monday, May 9 more than 400 fruit growers gathered at 
the Canada-U.S. border crossing near the small community of 
Osoyoos in British Columbia to protest the government's lack of 
action regarding an extremely perishable agricultural 
commodity, apples, which are no longer being protected against 
unfair marketing practices by American growers due to 
contradictory actions by the federal government.
<P>
	According to an article in the Osoyoos <I>Times</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When the dumping of U.S. apples occurred in 1987 and 1989, apple growers 
in B.C. lost more than $10 million, according to the association. But Ottawa 
responded by placing apples under the Special Import Measures Act, a 
five-year plan protecting orchardists against dumping. However, in February of 
this year the Canadian Import Trade Tribunal chose not to renew the plan, 
leaving growers vulnerable to what they call unfair competition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Imagine what would have happened to fishermen on the east 
coast when federal legislation providing special support to them 
called the northern cod adjustment recovery package expired on 
May 15 if the federal government had simply done nothing.
<P>
	When the legislation expired, hundreds of fishing families, 
the main economic support of their communities, would have 
faced bankruptcy. Rather than let this happen, the government 
brought in the Atlantic groundfish strategy, or TAGS. While I 
cannot speak wholeheartedly in favour of TAGS, I do recognize 
that a responsible federal government cannot expect major 
sectors of the Canadian economy to go cold turkey from wide 
scale government support and government control to full 
fledged, free enterprise overnight.
<P>
	Yet this is exactly what is happening to apple growers in 
British Columbia. Their industry was protected, and with not 
one effort to prepare growers for the sudden transition that 
protection was withdrawn.
<P>
	The Reform Party is strongly in favour of free trade but we 
emphasize that it must be fair trade. In the long run we in the 
Reform caucus look forward to the time when Canadian 
agriculture can thrive in a free market economy but we 
recognize that this time has not yet come.
<P>
	Okanagan fruit growers must not simply be thrown to the 
wolves or Canada may soon face the situation in which having 
apple tree in the backyard is merely a hobby and all commercial 
fruit must be imported. I believe that is totally unacceptable.  
The Reform caucus urges the government to recognize that there 
must be an orderly transition to tomorrow's world of free trade. 
In the interim, B.C. fruit growers face great economic hardships 
which will result in many of them going bankrupt.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I hear the hon. member on the other side basically suggesting 
that there should be no support given to the B.C. Okanagan fruit 
growers. According to David Hobson, president of the B.C. 
Fruit Growers' Association: ``Farm families cannot sustain 
another year of dumping''.
<P>
	At the B.C. rally on May 9, B.C. provincial government 
representatives, including Okanagan-Boundary MLA Bill 
Barlee, former B.C. agriculture minister and now B.C. minister 
of small business, as well as Okanagan East MLA Judy Tyabji 
pointed out that fruit growers have become entangled in a 
conflicting maze of B.C. and federal policies.
<P>
	More thoughtful government policies could moderate many 
economic consequences of the shift to a competitive world of 
free market. The lack of competitiveness from either B.C. fruit 
growers or west coast grain handlers is not due either to the 
farmers and workers involved nor to the conditions supplied by 
mother nature.
<P>
	Canada has been recognized around the world for the high 
quality of our tree fruit, particularly our apples. Our growers and 
our agricultural researchers deserve much credit for their 
dedication and hard work. We are blessed with abundant water 
as well as soil and climate that provide some of the best growing 
conditions in the world both for grain on the prairies and for the 
tree fruit industry, especially in the Okanagan Valley which 
historically has provided approximately one-third of Canada's 
apples.
<P>
	The future of Canada's horticultural industry should be 
bright. Instead we have growers who face a troubled and 
uncertain future due to the lack of wisdom in the way govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4747"> 4747 </A></B>
<P>
ment has dealt with the problems of our farms and orchards on 
one hand and the transportation of grain on the other hand.
<P>
	In the past government took the easy route. If a problem 
emerged it would throw tax dollars at it. If west coast grain 
handlers went on strike or elevator operators locked the union 
out, the federal government would wait whatever it considered 
the appropriate amount of time to give lip service to free market 
forces. Then Parliament would be called on once again as we 
were this spring to legislate an end to the strike.
<P>
	I voted in support of the back to work legislation with the 
specific suggestion that the House must develop a long term 
solution to problems of handling grain. According to the 
<I>Edmonton Journal</I> for May 17 the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food noted ``a wrinkle in the Western Grain 
Transportation Act'' which sometimes makes it cheaper to haul 
grain east to Thunder Bay before shipping it west to qualify for 
cheaper rates. That is the kind of unrealistic nonsense that can 
result from federal government intervention.
<P>
	To compensate for time lost in this spring's grain handlers 
strike, complicated by a lack of hopper cars earlier this year 
because of grain shipment disruptions in the U.S.A. due to 
flooding in the Mississippi River valley, west coast grain 
terminals are now being operated on a seven-day per week basis 
at full overtime rates. Such seven-day per week operation has 
long been necessary to handle the increasing volumes of grain 
going through west coast ports. In response to requests for 
seven-day coverage the federal mediator to the previous west 
coast grain handlers strike allowed it on condition that the 
terminal operators pay full overtime rates for weekend work 
even if weekend hours were to form part of the regularly 
scheduled work week, according to the terminal operators.
<P>
	In the world of free trade and strong international competition 
prairie grain pools cannot hope to remain competitive with 
emerging suppliers from other countries under those conditions. 
It is obvious that a long term resolution to such problems must 
be found.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture indicated he was interested in such 
action with a meeting he scheduled two weeks ago with officials 
from the grain companies, west coast terminal operators and 
union and federal grain agencies. After the meeting the Alberta 
agriculture minister said the immediate concerns about the grain 
backlog left little time for discussing long term plans. He said: 
``We just managed to scratch the surface in a tentative way''.
<P>
	For the prairie communities and railroads and the 3,500 west 
coast grain handlers who were subject to special legislation in 
1974, 1975, 1982, 1988, 1991, and again in 1994, these make-do 
meetings are simply not good enough.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Productivity of wheat, productivity per man hour of the grain 
handlers and the demand for wheat among the Pacific rim 
customers are growing. Both wheat and the production of apples 
are important regional aspects of the Canadian economy. For 
example, the fresh and  processed fruit and vegetable industry 
has an annual production that exceeds $4 billion. The fresh fruit 
and vegetable sector alone accounts for $1.8 billion.
<P>
	Regarding wheat, according to green matters, I quote: ``The 
Far East and Oceania, home to 3.2 billion consumers, could 
account for 40 per cent of world wheat trade by the end of the 
century. Population and income growth, increased urbanization 
and the resulting dietary shift away from rice are expected to 
lead to greater use of wheat based products. Canada could secure 
as much as 30 per cent of this market''.
<P>
	The Canadian horticultural action plan published by 
agriculture Canada in 1993 recommended that agricultural 
policies be changed in several areas. Currently the federal 
government has piecemeal agricultural policies which see wide 
differences from province to province.
<P>
	In conclusion, overall the Reform Party caucus is in favour of 
as little federal government intervention in our regions as 
possible. However, we recognize that in the transition from 
yesterday's heavily supported and controlled economy to 
tomorrow's world of free trade, orderly, thoughtful and 
reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that survival, 
particularly of Okanagan apple growers and prairie grain 
producers, are looked at in a different light. The federal 
government's intervention is often inefficient at best and 
harmful to regional development.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I understand that the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Shuswap wishes to share his time with the member 
for Capilano-Howe Sound.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Then there are five minutes for 
questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I caution the hon. member in his 
remarks, saying that he would want to get a little closer to the 
Bloc. I cannot believe that the Reform Party is trying to destroy 
Canada whereas the Bloc's specific mission is to destroy 
Canada. Right now it is doing a very good job of it. We really 
should not associate with the Bloc.
<P>
	A month ago I went to members of the Reform Party and asked 
them to participate in a mission to China whereby we would 
export Canadian products and services. I could not get any 
support.
<P>
	Yet the previous member of Parliament from Kelowna, Mr. Al 
Horning, came to Beijing, China with us on this mission. He was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4748"> 4748 </A></B>
<P>
there for the express purpose of selling apples, the fruit of the 
Okanagan Valley, and also ginseng.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party cannot have it both ways. 
They stand here in the House of Commons and say they do not 
want any government interference or government help, but here 
is a specific example where we should be supportive and come 
to the aid of not just the fruit growers but also deal in a 
substantive way with the grain problem.
<P>
	That is the point that I want to make. The Reform Party has to 
decide. Either there are times when they really need 
Government of Canada assistance or they do not. They cannot 
have it both ways.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member on the 
other side. Maybe the ears get plugged or maybe we are 
misinterpreted. The understanding of what is being said from 
this side is not quite there.
<P>
	First, who says that because we are on opposite sides that one 
party or another cannot come up with a policy of which part can 
be supported by the other parties. Just the Liberals say that if it is 
not a Liberal policy nobody should support it.
<P>
	I have sat here since the beginning of the session and all I have 
heard is how well you people on the other side want to get this 
country going. Yet you sit over there and refuse to accept any 
suggestions from any side on this. If it is not Liberal it does not 
wash, that is your way of thinking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Work with the 
separatists.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> There we go again. If it is not to your liking, 
everybody has to be against Canada. We have tried to introduce 
bills and motions in full support of Canada but that side does not 
support them. They go off on their own rhetoric.
<P>
	The Reform Party caucus has stated all along that you cannot 
just totally cut off everything.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You have to work with the Bloc.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> No, no. We are trying to work with the 
government. Unfortunately there are certain members on the 
other side who refuse to listen.
<P>
	When you are trying to further the output of companies it 
cannot be done through grants but you cannot cut them off 
instantly. It does not work that way. First the field has to be 
level. The member or his colleague mentioned it before in 
interprovincial trade barriers. We have more interprovincial 
trade barriers in our own country than we do for exports from 
other countries.
<P>
	It has been years. You have had your chances before. Now you 
are starting to listen a little bit. Not very much, just a little bit. I 
can understand that over here. It is too bad that gets lost over on 
the other side.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. Time has expired. We 
would ask both of the members who just spoke to try to put their 
remarks to the Chair. The ``you'' should  just refer to whoever is 
in the Chair, not to people on the other side of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have studied economic development for the last 30 years of my 
professional life. I would like to put some historic perspective 
into this discussion.
<P>
	In the post-war years in the 1950s and 1960s there were two 
economic development models floating around in the academic 
world and in the world of reality. On the one side we had the 
Soviet Union. It promised to solve all problems of economic 
development through deliberate central government action of 
planning and strict control over the lives of its members.
<P>
	On the other extreme we had the market liberal model of the 
19th century which believed that economic development was 
essentially the responsibility of individuals and that the role of 
the government was limited to setting down rules that protected 
and set up property rights, law and order, protection of 
individuals from both foreign and domestic interference. It 
essentially believed that minimal government was best to set 
free the energies and entrepreneurship of the individuals.
<P>
	There was a lot of discussion during this period as to which 
was the best model, which would best succeed in raising the 
welfare of people in this world. It was largely a theoretical 
model because we never, ever have had any experience with the 
kind of planning model which was used in the Soviet Union.
<P>
	We now know differently. We have now learned that the 
alleged success of the Soviet Union was all a big lie, that after all 
planning does not work.
<P>
	At the same time we have the very great success of the Asian 
tigers, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, which in a very short 
time by using basically the model of the libertarian 19th century 
market oriented philosophers succeeded in bringing 
unprecedented rates of economic growth to their people.
<P>
	I believe that the recent experiences are directly relevant to 
what is going on in Canada and what I believe Canada should do. 
Unfortunately in my judgment in the post-war years the 
Government of Canada travelled a great deal toward the model 
that is exemplified by the experiences in the Soviet Union and 
Cuba. I do not wish to say that we have become totalitarian. I 
merely wish to say the government has taken on the role of a 
major agent in economic development. This is in contrast to the 
idea that the government should merely facilitate economic 
development through some basic rules.

<P>
	We heard from a couple of representatives from the 
government ministry this morning. They still believe they can 
do essentially what has failed in so many other countries around 
the world. They believe they are responsible for the export 
success of some industries which they have mentioned.
<P>
	If there really is a project in Canada which can demonstrably 
be successful in exporting products to China which it now 
cannot do, many greedy capitalists in New York and elsewhere 
would love to put money into such a project. If it is worthwhile it 
should be done by the private sector.
<P>
	When there is a government agency which says: ``Fill out 15 
forms and subject yourself to all kinds of hearings and then we 
will give it to you'', no wonder they all come to the government 
and say: ``We will do it your way. It is much easier than 
subjecting ourselves to the rigours of the market''. Then the 
minister can say: ``Oh, what a great success this was''.
<P>
	If it had been anticipated to be a great success, why did the 
private sector not do it? The private sector would have done it, 
but one of the problems in Canada is that the government is 
constantly stepping in and removing the incentive for the private 
sector to engage in this kind of development.
<P>
	The future of Canada can go in either of two ways. One is the 
vision of the present government, which is continued 
government involvement in regional development projects. In 
the rest of the world it is almost a totally discredited approach to 
economic development. There is hardly an economist in the 
world who will disagree with the proposition that the 
government cannot pick winners. The government is not good at 
picking winners for economic development and which of the 
industries should be supported. The failure rate is extremely 
high.
<P>
	Remember that every time the government supports an 
industry and then fails, it has taken away money from the rest of 
Canadians. They are therefore less able to do the kind of 
economic development projects which traditionally were within 
their abilities.
<P>
	My vision for Quebec and Canada is let us make our country 
and Quebec after the model of Switzerland. Let us have free 
trade. Let us have a federation where all of the policies for 
economic development and social development are undertaken 
at the lowest level possible.
<P>
	The minister said that unless we do it from Ottawa we will not 
have a country. Switzerland has a very strong sense of country, 
but a very weak central government. The government in 
Switzerland is doing what the 19th century model says it should 
do: provide security, internal rules, freedom, property rights. 
That is what the Swiss government is doing. To say that unless 
we take money away from the rich provinces or cantons and give 
it to the poor there will not be a country is obsolete. That  model 
has failed. Just look at the countries which have pushed it to the 
extreme.
<P>
	In conclusion, I support the position of the resolution that is 
before us today. The government should generally support 
decentralization of function. It should go back to the function it 
had in the first place up until the end of the second world war.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	Also, if I may be so bold as to suggest, although I am not 
supporting it, but if it were to take place unhappy as I would be 
that Quebec became independent, I do hope it would take the 
model of Switzerland and not that of Albania in deciding which 
policies it would adopt with respect to trade and economic 
development. If Quebec were to become like Switzerland then 
many of the fears which have been voiced about the 
consequences for the rest of Canada, even the consequences for 
the people of Quebec on independence would be unwarranted 
and unjustified.
<P>
	I wish I could be optimistic about the people of Quebec and 
the Government of Quebec accepting my advice. Unfortunately 
from what I have heard in this House we will not have much 
support for a market Liberal type of policies. I am afraid the 
indications are and it makes me very sad that we will move 
closer toward the model that has failed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
saddened by the hon. member's comments. I think I actually 
heard him giving advice to the separatist element of the country 
of how they should properly separate. This follows more on the 
heels of what the Minister of Human Resources Development 
said about the problems with this great nation of ours. There are 
two parties in the House each with its own single focus which 
seems to be on separating us and making us different.
<P>
	The hon. member went on with a history lesson. He tells me he 
is an economist but in fact, he must be a historian. He wants to 
take us back into the history of the country, a history which 
incidentally has never existed, a laissez faire economy in which 
government is not involved in the economy whatsoever. The 
government's only function is presumably to make postage 
stamps. This economy has never existed in the world. An Adam 
Smith economy has never existed. The reality is the great United 
States, that great capitalist country has all kinds of these 
programs.
<P>
	The hon. member went on to talk about China, the new 
evolution and the new world. I note the Reform Party refused to 
send people to China. I was one of the ones who was honoured to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4750"> 4750 </A></B>
<P>
go and support some of our small and medium sized businesses. 
Some of them were from the west.
<P>
	In talking to the people of China I was surprised to learn that 
in spite of their demand type of economy they were all working. 
There was no unemployment. I am not supporting a communist 
system, but I am saying that when I look back on the situation in 
Canada I realize we have one of the highest standards of living in 
the world.
<P>
	If I took anything seriously from the member's comments, 
somehow we would be all destitute. I would like the hon. 
member to comment on some of those aspects of our economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, the more I listen to people like the 
hon. member who just spoke, they should get a lesson in 
listening. There are so many things I am supposed to have said 
which I never said. I will let <I>Hansard</I> stand for that.
<P>
	I never supported Quebec separation. However I believe it is 
not in the interests of the people of Quebec or Canada for us to 
refuse to think about what policies they might adopt if they do 
decide to become independent. I will justify that any time.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	Also, I never mentioned the people of China. If you go to 
China you will get shepherded around by a guide like I did. I 
have been to China. You see what you want to see. In the 1930s 
people came back from the Soviet Union saying: ``There is no 
unemployment. The Soviet Union is a model for economic 
development. Let's go that way''. The NDP for a long time 
pushed that line until finally somebody said what Stalin had 
done and what lies had been perpetrated on us.
<P>
	Since we have begun to intervene strongly in our economy in 
the 1960s with all the programs the hon. member's party is so 
proud of, the rate of economic growth in this country has 
decreased. It has gone from one of the biggest in the OECD 
down to the middle.
<P>
	Before Sweden started its massive programs of the sort 
members wish more of, it was the country with the highest per 
capita income in the world. However, it went to where it is now, 
which is in the middle. In the last 20 years it has had the smallest 
growth in per capita income. History speaks clearly that the 
model of maximum involvement of the government in economic 
development has failed. The empirical evidence is in.
<P>
	I would like to reiterate what I have said and the advice I can 
give as a 30-year student of economic development. Quebec 
demands for decentralization of this process of economic 
development. Keep more of the money there and let them do 
with it what they want to. This would be in the interests of the 
people of Quebec. Similarly this kind of approach might very 
well be the solution to keeping the country together, a looser 
federation modelled after that of Switzerland. Nobody can say 
that Switzerland is not a country. We can achieve that here, but 
we have to have it as a goal.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately the five minutes are up. 
I see someone else wishing to ask a question. Is there unanimous 
consent to extend the period?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound, 
Switzerland is much smaller than Canada. It is not as diverse in 
geography and population and it does have a very different 
economic outlook and economy.
<P>
	My point to the hon. member regards economic development 
which we are talking about today, and not the development of 
new countries. In economic development Canada has acted as a 
unified country to serve all the regions, to serve them as 
equitably and as fairly as we can.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada, there is the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, better known as ACOA. It helps to 
sustain some of the industries which cannot take on new 
technologies, new markets, new global competition without a 
little assistance. Let me give an example of what happened 
during the first week of May in my home town of Truro, Nova 
Scotia.
<P>
	I attended a sod turning ceremony at Intertape Polymer Group 
Inc. The head office of Polymer is in Montreal. It has a plant in 
Nova Scotia where it manufactures synthetic fibres, plastic tape 
for the backing of carpets, polysac bags, even large sacks for 
bales of hay. This high tech company markets globally. As I 
said, the head office is in Montreal and there are five branches of 
that plant in Virginia, Florida, Louisiana, Montreal and Truro.
<P>
	The company was looking at expansion. We, through ACOA, 
gave $1.4 million to Polymer to expand in Truro and the parent 
plant put in $15 million, for more than $16 million of investment 
in my home town. This investment created 45 new jobs for more 
than a total of 300 jobs in Truro, not Louisiana. We got ACOA 
funding as a stimulus and the parent company put the additional 
money in because that was where the best investment was for the 
best growth in exports from our ports to global markets 
throughout the world.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	That is the advantage of regional economic development. 
That is a success story of long term jobs, sustainable jobs and a 
sustainable economy in the Atlantic region that we appreciate 
and love Canada for. That is what economic development is all 
about.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound 
appreciates where we are coming from.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the great troubles we have as 
economists is that people always see their narrow, tiny little 
piece of the world. The world does not work that way.
<P>
	A month ago I gave a speech on the damage done by the 
economic policies of the government on what they call charity to 
the regions.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We do not call it charity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> I know you do not call it charity but that is what 
it is.
<P>
	The other side of charity is now showing up in every country 
of the world that has gone too far with charity. I am not against 
charity, just how much. It has another side. With charity we also 
create dependence. Until the program of regional redistribution 
was enacted the income in the maritime provinces was a bit 
behind that of the rich centre.
<P>
	The problem of economic development was solved by slow 
outward migration. Chances were that outward migration would 
have maintained income in the regions equal or near equal to 
that in the centre.
<P>
	However, what did we do? We instituted in the name of 
charity a program which when exposed turned out to have been a 
disaster. It told the people of the maritimes to stay where they 
were and, if they fell behind, they would be given money. They 
would be given charity. What happened? They became so 
dependent on it that when the fish disappeared, when an 
economic crisis developed, they ended up having the worst 
possible kinds of problems.
<P>
	We do not give money to our children after a certain stage 
because we know if we keep giving them money they will never 
become independent. Yet here we have a state institution which 
continuously says: ``Stay poor, we will take care of you''.
<P>
	This is the long run perspective on those kinds of programs 
which I believe has to be brought out in our discussion of where 
we are going into the future.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais 
(Madawaska-Victoria):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am appalled by the 
comments of the member who just spoke. He talked about 
charity to Atlantic Canada and before that he talked about 
history.
<P>
	Perhaps the member needs a little lesson in history. Atlantic 
Canada was one of the most prosperous regions when Canada 
was built, at the time of Confederation. The Atlantic region 
helped Quebec open up its waters to the world, to the detriment 
of Atlantic Canada. It helped develop western Canadian 
agriculture, and we are here as Atlantic MPs listening to western 
MPs telling us that we are charity cases.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Yes, you are.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> The hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata also.
<P>
	I want the member to withdraw his remark, his insult to the 
population of Atlantic Canada including the MPs  in the House 
who represent them. We are here because we were 
democratically elected. We were elected as members. I want the 
member to withdraw his remarks about Atlantic Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member did not indicate that she 
was rising a point of order. With great respect the word charity is 
not an unparliamentary word.
<P>
	The member has made her point very effectively. I will also 
give the member for Capilano-Howe Sound a chance to give 
his perspective on the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
reply. I wish the hon. member would read what I said when I had 
an opportunity in a systematic way to outline my views on the 
matter.
<P>
	I am in full agreement that the maritimes at a time when the 
world's wealth was determined by the availability of natural 
resources was one of the most prosperous regions of the world. 
The people of the maritimes were working very hard then and 
they are working very hard today. They would be most 
prosperous today, I am saying, if the government had not made 
the mistake of saying to the people of those regions: ``You can 
stay there as long as you want to. We will always maintain your 
income at a certain level''.
<P>
	The world has changed. Wealth today is no longer a function 
of natural resource availability. Singapore today has moved into 
the league of industrial countries and Singapore does not even 
have its own water supply. The source of income and wealth 
today is human capital which functions, unfortunately for the 
resources of the countries of the world, only in big cities. That is 
why income is so high in large cities.
<P>
	We would not have today the difficulties we are seeing in the 
maritimes, in my considered judgment, if we had not had a 
program motivated by the charitable instincts of Canadians, 
which I appreciate. That is the only point I wish to make.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to 
Standing Order 43(2), I wish to let you know that the speeches 
from the Bloc Quebecois members will be limited to 10 minutes 
in order to allow more members to address the subject matter of 
regional development. 
<P>
	First, I would like to mention the open-mindedness of some 
members who are looking for solutions to today's motion on 
regional development instead of dwelling on our differences.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4752"> 4752 </A></B>
<P>
	As we can see, regional development is a complex and 
troubling matter which is a unique combination of economic and 
political notions. Defining the developed regions can be quite a 
challenge if we compare Montreal to Gaspésie or Abitibi. The 
fact that regional development depends largely upon national 
economic growth is another problem too.
<P>
	It was only in the 1960s that Canadian politicians realized that 
all regions were not developing at the same rate and decided to 
set a series of programs based on a regional development federal 
policy to eliminate those disparities.
<P>
	Until then, public authorities thought that federal programs 
aimed at promoting national economic growth would also be 
beneficial to all regions, which was not the case. That could 
have been more or less true in times of prosperity, but the 
disparities have not disappeared. Ever since, they have not 
succeeded in improving the situation of the regions which 
unfortunately have too often the highest unemployment rates.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The implementation of programs to alleviate regional 
disparities led to the creation in 1969 of the Department of 
Economic Regional Expansion which later became Industrial 
Regional Expansion after merging with Industry and 
Commerce.
<P>
	In 1987, the Department of Regional Industrial Expansion 
was once more dismantled, and its federal responsibilities are 
now those of the Federal Office of Regional Development.
<P>
	The problem is that the various regions not only do not have 
the same financial means but their development opportunities 
also differ, resulting in what has become to be known as 
``regional disparities''. However, the concept itself of regional 
disparities creates a problem. An easily identifiable 
phenomenon, regional disparities-if we talk of a sector like 
Toronto or a region in the Maritimes-have very often been 
mistaken for regional development. This explains why, after 
identifying a higher unemployment rate in some provinces, the 
government adopted job creation policies, in other words 
policies that would possibly disguise the symptoms without 
eliminating their cause.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that a difference in the level of 
unemployment, productivity or income can be explained by 
many factors affecting the regional economy together or 
separately and, in many instances, each case calls for different 
measures.
<P>
	In summary, regional development programs have no doubt 
given positive results over the years, but in the majority of 
cases, they have not succeeded in alleviating regional 
disparities in Canada.
<P>
	The disappointment voiced about those programs brought 
about frequent reorganizations-which I have listed-of federal 
initiatives in that area. However, many of those initiatives 
showed that various governments  wanted to have an impact on 
regional development policy without wondering whether it was 
consistent with the existing needs and programs.
<P>
	However, many programs were designed only for job 
creation, with no thought of first changing the underpinnings of 
local economies, which would have paved the way to 
sustainable growth. Usually, job creation means economic 
growth. We should be careful not to confuse growth and 
development. Growth does not imply anything as to the future of 
an area, whereas development means that extensive changes 
will improve the ability of the region to generate wealth.
<P>
	Some 25 years ago, the federal government commissioned a 
group of professors from the Université de Montréal to conduct 
a study on Canada's economic development. This study is 
responsible for the social and economic concept whereby the 
main ingredients of development- capital, higher education, 
technology and decision-making-are concentrated around 
major urban centres. It is assumed that the surrounding areas 
will benefit from an active urban centre.
<P>
	Over the past 25 years, we have had several opportunities to 
evaluate the perverse effects of this theory: chronic 
unemployment in the regions, emigration of our young people, 
and under-financing of regions. Yet, no serious effort has ever 
been made to counter this approach.
<P>
	The first thing to do to foster regional development is to make 
money available for investment. Mr. Daniel Johnson understood 
that, and his strategic plan for the Montreal area included the 
creation of a corporation called Innovatech and the allocation of 
$300 million. He had understood the importance of capital, 
something we are lacking in the regions.
<P>
	That same government encouraged all regions in Quebec to 
draw up a strategic plan and gave them $3 million each, for a 
total of some $50 million for two thirds of Quebec, while the 
Montreal area, with one third of the population, was getting 
$300 million. Clearly, a better balance would have been 
advisable and would have helped the regions more.
<P>
	That example shows all too well that the political weight is 
inversely proportional to the democratic weight in the area of 
regional development planning. Therefore, it is important, even 
though public funds are less abundant than before, to allocate 
sufficient amounts to allow investors and businessmen in the 
regions to get the levers working on their behalf.
<P>
	Federal-provincial agreements on development are one of the 
instruments that regions can use. However, the standards and the 
decision process should be made more flexible in order to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4753"> 4753 </A></B>
<P>
reduce delays and obstacles. Also, the money should come from 
new funds and not from funds taken from one program to finance 
another.
<P>
	There are also other ways of stimulating regional economy; I 
am thinking here about tax measures. During the eighties for 
example, mining exploration companies benefitted from a 
flow-through share program which allowed a tax credit worth 
133 per cent of investments, once federal and provincial tax 
credits were calculated. Thanks to that program, individuals 
could invest tax deductible venture capital, which is greatly 
needed, and companies had funds to operate and thereby 
discover new deposits that are in operation today.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	People should know that there is at least a seven-year period 
between exploration activities and the moment when a mine 
begins full production; that is why it is so important for the 
mining regions of the country that funds be allocated to support 
research and exploration for future development.
<P>
	It is possible, Mr. Speaker, to be creative and to come up with 
new tax incentives suitable for specific development sectors in 
different regions. In the same vein, we must give investors loan 
guarantees and allow them interest-free periods when they 
borrow money in order to contribute to regional economic 
recovery.
<P>
	We could also offer tax benefits to companies who set up or 
maintain their headquarters in the region instead of locating in 
large centres. The feeling of belonging and the sense of civic and 
social responsibility of people living in the regions are directly 
dependant on the presence of decision-makers in their 
community.
<P>
	In my riding of Abitibi, we really suffer from the sale of large 
corporations to multinational logging companies. Like my 
fellow citizens I regret the situation that resulted.
<P>
	Other conditions come into play to stimulate a region's 
activity and the government can act upon them. It can stimulate 
sectors like transport, telecommunications and support research 
in the region's socio-economic component, whether it be 
fisheries in the Maritimes, forestry in my region, or mining.
<P>
	If we want to be able to meet the challenges of tomorrow, we 
must put decentralization as a basic tool for change at the heart 
of major economic and political debates. Already implemented 
in a lot of countries, decentralization seems to be an important 
and unavoidable factor in the evolution of a modern Quebec. Its 
success relies on the political will to make local government 
responsible for certain aspects of economic, social and cultural 
development.
<P>
	The main objective of decentralization is to allow citizens to 
take over the development of their economic, social and cultural 
environment, and to give them the power, through their elected 
representatives, to influence matters of concern to them in their 
daily life.
<P>
	Not only does decentralization put governments in closer 
contact with the people, making them more able to meet the 
needs of the population, promote public  participation, and 
diminish red tape, it is also aimed at preserving local customs 
which make up a community's heritage. Thus, a central 
government finds it harder to unilaterally impose the values and 
way of thinking of national elites. However, I realize that 
decentralization is not a cure for everything that ails us, but it 
does have the merit of bringing power closer to the citizens, 
allowing them to voice their opinion on development policies 
and public administration and to have a say when the time comes 
to set priorities and choose appropriate measures.
<P>
	At the present time we are witnessing the delegation of power, 
rather than a true decentralization. In the context of a real 
decentralization, duties and responsibilities would be shifted 
onto local governments, enabling them to have a decisive 
influence on the development of their community.
<P>
	Decentralization would create conditions favourable to the 
formulation and implementation of a regional development 
strategy which would complement sectoral national policies. 
Such a strategy would maximize the potential of each region and 
identify specific sectors of activity.
<P>
	Decentralization is a form of government characterised by the 
transfer of authority from the central government to local 
governments. It rests on the free administration of territorial 
communities. I believe that it would foster long-lasting job 
creation, which in turn would lessen citizens' dependence on the 
welfare state.

	It seems like a contradiction to me and I would like to ask the

tax decreases while at the same time increasing spending on 
regional development programs.

	<B>Mr. Deshaies:</B> Mr. Speaker, to answer the question, I do not 
believe that I ever said I wanted a reduction in taxes. I did talk 
about transferring more money to the regions.
<P>
	I think the Reform Party agrees with us that this would be a 
more effective way of managing our own money, instead of 
letting outsiders make decisions that affect local communities. 
We know that people in our region are quite resourceful when it 
comes to many fields of endeavour.

	For instance, I cannot see myself telling fishermen what to do, 
because I know nothing about the fishery, just as someone who 
has no experience in the mining sector and who lives 1,000 miles 
away from the region would not be in a position to formulate 
policy for this sector.
<P>
	I apologize if I did not make myself clear and if the hon. 
member understood me to say that I wanted a reduction in taxes. 
That is not what I said. I said I want more money to be 
transferred to the regions so that they can take responsibility for 
their own future.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the hon. member for Abitibi for his intervention. I was 
very interested in his discussion about transfers. I presume we 
are talking about transfer payments, all kinds of payments that 
go from the federal government into the local provincial 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	I also listened with interest with respect to the empowerment 
of individuals within the province, in particular his province of 
Quebec. In view of that thought process I wonder if what he is 
suggesting is that with something like the equalization payment 
transfer system we should be transferring these moneys directly 
to the municipalities in the province of Quebec and not to the 
provincial government. Would that be his suggestion?
<P>

	<B>Mr. Deshaies:</B> Mr. Speaker, those who worked in regional 
development planning know that municipalities are not the only 
bodies involved. Quebec has RCMs, regional county 
municipalities, which bring together many municipalities and 
set regional priorities.
<P>
	These groups or CRDCs, which also work on joint action, all 
bring together people from a county or a region; here we are 
talking about a county as a political unit but there are also 
regional units with their own particularities. These people meet 
and set policies which they apply with the funds received. For 
example, if we in Abitibi want to promote tourism with the 
funds received, we can use those funds for economic 
development, but if the decisions are made in Montreal or 
Ottawa and they say that tourism is no longer a priority that they 
encourage, we do not qualify for funds.
<P>
	That is really how we can develop our regions, not by waiting 
for directions to come from the provincial level in Montreal or 
the national level in Ottawa. I think that the debate should be on 
this issue. We must know if each region can take charge; it is not 
a matter of knowing how much it will get. The amount can 
always be negotiated, but how it will be negotiated is the most 
important point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak on this Bloc Quebecois motion respecting regional 
development. It condemns the federal government's ineffective 
regional development interventions.
<P>
	In fact, according to the April 13, 1994, newsletter of the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, or FORD, in 
Quebec, the employment level was still 73,000 jobs short of its 
pre-recession level. Major disparities have been reported in 
documents from the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec.
<P>
	For the 1980-1992 time frame, Montreal ranked 19th out of 
25 metropolitan areas in Canada in terms of job creation. 
Montreal has the fifth highest unemployment rate of all these 
metropolitan areas.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	As far as poverty is concerned, there were 674,000 people 
living in poverty in Montreal, that is to say 370,000 more than in 
all of Atlantic Canada. And when I say this, I am by no means 
minimizing the impact of poverty on Atlantic provinces. In fact, 
I will take this opportunity to say that regional development 
programs are not hand-outs but a responsibility that all of us 
must share.
<P>
	In a speech delivered on March 8, 1994, the Minister of 
Industry stated: ``Our party and our government are clearly 
committed to economic development and job creation in the 
Montreal area''.
<P>
	How many specific measures and clear commitments 
regarding regional development in Montreal were included in 
the Minister of Finance's budget? None, not one.
<P>
	The people of Montreal will have to make do with whatever 
will trickle down to them from the $150 million fund, the 
Montreal development fund, announced in 1992 by the 
Conservative government. I did not know the Liberals were this 
happy with what the Conservatives had done.
<P>
	Not only will the FORD-Quebec be affected by 
departmental operating budget reductions, but its own transfers 
to business will be cut by $70 million, or 25 per cent of its total 
budget, over the next three years.
<P>
	Let us take a brief look at the problem in Montreal. According 
to the Federal Office, Montreal's growth is curbed by its many 
slow growth sunset industries, with few high technology 
industries which still depend mainly on military contracts.
<P>
	The Lachine Canal region, the cradle of Canadian 
industrialization, and east-end Montreal are two areas of 
chronic underemployment.
<P>
	The Island of Montreal was also left a heritage that seriously 
hampers its development: contaminated soils. According to 
experts in this field, over 5,000 hectares show environmental 
damage. In addition, the unchecked suburban development of 
Montreal has led to an urban sprawl out of proportion to its 
population.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4755"> 4755 </A></B>
<P>
	This urban sprawl has increased the burden on Montreal's 
road system and shrunk its municipal tax base.
<P>
	The City of Montreal has estimated it needs $2 billion to 
modernize its basic infrastructure. The scant $200 million 
promised under the tripartite infrastructure program will not go 
very far in resolving a problem of this magnitude. The Liberal 
government could have focused its infrastructure program on 
renovating the basic infrastructure, as the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities initially proposed.
<P>
	The federal Liberals thus abandoned an important initiative in 
the City of Montreal, the engine of Quebec, in favour of the 
shortsighted election requirements of a provincial Liberal 
government in distress.
<P>
	The regional transportation network still shows obvious 
deficiencies: chronic congestion of several road segments, 
advanced deterioration of the road infrastructure, which 
compromises the network's efficiency and safety, as well as 
discontinuity of the road network.
<P>
	Let me also mention the underutilization of the aging rail 
infrastructure. This situation seriously complicates the 
transportation of passengers and freight throughout the 
territory, thus affecting people's quality of life and the economic 
competitiveness of local businesses.
<P>
	The major transportation infrastructures, namely the two 
airports, the port and the railways, which confirm the economic 
vitality of the Montreal region on the global markets, are faced 
with a quickly and deeply changing environment.
<P>
	Practically all of these major facilities come under federal 
jurisdiction. Most of the measures that could help are the 
responsibility of this government; this is no doubt its most 
dismal record.
<P>
	But Montreal also has strengths. The first and the most 
important one by far is its people. Indeed, as the bad news kept 
hitting our people, they became more resilient. A spirit of 
solidarity developed in the neighbourhoods, and local political 
and socio-economic elites joined forces.
<P>
	In fact, a number of regional exercises were undertaken, 
including the Pichette report, as well as the 1992 conference of 
Greater Montreal mayors, whose theme referred to the Greater 
Montreal as a strong entity asserting itself. Moreover, the need 
for interregional solidarity is being recognized in every regional 
discussion and meeting in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	In that regard, the FTQ stated this, during its 1992 congress: 
``To revitalize Quebec's economy, the development of Montreal 
must not be opposed to that of the regions. Regional 
development in Quebec will have to take into account the 
regions' complementarity and promote interregional 
development''.
<P>
	The task force chaired by Mr. Claude Pichette held a vast 
consultation exercise with Montreal stakeholders,  and a clear 
wish for autonomy emerged. We must particularly point out 
regional development initiatives in urban districts by CDECs, 
which are the Corporations de développement économique 
communautaire. In this regard, it is more than desirable to 
extend agreements between the different levels of government, 
the City of Montreal, and CDECs.
<P>
	The Pichette report also pointed out that Greater Montreal's 
strategic plan had recognized the importance of the role played 
by CDECs, and in fact proposed to strengthen their means of 
action to promote job development. Indeed, the stimulation of 
employment is the primary goal of CDECs. However, these 
corporations were painfully trying to find their way around 
through the current duplicating and mess in the occupational 
training programs of the federal and the provincial 
governments. New corporations are being created in Ahuntsic 
and Côte-des-Neiges, or are in the development stage, as is the 
case in Montréal-Nord.
<P>
	Business assistance is the second sector of activity of CDECs. 
It seems however that such partnerships between the various 
levels of government, the city of Montreal and community 
organizations must be based on longer-term agreements, 
because they deal with structural problems, social as well as 
economic issues that are linked to the de-industrialization of the 
Montreal area, as was mentioned in the Pichette Report. 
Provincial and federal civil servants still have some serious 
reservations about this kind of partnership.
<P>
	In the areas of local control, development, decentralization 
and priority planning, our communities have done their share. 
The city of Montreal has actively supported them and has often 
acted on their behalf with the higher authorities. At best, 
resource allocation to the CDECs is more like a redistribution of 
old money. That means less money for everyone when resources 
are scarce. There is no will to act. Consultations with the people 
and the community organizations, interregional initiatives and 
local control must all be supported. The people in Montreal have 
learned to rely only on themselves and have shown how dynamic 
they can be.
<P>
	It is also important that the regions be in charge of their 
economic development. The federal government should yield to 
this evidence. What the regions really want is some support 
from other levels of government, and not more government 
intervention and so-called national standards. By definition, 
regions have their very own identity, they are not merely a part 
of the country. They have special features and special needs.
<P>
	Therefore, it is important that we recognize, for example, that 
the Montreal census metropolitan area is a region in its own 
right. This metropolitan area has a core city, that is Montreal, 
whose regional and international characteristics must be 
recognized and supported by its regional partners as well as by 
the higher levels of government. It is important also that the 
federal  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4756"> 4756 </A></B>
<P>
government be committed to respecting the development of this 
greater area.
<P>
	In fact, the federal government must recognize Greater 
Montreal as the ``representative of the metropolitan area'' in 
economic matters and it must coordinate its economic 
development action at the regional level. The lack of efficiency 
of the Liberal government in matters of regional development 
results in an administrative chaos and sterile overlappings 
which are harmful to the economic growth of all regions.
<P>
	I would indeed like to quote the recent figures of the 
Economic and Regional Development Agreement, or ERDA. In 
the last stages of the agreement and only a few months before it 
expired, on March 31, 1993, the two governments had spent only 
$281 million, that is just 34 per cent of the planned $820 million. 
Quebec and Ottawa are equally bad in this case. The first has 
spent only $126 million out of $380 million, that is 33 per cent 
and the other, which is the federal government, has spent only 
$155 million out of the planned $440 million, that is 35 per cent.
<P>
	Montreal has so far paid dearly for the federal government's 
lack of efficiency in matters of regional development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his comments and his speech, and for the many 
comments that he made about inter-regional solidarity and 
co-operation between regions.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	I ask the hon. member whether he feels that this same kind of 
co-operation must exist between provinces, particularly 
between Quebec and other parts of Canada, and that in fact the 
Bloc is the very reason that this kind of co-operation does not 
exist right now and that its philosophy and the way it wants to 
handle the government is one of the reasons that the solidarity 
that we need is not now there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that we have wasted a 
great deal of time talking about big national issues this morning 
when we should be concentrating on regional development. It is 
not in our best interests, in dealing with such an issue, to 
provoke one another. I am not suggesting that the hon. member 
is doing that, but we have heard this morning some remarks that 
were not particularly edifying.
<P>
	However, on that point, I do not think that we are a cause, but 
rather a consequence. Imagine, after eight or nine years of 
Conservative rule, after the GST, after the scandals, after all the 
Conservative government inflicted upon us, Quebecers still 
remembered 1982 and the Trudeau government and they did not 
trust the Liberal Party. The Liberals keep talking about the red 
book. Quebecers rejected the red book in the last election.  
During the campaign, every single analyst in English Canada 
seemed to take pleasure in saying that there would not even be 
ten members of the Bloc in this House after the October election.
<P>
	The people from Quebec have a very good memory and, in 
that respect, some great measures have to be taken. In 
committee, I had an opportunity to talk with the clerk of the 
Privy Council, who told me about the need to strike a balance 
after Charlottetown. There is no proposal on the table. Where is 
that balance between the regions and the federal government? 
The parliamentary secretary who got all worked up about 
Quebec's independence a few moments ago-I do not want to 
mention his name-has a vision of a united Canada. He is 
entitled to his vision, which I respect, but that vision has been 
rejected and continues to be rejected. How are we going to strike 
a balance between English Canada, which thought that the 
Charlottetown Accord gave Quebec too much power, and 
Quebec, which thought that the offers on the table were nothing 
but crumbs?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais 
(Madawaska-Victoria):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
the Bloc member who agrees with me that regional development 
programs, particularly the one for Atlantic Canada -which 
benefits the Gaspé Peninsula to a certain extent-are not 
hand-outs like the Reform member said, drawing heavy 
applause from some Bloc members.
<P>
	I would like to stress that, indeed, Canadians and Quebecers 
have a good memory. As far as regional development policies 
are concerned, I remember the time when I lived in the Quebec 
North Shore area in the 1970s. It underwent a true industrial, 
economic and social revolution with the help of a Liberal 
government in Ottawa. I remember that vividly. But some 
people have a very selective memory. They remember things 
that may not have been really needed at the time, but they 
seldom remember and praise good things that were done. This is 
a case of selective memory.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	As concerns the remarks of the hon. member, I would like to 
mention that, as the member for Madawaska-Victoria, New 
Brunswick, I am not part of what he calls English Canada. Mr. 
Speaker, there is no such thing as an English Canada and a 
French Canada. There is one Canada from coast to coast, one 
nation made up of founding peoples and immigrants, a nation of 
which we are all extremely proud.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Ahuntsic has the 
floor for the same period of time as the hon. member who just 
spoke.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4757"> 4757 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> That is a lot, thank you. Listen, we are caught 
in a confrontation dynamic. The time for negotiation is over. 
The federal government as well as the sovereigntists want to 
settle the question once and for all, they want to put the question 
to Quebecers. I believe that it is fundamental that they do it. I 
was among those Quebec nationalists who believed in the ``beau 
risque'', the risk worth taking, who where criticized by people 
like the parliamentary secretary-I know, I cannot say who has 
now returned-but who were also criticized for their stand on 
the Meech Lake Accord. An agreement was possible, as if it was 
always-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> What has that to do with my 
comments? You are not answering what I said!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> No, but it does not matter.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No question was asked!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Daviault:</B> No question was asked. Comments were made 
on the Meech Lake Accord and the member who has a unitarian 
view.
<P>
	Canada is composed of regions. Quebec is a society made up 
of all its citizens. In this society, a francophone nation has 
developed and acquired an identity. These people call 
themselves Québécois. There is a Quebec nation just as there is 
an Acadian nation. It is very clear to me, and when I speak, it is 
mostly for Quebecers.
<P>
	My ancestor is of Italian origin, and his name was Davia. He 
was a mercenary for the king of France. He liked this country, 
and stayed. This country is mine. We were French Canadians. 
We are now Quebecers. We tried to get an agreement, we really 
did. Now the big question has to be put. The federal government 
does not want to make any new proposal. Sovereigntists want to 
take another road, and Quebecers will have to decide.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont):</B> Mr. Speaker, dear 
colleagues, I am very happy today that my colleagues from the 
Opposition have picked this day to discuss an issue that is very 
dear to me, that is, of course, regional development and regional 
development policies.
<P>
	I want to tell you from the start that this issue is dear to me 
because, now that I am the member for Outremont, I am 
extremely proud to represent that riding which I cherish. I must 
say that to sit as the member for Outremont, with all the history 
of that riding, gives me, as they say in Quebec, a thrill and I feel 
very proud.
<P>
	However, I must emphasize that I am also from an area of 
Quebec, more precisely La Malbaie, in the riding of Charlevoix, 
which is far from the major centres. I must underline to the 
Speaker that, being from that area, I became familiar with all the 
problems of regional development and all that they entail. 
Indeed, I want to tell you that one of the reasons why I joined the 
Liberal Party was in fact because of its great openness towards 
regional development policies.
<P>
	You know, Mr. Speaker, Canada as such, and it is being said 
regularly, because these days I have had the  chance to travel 
throughout Quebec, I must be travelling all over Quebec at least 
once a month, these days, Canada as a whole is a huge cultural 
patchwork, and we regularly say it loud and clear, but it is also, 
if I may say so, a geographical patchwork.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	There often are regional disparities within the same region. It 
is fortunate that Canada is a cultural and geographical mosaic. It 
is for this reason that Canada is what it is. It is for this reason 
that Canada is such an attractive counry. It is for this reason that 
Canada shines everywhere in the world. It is for this reason that 
so many people visit Canada.
<P>
	I joined the Liberal Party because, since my early chilhood, 
the Liberal Party has always symbolised this openness to what 
we really are, essentially a great country which has to be united 
and a great country whose regions must be respected.
<P>
	Today, when you look at what is going on in the world, it is 
clear that we are faced with globalization which of course 
involves the whole issue of cultural and economic co-operation.
<P>
	The Liberal government understood the key to the future for 
us in Canada. The key to the future lies in the great principles of 
co-operation. Since October 25, we have taken a very open 
approach to consultation and co-operation. As far as I am 
concerned, this is the key to the future and this is the approach 
taken by the government.
<P>
	When speaking of consultation and co-operation with 
partners, we mean of course private enterprise. We also mean 
the various levels of government. The Liberal government of 
Mr. Chrétien understood that we had to be united in order to 
build something. It put forward several principles, already 
contained in the Martin budget, to improve and enhance 
co-operation between federal, provincial and municipal 
governments.
<P>
	As you know, and I mentioned that earlier, the Infrastructure 
Program is an eloquent example of that new policy and that new 
philosophy. The program is also an outstanding success.
<P>
	As you know, the idea of co-operation is not new to the 
federal government and the Liberal Party in particular. As early 
as 1974, governments began to implement what was called 
general agreements on regional co-operation and development. 
The same year, two of those agreements were successively 
implemented in co-operation with the provinces and in 
particular the one I represent, the province of Quebec. All those 
initiatives were created to allow for an appropriate exchange of 
information to save money but also, as was well acknowledged 
and publicly known, to better serve the Canadians, because we 
must not forget that the primary goal of any government is to 
provide services. This is why our philosophy is based on 
consultation, which makes it possible to better understand the 
needs of each area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4758"> 4758 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, we are trying to create harmony between the 
various levels of government and I must say that we are also 
trying to create harmony within our own system, the federal 
system, and within our institutions. I would like to say that right 
now Mr. Chrétien's government is making considerable 
efforts-and efforts were made previously-to eliminate any 
form of overlapping, first of all at the federal level. I must say 
also that since 1974, a fantastic co-operation has emerged 
between the provinces and the federal government which has led 
to various side agreements in various areas that I will name.
<P>
	For instance, there have been agreements between Quebec 
and federal departments, and I am not referring to general 
agreements including both governments in the broader sense, 
but rather agreements at the departmental level, that is between 
provincial and federal departments.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The areas that have been affected, Mr. Speaker, are the 
following ones. For example, we can talk about an industrial 
agreement and side agreements on tourism, culture, forests, 
minerals, agri-food, communications and fisheries, 
transportation, science and technology.
<P>
	I am proud to say that today, because it is the way to go. 
Recently, the government showed once again that it is the way to 
go. It showed that dialogue and believing in a country and in a 
system can give rise to very interesting results for all regions in 
Canada.
<P>
	Recently, for instance, on April 18, an agreement called St. 
Lawrence Vision 2000 Agreement was announced. That 
agreement involves several departments at the federal level and 
implies some co-operation with various levels of government.
<P>
	The proposed agreement will cost $191 million and will be 
based on protecting and cleaning up the St. Lawrence River, 
which is an essential waterway for the economic development of 
the eastern part of the country and also for the economic 
development of Quebec.
<P>
	Within the context of the St. Lawrence Vision 2000 
Agreement, I would like to give you a list of the departments 
involved at the federal and provincial levels. And then people 
will argue that the system in which we live cannot work 
properly.
<P>
	Of course when you come to the House of Commons with the 
defeatist attitude that the present system does not work, you 
cannot build anything on that premise. I wonder how you could 
build an independent Quebec with people whose outlook is so 
pessimistic.
<P>
	To get back to federal-provincial co-operation, the St. 
Lawrence Vision 2000 Agreement involved the following 
departments and agencies: at the federal level, Environment 
Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Health and Welfare 
Canada, Agricultural and Agri-Food Canada, Canadian 
Heritage, the Federal Office of Regional Development; and, at 
the provincial level, in Quebec, Environment and Wildlife, 
Health, Social  Services, Agriculture, Fisheries, Food and 
Municipal Affairs.
<P>
	As you know, since the Chrétien government came to power, 
one of its policies has been to help small business. With the 
advent of globalization, small businesses must adjust to the new 
international focus on markets. If you look around, not just in 
the province of Quebec but all over Canada, and if you go and 
talk to owners of small businesses in their communities, as I did 
in recent months, you will see that they realize their future will 
depend on consultation and co-operation with various sectors in 
the community and with various levels of government. As many 
business owners will tell you, they really have no choice.
<P>
	They have no choice because today, the changes taking place 
in the economy, technology and business, in the broadest sense 
of the word, are occurring at an incredible rate. Today, 
networking is not a luxury but a necessity in order to exchange 
information and become more competitive and more efficient.
<P>
	Small businesses in Canada have the right attitude, an attitude 
that is in line with what the present government would like to 
see, since it reflects the international context of our markets. In 
the eighties, Canada signed a free trade agreement with the 
United States. Not long ago, this government signed a North 
American Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	We also know that as a result of GATT, the economy is 
becoming increasingly globalized, because the terms of this 
agreement provide for eliminating all forms of tariff barriers. 
Incidentally, I read some books by a number of politicians in 
Quebec not long ago, and according to them-this is not a direct 
quote because I do not have the text in front of me-because of 
globalization, the way of future might be a world federation, an 
international federation that would eventually unite all 
countries.
<P>
	We in the federal government have understood the need to 
look ahead and consider the broader perspective. One of the 
federal government's current instruments to help the regions, 
and one of which I am particularly proud and which is headed by 
the Minister of Finance, the Hon. Paul Martin, is the Federal 
Office of Regional Development for Quebec, an instrument that 
we as a government use to implement what we call regional 
development policies.
<P>
	There is a connection with small business, because as you 
know, not long ago, the Minister of Finance made a speech, and 
a very good one, on the new philosophy of the Federal Office of 
Regional Development for Quebec, and he clearly indicated that 
we would put the emphasis on small business. And why should 
we stress small business in our regional development policies? 
For the simple reason that since the end of the seventies, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4759"> 4759 </A></B>
<P>
companies with fewer than 100 employees are those that 
benefited from government assistance and that generated 2.3 
million jobs in Canada, that is 87 per cent of the total  number of 
jobs created in this country. It does not take a genius to realize 
that adequate knowledge of the community and support for 
small business are the two pillars of regional development.
<P>
	I am proud of this initiative to support small business, 
because small businesses always have closer ties with the 
community, and history has shown they are also better able to 
weather a recession. And a small business is usually more loyal 
to its employees. These are businesses which, as they diversify, 
will provide Quebec and Canada with a reliable economic 
infrastructure that will make it possible for us to think globally.
<P>
	Not long ago, we went ahead, as we said we would during the 
election campaign and as Mr. Martin explained on numerous 
occasions, we went ahead with pre-budget consultations, a very 
open process aimed at implementing the government's new 
philosophy on co-operation and consultation. Its purpose was to 
ask the public what it expected of the government generally in 
terms of budgetary policy.
<P>
	One fact to clearly emerge from this consultation process is 
that people really do want us to provide assistance to the 
regions. However, the government did receive one very clear 
message, namely that the public no longer wants it to intervene 
on a massive scale and to pour large sums of money, often 
unwisely, into useless programs which fall by the wayside after 
a certain period of time.
<P>
	Proud of this consultative process, the minister has given a 
new mandate to the FORDQ for which he is responsible and has 
retargeted this office's objectives. The end result is that the 
regional development policy advocated by the FORDQ is 
tailored to the people's demands. Clearly it is much more 
focused and as such, it will be much more effective.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Among other things, the FORDQ will focus on innovative 
actions such as technology transfers, design, formative regional 
projects, in particular, I might add, in the field of tourism. 
Efforts will be made to provide assistance to businesses to help 
them compete internationally and to get plugged in to the 
information highway.
<P>
	Therefore, provided consultation takes place and the 
government is positive and open, we can succeed. Canada is 
currently making preparations to confront the markets of the 
21st century. I find it odd to see members of the Bloc draw 
comparisons which are often weak between Canada and the 
European Economic Community.
<P>
	For example, Mr. Bouchard mentioned that a sovereign 
Quebec would use the US dollar just as the Europeans do. That is 
a very lame comparison indeed. For starters, the European 
Economic Community is an economic union which seeks to 
develop political ties. We are one step ahead of the game since 
we already have these political ties. However, the European 
economic union will use a common currency, the ECU, not the  
currency of one of the 12 member countries, unlike what Mr. 
Bouchard was suggesting when he said Quebec would use the 
US dollar, the currency of one of the countries in North America, 
as if Quebecers were a colonized people.
<P>
	I will not deny that the current system is not perfect, but with 
some consultation and some fine-tuning, we can effectively 
build a competitive Canada and Quebec for the future. However, 
if we embrace the view of the members of the official 
opposition, we will be looking ahead to constitutional debates 
which, even after a future vote on Quebec's separation, could 
drag on for five or ten years. This is valuable time. Important 
technological changes are taking place and we must not miss the 
boat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was amazed to hear the hon. member for Outremont 
mention, at the very end of his remarks, that the European 
Community was taking the same road as Canada. I find that 
quite extraordinary, since the great strength of the European 
Economic Community lies in the fact it is made up of sovereign 
states.
<P>
	I would like the leader of the government, the Prime 
Minister-because this is certainly not something the hon. 
member for Outremont would do-to go before the French 
National Assembly and tell the people of France that they are 
taking the same road as Canada and that, ten years from now, 
France will no longer be a sovereign state. I would like to see the 
Prime Minister stand in front of the Bundestag, in Berlin, and 
tell the Germans that their country is on the way to losing its 
sovereign status. I would like to see him do the same thing in 
Westminster. It is really double talk. I imagine that the Prime 
Minister would be advised against making such a speech. 
Perhaps he would come to that conclusion himself.
<P>
	Let us take a look at what serious international figures have to 
say, people like Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary 
General of the United Nations, who told us in Montreal that 
there are two main tendencies in the world today: one toward 
nations and peoples forming into countries and the other toward 
the same countries getting together to form larger economic 
entities. That is what is happening in Quebec and what the 
Liberals were objecting to during the debate on free trade. They 
ran the 1988 election on opposing free trade in the name of 
Canadian nationalism. All is very well to talk about nationalism 
in reference to Canada, but in reference to Quebec, it becomes a 
mortal sin. I find this double talk rather strange.

<P>
	These people-even the Liberal members of the National 
Assembly in Quebec City, and in their case it is 
shameful-refuse to recognize Quebec as a nation. And yet, 
they are sitting in the Quebec National Assembly. As far as I 
know, national, as in National Assembly, refers to a nation. If 
Quebec were not not a nation, but a society, then it would have 
been called the Societal Assembly!
<P>
	This name was voted by a Premier who headed the Union 
nationale-National Union. So, I would like to know what the 
hon. member for Outremont is saying exactly. Is Quebec 
currently a nation within the Canadian federal system or is it not 
a nation?
<P>
	If not, will he commit to advise his Liberal colleagues in 
Quebec City to change the name of the Quebec National 
Assembly? It is sheer nonsense to call it that if Quebec is not a 
nation! I would like him to comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would just like to 
stress how sorry I am to hear opposition members say that, as 
members from Quebec, we should be ashamed of saying this or 
that just because they think we do not share their philosophy. I 
can tell you right off the bat, Mr. Speaker, that, as a Quebecer 
and a young politician from the new generation, I have always 
been proud to respect the opinion of my political opponents 
because even if I do not agree with their philosophy, some of 
their ideas can certainly result in things that could benefit all of 
Quebec and all of Canada.
<P>
	The only thing I ask in return from the opposition party is to 
respect my philosophy which, of course, puts Quebec within 
Canada.
<P>
	Having said that, before I come to the national issue, the hon. 
member tried to make fun of my position on the European 
Economic Community. I want to tell you that I studied the EEC 
for a year in England and if I may-you can thank me if you 
want-it is obvious to everyone that the 12 members of the 
EEC-that number may soon go up to 16-are sovereign 
countries linked by an economic union with the four categories 
of movement; it is an open secret.
<P>
	However, what I was saying-and I cannot comprehend why 
the hon. member does not understand-is that they tried, 
especially during the Gulf War, to establish non-economic links 
between themselves to build the Europe of tomorrow.
<P>
	Whether we are talking about the ECU or the collective 
foreign policy they put to the test during the Gulf War, I think it 
is a step beyond the economic links. In essence, what I am now 
saying is that our economic links within Canada will soon be 
much better because, by the end of June, we will have an 
agreement with the federal government and all the other 
provinces on interprovincial economic trade.
<P>
	I hope this will lead to freedom of action in the four existing 
categories of movement. In Canada, we also have  political ties 
provided for in the Canadian Constitution and I say that there is 
a certain similarity between the two. Europe is building a union 
which may eventually lead to shared political sovereignty, we 
do not know.
<P>
	Now Canada, which has had a very rewarding union, is 
essentially refining the internal ties. You know, we live in a 
framework that has proven itself. We have experience with 
regional development policy so that we can sit down and set 
appropriate policies for tomorrow, whereas the opposition party 
talks about separation and sovereignty and anything you want, 
but when the time comes to say clearly what a sovereign Quebec 
would be, we run into a Berlin wall; that is, we get no answer 
because they do not know themselves what a sovereign Quebec 
would be-it is total uncertainty. That is why I feel somewhat 
humiliated as a Quebecer when I see Lucien Bouchard cross the 
Atlantic to ask the French government for its blessing on 
separation, Mr. Speaker, even before the people of Quebec have 
voted in the next election and before the plan for separation has 
been explained to them and they have given an answer in a 
referendum, which is now very hypothetical.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	I feel rather colonized, even though it is a word that 
disappeared from our vocabulary in the 1960s, when Lesage was 
in power. I feel rather colonized when I see Lucien Bouchard go 
to see the French and treat Quebecers like sheep and ask the 
French government for its blessing for a separate Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to the hon. member for Outremont and I heard him refer to a new 
generation of politicians. However, I must say that, based on his 
answers, he looks a lot more like an old traditional politician.
<P>
	I have another question for him, but first I want to make a 
comment. I have other questions on regional development, but I 
want to go back to a remark made by the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> They are sovereign states.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> When the hon. member discusses an hypothetical 
issue and refers to the possibility of a sovereign Quebec and to 
Europe, he must not forget, as the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie just pointed out, that these are all 
sovereign states.
<P>
	As for us, we want the Quebec of tomorrow to be open to the 
world and to be a free trader. Who is inward-looking? The hon. 
member is the one who alluded to a Berlin wall and who is 
saying that Canadians will refuse to be free trade partners with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4761"> 4761 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec. It is not Quebecers who are making these comments; it 
is members opposite who represent the rest of Canada.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member: As a young Quebec MP representing 
Outremont and a new generation, is he young or old? Are his 
ideas young or old? This is what is important. Personally, as a 
young person, I am deeply hurt by his comments, because what I 
hear from people of my generation has nothing to do with these 
very partisan remarks. I ask the hon. member: In his opinion, is 
Quebec a nation? I ask him to give a clear answer and not digress 
from the issue. The question is very clear to those listening to us. 
Does the hon. member feel, as a Quebec MP representing the 
riding of Outremont in Montreal, that Quebec is a nation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, members opposite are 
once again hurling insults, calling me an old style politician. At 
thirty-one, that is hardly the case. I think my view of the 
situation is entirely up to date. Nevertheless, I respect the views 
of the Bloc Quebecois, even if its members do not respect mine.
<P>
	That being said, I will answer the nation question when the 
Bloc Quebecois has-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Let me finish. When the Bloc 
Quebecois-Remember, I am the member for Outremont and as 
a member from Quebec, I am very concerned about the 
hypothetical referendum debate they are trying to launch 
prematurely, a debate that does not respect the views of the 
entire population of Quebec.
<P>
	I will answer this question as soon as they explain what they 
mean by separation. And as soon as they decide what they want 
to call it: separation, sovereignty, sovereignty association. As 
soon as they decide to be intellectually honest with the people of 
Quebec, whom I represent, we can talk about serious matters. In 
any case, answering this particular question might take as long 
as an hour, something like Cyrano de Bergerac!
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I see another member who wants to ask 
a question. Is there unanimous consent for extending this 
period? I asked a question. Is there unanimous consent for 
extending this period?
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We will resume debate. Unfortunately, 
the time for questions and comments has expired. The hon. 
member for Trois-Rivières, on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to take part in this debate which, understandably, 
arouses passions. First of all, I would like to congratulate my 
colleague from Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup for his motion 
which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the federal government's ineffective regional 
development interventions, which create overlappings and inconsistencies, 
resulting in an administrative chaos that hampers regional economic growth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As we have seen, the debate can easily become acrimonious 
because it illustrates perfectly the problems of the federal 
system. As I said, it arouses passions because it reveals the 
intrinsic adversarial elements associated with the operations of 
two governments in the same field. Frankly, what interests us in 
regional development is the way the federal is involved in 
Quebec. We have conflicting interests; the Quebec government 
requests overall control of programs because it is responsible 
for development within its territory, while the federal 
government justifies its involvement by saying that one of its 
roles is to lessen regional disparities and uses its spending 
power, at times improperly.
<P>
	It intervenes in various ways in regional development, 
through institutions which duplicate the work of similar Quebec 
institutions, thereby creating duplications, frictions, waste and 
confusion. I can give you a few examples.
<P>
	The Federal Office of Regional Development is in direct 
competition with the regional secretariat for development and 
the regional development councils which have a program called 
business assistance fund. There is competition between the two 
institutions which have the same clients.
<P>
	In the area of technological development, the National 
Research Council, which targets small businesses, is in 
competition with the Quebec department of industry and trade 
and its program Innovation PME. So we have two structures and 
two budgets and we therefore expend twice the energy.
<P>
	In the area of training seminars for small businesses we have 
on the one hand the Federal Business Development Bank and on 
the other the Quebec department of industry. These are two 
structures which invite the same persons to the same kind of 
courses.
<P>
	Then, there is the well-known area of vocational training. 
Everybody in Quebec agrees that this area is a mess. On one side 
we have the pretensions and the budgets of Employment and 
Immigration, and on the other the Société québécoise de la 
main-d'oeuvre, which has become an almost empty shell 
because of the federal-provincial conflict in the area of 
vocational training.
<P>
	In a blatant disregard for the federal government, there is in 
Quebec a strong consensus among employers and employees, 
and all the parties involved, both at the public and para-public 
levels, to make vocational training the exclusive jurisdiction of 
the province.
<P>
	As long as we remain part of it, we would like the federal 
structure to abolish all its training programs and to transfer their 
budgets to Quebec or, at the very least, to put these programs at 
the disposal of the Quebec structure already in place in every 
region.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4762"> 4762 </A></B>
<P>
	I should add that when we talk about regional development, 
we do not mean just administrative structures or 
federal-provincial agreements.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	It is also something much larger, something which includes 
activities as well as institutions having, through their operation, 
a direct influence on regional development.
<P>
	There are sectors which interest me particularly. The whole 
area of industrial conversion has an influence on regional 
development. The same applies to transportation, all the 
transportation policies-and I could give you in a moment some 
examples which affect directly my riding of 
Trois-Rivières-whether they apply to marine, air or rail 
transportation.
<P>
	There are direct implications for regional development. We 
will see that recent decisions and government inaction have also 
had a direct impact on regional development.
<P>
	When it comes to industrial conversion, it is very sad, not to 
say deplorable, to see, week after week, the lack of political will 
on the part of the present Liberal government. The 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Industry, who is 
directly concerned, is here. He can hear me. He knows what our 
position is in this matter.
<P>
	It is an issue of the highest priority, and yet the minister seems 
to want to wash his hands of it. The situation is critical. Since 
1987, in Quebec alone, 11,000 high-tech jobs have been lost. 
We cannot repeat it enough, it is totally unacceptable. It is 
nothing short of a large scale brain drain. People who deserve to 
work and should work, are no longer needed. The resulting 
higher unemployment is going to drive them away. The 
government must act now.
<P>
	It cannot stand on the side line as it is doing now, claiming 
that it is waiting for boards of directors to submit their business 
plans to it. It must summon them, act as a catalyst, shame them 
in the public interest and ask them what they intend to do, given 
the geopolitical changes which are sweeping the world, and the 
fact that all over the western world, defence budgets are being 
cut. What does the private sector intend to do? We believe that it 
is up to the government to find out.
<P>
	I forgot to mention that as far as R &amp; D is concerned, the 
federal government has a leading role to play in terms of 
regional development. It must ensure that R &amp; D funding is 
evenly distributed throughout Quebec, especially among 
university research centres and researchers. This will attract 
scientists who will improve the quality of life of people in each 
region and contribute to a richer and more articulate community 
life.
<P>
	I will now raise the issue of transportation, starting with water 
transport. It is common knowledge that the federal Department 
of Transport is entertaining serious thoughts about privatizing 
all Coast Guard operations in  the St. Lawrence or even about 
making shipowners pick up the tab for Coast Guard services in 
the near future.
<P>
	If ever shipowners were required to pay for these services, it 
is not difficult to imagine the impact such a decision would have 
on all St. Lawrence ports, especially the port of Trois-Rivières. 
What is to become of Quebec ports and how will be they fare 
compared to ports where there is no Coast Guard, with ports in 
Eastern Canada or with U.S. ports?
<P>
	If ever this decision was carried out, we would no longer be 
talking about regional development, but rather about regional 
anti-development. This decision could have some serious 
repercussions and all stakeholders must be very vigilant and 
oppose any such action.
<P>
	With respect to air transportation, another issue which 
directly concerns my riding of Trois-Rivières in which a 
regional airport is located, Transport Canada's policy has been 
to divest itself of its airport assets. In a riding like my own, this 
issue has been under consideration for ten years. During the 
Liberal Trudeau era, the question was being reviewed and the 
repercussions are still being weighed today. Yet, a regional 
corporation is willing to take over the running of the airport and 
it is waiting for the two levels of government, federal and 
provincial, to agree on the fate of this facility. In the meantime, 
equipment is not being properly maintained and the situation is 
extremely dangerous.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I have been told that the electrical wiring is outdated and that 
the cracks are getting bigger every year. This could prove 
hazardous to the member for Saint-Maurice who occasionally 
flies in to visit his constituents and stops by in my riding. In any 
case, the Minister of Transport would simply be showing some 
common sense by taking steps to ensure that the Trois-Rivières 
airport is in good condition.
<P>
	Lastly, with respect to rail transportation, we sense that there 
is no political will on the part of the government to proceed with 
the high-speed train project. The conditions in our regions, 
including mine where the unemployment rate stands at 12.2 per 
cent, a ridiculously high level for 1994, are unacceptable. This 
illustrates the complexity of the federal system and the lack of 
political will. It also shows how the federal government's focus 
is more on centralization and maintaining a unitarian system. 
Quebecers will have to choose. Either they will choose to remain 
a province much like any other province, smaller and more 
regionalized than ever before within the post-referendum, 
unitarian Canada of the future, or they will choose to become the 
masters of their own destiny and become a sovereign nation, as 
others before them have done.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would say to the member for 
Trois-Riviéres that I have enjoyed working with him in the last 
three months in the industry committee where on behalf of all 
the small businessmen and women of this country, every region 
of Canada, we have worked hard as a team trying to access 
capital for small and medium size business.
<P>
	I believe it was an example where the member for 
Trois-Riviéres was not just thinking of the people in his riding 
or his province, but working on behalf of all Canadian small 
businessmen and women.
<P>
	When I stand in the House today and say that I am totally 
opposed to separating this country and destroying this country, 
it is absolutely nothing personal. My difference of opinion is 
nothing personal with the member.
<P>
	I believe this debate today is about spending power: Who has 
the spending power and who speaks for Canada in Quebec.
<P>
	I have always believed that the best way to serve the 
disadvantaged regions was by having a strong national 
government so that from time to time when regions which were 
creating more wealth than others needed that wealth to be 
shared, this Chamber would say through budget and public 
policy: ``Listen, B.C., Alberta and Ontario, you are doing better 
right now so we must share that with either Atlantic Canada or 
share it with Quebec''. That has been the history and that has 
been the practice.
<P>
	Whenever we worked as a unit in the House of Commons with 
a strong national government, especially under Prime Minister 
Pierre Trudeau, the people of Quebec prospered.
<P>
	Does the member for Trois-Riviéres not believe that the 
decentralized Government of Canada instrument FORD-Q 
working on the ground in Quebec is the best hope for looking 
after some of those very special needs that the member cited in 
his speech today?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by thanking 
my colleague from Broadview-Greenwood for his nice 
comments on my role on the committee but it shows a little my 
mentality and probably that of many of my colleagues with 
respect to the relations that will have to be maintained in the 
future between two sovereign peoples. I think that the courteous 
and the civil thing to do would be to deal with each other on an 
equal footing without hate or prejudice. That is what I am used 
to. The quality and experience of the membership of the 
committee my colleague sits on also helped.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	In response to the question, I think that with every passing 
year it becomes more obvious that this country has reached a 
dead end. What I have noticed in recent  weeks, perhaps during 
the opposition leader's international travels, is that English 
Canadians seem to have discovered the sovereigntist movement, 
as though it started with Mr. Parizeau, leader of the Opposition 
in Quebec, and the member for Lac-Saint-Jean, Leader of the 
Opposition in this House. In fact, the sovereigntist movement 
has been around in Quebec since Confederation and as you 
know, there was no referendum before Quebec became a 
Canadian province. If I remember correctly, it passed by one 
vote among the Quebec representatives here in Canada's 
Parliament.
<P>
	What strikes me is that we may have to question the role of the 
media in the evolution of the debate. Incidentally, 30 years ago 
here in Ottawa, there was the Laurendeau-Dunton Royal 
Commission.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills:</B> Mr. Trudeau was not a separatist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> No, I am talking about the sovereigntist 
movement that has been evolving for the past 30 years. I myself 
have been a sovereigntist since 1961. I was a member of the 
Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale, or union for 
national independence. The Laurendeau-Dunton report, which 
referred to the two solitudes, was published in 1963. We are not 
inventing anything, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Four other royal commissions examined the patient and all 
came to more or less lame conclusions that promoted the growth 
of the sovereigntist movement. Why? Because first of all, we are 
a nation and now that we are better educated, we want to become 
a member of the United Nations. On the other hand, in this 
Canada we are condemned to always remain a minority if we 
stay in Confederation.
<P>
	So, in my opinion as a long-time sovereigntist, these are the 
two main points underlying all our arguments. The sovereigntist 
movement is not, as has recently been suggested on 
French-language television, ``a burst of pressure from the 
Quebec people'' but, on the contrary, a fire that has been stoked 
up for a long time. The ashes are smoldering, the fire is hot, and 
Quebecers will soon decide on their future in a democratic 
fashion, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is good.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on this Official Opposition day to speak on 
regional development. My remarks will focus on the Laurentian 
region, a major part of which is in my riding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4764"> 4764 </A></B>
<P>
	The situation faced by individuals in my region is very 
serious. In April 1994, the unemployment rate was 16.6 per cent. 
Add to that all employable welfare recipients who are out of 
work and this rate easily rises to 30 something per cent. One 
person out of three is out of work.
<P>
	In Saint-Jérôme, a major regional center, the average annual 
income of renting households was $22,835, while the provincial 
average was $28,136. That is $5,500 less. In Saint-Jérôme, one 
household out of four spends over 30 per cent of its income on 
housing. Things are even worse for 20 per cent of these, or 1,340 
households, since 50 per cent of their income has to be used on 
housing. Most of these households, or 66 per cent, are lead by 
single mothers.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	These figures are telling. They speak volumes about the 
conditions that cause an escalation in poverty, hunger and health 
problems. These problems are increasingly palpable as they set 
in and take on proportions never seen before.
<P>
	This account of the situation of the people in my region 
clearly shows a declining economy. For several years now, there 
has been no growth. We are justified in looking seriously into 
the whole issue of regional development, because, as we can see, 
it clearly does not meet its primary goal, which is to enable 
people to live comfortably in their regions.
<P>
	The federal government was not successful in developing my 
region. The regional economic base is crumbling in spite of 
massive injection of money under general agreements. The 
social fabric is disintegrating, rural migration is continuing and 
young people are the first to leave their regions.
<P>
	Developed regions, major centres, are expanding at the 
expense of regional resources. The problem can be readily 
identified on site and all those concerned are unanimous in 
denouncing the cause.
<P>
	The interference of the federal government in the 
development of my region is causing horrendous administrative 
chaos, costly duplication and inconsistency. Development, 
which entails consultation, joint action and harmonization, is 
not designed by the federal government to accommodate these 
notions.
<P>
	On the contrary, the government moves in and acts as if it 
owned the place. It does not examine the situation. It does not 
consult people. It does not have any regard for what has been 
accomplished so far. Even worse, they are incoherent and 
illogical in their regional development policies.
<P>
	I have a specific example for you. In my riding, in a small 
municipality, the federal government, through the Federal 
Office of Regional Development, FORD, asked hoteliers and 
innkeepers to come up with plans to renovate their outdated and 
run-down facilities and to harmonize them with the 
development of a major private  ski resort then under way. The 
hoteliers and innkeepers produced these projects and plans in 
the expectation of federal financial support under APDA, the 
Assistance Program for Designated Areas.
<P>
	These people did their homework seriously. The first step was 
taken; it only remains to carry out the projects. Unfortunately, 
they are still waiting and uncertain, since there is no money for 
this program. What good planning! What consistency! It is as if 
you drew up plans for a house but stayed outside because you did 
not have money to build it. These business people have been 
sorely misled.
<P>
	Now let us look at strategic development plans. All regions of 
Quebec recently adopted such plans for themselves. They are 
drawn up in concert with the RCMs, local stakeholders and 
regional sectoral organizations. These plans are based on 
consultation and co-operation. They were developed very 
carefully, following a very thorough process to consult all local 
and regional interest groups.
<P>
	What disturbs many community stakeholders is the lack of 
concern and of consideration for these plans shown by federal 
agencies and departments. All federal officials in the regions 
have these plans, but they never replied or bothered to compare 
their point of view with what the regions want and consider 
important and strategic for their development.
<P>
	Even worse, since it did not consult the various interested 
parties in the regions, the federal government, through FORD, 
went so far as to have a firm of consultants draw up its own 
regional plans and this firm used data provided by the producers 
of the regional plans. This borders on fraud and is certainly a 
shameful waste of public money.
<P>
	It is another fine example of duplication and, even more, an 
illustration of federal contempt and disrespect for Quebec's 
regions and the interest groups that seriously spent so much 
energy and money to come up with a clear vision for their 
regional development.
<P>
	The federal government must change its approach to regional 
development. I am not talking here about section 25's or DEPs, 
which can be termed the welfare approach to regional 
development. I am talking about export assistance programs, 
technological development support programs, the program to 
help disadvantaged regions and so on. I am talking about 
programs which have real impact on regional development and 
are in no way linked to the regions' initiatives.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	I would like to make a digression about international markets 
to indicate that the regions are already selling goods and 
services on these markets. Given these facts, you have to agree 
that the federal government should review its regional 
development policies and harmonize its actions with those of 
the regions 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4765"> 4765 </A></B>
<P>
which are already taking into consideration the new situation on 
the world market.
<P>
	In matters of regional development, the federal government's 
record is far from brilliant. I think they should go back to the 
drawing board and fast. For the taxpayers, it is sad to see how the 
government is wasting their money.
<P>
	Harmonious regional development requires more consistency 
in the actions of all levels of government. Given its inefficiency 
in this area, the best thing the federal government could do is to 
withdraw from this jurisdiction, as all social and economic 
experts have asked him to do, and to transfer to the province of 
Quebec all the funds allocated to the economic development 
programs which have some regional impact.
<P>
	Of course, a sovereign Quebec would resolve this issue.

	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was following the remarks made by the hon. member and she 
demonstrated that there are no good and effective 
federal-regional development programs.
<P>
	I was looking forward to examples from her province that 
would benefit the federal government so those could be 
implemented in all regions.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would be good enough to give us 
some examples of what the government in her province 
implemented for regional development within the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I just gave an example from my 
riding, but throughout Quebec and Canada there are several such 
examples of overlapping and duplication. The hon. member 
could probably provide examples from his own riding.
<P>
	I will not give him any additional example, but I do know that, 
particularly in my region and in Quebec, there are enormous 
problems. The FORD is not doing what it should, while Quebec 
is doing its job. I am sure that if the hon. member checks, he will 
find similar problems in his region.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's speech is in perfect agreement with 
the findings of a gallup poll to the effect that 82 per cent of 
Quebecers feel the Liberals are not managing the economy 
efficiently; 60 per cent of British Columbians think the same, as 
well as 52 per cent of Maritimers, 49 per cent of Westerners and 
48 per cent of Ontarians.
<P>
	This poll shows that the farther they live from the national 
capital, the further you are from Ottawa, the more unsatisfied 
people are. Does the hon. member not see this as a confirmation 
that government programs for regional development, not only in 
Quebec but also in the Maritimes and in the West, absolutely do 
not meet the specific needs of these regions, and that these 
national programs are not adapted to any region of the country?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. These programs obviously do 
not work, since the needs of each region are different. Where I 
come from, there are associations and groups conducting 
economic impact and regional development studies specifically 
for our region. However, these studies are not taken seriously. 
Valuable work is done at these conferences and meetings. 
Sometimes, it takes two, three, four or five months to do a 
serious study.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Studies are done, but the federal government ignores them. 
The FORD does not work with us at all regarding these issues. 
We have always had problems. Even members of Parliament, try 
to get information from that office, but nothing happens. 
Everything is on hold. It goes without saying that regions must 
be involved in regional development. We are tired of seeing 
young people leave our regions and move to large urban centres 
because we have no jobs for them.
<P>
	In Quebec, we have a very good structure to develop our 
regions; consequently, if we have our own development tools 
and if we can look after our own regional development, we will 
certainly do very well. However, in the meantime, and as long as 
the federal government tries to control and centralize everything 
and does not let the regions decide anything, we will 
unfortunately live in poverty as is the case now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have an opportunity to 
participate in the debate today because I believe that this debate 
is really about who speaks for Canada.
<P>
	I do not believe that we will ever resolve the debate with the 
Bloc Quebecois because it does not believe in Canada. It is 
separatist. It will not recognize any federal presence, 
Government of Canada presence, in the province of Quebec. As 
long as it has that position of trying to destroy Canada then this 
debate is not going to go very far.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that we are a national government 
here in Ottawa but we are supervising one of the most 
decentralized national governments in the world. Many 
members of Parliament today gave very specific examples.
<P>
	We have a decentralized instrument in Atlantic Canada called 
the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency which is a 
Government of Canada instrument on the ground working with 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4766"> 4766 </A></B>
<P>
provinces and the municipalities. That unit is very sensitive to 
the diverse needs of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	As we become more and more dependent on the new economy 
and the new technologies, the Government of Canada presence 
is there to support those new emerging small and medium sized 
businesses. That instrument is in place.
<P>
	In western Canada we have the western Canada 
diversification fund which is also a decentralized Government 
of Canada instrument working on the ground in every province 
in western Canada trying to be ultra sensitive to the needs of not 
just the region but of every province in the western region.
<P>
	In the province of Ontario we have FedNor, an instrument in 
northern Ontario which is very sensitive because we are talking 
about industries which have very difficult times because of 
shipping distances and because we are going through a 
conversion in the north. We are moving into new industries there 
because our resource based industries can no longer sustain us. 
However, the Government of Canada has a presence there. The 
federal Government of Canada works with FedNor and with the 
municipalities and the province of Ontario trying to be sensitive 
to the needs of northern Ontario.
<P>
	In the province of Quebec we have the Federal Office for 
Regional Development called FORD-Q. There are hundreds of 
examples of where FORD-Q is working in a decentralized way 
in every region of the province of Quebec, trying to make sure 
that the very issues of concern that the Bloc Quebecois is talking 
about today are addressed.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	The problem is that the Bloc Quebecois refuses to tell its 
constituents that there is a Government of Canada presence 
working on the ground in its region, getting policy direction 
from the national government in Ottawa, on the ground 
operating in Quebec in a very decentralized way. The fact of the 
matter is the Bloc members will not recognize these 
decentralized instruments because they are not interested in 
building Canada. They are interested in destroying Canada.
<P>
	The thing that is beginning to really bother me about the Bloc 
Quebecois members is they now know that their separatist thrust 
is destabilizing the economy of the country. As they destabilize 
the economy of the country they are putting pressure on our 
interest rates. That cost to the national treasury is a heck of a lot 
more than some of the duplication examples that they gave here 
today.
<P>
	I would be the first person to admit that our system is not 
perfect. There are examples, not just in Quebec but in every 
region of this country, in which we can show that there might 
have been some waste here or that there might have been a 
duplication there. That is no excuse for giving up on Canada. 
That is no excuse for saying I want to separate from Canada. If 
they really believe in putting people back to work in their 
constituencies the same way that we in every other region of the 
country want to put our people back to work, then they would 
stop this notre chez nous.
<P>
	Let us get real. We are dealing with the lives of millions of 
people here. We are no longer dealing simply with the lives of 
the people in the province of Quebec. We are dealing with the 
lives and the jobs of people from coast to coast in this country. 
This separatist let us kill Canada approach is really not in the 
best interests.
<P>
	They laugh. This is a member of Parliament who served for 10 
years in the Mulroney government, an ex-Mulroneyite sitting 
now with the Bloc. Their leader, another ex-Mulroneyite, is an 
incredible example.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
very sad day for our country when people come to this 
boardroom not to build it, not to improve and not to look out for 
the unemployed in their ridings, but they know because they are 
not stupid people-you do not get elected here by being 
stupid-that this destabilizing talk that they are going through 
right now is costing jobs right across the country. It is 
destabilizing our economy.
<P>
	When they talk about regional and economic development 
there is not a province in Canada that has had the benefit of the 
national treasury like the province of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> It is our money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> It is not your money.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is Canadian money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois always comes up with this line that it is its money. It 
is not; the Minister of Finance announced in January under the 
equalization entitlements a further $70 billion going to Quebec 
from Ontario, B.C. and Alberta. It just came off $60 billion from 
the last five years.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	Those members do not tell their constituents that between the 
last five and the next five years from the provinces of British 
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario we have transferred $110 
billion. Almost one-third of the national debt is because of the 
province of Quebec equalization entitlements.
<P>
	We do not resent that because that is part of our constitutional 
responsibility. What really bothers me is that in spite of our 
living up to our responsibilities in Confederation these people 
still want to come to this national Parliament and try to destroy 
the country. Canadians have lost patience with the Bloc 
Quebecois and I believe that eventually even in the province of 
Quebec there will be many people who will say that if they 
reflect over 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4767"> 4767 </A></B>
<P>
history and talk about caring and sharing, Canada has really 
been a good package for the people of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not 
as if we are standing on this side of the House saying that we 
have a perfect system but it is very tough to work with an 
opposition that really does not have any intention to 
constructively criticize or improve the fabric of Canada. It sits 
there day after day working away at trying to destroy the fabric 
of Canada.
<P>
	I believe that in the very near future it will probably be living 
up to its leader's commitment that if it loses in the provincial 
election its members will all be resigning.
<P>
	The debate today is really not about our regional development 
programs and their effectiveness because we have regional 
development programs in every region of this country. They are 
working. They can always be improved.
<P>
	The debate today is really about who speaks for Canada and 
the Bloc Quebecois really has always had a resentment for the 
Government of Canada presence in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I believe that most Quebecers will realize when they look at 
the contributions of Health and Welfare Canada, 
Communications Canada, Industry Canada, Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada, when they look at all the money that has 
been poured into Hydro Quebec to help develop James Bay, 
when they look at all the money that has been put into training 
programs, when they look at the fact they received $1 billion 
more in the last year just in terms of unemployment insurance 
and trading entitlements, I believe-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> We want jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> This traitor to Brian 
Mulroney talks about jobs. Do you know how you get jobs? You 
get jobs by trying to build this country, not by trying to destroy 
it. That is how you do it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
members opposite talk about jobs. They are not fooling the 
people of Quebec. I have a tough time saying Her Majesty's 
Loyal Opposition. It is an oxymoron with this crowd. Her 
Majesty's disloyal opposition is what they should be called.
<P>
	When you think about the fact that these people are parading 
around the world-

Transport has announced he will implement the $100 million cut 
in VIA Rail's operating budget proposed by the previous 
Conservative government. This cutback will cause a reduction 
in services to remote areas, possibly including the 
Jonquière-Montreal line.
<P>
	This service, which connects my region to Quebec's major 
economic centres, is vital to the development and quality of life 
of the region.
<P>
	In my opinion, the government should abide by the policy 
drafted by the Liberal Caucus in November 1989 and declare a 
one-year moratorium on any decision affecting VIA Rail, in 
order to allow for public hearings.
<P>
	However, the minister has refused to consider public 
consultations. It is another indication that when they were in the 
opposition, the Liberals were far better-intentioned than they 
are now as the governing party.

murdered by a young offender for his baseball cap in a Fraser 
Valley community a couple of years ago.
<P>
	Chuck, who founded a group called CRY-Crime, 
Responsibility and Youth-is disappointed with the Liberal 
attempt at reforming the Young Offenders Act. His group's 
numerous recommendations have turned into a cry in the dark. 
Yet the justice minister claims he is listening to Canadians.
<P>
	This government will soon see thousands of letters coming to 
the justice minister from all across this country, all crying out 
for stronger action on young offenders.
<P>
	We have just found out that a violent repeat young offender 
has escaped from a youth detention centre by melting through a 
Plexiglas barrier with a soldering gun. The young offender who 
sliced his way to freedom was very innovative. We need equally 
innovative laws to keep up to these people, and today's half way 
measures do not cut it.

details of the government's plans to consult with Canadians 
about the taxation of child support payments.
<P>
	In the past few weeks I have received many letters from my 
constituents wanting to see the present system changed. I would 
like to take this opportunity to urge the people in my riding to 
share their views with the government.
<P>
	This government has prepared discussion points for people to 
read and they can offer their views right on the document and fax 
their presentation to Ottawa toll free.
<P>
	Many parents face a daily battle to make ends meet because of 
inadequate or late child support payments. This government is 
concerned and wants to help. I encourage residents of St. John's

with the challenges of adolescence and those that face her as a 
victim of lupus, and when I think  about my 37-year old friend 
who is at once raising a family of seven children and taking 
chemotherapy to fight breast cancer, and when I talk to my aunt 
and my grandmother who both in their later years are suffering 
the pain and the disfigurement of osteoporosis, I know that we 
have to do more to fight these diseases and others that 
predominantly affect women.
<P>
	We know that there has been a systemic bias against women in 
our health care and our health research. That is why I am so glad 
and look forward to the creation of a centre of excellence that 
will focus on women's health and why I hope that when our 
national health forum meets this summer the issue of women's 
health will be on its agenda.

to streamline environmental regulatory processes and 
harmonize federal and provincial policies and programs.
<P>
	To this end yesterday in New Brunswick the federal 
environment minister and her colleagues from the Atlantic 
provinces entered into a federal-provincial framework 
agreement for the environmental co-operation in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	This agreement is the first of its kind in the environmental 
field in terms of both its breadth and scope. It set out principles 
to cover compliance with regulations, environmental 
assessment, environmental monitoring and data management, 
water programs and public awareness.
<P>
	The agreement will lead to the elimination of overlap and 
duplication of program delivery and provide a single window for 
pursuing regulatory matters. It illustrates this government's 
commitment to environmental protection and conservation and 
to co-operation and harmonization with the provinces.

ineptitude in the matter of regional development.
<P>
	All regions in Quebec have been facing major problems for a 
number of years. Despite the fact that we have a federalist 
government in Quebec as well, quarrelling on regional 
development has merely increased political tension, while the 
economy of the regions suffers. This is reflected in the youth 
unemployment rate in my region, which was 24 per cent last 
year and led to migration to the larger urban centres.
<P>
	I wish the Liberal government would stop telling us that all is 
well and that federalism is the answer to all our problems. 
Federalism has had plenty of time to prove itself, and it has 
proved to be a failure.

	This bill has now received royal assent. We have learned that 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage is in possession of a report 
which would eliminate all funding for lacrosse.

	The minister's office assured me that this was not the official 
position of the government. Then his parliamentary secretary 
told us recently in this House that a decision on this will not be 
forthcoming until late summer.

	This puts the men's national lacrosse team in a desperate 
situation. It hopes to compete in the world championships in 
England this July but will not be able to unless recognition of its

	Young people in Guelph-Wellington are concerned about 
employment prospects and look to this government for 
programs and ideas which will provide hope and opportunity.
<P>
	I encourage our young women and men to believe in their 
future. I also encourage them to make use of their talents 
through volunteer experiences. Volunteering is an excellent 
avenue to gain experience and to establish a network in the real 
world of employment
<P>
	At the same time there are a number of Canadians young and 
old who can benefit from the dedication and spirit of our

high-tech equipment, while enhancing Montreal's reputation as 
the hub of the industry's production for foreign markets.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, amidst 
all the talk of criminal justice reform in the Young Offenders Act 
we often forget the victims who suffer at the hands of violence.
<P>
	I would like to give a victim's impact statement today from a 
young woman in my riding, Christine Angus, who was recently 
beaten in broad daylight by two young offenders who demanded 
her purse:
<P>
	``I knew that crime amongst young offenders was getting out 
of hand, but it was sort of on the sidelines and until this 
happened to me I never realized that crime is so close to all of us. 
I was on my way to work at 12.30 p.m., the noon hour, and two 
guys came up behind me, grabbed me around my throat and said 
they would hurt me if I did not give them my purse, then they 
spun me around''. Christine was then beaten about the face and 
head.
<P>
	Her final comment was: ``Who will care for my emotional 
state? I cannot sleep at night. I am afraid. Who is going to help 
me with this?''.
<P>
	Victims like Christine feel betrayed by a justice system that 
lets them down time after time. Victims have special needs. Let 
us recognize them and hold young offenders accountable.

	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy

Speaker, I would like to add my voice to that of my colleagues 
who, yesterday, paid tribute to the mother of Daniel and 
Pierre-Marc Johnson, who  passed away. Like two members 
from the Bloc, I had the chance to work with Daniel and 
Pierre-Marc Johnson in the Quebec National Assembly during 
two terms.
<P>
	I was also part of of Daniel Johnson's team during his first bid 
for leadership. What is remarkable about the Johnson brothers is 
that, confronted daily by issues they approached from opposite 
ends of the political spectrum, they managed to keep strong and 
constant fraternal ties. They are friends as well as brothers. This 
comes from the strong family values passed on to them by their 
parents. I offer my deepest sympathy to Daniel, Pierre-Marc 
and their families.

	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in May 1993 the World Health Organization asked the 
World Court to declare nuclear weapons illegal under 
international law.
<P>
	As a result the World Court asked all member states, 
including Canada, to submit their positions by June 10, 1994.
<P>
	I want to urge the government to make such a submission. At 
this time there are six known nuclear weapon states and there are 
15 other states that either have or are developing nuclear 
weapons capacity. If this proliferation continues and nuclear 
weapons are held by irresponsible leaders in the world, the 
entire planet is in grave danger.
<P>
	In 1995 the 25-year old non-proliferation treaty will come to 
an end unless there is political will in the world to have it 
continue and make it work. We have banned chemical weapons. 
We should do the same with nuclear weapons.
<P>
	I urge Canada to support this World Court project before the 
June 10 deadline.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEPATITISC">HEPATITIS C</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Health. Because the 
federal government refuses to take its responsibilities seriously, 
the Red Cross is about to launch a large-scale operation to trace 
thousands of carriers of the hepatitis C virus who were infected 
as a result of blood transfusions. The Red Cross spokesperson 
claimed, and rightly so,  that a person who received a blood 
transfusion had the right to know whether he had been exposed 
to the hepatitis C virus.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Health, who has refused to take her 
responsibilities seriously on this issue, maintain her claim that it 
is impossible to trace people who were infected with the 
hepatitis C virus as a result of a blood transfusion, when the Red 
Cross is preparing to do so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I 
said yesterday and the day before, and I will repeat it again 
today, we have several partners who are involved in the blood 
supply system. I commend the Red Cross, which is examining a 
proposal. However, the fact remains that it will be very difficult 
and well nigh impossible to go back any further than 1990, when 
we started testing for hepatitis C. We are waiting to find out how 
effective their proposal will be.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister endorse what was said by the spokesperson for her 
government, who pointed out that this kind of initiative would 
not be very useful because there is no effective treatment for this 
disease?
<P>
	Does the minister still deny there is a risk of spreading the 
hepatitis C virus if people are not informed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
there is no vaccine against hepatitis C. At least, not yet. 
Scientists are working on it, but there is no vaccine right now.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	There are ways to treat the disease itself, but we want to wait 
for recommendations from the Red Cross. What they are looking 
at is still very vague. We should not get too excited about all 
these proposals. I think we should take this a day at a time.
<P>
	As I said before, hepatitis C has been with us since the forties, 
when we started our blood transfusion system. However, testing 
for hepatitis C has only been possible since the nineties. Since 
that time, out of the total number of blood donors, only 0.3 per 
cent were found to be infected with hepatitis C. The blood taken 
from these donors was never used.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the Red 
Cross is preparing to trace people, there is a serious problem.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the minister is not taking any action 
because she is opposed to the idea of compensating individuals 
who were infected with the hepatitis C virus as a result of blood 
transfusion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
always take my responsibilities very seriously, but the point is 
that we do not have all the answers. When we say that no testing 
was possible before 1990, that is the honest truth. No testing was 
possible. We are now working with the Red Cross, the hospitals, 
the provinces and all parties responsible for protecting the 
health of Canadians, to provide the best possible service.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the Kanesatake band council suspended work on the expansion 
of the Indian cemetery in a gesture of good will. The band 
council chief mentioned however that certain unspecified 
conditions would have to be met before negotiations could 
resume.
<P>
	My question is, of course, for the minister of Indian affairs. 
Can he confirm that among the conditions set by Jerry Peltier, 
there is, according to CBC, the payment to the band council of 
certain sums of money? And if so, how much is involved?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, there were times during the 
so-called mini Oka crisis when it was important that the 
situation be calm, the negotiators be at the table, and the 
mediators be appointed. I think that time has past. The mediator, 
the negotiator and the principals are meeting.
<P>
	Over the next few days, until I hear what solutions are coming 
forward, I do not think it is appropriate to do the negotiating 
through the press or through the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, could the 
minister tell us if the administrative inquiry conducted by his 
department into the use of federal grants by the band council was 
discussed during the discussions prior to the resumption of the 
negotiations? Did the pre-negotiations deal with this issue?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question will have to be put 
with more clarity before I can answer it. After the House 
convenes if the member wants to make that a clear question and 
on a specific point I would be prepared to talk to him and answer 
specifically what he is talking about.

secretary for fisheries has a 50 per cent interest in Dynamic 
Maintenance Ltd., a company that on May 1 of this year received 
a three-year contract for maintenance at Pearson International 
Airport worth $13.5 million?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I understand that a company that the parliamentary 
secretary formerly had an involvement with had a contract with 
Pearson. This has been made public. It was carried in one of the 
newspapers.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> About three weeks ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> About three weeks ago for the members who were 
asleep at the switch. Apparently it is quite normal, done within 
the normal tendering procedure. If the member is alleging a 
specific wrongdoing he should make the allegation. Otherwise 
he should find something more useful to talk about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, somebody 
has been asleep at the switch here.
<P>
	Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that even though the 
member indicated he had resigned as a director and officer of 
Dynamic Maintenance Ltd. and he supposedly did this on 
December 1, 1993, as of May 24, 1994 the parliamentary 
secretary of fisheries is still listed with the B.C. Ministry of 
Finance and Corporate Relations as an officer of this company.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps when I tell the member that my understanding 
is that the parliamentary secretary is totally in compliance with 
all of the requirements of the conflict code, and this has been 
checked with the most senior authorities of the government, the 
member might want to seek unanimous consent to stand and 
apologize for making reckless accusations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a letter 
dated April 12, 1994, Mr. Howard R. Wilson the Assistant 
Deputy Registrar General and candidate for the position of 
Liberal ethics counsellor in response to a request for guidance 
on this possible conflict stated that he was satisfied the company 
was ``administered blindly and at arm's length to the member''. 
Yet one of the directors listed is the father of the member with 
whom he shares and co-owns a residence.
<P>
	Does this qualify in the opinion of the government as an arm's 
length relationship?

	The member opposite is fully aware that the senior official 
who has the responsibility for ensuring compliance with the 
conflict code has indicated that all of the requirements of the 
conflict code have been met and all of the arrangements required 
have been met. Nevertheless, this member stands on no other 
basis than seeking to damage the reputation of an hon. member

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, upon the recent 
return of the Minister of Foreign Affairs from a trip to Paris, the 
government claimed that relations between France and Canada 
had never been better. And yet, Mr. Alain Juppé, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, said in the French National Assembly that Bill 
C-29, which Canada had just passed to control overfishing, was 
unacceptable and that he intended to challenge it with the help of 
other European countries.
<P>
	Can the Deputy Prime Minister explain how it is that the 
recent visit to France of her foreign affairs minister has resulted 
in a vigourous and open challenge of the measures proposed by 
Canada to control overfishing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, I find it astounding that 
there is in this House a Canadian MP-he is still Canadian as far 
as I know-who opposes a policy which was unanimously 
adopted by this House to try to prevent overfishing. If he wants 
to sit in the French National Assembly, I invite him to do so. But 
here, in Canada, we have a unanimous policy regarding the theft 
of our resources.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, my supplementary 
is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. I think that as fishing 
enthusiasts, we will understand the issue better. He might also 
enlighten the Deputy Prime Minister; he knows the Bloc 
Quebecois strongly supported the bill at second and third 
readings.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, my question to the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans is this: How does he intend to convince the French 
government of the validity-the Deputy Prime Minister is 
taking note, I hope-of the provisions of Bill C-29, when 
France believes that this piece of legislation is not in accordance 
with international law and the law of the sea? Can the minister 
explain now how Canada is going to make France see reason?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for his question.
<P>
	All members of this party and I have acknowledged in the past 
that it was a unanimous motion in the House supported by all 
parties that allowed for quick passage of our foreign overfishing 
bill, and I acknowledge that again today.
<P>
	I would ask the member to acknowledge that sometimes when 
Canadian parliamentarians visit France they do not always get 
the kind of support they are expecting for their initiatives. That 
level of disappointment is shared on some days in equal measure 
by members on the government side and sometimes even by the 
Leader of the Opposition.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister is not aware. I have a supplementary question.

	Presumably the government will be doing such polling over 
the summer and fall months. Could the minister assure us that 
the results of such polling would be made public on a timely 
basis?

Canada.
<P>
	According to an article in this morning's edition of <I>Le Soleil</I>, 
the Solicitor General's office is in possession of an RCMP report 
that says weapons are being smuggled into the country on CP 
freight trains returning from the United States. According to the 
report, the point of entry for the smuggled weapons is Montreal, 
with the Kahnawake reserve being their ultimate destination.
<P>
	Given that the source of this briefing note is his own 
department, can the Solicitor General tell us why RCMP 
authorities have not stepped in yet to stop the smuggling?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
can assure my hon. colleague that further to my inquiries, my 
department insists that it has no knowledge whatsoever of the 
existence of such a briefing note. Let me assure the hon. member 
that the RCMP, along with Customs, will take the necessary 
measures to resolve this situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my supplementary is also for the Solicitor General. Are 
we to understand from his answer that the RCMP, as hinted by <I>Le 
Soleil</I>, has not put a stop to the smuggling operations which 
involve the use of warehouses on the Kahnawake reserve 
because it has not been authorized to do so by the federal 
government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as I have said many times, the RCMP has every right to do its job 
anywhere in the country. There are no ``no go'' zones. It does not 
need the government's permission to do its job on native 
reserves or anywhere else in Canada.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The minister announced amendments to the young offenders 
system this morning. His statements do not deal with a reduction 
in the age parameters of the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	How do the announcements of the minister reflect the thrust 
of thousands of submissions which he says he has received from 
the recent round of public consultations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the amendments we 
introduced this morning in our view reflect those submissions 
and that consultation very directly.
<P>
	Among other things, the bill we put before the House of 
Commons at ten o'clock this morning sends a strong message 
from the government that crimes of violence will not be 
tolerated from any age group in society.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Reflecting the consultations and in keeping with 
commitments the government has given, we have doubled the 
maximum sentence for first degree murder and increased to 
seven years the sentence for second degree murder.
<P>
	We have broadened extensively the sharing of information 
about young offenders for purposes of community safety. For 16 
and 17 year olds, the top age group among young offenders, 
charged with the most serious crimes of violence we have in fact 
reversed the onus on the transfer test to adult court so that they 
must demonstrate they have the right to remain in youth court 
for rehabilitation purposes.
<P>
	These and other measures directly reflect many of the themes 
that were sounded during our extensive consultations with 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before the Chair goes to the supplementary 
question, as all colleagues are aware this bill is before the 
House. I would judge to be in order questions of a general nature 
such as the last one posed. I would caution that questions not be 
specific because they are going to be dealt with in the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the minister for his willingness to table 
legislation to make changes.
<P>
	Will the minister assure the House that the government will 
stop defending all basic tenets of the current juvenile system and 
remain open to major amendments such as age of operation if 
there is community support for change?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government continues to 
believe the youth justice system is fundamentally sound, and we 
support it.
<P>
	The question of age, as the hon. member knows, and other 
questions about the youth justice system were expressly put to 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. The hon. 
member will know, because I have made the letter public and 
provided copies to members of the House, that I have expressly 
asked the standing committee to undertake a comprehensive 
review of the statute and the youth justice system generally after 
it has reported on the bill I tabled this morning.
<P>
	One of the subjects I asked the committee to look at was the 
question of age.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. A study made public 
yesterday by Statistics Canada shows that women in particular 
are hard hit by the recession. The drop in labour force 
attachment of women which has been observed since the 
beginning of the recession is reversing historical trends. Women 
between 15 and 24 years of age are the main victims of this 
recent decline in the female labour force.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance recognize that women, and 
young women in particular, are being hit harder than anyone else 
by the current economic difficulties and does he intend to put in 
place a real job creation strategy that will benefit women as 
well?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, I share the hon. member's 
concern over this particular issue. Employment equity is one of 
this government's primary objectives and we have taken 
specific steps over the past six months to address this problem.
<P>
	For example, under the Canadian Youth Service Corps 
program, participants will be allowed to use $2,000 for day care. 
We are currently actively negotiating with the provinces to open 
more day-care spaces. I also hope to table concrete proposals in 
this House in the fall to address employment equity problems 
encountered by women.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is also for the Minister of Finance. Will 
the minister recognize that the infrastructure program, the only 
concrete job creation measure put forward by his government, 
provides very few opportunities for women in view of the nature 
of the work involved?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have tried to promote with the provinces and municipalities a 
mix of projects so that in various sectors of society where 
unemployment prevails there will be opportunities including 
opportunities for women.
<P>
	That point was brought home to me by the secretary of state in 
charge of women's issues. I assured her, as I assure the House,

	Daycare facilities very much qualify as part of the 
infrastructure program. There are numerous projects aside from 
construction where permanent long term jobs are created, and 
many of them are for women.
<P>
	We will continue to encourage the provinces and the 
municipalities to provide that kind of mixture so women in other 
sectors of society can be employed, because the government's 
number one priority is job creation.

	Today the minister tabled amendments to the Young

Sixteen and seventeen year olds accused of serious crime will 
automatically be transferred to adult court unless they can prove 
they should stay in youth court, and the identities of young 
offenders will be more available.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	In early March the minister arranged for a meeting at Chateau 
Montebello to discuss immigration policy consultation. 
However a reading of the summary of the meeting indicates that 
something other than public consultation was discussed.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the purpose of this million dollar 
so-called consultation process is to change public opinion 
rather than respond to it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely false.
<P>
	The Reform Party has advocated as one of its prime 
motivating reasons for being here opening up the process of 
government to those who wish to discuss and debate the issues 
of the day. The government has opened up the consultation 
process on immigration policy to an unprecedented level since 
the green paper in 1976.
<P>
	For a two-day period we took approximately 40 to 45 
Canadians from a variety of disciplines in western, northern, 
central and eastern Canada to talk about two things: how we 
consult fellow Canadians on immigration and what are the 
issues we need to consult on. No more, no less.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
document speaks for itself and I quote from it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4776"> 4776 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The public education aspect of the consultative process will require some careful 
thought-neither governments nor NGOs enjoy sufficient credibility to effectively 
convey the ``facts'' on immigration to Canadians-the media could be ``constructively 
engaged in the process''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, does this sound like consultation to you? How 
does the minister defend what appears to be a cynical and 
manipulative approach to dealing with the public on this very 
important issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, unlike the leader of the Reform 
Party and that entire caucus we do not need a Conservative 
member of our office to do any coaching on how we approach 
the business of government or Parliament.
<P>
	We are consulting Canadians. We have in train 10 working 
groups that will be both round table and public. There will be 
five townhall meetings across the country. There will be eight 
study groups across the country. I have invited every member of 
the committee to be part of one of the working groups.
<P>
	The government has nothing to hide. We want to rally a broad 
consensus for what immigration can do for the country as a 
nation building tool.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Justice. Under pressure from some members of 
the public and the conservative wing of the Liberal party, the 
Minister of Justice followed up on the Liberal Party's red book 
and tabled a bill toughening the provisions of the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Justice assure us that his bill respects 
Quebec's laws and policies on youth protection, as Quebec's 
National Assembly demanded last month?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada): </B>Yes, Mr. Speaker, we are fully aware of 
differences of opinion on this law and we are also aware of 
regional disparities. We know that Quebec's approach to 
enforcing the law has clearly proven itself. We think, however, 
that the changes in this bill give each of the provinces enough 
flexibility to adjust and administer the law while taking their 
particular circumstances into account.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the minister 
admit that his bill sends the message that young offenders must 
go to prison to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is not true at all. In fact, 
our proposed amendments to this act focus on the rehabilitation 
of young offenders.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Among other things, we have proposed changes to the 
statements of principle that will expressly state that the interests 
of society are best served by the rehabilitation of offenders.
<P>
	Instead of just proposing the automatic transfer of 16 and 
17-year olds, which some would have us do, we suggested in 
this bill that they be brought before the court one at a time for a 
judge to make that decision. Most particularly, in the case of 
non-violent offences we have introduced specific measures that 
would require the court to resort only as a last step to custody 
and to focus instead on community based rehabilitative 
dispositions.
<P>
	Therefore I disagree fundamentally with the premise of the 
hon. member's question. I say that this bill reflects a balance 
between a strong message against violence and rehabilitation of 
the offenders.

the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	In a five-year period ending in 1991, British Columbia light 
stations came to the aid of the public over 32,000 times. These 
incidents range from rescues to offering pilots emergency 
weather reports.
<P>
	Does the minister agree with the commissioner of the Coast 
Guard who says that lighthouses in British Columbia are no 
longer essential?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
for anyone to suggest that on the coast of British Columbia or on 
the coast of eastern Canada lighthouses are not essential would 
be totally irresponsible.
<P>
	We have said that what we intend to do is to look at the 
staffing of lighthouses. The technology of 1994 has allowed the 
United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, countries around 
the world, including Canada on the east coast, to make major 
changes in how to protect and make sure that people who use the 
sea are safe.
<P>
	The Department of Transport understands its obligation to 
people who earn their living on the sea or who spend leisure time 
on the sea. We have no intention of doing anything on the west 
coast of Canada or anywhere else that would put the safety of 
Canadians at risk.

	With all due respect, all of us recognize the magnificence of 
the British Columbia coast, its harbours and bays and the 
tremendous amount of marine activity which takes place out 
there. I would simply suggest to the hon. member that he look at 
what happened on the west coast of the United States. It is very 
similar. The situation in the U.K., the United States, Australia 
and around the world is that technology is replacing human 
beings in lighthouses. It is going to happen on the west coast, but 
it will only happen when we take into account the safety and 
security of people who use marine facilities in that area.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister confirmed the commitment made by 
the Prime Minister that a French-language school will be built 
in Kingston as quickly as possible,  given the appalling 
conditions of the existing facilities, which have no toilets nor 
running water, and which have been used as a school for over six 
years.
<P>
	Considering that the Kingston French-language school board 
has decided to build a school on the Olan Mills site, considering 
that the Ontario Department of Education has approved the 
$7-million contribution for the construction of the school on 
that site, and considering that the minister himself and the 
Ontario minister of culture have authorized a budget of over one 
million dollars for the construction of a cultural centre adjacent 
to the school, will the minister pledge to ensure that the 
French-language school will be built on the site selected and 
bought by the school board?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to repeat what the Prime Minister and 
myself have already said. It is our wish and our will to see that 
school move to new facilities in Kingston.
<P>
	We have indeed allocated funds in this regard, which reflects 
our will to see the issue solved. The primary responsibility lies 
with the provincial department, municipal officials and 
concerned school board.
<P>
	We have already contacted provincial authorities to express 
our concern. Right now, school board members are negotiating 
with Kingston officials to speed up the process. I think we must 
trust those who are primarily concerned, namely the school 
board officials, and give them a chance to solve the issue with 
our general support.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a supplementary. Since the approval of Kingston 
city council is the only thing delaying the construction of the 
school, does the minister not realize that, at this stage, the 
search for another site, or any delay in the council decision, 
would unduly postpone the timely construction of an adequate 
French-language school in Kingston?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, clearly we want to see this issue come to a conclusion 
as quickly as possible. I think that the best way to do so is to give 
a chance to those who are currently negotiating to reach an 
agreement, rather than disturb the process with all the political 
considerations which the party opposite is trying to bring up.

that she has the terms of reference for the National Health Care 
Forum. This forum would have a four-year mandate and a 
budget of $12 million.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge today that our health care 
system is in critical condition and requires emergency care? Is 
she going to take four years to make decisions to save Canada's 
health care system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have said it before and I will say it again. The national forum is 
meant to be a process. It is a series of meetings to put forward 
ideas for the renewal of our health system, not just our health 
care system, for the 21st century. It is not meant to take the place 
of the Conference of Federal-Provincial Ministers of Health 
who are meant to take the day to day decisions having to do with 
our health care system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr.

	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
withdraw the statement about truthful.
<P>
	I would though like to have a straight answer on this if I may. 
What are the terms of reference of the health care forum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
often many statements are made in the House and many 
statements were made in the last election, especially by that 
particular party across the way, but in all honesty, we upheld the 
principles of the Canada Health Act and we have not moved 
from our commitment to those.
<P>
	In recent articles I have read, the hon. member believes the 
rich should pay for their health care. In  Canada and many other 
countries there are many things which are available to people 
who can pay for them, more suits among other things. With 
regard to health care, we believe there should not be any kind of 
cash register approach to it. It should be equal for everyone.

are ready to release them.

	The minister has refused to close some of the tax loopholes. 
Why has he not agreed to eliminate tax loopholes such as the 
capital gains exemption and the family trusts, instead of going

<P>
	Ultramar Canada has announced plans to sell if possible and, 
if not, to completely close down its refinery in Dartmouth; this 
in spite of the fact that when Ultramar acquired this plant in 
1990 it signed an agreement with the federal competitions 
bureau to keep this operation open until at least 1997.
<P>
	I want to ask the minister what measures he and his 
department are taking to ensure that Ultramar indeed lives up to 
the letter of these commitments and does not easily extract itself 
from this agreement with the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member knows, Ultramar acquired the assets of Texaco 
in 1990 pursuant to a consent order of the competition tribunal 
and subject to the agreement of the director of investigations 
and research under the Competition Act on the basis of 
undertakings given by Ultramar to keep the refinery in 
Dartmouth open for seven years, unless there was a material 
adverse change in circumstances.
<P>
	Ultramar is now saying that there is such a material adverse 
change in circumstances and endeavouring to either sell or, 
failing to sell, to close the refinery.
<P>
	The director of investigations and research is investigating to 
assure himself of the facts that are the basis of the claim of an 
adverse change in circumstances. Once he is satisfied as to 
whether such a change has occurred he will then be in a position 
to take the appropriate action either to enforce the undertakings 
or to permit Ultramar to proceed with its actions.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that we are very concerned, with 
him, about the jobs that are at risk in Dartmouth as a result of 
this decision and we want to make sure that the right thing is 
done.

	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, I did not realize that I had five 
minutes left on my remarks. I will take that time to review some 
of the points that I made in my speech before question period 
began.
<P>
	As I said, the opposition motion today tried to discredit the 
Government of Canada as not having effective regional 
development plans or programs or instruments. Those people in 
every region of Canada know that we have always had 
decentralized instruments to help deal with very sensitive and 
diverse regional business opportunities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4780"> 4780 </A></B>
<P>
	The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency has been dealing 
with the problem of regional development expansion for the last 
number of years. In the province of Ontario we have the FedNor, 
which has been designed to look after northern Ontario 
opportunities, western Canada diversification and FORD-Q in 
the province of Quebec.
<P>
	For the Bloc Quebecois to put forward an opposition motion 
today that would suggest that we are not governing in a 
decentralized way is not accurate.
<P>
	The real point of the Bloc's motion today has to do with the 
fact that it does not believe the Government of Canada should 
have people speaking for Canada in the province of Quebec. It 
does not believe in having a Government of Canada presence 
active on the ground in Quebec.
<P>
	Of course none of us on the government side of the House 
shares that position. Imagine a situation in which it is saying, 
have the Government of Canada send a cheque because they in 
the province of Quebec know how to spend that cheque best.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	We have had experiences in the province of Quebec in the past 
in which it has not been interested in the national position or the 
national view. Normally the province of Quebec or for that 
matter the province of Ontario are just basically speaking for 
provincial matters. When we are in the national government 
position we have to balance our view.
<P>
	As a national parliamentarian coming from Toronto I do not 
just stand here and speak for Toronto. We do not just stand here 
and say that the only part of the country we are concerned about 
is Ontario. The proof in the pudding on that has to do with the 
entitlements that were granted before the budget in January 
when under the Constitution of Canada the new formula for 
entitlements was announced by the Minister of Finance in which 
the have provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario 
will transfer to the province of Quebec $70 billion over the next 
five years.
<P>
	If a person were just interested in the province of Ontario do 
you think that the provincial members would say they have to 
send cheques off to the province of Quebec? That would not 
happen.
<P>
	The purpose of this Chamber is to make sure that the regional 
disadvantages and the regional diversity are looked after by a 
strong national government, so stronger provinces make sure 
that provinces that go through weaker periods from time to time 
share in the wealth of the whole nation.
<P>
	I resent the opposition motion today because it really is not a 
motion that speaks about how we build a stronger Canada. It is 
not a motion that is sincere because it is coming from a party that 
basically wants to destroy the country. I do not want any part of 
it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the much too lengthy comments of the hon. member 
for Broadview-Greenwood who talked about almost 
everything, except regional development.
<P>
	I want to point out to the hon. member that although it is true 
that the federal government is about to transfer $70 billion to 
Quebec in the next five years within the equalization program, 
this money comes for the most part from the pockets of 
Quebecers. The only pennies which are paid to Quebec but do 
not come from the pockets of Quebecers are those which are 
borrowed in their names. The government should know it and 
stop acting as if it was always playing Santa Claus because it is 
not true. The government is acting in bad faith.
<P>
	Canada's accumulated deficit of some $500 billion is nothing 
to be proud of, even in Broadview-Greenwood. Our economy 
is in such a mess because of the accumulated debt that they 
should not dare play Santa Claus.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc have been rightfully and legally elected 
to this House and they have a right to speak and the hon. member 
for Broadview-Greenwood is not the one who will silence us. 
If this does not please him, he can always go behind the curtain. 
This is maybe where he will do his best work.
<P>
	Moreover, we are here to talk about regional development. 
Did the hon. member tell us about regional development 
infrastructures? We would have expected him to talk about that. 
Did he say anything, for example, about regional airport 
infrastructures? This is an important issue. My riding of 
Chambly is located in the Richelieu valley and includes some 
large municipalities. We have a road system. We have provincial 
road infrastructures that were not given to us by the hon. 
member for Broadview-Greenwood. They were paid for by the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	We have a nice road system that, unfortunately, is 
deteriorating rapidly because the Liberals have cut rail 
transport, because they have abandoned rail lines everywhere. 
That forces us to overutilize our roads, which are paid for with 
provincial funds.
<P>
	The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood tells us that the 
federal government helped make Hydro-Québec what it is 
today. If the federal government ever gave a penny to 
Hydro-Québec, Madam Speaker, I would like the member to 
compare that with the amount of money that the federal 
government gave to Atomic Energy of Canada, in Ontario, over 
the same period. There is absolutely no comparison possible. 
They are federalists. The hon. member for Madawaska said that 
some people in this House have a selective memory. I think that 
applies very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4781"> 4781 </A></B>
<P>
much to members of the present federal government. Talk about 
selective memory! The federal government never gave a penny 
to Hydro-Québec, as  opposed to billions of dollars that were 
given to Atomic Energy of Canada.
<P>
	The member did not talk much about Hibernia. Regional 
development is important. We need the infrastructures and we 
have to spend money for that. Let us take regional airports, for 
example. I said a few minutes ago that the town of Richelieu, in 
my riding, and all the surrounding towns, including 
Marieville-almost all of which have a small industrial park and 
a good road system connecting with the Montreal-Sherbrooke 
freeway, Highway 10, Highway 30 and roads to the United 
States, and are not far from railway lines which have not yet 
been abandoned-adopted resolutions asking for a regional 
airport.
<P>
	Many people, including those from Sivaco, a fair-sized 
factory in Marieville, talked of closing their doors because the 
senior executives who come from God knows where in the 
United States find that there is an access problem because they 
have to land in Montreal and then travel the rest of the way by 
car in winter. They would prefer to have a small airport close by.
<P>
	So the towns adopted resolutions to that effect and we are 
trying to wake the federal government up because it has the bad 
habit of investing only when it can see the picture of the minister 
responsible for the area in local papers; otherwise regional 
development does not interest it. They did that to me last week 
in Saint-Bruno, when the Minister of Canadian Heritage came 
to announce a contribution of $11 million from the 
infrastructure program and tried to convince the people there 
that that money was a gift from heaven, from a place not far from 
Toronto, probably Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that instead of moaning as they have all 
day about the presence here of the Bloc Quebecois, they should 
shoulder their responsibilities and do some regional 
development. That is what we need and that is the subject of 
today's debate, whatever the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood may think.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would not want the hon. member to think that I was whining. I 
was merely trying to point out to the member and to members of 
the Bloc that the province of Quebec has benefited by being part 
of Confederation.
<P>
	I can say that James Bay has received hundreds of millions of 
dollars from the national government, from environment and 
from Canada Mortgage and Housing for every aspect of that 
project. If you do not believe me go to the Library of Parliament 
and they will produce the records dollar for dollar for you.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	There is no resentment for that. This is part of Confederation. 
All we are saying is do not pretend that the national government 
has done nothing for the province of Quebec. My goodness, that 
is an insult to all the elected members who come from Quebec.
<P>
	Look at the 16-year period of Pierre Elliott Trudeau when the 
Liberals had 74 out of 75 members and see all the great things 
that happened in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	The difference was that those members of Parliament 
believed in Canada. If this group over here would start believing 
in Canada maybe then we could get our economy going a little 
better and maybe we could put even more money into the 
province of Quebec. That is how we would get more Quebecers 
back to work.
<P>
	Throw away this idea of destroying the country and get back 
to reality. You will never be able to build a strong economy by 
ignoring the fact that a great deal of the reason we are rated 
number one in the world today as a nation to live in is because 
historically we have all worked together. The minute that we 
destroy that reality of Canada, it is not just your constituents 
who are going to suffer, it is mine and everyone else's in this 
country.
<P>
	That is why I become very emotional about my country. I 
believe and I am going to continue to preach the fact that when 
you are in this House of Commons you should be building 
Canada, you should not be here trying to destroy it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
	One of the most interesting things about human beings is that 
we very frequently do not learn from history. If we do not learn 
from history the one thing that we can count on is the fact that we 
will be doomed to repeat it.
<P>
	When I was first involved in business, going back a few years 
to the very early seventies, I became aware of a government 
regional grant program under the acronym of DREE. Somehow 
under this DREE program the decision was made that the West 
Kootenays would be a have not portion of my particular part of 
the country whereas the East Kootenays had a lot of funds and 
could do its own thing.
<P>
	As a result of the DREE program, there was a decision to go 
ahead with a chainsaw manufacturing process at Waneta, just 
outside of Trail in British Columbia. This chainsaw 
manufacturing was really spot on in terms of its time in coming 
to the market. Rather than just manufacturing chainsaws it was 
manufacturing a small personal portable chainsaw. For those of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4782"> 4782 </A></B>
<P>
us who are familiar with what was happening in that particular 
marketplace, it was very timely. Between 1972 and 1976 DREE 
put $200,000 into that chainsaw manufacturing company.
<P>
	In Castlegar at about the same time there was another venture 
that went forward to generate light weight travel trailers. If we 
go back 21 or 22 years in our minds, we realize that there was a 
market for a light weight travel trailer. DREE had this light 
weight travel trailer manufacturer set up in Castlegar and put in 
$220,000.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I am forced to report that neither of these 
ventures are still in place. As a matter of fact, they disappeared 
from the business scene. They are gone.
<P>
	Working a little bit in this direction, in the early eighties in 
Cranbrook, which is where my home constituency is, there was a 
printing company. I am not really sure of the figures, but it was 
put into place with between $496,000 and $750,000 of 
government grants. That business went for about 24 months, ran 
into cash flow problems and the business was shut down. There 
was no way the government could ever recover its over half 
million dollar investment. Because it had run into the cash flow 
problems it had let its insurance lapse. The building was 
vandalized and hence there were no assets for the government to 
reclaim.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Coming even further forward into the mid to late 1980s I am 
very familiar with an operation in Langley. This one, instead of 
being unfortunate, unfortunately was a scam. A company 
decided to develop a communication development laboratory. 
The principals of that firm actually disguised antiquated 
equipment. People in smocks were running around and this 
fooled the government inspectors. The venture lasted one year. 
It was not quite enough of a scam to catch the attention of the 
police. As a result Canadians are out half a million dollars.
<P>
	My thesis is if the marketplace will not support a business 
start up it likely will not support the business. That is the 
fundamental flaw, the fundamental problem of regional 
development grants.
<P>
	Let me give some specific examples. The federal government 
wants to forgive $5.3 million it lent to the Sydney Steel 
Corporation of Nova Scotia which is owned by the Nova Scotia 
government. The Cape Breton company borrowed the money in 
the early 1970s to build a wharf. The government also wants to 
forgive the $20.4 million in interest payments the corporation 
now owes on that loan.
<P>
	The government wants to forgive a $4.6 million loan to the 
International Tin Association, an organization set up to help 
stabilize the tin process. Since the association was disbanded in 
1985 the government has determined the chances for repayment 
are rather slim.
<P>
	We have an absolute hole as it were that we seem to be 
constantly pouring money into with good intentions. I sincerely 
applaud the motive, the background, and the desire of the 
government. Unfortunately, it has not learned from history.
<P>
	In doing some research on this speech I had my assistant make 
some telephone calls and he reports this:
<P>
	``Government's best intentions whether it be to assist small 
business or to employ people or train people would be best left 
to the people who know how to develop and manage company's 
employees, which means small business people in every 
community.
<P>
	The best way government could do that according to the 
people I have talked to would be for the government to demand 
less from each small businessman in the way of red tape, 
completing forms, GST returns, in other words the services he is 
required to fulfil for the federal government. This would allow 
him more time to do what he does best which is to effectively run 
his company so as to produce some real dollars and provide real 
lasting jobs for people in his community and Canada as a whole.
<P>
	Government by trying to control the labour market that 
interferes with supply and demand whether it be printers or cows 
only interferes with free enterprise and the people who really 
know the marketplace''.
<P>
	My point is that when the government gets involved with 
throwing around taxpayer's money unfortunately that almost 
invariably interferes with the normal marketplace.
<P>
	The very best result that we can expect from the funds the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and the Western 
Diversification Fund are throwing into the marketplace is that it 
will simply distort the marketplace. The difficulty is when it 
distorts the ordinary marketplace it makes it difficult for 
successful tax paying businesses to be able to continue in 
business. They find that all of a sudden their taxpayers' dollars 
are being used to subsidize businesses that are in competition 
with them.
<P>
	I have been hearing a little bit of yapping from the other side 
of the House. Perhaps if they were to talk to some of their 
business people they would get exactly the same story as I am 
relating here.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	I have explained the best result. The worst result is probably 
best explained when western economic diversification fund 
officials on January 16, 1990 lent $526,990 to Myrias Research 
Corporation. On April 17 they gave it another $1.4 million. On 
May 30, 1990 they gave it another $686 million. On August 9, 
1990 they gave it another $775,000. On October 5, 1990 they 
gave it another $517,000. On October 26 the corporation was 
placed in receivership.

	If the government, which has the best of intentions, granted, is 
not prepared to take lessons from history and learn from history 
then we have the difficulty of repeating history.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Madam Speaker, talking 
about taking a lesson from history, I wonder how the hon. 
member's party would have existed in the early stages of our 
history when the government actually had to finance Canadian 
Pacific to build a railway across the country to link the country 
together to create the nation we live in today. It seems, if we had 
had a Reform Party representing the people out west, they would 
not have been part of Confederation in the first place. 
Incidentally that was a perfect example of the government 
getting a business going, turning it over to private hands and 
turning it into a success story.
<P>
	All I hear from the Reform Party is about failures. Certainly 
every time we get involved in a business venture there is the 
possibility of risk, the possibility of failure.
<P>
	I also want to focus on another aspect of regional 
development. In some of these areas the federal government 
through a process of transfer payments or whatever is sustaining 
people. We have people on welfare and on unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	I would like to direct a question to the Reform Party. If we 
have a choice between paying people to sit home and do nothing 
or trying to create worthwhile jobs and careers for people to get 
out of that situation, which is more preferable?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, the member raises the 
interesting point of bringing 1800 solutions to 1994 problems.
<P>
	In 1800, when the CPR was being put together, we did not 
have the gigantic welfare state we presently have. We did not 
have unemployment insurance. We did not have 53 per cent of 
all government spending going to individuals in a giant welfare 
state like the Liberals in particular pioneered through the 
seventies.
<P>
	With the greatest respect, I must agree with the member about 
the Canadian Pacific. Clearly it is a fact of history that it tied 
Canada together; it is a done deal. How much did it really cost 
Canada by coming out west when we take a look at the amount of 
property that was given to the corporation, or by coming out 
west when we take a look at the fact that we are still basically 
paying for the line?
<P>
	That is fine. That is history. I am proud of Canada. I am proud 
to be a Canadian. I am happy the CPR was brought in. However I 
suggest with the greatest respect that he is bringing an 1800 
solution to a 1994 problem.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, I wonder if 
the hon. member, with his great knowledge of Canadian history, 
is aware of a certain phenomenon that took place in post-war 
Canada, in Atlantic Canada and  eastern Canada in general but 
most particularly in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Atlantic Canadians paid $5 over world price for their oil that 
went to the province of Alberta so that the oil industry could off 
the ground. Eastern Canadians, maritimers, Atlantic Canadians, 
did this in good faith because they believed we were one 
country. They believed an oil industry in Alberta would be a 
good thing for Canada, and they did it with pleasure.
<P>
	Therefore, would the hon. member like to comment on that 
fact, if he knows about it?
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, I would be very interested in 
receiving some documentation of the fact the member has put 
forward. My understanding of the oil industry in Alberta is that 
it was financed fundamentally from the U.S. That was where 
most of the dollars came from.
<P>
	However, I suggest as part of the price the people in Alberta 
have paid in order to be in Canada under the wonderful-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker. We would 
like to listen to the remarks of the hon. member, but it is difficult 
because some members are talking in front of us. Could all 
members be more cooperative?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> From time to time, there 
are heated discussions in the House. The hon. member should 
use his earphone, and I would ask all hon. members to show 
more consideration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, I was about to say that the 
people of Alberta can recall very clearly, very vividly, the 
confiscation of $67 billion from one province to central Canada 
under the Liberal government's national energy plan. The point 
therefore I want to make is that the people in western Canada 
have contributed very much.
<P>
	With the greatest respect to the people in Atlantic Canada, I 
do not think they have an edge on contributions to Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it might not be a bad idea for members opposite and 
those Canadians viewing the debate at home if we were to go 
over the motion again so they know what we are talking about.

<HR>

<P>
	Today is a supply day which means the opposition, and in this 
case the Bloc, supplies the motion for debate in the House. The 
motion the Bloc Quebecois put forth for debate today reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the federal government's ineffective regional 
development interventions, which create overlappings and inconsistencies, 
resulting in an administrative chaos that hampers regional economic growth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Although I probably would not have put it in those terms at 
all, the whole notion of Canada's regional development is one of 
the basic differences between Canada and the United States, 
Canada and many countries in the world. There are not many 
countries in the world that take resources from one part of the 
country and transfer them holus-bolus to another part of the 
country in order to create some sort of evenness across the 
country.
<P>
	What usually happens in terms of world affairs is that they 
make sacrifices for the future. Perhaps none of us would be here 
in Canada today, or very few of us except the indigenous people, 
if our forefathers had not left where they were so that they, their 
children and their grandchildren could have a better life in a new 
country.
<P>
	What has happened in Canada over the years is that rather than 
making the sacrifices for the future, we made the future sacrifice 
for us today. Today when we are making transfers of money from 
one part of the country to another, by and large the transfers of 
money are transfers of borrowed money. We are really 
transferring money and wealth from future generations to this 
generation and then once again transferring it to another part of 
the country, in the hopes that it will make one part of the country 
work a bit better and that we will have a more even playing field.
<P>
	I guess the debate is not really out. Does it work? Is it 
effective? If it worked probably there would not be much debate 
about it because we would recognize it as a good thing.
<P>
	Given that we have been doing this transfer of resources from 
one part of the country to another over these years and given that 
it really has not changed the nature of dependence in various 
parts of the country, it is reasonable to question whether it works 
at all.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	The basic premise of the Bloc motion is to suggest that 
perhaps this money transfer could be done in a more efficient 
and more effective way. From the Bloc's perspective it would 
like to see all the money transferred to the province of Quebec 
and the province of Quebec making the determination, 
controlling all the strings, even though it is federal money. The 
real question, though, is whether or not we should be doing it at 
all.
<P>
	I would draw the attention of hon. members to the situation 
that exists in the United States. The southern United States, as 
many members would know, for many years languished 
relatively poorly compared with the northern and western 
United States. Yet today the south  is vibrant and flourishing in 
part because it was not force-fed resources from the more 
prosperous parts of the nation and in part because they have a 
triple-E senate. Things were able to find their natural level. The 
cost of land and the cost of being in business today in the 
southern United States are less than in the north. Therefore 
people establish their businesses in the south.
<P>
	We do not have the same playing field in Canada because we 
have a federal system of government that favours central 
Canada at the expense of the regions, particularly the maritimes. 
If we had a system of government that did not favour one part of 
the country over another because the vast majority of the 
population of Canada is centred in Ontario and Quebec, we 
might not have the need for regional economic expansion.
<P>
	I suggest we should give some thought to why we got into this 
situation in the first place. The Bank of Nova Scotia 
headquartered in Toronto is not called the Bank of Nova Scotia 
because it started in Toronto. It is called the Bank of Nova Scotia 
because it was established and started in Halifax. Why did it 
move to Toronto? It is because that is where the economic base 
of the country is. Chapter and verse the concentration of wealth 
is in Ontario and Quebec because that is where all the votes are 
in the country.
<P>
	We need to change things in a much more fundamental way. 
As a Parliament we should consider a triple-E senate because in 
my opinion it would help dramatically in regional economic 
expansion.
<P>
	Does it work? Is it worthwhile? We have read with 
considerable interest that the new entrepreneurial class in 
Quebec in the last 20 years or so has created a revolution in 
thinking and in spirit. My colleagues from Quebec could speak 
in much more detail about it, but that is the perception many 
other Canadians have of the entrepreneurial class in Quebec.
<P>
	Quebec and Alberta in harmony embraced the whole notion of 
NAFTA or free trade with the United States. As a matter of fact 
Canada has free trade with the United States in very large 
measure because Quebec wanted it and Alberta wanted it.
<P>
	Let me just read a few statistics about what has happened to 
the west after five years of free trade with the United States. I 
submit that in these statistics lies the avenue for expanded 
economic activity for Quebec, for the maritimes and for all other 
parts of Canada. I am quoting from a report by the Centre for 
International Business Studies, the Faculty of Business, 
University of Alberta, Edmonton, dated April 1994:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the five year period, 1988 to 1993, the value of exports from western 
Canada grew by 23 per cent, while exports to the U.S. market rose by 58 per 
cent. The growth of total exports amounted to 51.3 per cent for Alberta, 18.4 per 
cent for Manitoba, 9 per cent for British Columbia, and 3.7 per cent for 
Saskatchewan. The growth in exports to U.S. markets was 77.1 per cent for 
Alberta, 70.4 per cent for Saskatchewan, 46.4 per cent for Manitoba, and 34.2 
per cent for British Columbia.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	I recognize that in quoting all these numbers it ends up being a 
major jumble. However, the fact remains we are not going to get 
rich in our nation by transferring wealth from one part of the 
country to another and then quibbling over who got more and 
who got less or where it came from. We are going to be wealthy 
as a nation because we produce wealth all over Canada. As an 
exporting nation we export primarily to the biggest and 
wealthiest market in the world which is right next door to us no 
matter where we live in Canada, the United States.
<P>
	If we would put half of our energies into developing our 
manufacturing base, our competitiveness and our export 
markets and break down the internal trade barriers so that we are 
competitive within the country and put those energies into 
exporting and developing our markets in the United States and 
elsewhere in the world, we would gain dramatically. This 
incessant bickering about who gets more and who gets less 
within our Confederation is destructive and leads nowhere.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest used the 
words quibbling and bickering several times. That concerns me. 
As a new member in this House I have heard a lot of quibbling 
and bickering and quite frankly, it has come from that side of the 
House.
<P>
	A colleague from eastern Canada not so very long ago talked 
about the people whose livelihood in fishing had been 
suspended. They were glad this government was helping them, 
that it was willing to stand up for what we might call our 
brothers and sisters in our family. I believe Canada is a family. I 
think the Reform Party shares this view and believes that 
Canada should continue to be a family and live as one. As a 
family, sometimes it is important to help each other. When we 
talk about putting money into different parts of Canada 
sometimes that is the reality. In tough times we have to stick 
together and do what is right for the country.
<P>
	Members have spoken today about history repeating itself. 
Many times in Canada's history it has been very positive to put 
money into different parts of Canada and to have jobs flourish 
and grow through that. Sometimes a hand up is a help.
<P>
	Does the hon. member honestly believe there is a simple 
solution? Should people only look out for themselves in their 
own backyards and not for the rest of the people in the 
community or country? Does the member believe that being a 
grab all and keeping it for himself would promote growth and 
jobs?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, in response to my hon. 
colleague's questions, I do not remember saying anything about 
a grab all in my presentation. One must be very cautious in using 
the term grab all. What we are talking about is putting money 
into the hands of individuals, in lending a helping hand and a 
hand up. I do not think that anyone seriously quibbles or quarrels 
with that.
<P>
	What we do have a problem with is when the federal 
government taxes individuals and takes the money into 
government. It takes a dollar from the hands of the taxpayer and 
then spits out 20 cents into the arms of a business. That business 
will then go into competition with the business which supplied 
the taxes in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	This debate has nothing to do with transfers to individuals. It 
has to do with regional economic expansion, which is federal 
government money going to businesses and the federal 
government picking winners and losers, or any government 
picking winners and losers. I submit if members were to make a 
list of winners and losers that all levels of governments have 
picked, the list of losers would be as long as their arms and the 
list of winners would be very short indeed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
absolutely delighted to be able to stand here today and set the 
record straight on some rather outlandish statements by Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition and Official Opposition.
<P>
	To claim that regional economic development efforts are 
creating overlap and inconsistencies resulting in 
``administrative chaos'' could not be further from the truth. This 
government's approach to economic development is working 
and is working toward eliminating the very overlap and 
duplication my hon. colleague speaks of.
<P>
	In particular, the record shows that the approach being taken 
in regional economic development by the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency is extremely effective. In fact, given its 
success in creating permanent jobs, ACOA is this government's 
prime instrument to create economic development in the 
Atlantic region.
<P>
	The regional agency approach has the full confidence of the 
government. Important gains have been made, but our 
government is still not satisfied with the rate of economic 
growth in Atlantic Canada. As such, much remains to be done to 
assist the region in attaining its full potential.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In order to help it respond to new development challenges, the 
agency must strategically direct its help to the most promising 
economic development opportunities in terms of job creation. 
Moreover, ACOA must become more aggressive in its efforts 
with small businesses to help them discover viable commercial 
ideas and actively realize them.

	Atlantic Canada's economy is going through a transition,

industrialized countries. Many factors explain this transition, 
the most notable being the changing structure of international 
trade, the speed of technological development and the 
generalization of government policies and the changes made to 
them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This trend is likely to continue at a rapid pace over the current 
decade. Trade liberalization offers numerous opportunities for 
trade development. New technologies offer tremendous 
opportunities for productivity improvement in all sectors of the 
economy and in all phases of the production process. All of 
these will open new opportunities for Atlantic Canadian 
producers and entrepreneurs, but will also translate into 
increased and intense competition on domestic and world 
markets.
<P>
	Governments increasingly constrained by mounting debt 
loads are forced to rethink their role and review social and 
economic programs. Speaking of learning from history, that is 
what this government is doing and that is what it is doing 
particularly through the mode of ACOA.
<P>
	First let me talk about the comprehensive approach to the 
economic development of the Atlantic economy. Regional 
economic development programs are not immune from this 
review process and ACOA is currently defining new corporate 
directions.
<P>
	The current government recognizes that strong regional 
economies are the building blocks for a strong Canadian 
economy. However, a new and more innovative approach to 
regional development needs to be developed, taking into 
consideration the global environment and tight fiscal 
constraints. Job creation will be the prime guiding principle for 
this new approach. This fulfils the promises we made in the red 
book and it is part and parcel of the philosophy and the base of 
this Liberal government.
<P>
	Small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, will be the focus 
of ACOA's programming and initiatives. The general approach 
will be to build on the expertise of all agents for economic 
development. This calls for economic co-operation, joint action 
and integrated development at the regional level.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Strong emphasis will be put on public sector and private 
sector partnering and the mobilization of scarce resources 
necessary to achieve strong regional economies and help 
regional firms and industries meet the challenges of 
international competition and change.
<P>
	Second, we have to improve co-ordination among federal and 
provincial governments. A major regional development priority 
of this government is to work closely with provincial 
governments to ensure that the federal government is a partner 
in the formulation of regional development.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A second guiding principle given for job creation is as 
follows: in conjunction with provincial governments, we will 
try to reach the goals set in the strategic economic plan by 
focusing our efforts on tourism infrastructure, on commercial 
applications of research and development in local institutions 
and on assistance directed particularly at small businesses.
<P>
	The government also recognizes that it is imperative to take at 
the regional level some action to improve co-ordination and 
effectiveness under the present circumstances of fiscal 
restraints and a heavy debt load.
<P>
	There must be a greater harmonization of efforts and actions 
by the federal government and the provinces in the area of 
regional development. In view of its size and population, the 
Atlantic region will be able to compete more effectively on the 
world market if it integrates its economy, harmonize its 
strategies and co-ordinate its activities on a regional basis. 
ACOA has already taken the first steps by establishing such 
co-operative efforts at the regional level. Partnership with the 
tourism industry in Atlantic Canada, which was talked about 
earlier, is an eloquent example of that.
<P>
	I also just recently announced an important measure on trade 
in the whole region, that is the co-operation agreement between 
Canada and the Atlantic provinces. That measure deals with the 
promotion of external trade. It will unite the four Atlantic 
provinces, ACOA, Industry Canada and Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade, in their efforts to help small and medium 
business in capturing export markets.
<P>
	However, it is possible to do even more and, in order to do so, 
the president of ACOA conducts a forum of deputy ministers 
responsible for economic development in the provinces. This 
forum has the mandate of harmonizing even more the 
development efforts in the Atlantic region.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Improving government services to small and medium sized 
business is a high priority for this government. In ``Creating 
Opportunity'' this government pledged to review regional 
development programs and grants to business to ensure that they 
reflect a commitment to streamline government operations and 
eliminate duplication, to provide better support to commercial 
applications of R and D, to export oriented industries, and to 
small and medium sized businesses.
<P>
	To this effect ACOA has established a Canada Business 
Service Centre in Halifax. One is currently being set up in 
Fredericton. Plans call for two other centres, in St. John's and in 
Charlottetown. These will serve as one stop shops for all federal 
and provincial government assistance to business. These centres 
will help improve considerably the delivery of assistance to 
these businesses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4787"> 4787 </A></B>
<P>
	There is currently numerous overlap and duplication in 
programs and services among federal departments and between 
provincial and federal governments. The CBSCs as well as the 
harmonization process between the federal government and 
provinces will contribute significantly toward elimination and 
reduction of overlap and duplication.
<P>
	ACOA as the government's primary industry for supporting 
small business in Atlantic Canada is well placed to play a lead 
role.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The emphasis will be put on the creation of permanent jobs as 
well as on the economic renewal, through the infrastructure 
program.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	We expect that 7,500 jobs will be created in the Atlantic 
region during the first two years of the infrastructure program. 
This program is making good progress and to date, 164 projects 
have been announced, representing a federal contribution of 
over $72 million earmarked for projects worth almost $200 
million. This will create a little over 2,500 jobs.
<P>
	Effective infrastructures will be put in place to attract 
industries to the communities. This new way of doing things 
will lead to increased competitiveness, a positive adjustment of 
the declining sectors, and a maximization of new opportunities.
<P>
	ACOA, together with other federal departments, the 
provincial governments and its partners in the private sector, 
will concentrate its efforts on improving the competitiveness of 
the businesses in the Atlantic region so that they can compete on 
regional, domestic and international markets. To achieve this, 
ACOA will target the aid for adopting and adapting high 
technology processes and information technology as well as 
developing human resources to improve the quality of labour 
management and finally allow companies in the Atlantic region 
to exist and to grow in today's highly competitive environment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One example of the type of innovative small company which 
the agency intends to target is Holland Stafford of 
Charlottetown which has become a leader in seafaring 
technology. This company has recently developed hundreds of 
new patterns for boat propellers by incorporating the latest 
technological developments and using new computerized design 
methods. This expertise has enabled the company to 
successfully expand into international markets for these 
products, as I am sure my colleague from Egmont would agree.
<P>
	Another example is Eastland Industries in Minto, New 
Brunswick which has set up a new computerized assembly line 
of production machinery. This innovation has helped it expand 
its sales of European style cabinets and countertops to the 
Atlantic and New England markets.
<P>
	Rationalization is occurring in all traditional industries: pulp 
and paper, fisheries and mining. As a result, employment in 
these industries has been declining. The transportation sector, 
notably railways, has also been shedding unprofitable activities 
which will also result in job losses.
<P>
	The demilitarization ensuing from the end of the communist 
regime in eastern Europe is resulting in the closure and 
downsizing of many bases in Atlantic Canada. This has been 
accompanied by the loss of military and civilian jobs.
<P>
	ACOA is taking a lead role in working with other federal 
departments, provincial governments and the affected 
communities to put in place development to replace these jobs. 
Some funds will soon be available to help communities get 
organized and develop and implement projects. ACOA's regular 
programs will of course be available to assist businesses seeking 
to establish or expand in these communities.
<P>
	Trade liberalization, as reflected by the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade, the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement and 
the NAFTA and, to a lesser extent, the economic integration of 
the European community, offer numerous new opportunities for 
Atlantic firms.
<P>
	ACOA will put significant emphasis on trade development so 
that entrepreneurs in Atlantic Canada can take full advantage of 
opportunities arising from trade globalization.
<P>
	A proactive approach will be adopted to support sectors and 
firms which have high growth potential. There will be a focus on 
high growth potential sectors such as communications and 
information technology, health industries and pharmaceuticals, 
geomagnetics in space. Development at the firm level will be 
encouraged through such measures as diagnostic services, 
benchmarking and strategic planning.
<P>
	Another example of a small company that has been able to 
penetrate export markets is Day Industrial and Minetech 
Incorporated in Cape Breton. The company has developed a long 
lasting, durable lamp for Cape Breton coal mines. It now sells its 
products to mining and other markets in Canada, the United 
States, Australia, Europe, South Africa and South America.
<P>
	Some of our friends across the way do not think that this is a 
good way to invest in Canadians. I think that is a shame.
<P>
	Ultima East of St. John's, Newfoundland has developed into a 
world leader in the development of access technology for 
mobile satellite data networks. Satellite Communications is a 
global industry and the company has developed a large foreign 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4788"> 4788 </A></B>
<P>
market, including Brazil, Norway and the United States. Ultima 
East has rapidly emerged as a success in a highly technical and 
competitive field. Started in 1985, Ultimate East and its parent 
company, New East, now employ 50 people, but hey, why should 
we put money into ACOA?
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	ACOA with other federal partners and the provinces has also a 
major role to play in maximizing the benefits from major 
projects such as the Northumberland Strait crossing project, the 
link, or as some of us like to call it, the span of green cables, and 
in helping deploy effectively the workers who will be displaced 
from cessation of the ferry service. The link will be unique in 
North America and world class. It will cost about $800 million 
to build and generate 5,000 person years of employment, 2,000 
during the peak employment period.
<P>
	The project will offer numerous regional benefits in terms of 
procurement, including goods, services and labour, significant 
investment opportunities and spin-off activities. The developer 
is committed under the regional benefit agreement to procure 70 
per cent of goods, materials and services and 96 per cent of 
labour content from Atlantic Canada. I think that is a great idea. 
I think the member for Egmont would agree with me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McGuire:</B> I agree.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I would bet even the member for 
Guelph-Wellington would agree with me.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> The agencies major objectives are to help ensure 
that the construction of the project contributes to ACOA's major 
corporate objectives of long term job creation and attracting 
new industries, to help ensure that the developer complies with 
the regional benefit agreement, to help mitigate the negative 
impact of the cessation of the marine Atlantic operation, to help 
minimize negative effects on marine Atlantic workers displaced 
by the construction of the fixed link, to help maximize 
development opportunities and benefits for the Borden area of 
Prince Edward Island and the Cape Tormentine area of New 
Brunswick arising from the Northumberland Strait crossing 
project.
<P>
	The federal government is committed to providing $20 
million to fund development activities in these areas. As a 
maritimer, as an Atlantic Canadian, I say hooray.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Like the other Canadian provinces, those in Atlantic Canada 
must face the major stakes created by the world economy which 
has become more and more competitive because of trade 
globalization and free trade. Moreover, Canadians from the 
Atlantic region must deal with a new reality: a systematic 
structural transformation of some major industries like the 
groundfish fisheries.
<P>
	If ACOA really wants to help the area to cope with the 
situation, it must absolutely use the meagre monetary resources 
it has in the best possible manner.
<P>
	The agency favours direct support of those sectors and 
companies which hold the most promise in terms of permanent 
jobs creation for Canadians of the Atlantic region. This 
government is determined to make the best possible use of its 
meagre resources by eliminating duplication and overlapping in 
services and programs  offered to businesses and by reducing the 
number of departments and agencies providing those services.
<P>
	Besides, the agency will continue to improve the efficiency of 
public investments by obtaining a greater commitment from the 
private sector towards the development of small and 
medium-sized businesses. But it is also the agency's 
responsibility to administer the resources allocated to it in the 
most effective way possible.
<P>
	Discussions about the necessity for Canadian businesses to 
improve their productivity to allow the country to be more 
competitive on the markets have become commonplace. 
However, the improvement of productivity is very important for 
the overall competitiveness of the country. The government is 
determined to improve the effectiveness of the bureaucracy, and 
I can tell you that any other private or public organization would 
die to be able to show results comparable to those of ACOA.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The agency's move to focus its activities on improving the 
competitiveness of small and medium sized business is more 
credible because ACOA has demonstrated it has an 
understanding of what is needed to improve efficiency and the 
benefits that are possible.
<P>
	Over the last three years ACOA has been able to reduce 
corporate administration costs as a percentage of total agency 
costs by 20 per cent. The agency is forecasting a further drop of 
25 per cent and so costs are expected to be only 3 per cent this 
year of total costs.
<P>
	Part of this government's commitment to creating 
opportunity has been to look at the relevance of all bodies and 
recommend elimination or downsizing.
<P>
	Shortly after taking charge of the agency a study was 
commissioned by Dr. Donald Savoie of the ACOA advisory 
board. The study was made available by the minister to the 
public. The recommendations are now being considered and he 
will soon be making recommendations in a number of areas, 
including the issue of streamlining the board's operation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4789"> 4789 </A></B>
<P>
	The savings which have been achieved and those which are 
able to come will potentially allow a transfer of funds from 
operating costs to contributions in support of SME growth and 
competitiveness.
<P>
	We in Atlantic Canada are very happy with ACOA. We are 
very happy as members of Parliament for Atlantic Canada and as 
Canadian members of Parliament that this government is 
committed to the regional development of every part of the 
country. The best and happiest Canadians are those with 
economic security. This government and ACOA know how to 
put that in motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Madam Speaker, I want 
first to thank the member for Halifax for her efforts to speak 
French.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	I know that the member has a lot of experience in this House. 
When she was in the opposition, I heard her talking about the 
Atlantic development agency. Besides, I was Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology 
when the act on that department was voted on, and I remember 
there were a lot of criticism of what was done.
<P>
	The government has now been in power for six months. 
Today, in order to justify the work done by her government, the 
parliamentary secretary gives us a list of businesses which 
received grants, obviously before her government came into 
office.
<P>
	However, I am happy to see that she thinks that having a 
regional development agency for Atlantic Canada is a good 
decision taken by the Conservatives because Canada is 
becoming more and more a country of economic regions where 
the market trends are more and more south-north and 
north-south than east-west.
<P>
	However, I have to admit that nothing was said about 
Hibernia. This is incredible. If we were to put in the bank all the 
money spent on Hibernia, we would have enough money for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency for the next 100 years. 
We would get hundreds of millions each year in interest alone on 
the money we are going to waste. What is the government 
doing? Nothing. We are wasting billions of dollars for 
something which has no viable future. It is unbelievable.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary is telling us about duplication 
and overlapping. She should thank Quebec for putting this on 
the agenda and making it a major issue. Clearly, in the years to 
come we will be less and less able to afford duplication and 
overlapping between the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	Those who wish to stay within Canada can try to come to an 
agreement with the federal government to limit duplication. 
However, when we talk about harmonizing it means that 
someone has decided to harmonize as he or she sees fit. That is 
exactly what the federal government is doing with respect to 
manpower despite the fact that,  in Quebec, all stakeholders 
have agreed that Quebec should be responsible for manpower 
training.
<P>
	However, the federal government has been refusing for years. 
We are promised agreement after agreement, but nothing ever 
comes about. What the government is seeking is not 
harmonization but centralization. Yet, we know that in order to 
have endogenous development in the regions they need 
resources. They need to have, locally, the right, the power, and 
the capacity to undertake projects without the federal big 
brother who thinks he can always do better than anyone else. 
This is the problem in this country.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	If the Liberal point of view had a purpose, with the huge 
amount of money invested in the Maritimes, this would be 
heaven on earth. The role of the federal government in regional 
development has a purpose.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay:</B> Maybe. The parliamentary secretary thinks 
Atlantic Canada is heaven on earth; maybe for her it is, but for 
the thousands of unemployed, for example those who have to 
move, it is certainly not a paradise. There is considerable work 
to be done and we think people can do better locally than 
whatever the civil servants could do here in Ottawa.
<P>
	We also think that Fisheries and Oceans officials would be 
better off in Newfoundland than in Ottawa. Of course the federal 
government always thinks it can do better.
<P>
	There is another very important point the parliamentary 
secretary forgot in her speech and it concerns the regional 
economy of the Atlantic region and Montreal. What is the 
government planning to do for the conversion? It certainly has a 
role to play in this issue since it was the one to give out the 
contracts. We all know that defence programs will decrease in 
importance because the government is getting out. Therefore, 
we must make sure that conversion programs from military to 
civilian use are implemented. We have been fighting for weeks 
here in the House for such measures. There even was an 
opposition day on that issue. The military economy is still 
important today; companies producing military equipment are 
very important in the Atlantic region. But the speech says 
nothing about that.
<P>
	They refer to successful projects, projects that produced good 
results during the Tory mandate and they say: ``Look at these 
achievements; that is what the Liberals want to do''. Meanwhile, 
they continue to forget the true role of the federal government in 
the conversion of military industries into civilian ones. That is 
the government's responsibility; the American government 
accomplished that very well by the way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4790"> 4790 </A></B>
<P>
	So if we want regional development in the Atlantic region, we 
must let the local people decide for themselves. We must stop 
spending billions of our taxpayers' money on stupid projects 
like Hibernia and we must immediately implement a conversion 
program for military industries.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to remind 
members that this is a question and comment period; we are not 
on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay:</B> This was a comment, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> If I may say so, it was a 
very lengthy comment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, the member's comments are 
not causing me any problem; I accept them at face value.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to say a couple of things. First, if the hon. 
member would like to have a debate on the principles and the 
reasons for the setting up of Hibernia I suggest that he bring it 
forward. I would be delighted to debate him on that topic at any 
time.
<P>
	However, I came today to talk about regional development in 
general, and ACOA being the vehicle for that that was the reason 
that I decided to use ACOA. I understand that the hon. members 
of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition are not perhaps aware of 
what really happens in Atlantic Canada. As an Atlantic 
Canadian member of Parliament it is my duty to make them 
aware of it.
<P>
	I believe that Atlantic Canada is a heaven on earth due to long 
time Liberal policies. To make it a true heaven on earth, it would 
perhaps be wise if some people would stop trying to rip the heart 
out of my country.
<P>
	To get back to the point I made before to the hon. member, I 
am glad that he remembers his previous role in a government 
which pursued, I might add, a scorched earth policy in Atlantic 
Canada. Those days are over. It is unusual for members of le 
Bloc to remember that their birth came from the Progressive 
Conservative government that did such damage in Atlantic 
Canada. I think it is quite honest and shows a level of integrity in 
the hon. member that he admits his role in that pernicious 
government with its pernicious policies and that he is obviously 
prepared to seek some sort of absolution from those of us in 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	He is not going to get it. He certainly is not going to get it from 
me. What he is going to get is good policy, job creation and a 
belief in every region of this Canada; Atlantic Canada, Quebec, 
Ontario, the prairies, the west and the north. One country united, 
indivisible. As I have said the heart in the province of Quebec 
remains strong.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> One short question from 
the hon. member for Vegreville.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Madam Speaker, does that 
mean that I cannot ask all three of them?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. That is the 
unfortunate part about long comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> I will make the question very brief to the hon. 
parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	First, have the billions and billions of dollars spent on 
programs for regional development in the maritimes and the 
dozens of programs helped the maritimes to the extent that they 
are equal with other provinces in Canada in terms of their 
economy?
<P>
	The second is a comment made by the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Industry earlier that Alberta and 
B.C. had given over $100 billion more than they had received 
from the coffers into the federal government coffers. In fact the 
figure should be between $100 and $160 billion in Alberta. Does 
the member think that Albertans are willing to give more?
<P>
	Finally, I would like a response to this very brief quote: ``A 
reliance on granterpreneurship as opposed to entrepreneurship 
has fostered artificial local competition and created distortions 
in local markets''.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, I would like 
to give the hon. member a few seconds to respond.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
question. I would although ask him to use words that I am 
familiar with in either of the two official languages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> They are from the red book.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> There is no such word as granterpreneurship.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> That quote is from your red book.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, do something about him, will 
you. I did not think I was going to have to come here and give 
lessons in history but obviously the Reform Party needs it. If he 
wants to know about the history of this country and what 
Atlantic Canadians have given in dollars he might talk to his pal 
across the aisle who did have a history in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	He might want to know for example when I brought it up to his 
friend from the Kootenays earlier today that for over 20 years 
Atlantic Canadians paid an extra $5 over world price on every 
barrel of their oil to go directly, my learned friend, into the 
coffers of the Alberta government to build the oil industry in 
Alberta.
<P>
	Nova Scotians, New Brunswickers, P.E. Islanders and 
Newfoundlanders after their entry into Confederation did it with 
joy because we are one country. We believe in transfer 
payments. We believe in equalization payments and we are 
going to do it whether the hon. member likes it or not.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I take part in the 
debate on regional development. I really appreciate today's 
motion by my friend and colleague from 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. I must remind you that 
regional development is first and foremost a regional 
responsibility. In my riding of eastern Quebec, as elsewhere in 
Quebec and in Canada, people know their territory and its 
resources and how to develop them. Very often, they need only a 
little bit of money and the support of the local government.
<P>
	However, yesterday, in preparation for this debate, my staff 
contacted various spokespersons in my riding. They all said the 
same thing: ``The region has its resources and governments, 
rather than listening to us in order to help us develop them, do 
what they please and more often than not fight it out among 
themselves at our expense obviously''. Other people have 
denounced the attitude of the federal government which not only 
encroaches on areas of provincial jurisdiction, but also often 
takes initiatives diametrically opposed to the will of the local 
and provincial governments.
<P>
	However, with an unemployment rate of 27.3 per cent in the 
Gaspé Peninsula and of 17.6 per cent in the Lower St. Lawrence 
district, efficiency is now a must. In my riding, for example, we 
have ideas on how to create jobs by using our natural resources 
like the forest, agriculture or manufacturing resources. We have 
projects for processing plants, and so forth.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, very often, the federal government has shown in 
the last few years its total lack of understanding of the regions' 
needs. On December 5, 1990, the president and CEO of the CBC, 
Gérard Veilleux, announced the closing of the CJBRT station in 
Rimouski, CBGAT in Matane, CBST in Sept-Îles, for a total of 
about 150 jobs in eastern Quebec and lost wages of almost two 
million. Not only did we see families leave the area and the 
regional economy lose these two million-and this is a very 
large sum for a region such as eastern Quebec-but our 
shopkeepers, our community lost at the same time a very 
important means of communication. Now, to hear about the 
eastern part of Quebec on CBC television broadcast from 
Quebec city, we must be on the lookout since it is often 
sandwiched between news concerning Quebec's mayor and his 
disputes with the mayor of Sainte-Foy on the program ``Ce 
soir''. Sometimes there is something about the eastern part of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Let us not forget also the bad federal decisions made by the 
Trudeau government which seem to have benefited the 
Maritimes. There was a bad decision about Mirabel and another 
one, taken by the minister of the day, member for Matane, about 
the Maurice Lamontagne Institute, which was located in 
Sainte-Flavie when it should have been in Pointe-au-Père. An 
$18 million  wharf was constructed, but no ship ever drew 
alongside it since there is nothing to protect those that would. In 
the meantime, the wharf at Pointe-au-Père is rotted out but we 
do not have the million dollars needed to pull it down, even 
though it is a public hazard.
<P>
	The CBC pulled $46 million out of the regions when it closed 
11 regional stations across Canada. I remind members that that 
restructuration cost quite a few million dollars, more exactly 
$138.5 million, not to mention the fact that the CBC's deficit is 
far from under control.
<P>
	Our regions remember this episode vividly, especially the fact 
that the first thought of the management of the CBC was to cut 
regional services. This set an example that was repeated many 
times over.
<P>
	Another significant example of the lack of respect paid to 
regions was the closing of post offices. Imagine the contempt of 
Quebecers or rural Canadians whose post offices are being 
closed, despite their very important role in the community. The 
current government has indeed declared a moratorium on post 
office closures, but it has not committed itself to reopening the 
post offices which were closed by its predecessor, and people in 
my riding who were contacted by my office yesterday and who 
are working on this issue are not at all sure that the post offices 
will remain open once the moratorium is lifted. On the contrary, 
some have told us that Canada Post's current lobby would 
ultimately succeed.
<P>
	VIA Rail is another example. The government boasts about its 
infrastructure program, but at the same time, it keeps 
dismantling other important infrastructures such as VIA Rail 
when we all know how railways, in regions like ours, do make a 
vital contribution to the Eastern Quebec economy.
<P>
	Another example of this government's sensitivity is the 
National Film Board's decision to close its regional offices. The 
Carrousel du film, a major festival in the area of audio-visual 
production for children and the only one of its kind in America, 
has also been targeted for severe budget cuts. Telefilm, which 
must reduce its funding of various programs because of cuts 
imposed by the government, has decided to focus more on large 
festivals, or those held in big cities. The Carrousel du film, 
which is a regional festival, will therefore be subjected to cuts. 
This internationally recognized festival promotes productions 
for children, a key sector which meets the objectives of 
acquainting children with quality movies. But, here again, our 
unfeeling government did not hesitate to make cuts.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Those are only a few examples of what the implementation of 
so-called national policies leads to. Such policies are dreamed 
up in a city by city-dwelling bureaucrats and civil servants who 
do not have the slightest idea of the concerns of people in remote 
areas.

	The first consequence of the deplorable failure of federalism 
in the remote areas of Quebec is the exodus of adults and young 
people alike. If you refer to a publication of the Rimouski 
community health department, called <I>Optique Santé</I>, you will 
find some fascinating information. The 1991 census shows that 
the Quebec population has increased by 5.6 per cent, whereas 
the Lower St. Lawrence is loosing its population and shows a net 
loss of 2.7 per cent.
<P>
	This overall drop in the Lower St. Lawrence population is due 
to a negative balance of migration. Such emigration is one of the 
main causes of the aging of these communities since it is the 
most mobile inhabitants who leave, namely the young people 
and the adults. In short, the failure of the federal regional 
development policy has had a severe impact on the demographic 
decline of the Lower St. Lawrence. People in that area will speak 
loud and clear during the upcoming election and referendum.
<P>
	This morning, our ability to read was questioned so, to 
conclude, I would like to quote from John Naisbitt's book 
entitled <I>Global Paradox</I>. According to the jacket blurb, he is 
supposed to be quite a genius.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``In the hallmark of genius is simplicity that Naisbitt has 
brilliantly presented a work which reasonably addresses the 
challenges of the future while providing the chart for successful 
navigation''.
<P>

<P>
	I will now quote the author.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The breakup of countries (artificially put together) into national or tribal 
entities is surely as beneficial as the breakup of companies. It eliminates 
duplication and waste, reduces bureaucracy and promotes motivation and

like in companies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is what the Chilean Minister of Finance has to say about 
him:

	Quebec's objective is quite laudable. English Canada has not 
yet understood that we have had enough of not having the 
necessary resources to fully develop our potential. So Atlantic 
Canada is a paradise on earth, let it keep on developing! So 
western Canada has all it needs for its development! Ontario, 
where most of this government comes from, is still not 
understanding what is going on in the rest of Canada. But 
nothing will deter us from our one and only goal: Quebec 
sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Madam Speaker, I found the speech  of the hon. 
member for Rimouski-Témiscouata very interesting. 
However, she did not mention the private sector. She only 
mentioned the CBC, VIA Rail, the Film Festival, the NFB. She 
did not talk about private enterprises, but she mentioned one 
author, someone who argues that the state should be managed 
like a private company. We have seen the results with the 
Conservatives and some members of the Bloc. If she really 
wants to talk about job creation, she should give us some 
examples in the private sector.
<P>
	I must also point out that the Federal Office of Regional 
Development is precisely located in the beautiful city of 
Rimouski. I believe that the hon. member will have the 
opportunity to talk with these people and to set up a real program 
of economic development instead of complaining to her 
colleagues, here in the House.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> I met the director of the Federal Office of 
Regional Development in my riding. He told me that the 
cupboard was bare. I do not mind talking in this House, but when 
I am told that there are only $2 million left for the Lower St. 
Lawrence, the Gaspé Peninsula and the Magdalen Islands, I say 
that the cupboard is bare.
<P>
	We are told about the development of small and 
medium-sized enterprises, but I am still waiting for the list of 
those created since this government took office. There are no 
business opportunities to talk about in my riding. All I have, 
daily, are people joining the ranks of those on unemployment 
insurance or welfare. There are no businesses developing.
<P>
	Of course, the restaurant La Cage aux sports will open on June 
15, but I do not call that an extraordinary economic development 
of the Lower St. Lawrence and the Gaspé Peninsula. Sure, this 
will be on more establishment, but this will only divide the 
profits. There are plenty of restaurants in my riding, so the 
opening of this one will cause another to close or will divide the 
profits. People are moving out, because there are no jobs. We are 
waiting for jobs, Mr. Parliamentary Secretary.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to remind 
the hon. members that comments must also be addressed to the 
Chair.
<P>
	As you only have about one minute left, I will give the floor to 
hon. member for Durham.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4793"> 4793 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to ask a couple of questions of the hon. member.
<P>
	First, she talked about post office closures. She and some 
other members talked today about the reductions in UI benefits 
and so forth as some kind of a failure of our federal system. At 
the same time she complained about the deficit. Her party 
complains about the deficit, that this is a tax on the backs of the 
people of Quebec.
<P>
	I wonder how you can have it both ways. How can we try to 
control the deficit by some of these manoeuvres and at the same 
time be blamed for not dealing with the deficit problems. I find 
this a terrible inconsistency in their philosophy.
<P>
	Second, I would like to pick up on one of their other members, 
the member for Abitibi, who talked about the empowerment of 
some of the local regional municipalities. Would she support a 
philosophy that paid regional transfer payments and rather than 
sending them to the province of Quebec actually sent them to the 
regional municipalities in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
you. Your question should be directed to the previous speaker.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, the question takes me by 
surprise because my remarks had nothing to do with what the 
hon. member is talking about. There was no mention of deficit 
reduction in my remarks. This point has been made to another 
hon. member earlier, but as far as I am concerned, I never raised 
the issue.
<P>
	Deficit reduction is the least of my worries. My main concern 
at this time is to ensure that people are afforded the dignity of 
getting up in the morning, facing themselves in the mirror and 
setting off to got to work, instead of getting depressed because 
they have nothing to eat or no job. What we need, Madam 
Speaker, is jobs. This government crows about jobs, but does not 
create any. It produces fine speeches, but no jobs. What I want is 
job creation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, as member 
representing Lévis and the Quebec region, I am pleased to 
participate in this special debate on regional development 
initiated by the Official Opposition.
<P>
	I think it may be useful at this stage of the debate to read again 
the motion before us, which was put forward by the hon. member 
for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the federal government's ineffective regional 
development interventions, which create overlappings and inconsistencies, 
resulting in an administrative chaos that hampers regional economic growth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Madam Speaker, the members of the current federal 
government rack their brains only to recall the good shots of the 
previous Liberal government in terms of regional development.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Some members like the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood-he is from Ontario-even got the 
feeling that Quebec was living off the federal government, that 
it owed its very survival to the federal government's support. I 
could quote other comments, but my point is the following: if 
Quebec costs so much in terms of unemployment insurance, 
social assistance, regional assistance and so on, what is the point 
of insisting, as this government does, on Quebec remaining a 
part of this Confederation? One wonders.
<P>
	Figures speak louder than feelings. Therefore, I would like to 
recall a few. Between 1989 and 1994, according to the figures 
from the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, the 
Atlantic provinces received $920 per person for regional 
development; Western Canada, $240; and Quebec, $230, which 
is less than Western Canada and much less than the Maritimes. 
The hon. member said that Quebec seemed to be the main 
beneficiary of regional development but, as we can see, Western 
Canada and the Maritimes received four times as much. Ontario 
receives $30 per resident but-as everyone recognizes and I 
think Ontarians must recognize it, too-Ontario is the main 
beneficiary of the federalist system.
<P>
	Why? First of all, the presence of the public service, as well as 
all the money spent on AECL, on the Toronto Airport, over the 
years. There is also the defence industry. While Quebec was 
getting subsidies for small business, for bicycles in the Beauce 
region, Ontario's auto industry was doing very well and the 
military tank industry, even better.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bonaventure said something earlier 
about how impressive business subsidies are. I did some 
calculations and in the provincial riding of Lévis, which is split 
in two at the provincial level, in what is called the regional 
county municipality of Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, which is my 
local economic development corporation, they estimated the 
impact of federal funds on the economic development of this 
riding at less than 1 per cent. One per cent of the regional 
economy comes from the federal government. They then try to 
convince us that Quebec would not have been able to develop its 
regions without the federal government's help. This 
disproportion is unacceptable.
<P>
	Beyond figures-we could argue over figures for a long 
time-what is Quebec organizations' main complaint against 
the federal government's actions? I am not talking about the 
Bloc Quebecois but about the claims made by organizations in 
books and forums. They say that, basically, the main 
shortcoming of the federal government is that it does not hold 
enough consultations with the regional organizations already in 
place. Federal  departments do not even hold enough 
consultations among themselves before taking action, so that 
most of the time the action only involves one sector.
<P>
	I will give you an example. In the rail industry, they say it is 
expensive to maintain CN services but they do not consider the 
impact this will have on Quebec roads.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4794"> 4794 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Let me give you an example. At certain times, a passenger 
train represents the equivalent of 17,000 automobiles on the 
road. These are the figures of the Quebec Department of 
Transport. When the idea is entertained of abandoning certain 
lines such as the Murray Bay line in the Charlevoix region and a 
number of other lines leading to the Beauce region, no 
consideration is given to the impact this could have on road 
infrastructures. This is what I mean by short-sighted sectoral 
intervention.
<P>
	Another problem is maps. Federal government department 
maps do not jibe with one another, or for that matter, with 
provincial or regional municipality maps.
<P>
	Apparently that is the case. Another area which we hear a 
great deal about but about which little is written is the Youth 
Service Corps. The member for Bonaventure has given me a 
striking illustration of the problem. While in Winnipeg, the 
minister announced the creation of four pilot projects, each with 
a budget of $100,000. However, one of the four projects was 
given a budget of $600,000. In which riding did this pilot project 
happen to be? Surprise, the member for Bonaventure's riding. 
That is what was announced in the minister's press release 
issued in Winnipeg. Check it out for yourselves.
<P>
	Moving on, I would like to speak a little about the Quebec 
City area which, on a provincial level, is divided into two major 
regions, the combined population of which exceeds 900,000. 
Until now, the tertiary sector has been front and centre.
<P>
	Allow me to quickly mention one case, that of MIL Davie. 
Here is an extraordinary opportunity for the federal government 
to intervene in the field of regional development. Before the 
Liberal Party came to power, this sector represented $150 
million in wages. It also represented $600 million in economic 
spin-offs for the Quebec City area. The region has been waiting 
for six months for a decision on the awarding of transitional 
contracts for the Magdalen Islands ferry and for the smart ship.
<P>
	Another important issue, apart from rail transportation which 
I have already mentioned, is the Quebec City airport. We have 
been waiting for years for action in this area. When the 
Conservatives were in office, they had a small sign erected 
proclaiming this facility to be Jean Lesage International 
Airport. However, the only thing that is international about this 
bush-league airport is the wording on its sign.
<P>
	As for the municipal convention centre, the project got going 
only very recently. It took years! The communications problem 
raised by the hon. member for Rimouski also affects us, because 
the resources we had before which were exclusive to the Quebec 
City area must now be shared with the regions in eastern Quebec 
and the North Shore.
<P>
	There is also the problem of the Port of Quebec. It is 
experiencing a tremendous decline. Why? Because goods are 
now shipped west, and their transportation is subsidized. Just 
reread the agreement on Crow's Nest subsidies. Yes, I know that 
was when the Conservatives were in power, but it still goes on.
<P>
	There are the ports of refuge. The same thing goes in 
Saint-Jean-Port-Joli and in Portneuf: the federal government 
does not even maintain its own equipment and it has become 
dangerous to go near it.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by saying that the urban region of 
Quebec City has not done too badly, in the end, but the problem 
we see in the outlying regions of Bellechasse, Portneuf and 
Charlevoix is the same as in the Lower St. Lawrence and the 
Gaspé Peninsula. But there are also large areas of poverty even 
in downtown Quebec, to which I think the Liberal government 
has so far shown great indifference.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi-Association 
Canadienne-Française de l'Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	I would like to start by pointing out the blatant contradiction 
in the position of the Official Opposition. On the one hand the 
Bloc argues that federal intervention is ineffective for Quebec's 
economic development.  On the other hand it criticizes the 
federal government for cutting back on the budgets of the 
regional agencies. It cannot continue to have it both ways. 
Liberals believe that federal programs from unemployment 
insurance, to health care, to community development, to 
education, to regional development can and do assist each and 
every region in Canada to grow and prosper.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	From the perspective of western Canada it can be said that the 
concept of a regional economic development agency based to 
promote western interests is crucial in terms of diversifying the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4795"> 4795 </A></B>
<P>
economic base of western Canada in creating jobs, increasing 
our international trade and in obtaining a greater share of federal 
contracts.
<P>
	Many people in western Canada have come to identify 
western diversification as the voice of the west in Ottawa, a 
department which has done a great deal to ensure that western 
Canada's interests are always taken into account in the national 
decision making process.
<P>
	Western diversification assists western businesses to get 
equal access to major government contracts not by interfering in 
the process but by ensuring that there is fairness and equity 
involved in the awards, that the contracts go to the businesses 
with the best technology and the best people capable of 
providing a quality product.
<P>
	I am sure members will all agree many of those high quality 
companies and people are based in the west, making a major 
contribution to the economic strength, not just of western 
Canada, but of the nation as a whole.
<P>
	The western share of industrial and regional benefits from 
major federal procurement contracts has risen from just over 7 
per cent in 1988 to just about 35 per cent today, representing 
some $1.7 billion.
<P>
	I would also like to commend the Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification for the work he has done in bringing 
the western provinces together to the table to look at pan western 
initiatives which will prove of enormous benefit to the economy 
of the region and the nation as well. He has taken the lead in 
saying to the provinces that we should work together in the spirit 
of co-operation because the government recognizes that 
co-operation at all levels of government is essential to 
achieving and maintaining a strong economy not subject to the 
ebb and flow of international commodity prices, but one which 
is developed from the strength of the region's people, its skills, 
and its natural resources.
<P>
	This kind of co-operation between governments does not 
create overlap but rather enables all levels to maximize the 
return on their investment of taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	As the member for Saskatoon-Dundurn I know first hand of 
the importance of diversifying the economic base of 
Saskatchewan. Biotechnology is now a flourishing industry in 
Saskatoon thanks in part to the assistance given by western 
diversification, the NRC and other federal programs that 
appreciate that Saskatoon has the necessary human skills as 
anywhere else in Canada. We are building a niche in agricultural 
biotechnology that is unsurpassed but it is only possible because 
of the partnerships that are being facilitated by the federal 
government.
<P>
	Western diversification is also working closely with business, 
labour, educational and other institutions for the betterment of 
the economic well-being of western Canada and the nation as a 
whole. If western Canada is strong all of Canada benefits and the 
same holds true for Quebec, Ontario and the Atlantic.
<P>
	Repayable assistance for small and medium sized businesses 
by western diversification has helped more than 4,000 projects 
get off the ground and has created or maintained over 40,000 
jobs.
<P>
	I know that my colleagues from the Reform Party would 
rather wipe out this kind of assistance but as my government 
colleagues have already pointed out with many compelling 
examples from across the country, by helping some of those 
innovative entrepreneurs get their foot through the door 
opportunities that otherwise would be lost are instead being 
created.
<P>
	Although working with business in this regard is still a major 
role I believe the department's advocacy role and its 
increasingly close ties with the provinces and municipalities are 
both key to the future strength of western Canada.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Our infrastructure program is a compelling example of the 
importance of such partnerships. Strategic initiatives such as 
information networks which ensure economic and business 
information are shared across the west. Other initiatives such as 
an agri-food initiative which will increase the export of value 
added food products and benefit farmers and food producers 
across western Canada and the rest of the nation can only be 
regarded as positive and proof indeed that western 
diversification is not only working as a concept but is making a 
very real, very positive contribution to the nation's economic 
strength.
<P>
	The motion calls on the House to condemn ineffective 
regional development interventions. This Liberal government is 
working actively to improve and strengthen regional 
development initiatives across Canada. Indeed we were elected 
on our policies which include the following commitment in our 
red book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We see strong regional economies as the building blocks of Canada. One of 
the most important ways of making this happen is to develop forums for 
economic co-operation, joint action and integrated development at the regional 
level.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is the approach that we are embracing and promoting. I 
do not support the opposition motion, as I believe that our 
federal interventions in regional development are essential to 
strengthening the social and economic fabric of Canada today 
and in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member who just presented gave a quote from the red book. I 
would like to give a quote from the red book that I gave earlier:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A reliance on ``granterpreneurship'', as opposed to entrepreneurship, has 
fostered artificial local competition and created distortions in local markets.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4796"> 4796 </A></B>
<P>
	That is a quote from the Liberal red book and that is the part of 
the quote that you left out from the quote that you just presented 
to us. I think the hon. member maybe should consider that in his 
comments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would ask the hon. 
member to address his comments to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to ask some 
questions about western diversification.
<P>
	The hon. member has mentioned some success stories, at least 
in his mind they are success stories, and I would like to ask about 
some other people, for example the local owner of a sausage 
plant in my constituency who has been competing and been 
struggling but he is making a go of it. This family business as a 
sausage plant has had to compete with a sausage plant down the 
road that has received western diversification money. This is 
unfair competition with his tax dollars that he has paid to the 
government to help support the competition.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member if he feels that is fair.
<P>
	What about the two local businesses, the largest businesses in 
our neighbouring town, that are funded through western 
diversification, both now out of business and have left the town 
grasping for something to replace them and it is not there.
<P>
	What about the swather manufacturing business in 
Saskatchewan, a very successful business, which was forced to 
compete against a swather manufacturing plant funded with 
western diversification money. The result was they both went 
out of business because of this unfair competition.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member what about those 
businesses and what about Albertans who have paid $100 billion 
to $165 billion more in tax dollars through the national energy 
program and through transfer payments to the federal 
government than they received over the past 25 years. Is it fair to 
those Alberta taxpayers to be funding these programs in other 
provinces?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Madam Speaker, we have reference to the red 
book again. I am very pleased that the members of the Reform 
Party are making such good use of the red book since I trust that 
it will go down in history as one of the finest productions that 
made in the political history of this country. It is nice to hear that 
they continue to refer to it. I am pleased they have referred to it.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	When we make reference to the red book we see the new 
direction the hon. minister in charge of that department wants to 
take western diversification. The direction is not one of giving 
away money to businesses but one of helping businesses identify 
export markets, helping businesses arrange the financing, not 
giving them financing, and helping businesses compete on the 
international market.
<P>
	In my province in western Canada we see industries are 
expanding and increasing their exports into countries  like the 
United States in the areas of farm machinery in particular and of 
meat products. These are being expanded and we cannot ignore 
such businesses.
<P>
	This will continue because our government intends to help 
business increase exports, not compete against each other 
unfairly in our country but compete on the international market.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Madam Speaker, like many Quebecers, I certainly do 
not agree with the motion as it is tabled by the opposition.
<P>
	It is interesting that, just last week, the United Nations told 
the whole world that Canada is the number one country in terms 
of its quality of life.
<P>
	For that reason, I find it curious that some, particularly 
opposition members, say that every measure taken by the 
government of Canada has been a failure. Let me tell you this: 
Since 1974, the Federal Office of Regional Development has 
invested over $1.6 billion. All kinds of agreements were 
concluded, including on tourism, forestry, fisheries and job 
stimulation. Over the last few months, there has even been talk 
of a dynamic federalism, because we rely a lot on measures 
taken in the past.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I must also tell you that over 80 per cent of 
the money invested in Quebec was transferred to that province 
through administrative agreements. We are there to stimulate 
the industry as a whole. We are there to help small businesses.
<P>
	We did not waste any time since we took office. We launched 
the infrastructure program. We have allocated over $60 million 
through partnership projects with the province and the 
municipalities. This program was initially endorsed by the 
mayors of Quebec city and Montreal, and surely by several 
dozens if not hundreds more throughout the province.
<P>
	There is a lot to do. All Canadians must make sacrifices, as 
well as the province and the municipalities, but we are there to 
stimulate employment.
<P>
	As regards the environment, the hon. member for Malpeque 
and myself did not wait. We looked after the <I>Irving Whale</I> issue. 
There are members who take environmental issues seriously. 
The members opposite must know that the federal government 
has just announced a $100 million project for the St. Lawrence 
River, with a contribution of $60 million from the province of 
Quebec. This is a serious government which is concerned first 
by the employment situation, but also by the environment issue.
<P>
	We can also talk about the Cod-Fisher Assistance Program. It 
is true that cod-fishers, not only in Quebec, but throughout 
Atlantic Canada, are going through a rough time. We have 
invested $1.9 billion, including $100 million in Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The weekly benefits these people receive have gone from 
$171 to $219. We are ready to invest significant amounts of 
money in the Gaspé Peninsula for job creation and economic 
recovery, by urging people to open small businesses, to take up 
aquaculture, to participate in some programs and to develop 
their entrepreneurial spirit. That is the role of the federal 
government, the role of the Government of Canada.
<P>
	We can also talk about the Federal Office of Regional 
Development. The hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata 
said: ``The federal did not invest in anything. I am looking, but I 
cannot see where it invested''. I want to point out to her that 
there is a Federal Office of Regional Development in Rimouski. 
As a resident of the Gaspé area, I can tell you that Rimouski has 
received more than its share, compared to other regions in 
Eastern Quebec. The time has come to do something about this.
<P>
	You know, we have invested in more than 1,000 small 
businesses in Eastern Quebec. Of course, we have invested in 
corporations which have become, with the help of the 
Government of Canada, multinational companies, like Canadair 
and de Havilland, and also Bombardier, a world-renowned 
Quebec company. We have invested in Noranda and in the 
mining industry.
<P>
	The Government of Canada takes its responsibilities 
seriously. I can give you some more examples. I see here that the 
Corporation of the mining community of Bourlamaque, in 
Val-d'Or, has recently received $3 million in subsidies. Spielo, 
in Sainte-Anne-des-Monts, got $1 million, which is not an 
insignificant investment for a region hard hit by unemployment.
<P>
	And this one is my favourites. You know that we firmly 
believe in education. Incidentally, I went in the beautiful 
constituency of Rimouski to hand out federal scholarships to 
young and promising students, to future leaders of Canadian 
society. I can tell you that we want our young to achieve 
excellence. At the Université du Québec, we invested more than 
$9 million in the Engineering Department building, because we 
believe in the scientific sector in Eastern Quebec. Sure, people 
will tell me that education comes under the provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Here is a question for you, Madam Speaker: Why is it that 
several school boards in Quebec have a drop-out rate of 35 to 40 
per cent? We know very well why. The answer is easy. Because it 
comes under provincial jurisdiction. But why has the province, 
which has had jurisdiction over education since 1867, been 
unable to correct this situation? And we know that 95 per cent of 
young people complete their studies in Korea, and 90 per cent in 
Japan. It is often said that students in some developing countries 
have a better completion rate than Quebec students. The Quebec 
government and the Opposition members should take their 
responsibilities.
<P>
	By the way, the policy of the Bloc is obviously suicidal for 
Quebec. It does not address the real issues for Quebecers, that is 
job creation and protection. But I do not want to conclude with 
this. I want to tell you about the Town Corporation of 
Rivière-du-Loup, which recieved $1.3 million; the Forestville 
sawmill, $4.75 million. And that is not all.
<P>
	I told you about the dryers in my beautiful constituency of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, and we invested more 
than $4 million in the Outaouais region. In Forestville, there is a 
$1.1 million project funded by the federal government; and the 
Tadoussac Town Corporation got almost $775,000.
<P>
	Maybe I should say a few words about the riding of 
Bonaventure. We invested over $300,000 last winter in surface 
grinders to help tourism. We invested $50,000 in studies for the 
museums. We invested $120,000 in the Youth Service Corps. We 
have already invested a lot of money, even though we have been 
in office for only six months, and we are about to invest several 
million more. We have a business plan and we are very serious 
about our job.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	We have acted instead of preaching about sovereignty, 
independence and separation, about destroying the best country 
in the world, about getting a divorce-that was the word used by 
the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata who, by the way, 
did not propose anything. It is easy to criticize. Admittedly, 
Canada may not be easy to govern, but it is a generous country. It 
is recognized internationally.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition even went to see the Europeans 
and the Americans to ask them if they would recognize Quebec 
as a sovereign state. Essentially, they said: ``We recognize 
Canada as a country''.
<P>
	In the business world, in the private sector, in real life, it is 
important to know with whom you are dealing. Canada has been 
known as a country for 125 years. It is a welcoming country, a 
country which sacrificed many of its sons and daughters in the 
First and Second World Wars. Canada has a very good credit 
rating. But some people do not realize that we have a lot of work 
to do and that we must do it together. They do not realize that 
those who would suffer the most as a result of the divorce 
proposed by the opposition would be the workers of Quebec. 
Everybody knows that. Ridiculous numbers are often thrown at 
us. Some people do not understand that we have an obligation 
towards all Quebecers and all Canadians. We have to take care of 
their future, but it is not by talking about separation and about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4798"> 4798 </A></B>
<P>
destroying this country as we know it that we will give a better 
life to Canadians, especially to Quebecers.
<P>
	We know that only 5 per cent of Quebecers, opposition 
members included, believe that independence is the most 
pressing issue. I see that my time is running out, but we have 
many questions to solve and I think that we are going to solve 
them together. We are going to solve them among Canadians. 
But I find it totally unacceptable for the opposition to laugh at us 
when we say that we want to put Canadians back to work, 
particularly Quebecers, but they offer no alternative but 
sovereignty and wishful thinking.
<P>
	I urge opposition members to look around them and maybe to 
co-operate with us in the search for solutions-which will 
certainly not include sovereignty-to put Quebecers back to 
work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
go back to a few points mentioned by the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine when he vaunted the 
Liberals' regional development programs. First, with regard to 
education programs in Quebec, he said he was concerned about 
the drop-out rate in Quebec. But he never said we were losing 
between $250 and $300 million a year in occupational training, 
money which should be spent in Quebec to help solve the 
problems caused by dropping out. Education budgets have been 
cut for nearly ten years in Quebec and, again, it is a Liberal 
government which, for the last eight years, has reduced grants to 
school boards and continually asked them to do more.
<P>
	Neither does the member mention duplication in regional 
development, where federal programs overlap with provincial 
programs, and sometimes all this is done without considering 
evaluation programs. They do not want to know what the results 
will be. All they want is to throw some money in order to 
convince Quebecers that the federal government is the best. 
They are not interested to know if the programs will help create 
jobs, all they want is to spend money to impress people.
<P>
	Where was the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine last week when we spoke 
of putting the regional infrastructure in place for building a 
high-speed rail line? Not a single Liberal member from Quebec 
rose in this House to support this bill, which could create 
120,000 jobs. This is a real regional development project, it is 
not an infrastructure project creating only short-term jobs. But 
the member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine was not 
here to support it.
<P>
	When one speaks of measures, one must be sincere and follow 
one's principles and thinking through to their conclusion!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, members opposite speak 
about vocational training. In 1975 and 1970, more than 20 years 
ago, we had five or six vocational training programs at the high 
school in Bonaventure. Today, there are only a couple left.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Quebec withdrew from its commitment to vocational training. 
That should not be blamed on the Canadian government. A 
question was asked about the $250 or $300 million funding. This 
is a matter of harmonization, and of reaching an administrative 
agreement with Quebec. Negotiations are under way and I can 
tell you we are making good progress.
<P>
	They talk about the high-speed train between Quebec City 
and Windsor. What would happen if Quebec became 
independent? Are we going to set up a border? Probably. You 
think everything will be easy, but there are hard and cold facts. 
Liberals want to concentrate on job creation and economic 
renewal. Quite honestly, sovereignty does not solve any of our 
real day-to-day problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to the motion of my colleague from 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. It is the first time since I have 
been in the House of Commons that we talk about regional 
development. The motion moved by a member from the Bloc 
aims at making the public aware of the sad situation that exists 
in the regions of Canada, and particularly of Quebec.
<P>
	The motion says: ``That this House condemn the federal 
government's ineffective regional development interventions''. 
Today, I heard our Liberal friends speak highly of Canadian 
federalism. I heard them speak about grants, about money given 
everywhere in Quebec and in Canada. According to them, that is 
a godsend for the good people and everyone should be happy and 
say ``thank you, my good government''. But if we look at what is 
presently going on in Quebec, particularly in the regions, what 
do we see? We see unemployment, regions that are stagnant, 
populations that are not growing and, most of all, we also see, 
and that is dramatic, young people who are leaving their region.
<P>
	I look at my region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, and 
particularly my town. Ten years ago, in Jonquière, there were 
62,000 inhabitants; now, there are perhaps 58,000. What 
happened? The young people do not like their region any more? 
That is not the case. What happened is that people have to leave 
their region in order to survive. There are regions in Quebec that 
have almost become under-developed countries. Why are 
people leaving their region to go elsewhere? It is because they 
want to eat. And that is what are presently doing many 
Quebecers who are leaving their region to go to Quebec City or 
Montreal because they are hungry, they are hungry for work and 
for opportunities.
<P>
	Let us look at our regions. What happened? Is it because 
people who work there are inefficient? There is a considerable 
number of development programs both at the federal and 
provincial levels. Some people work on the development of 
those programs as administrators or regional sponsors. Those 
people act as volunteers and give their time and their energy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4799"> 4799 </A></B>
<P>
because they are  committed to the development of their region. 
There are also federal and provincial civil servants working.
<P>
	Since my election I have been in contact every day with a lot 
of federal civil servants. I know they are competent and 
committed to their work but if we look at the results we can see 
that nothing works well because of the endemic unemployment 
in the regions. In my own area of Chicoutimi-Jonquière, the 
unemployment rate is about 17 per cent, or 15 per cent in the 
greater area. There must be something going wrong. I cannot see 
what our Liberal friends have to brag about or congratulate 
themselves for. They should meet the unemployed and the 
students who cannot find work and tell them that everything is 
going well; and we will see what answer they get.
<P>
	Let me give you two examples of the inefficiency of regional 
development in my region. I blame that situation on the 
inefficiency of Canadian federalism. In my own region, an 
incredible story has been going on for about fifteen years and it 
is about the famous Alma-La Baie Highway.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	This is a highway which was to link the towns of Alma and La 
Baie. There was a federal-provincial agreement for the 
construction of this highway. The federal agreed, the provincial 
agreed, the municipalities agreed, everybody agreed, but there 
is still no highway. Every two, three, four or five years we add 
three or five kilometres. When we want to go ahead there is 
always someone to object.
<P>
	At times it is the provincial government which objects, other 
times the federal government which asks for delays. There is 
conflict, and discussion, but no construction.
<P>
	This is an example of a non-functioning federal-provincial 
agreement endorsed in good faith by local governments which 
did not realize that there was a fundamental flaw: there were two 
decision-makers. When important decisions can come from two 
different places, very often none are made.
<P>
	This is an example that shows that Canadian federalism does 
not work in the area of regional development. A divided 
highway is essential for a region, but we still do not have one 
because Canadian institutions are flawed.
<P>
	Let us take another current example. There is a passenger 
train service between Jonquière and Montreal which is managed 
by VIA Rail. Some people in Canada say that rail service is not 
cost-effective. They say that some lines make no profits, and 
that cuts are needed. But where should we cut? Of course they 
are going to make cuts in the means of transportation between 
the large centres and the remote areas. They want to eliminate 
one mode of transportation which is important for my area, in 
several respects.
<P>
	First of all, it is important because an area like mine, which is 
quite remote, needs a variety of means of  transportation for its 
development and to be connected to larger centres. We have the 
Laurentian Highway, which is not yet a divided highway, in spite 
of several projects which might come to fruition some day, for 
our grand-children to see. We have a deep water port and we 
have the railroad.
<P>
	An essential and fundamental aspect of rail transportion is 
that it carries passengers. The Jonquière-Montréal train is a 
very well kept secret. There is no publicity. People think it does 
not exist any longer. They believe it is gone for good. So, 
nobody takes the train, and since nobody takes the train, it 
becomes easier to eliminate it.
<P>
	A rumour is circulating to the effect that the railroad is going 
to be closed. It may be more than just a rumour. I can tell you 
that people in my area do not agree. The CRDE, municipal 
councils from Jonquière to Montreal, people in Joliette, in 
Shawinigan, the Prime Minister's own town, have been sending 
petitions asking that the train be kept running. What has the 
federal government done? It does not have a regional 
development policy and it does not see how important and 
fundamental this train is.
<P>
	It will be even more important in the future. Right now, road 
transportion is in. Trucks carry very heavy loads through the 
Parc des Laurentides and ruin the road. It would be better done 
by train. If the railroad is used less, and if there is no passenger 
service any longer on that line, what are the great planners in 
Ottawa going to say? Your train is not being used. Let us also 
eliminate rail transportion of goods, remove the tracks, and 
build bicycle paths instead. Where we come from, bicycle paths 
are the major projects.
<P>
	In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area, the biggest 
development project is the construction of a bicycle path around 
the lake. We support the bicycle path, it is important, but when 
in a area, the major project, the highest priority, is to build a 
bicycle path, it means that something is wrong with regional 
development policies. We are going to have to solve the 
problem. How are we going to do it?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has a solution. We will not talk about 
sprinkling grants around, but we will say that someone in the 
regions must be responsible for regional development. Who 
should that be? We believe that it should be the government 
closest to the people. And who might that be? The answer is the 
Quebec government and regional governments.
<P>
	As part of the Bloc's sovereignty program, every possible 
decision-making mechanism would be handed back to Quebec. 
This is what a sovereign Quebec would do and this is how 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4800"> 4800 </A></B>
<P>
regions would be treated. We want them to have 
decision-making and spending powers.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	We have devoted this entire day to focusing on regional 
development with the intent of getting this message across to the 
House of Commons and to our regions. Our regions want to 
survive and to have effective policies. They want a future in 
which they can flourish and continue to build on past 
accomplishments. With the good will, ability and talents of the 
regions, I am confident that a sovereign Quebec will flourish 
and I am especially confident that this day will come very soon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Madam Speaker, before 
putting a question to my colleague, I must comment the remarks 
made earlier by the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	Modest as usual, he sang the praises of the federal 
government and the Federal Office of Regional Development 
and their past achievements. He also referred to a United 
Nations report according to which Canada was number one in 
terms of quality of life.
<P>
	I would just like to make one thing clear. This report was 
based on 1992 data. If my memory serves me right, the 
Conservatives were in power in 1992. All of a sudden, the very 
people who criticized the Conservatives for all their political 
and economic actions are-or so it seems-singing their 
praises, telling us they have given this country the best quality 
of life in the world, after saying just the opposite during the 
election campaign.
<P>
	These reports and their basis could all be challenged. You 
probably remember this report on poverty that said: ``Canada 
may be the industrialized country with the highest poverty rate, 
but to reduce that rate, all you have to do is lower the poverty 
line''. We could go on about this at length. The hon. member 
also mentioned a grant to the University of Rimouski. Again, I 
will point out to him that this grant was made by a Conservative, 
namely Mrs. Vézina-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member, but his comments must be addressed to the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Very well, Madam Speaker. When I heard my 
colleague talk about train service, it reminded me of what the 
hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine had said. 
My question is twofold.
<P>
	The first part refers to what was said earlier. My colleague 
mentioned train service. The word is that there is talk across the 
way about a high speed train to develop both regions, Toronto 
proper and the metropolitan area. This train would apparently 
have to stop at certain borders.
<P>
	I would like my hon. colleague to comment on that, because as 
far as I know, planes do not stop in mid-air when travelling from 
one country to another to have all passengers passports checked. 
I think there is a serious problem there.
<P>
	I would also like him to tell us about independent workers. He 
never said anything about it, but there were designated areas in 
which assistance was provided to unemployed workers who 
wanted to start up a business. But this year, all designated areas 
will receive almost no money at all. I would like to know what 
my hon. colleague has to say about that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to the high-speed train, 
I must point out that such a train will link France and England. I 
do not think it will stop in the middle of the Chunnel for a 
passport check.
<P>
	Assistance to independent workers has been cut. I think it is 
unfortunate because this program was very beneficial to some 
workers. I could add that, a month ago, my city of Jonquière 
became a designated area under the independent workers 
assistance program. We can say it is great and congratulate one 
another, and I think all the local people were glad, except that we 
and Sherbrooke have one of the highest unemployment rates in 
Quebec.
<P>
	We had large paper mills. We had the Alcan plants. We were 
clearly well off economically and, 10 or 15 years later, we have 
become a designated area and we are forced to accept with 
pleasure for the time being but after we take control of our own 
destiny, we will certainly do what is needed to escape the 
poverty the federal system has plunged us into.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	However, for now, we must say that we are very glad to have a 
good program, as my colleague from Bonaventure was saying 
earlier, except that there is a 27 per cent unemployment rate in 
his riding, so I hope he will tell his unemployed constituents that 
there is a new dryer and that a subsidy has been granted to 
Rimouski. Everyone must be happy, the subsidy machine has 
come through.
<P>
	The people of the Gaspé and the Lower St. Lawrence have 
been subjected to planning experiments for many years and have 
benefited from federal programs which were scrutinized by 
everyone but, after 20 years of work and of federal and Liberal 
subsidies, they still end up with a 27 per cent unemployment 
rate.
<P>
	So there is nothing new under the sun. They boast about 
federalism and theorize but when we go see the people on 
unemployment or on welfare-go ahead and laugh but these 
people may be at home watching us and shaking their heads.
<P>
	They say it is very nice. There is a nice post office with a nice 
red flag in my village but I am afraid that-
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., it is 
my duty to inform the House that, pursuant to Standing Order

<P>
	The House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business, as indicated on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should systematically table, 
every month, all contracts awarded by departments and by the agencies that 
report to them, with any related information, in order to (<I>a</I>) keep the taxpayer 
appropriately informed, (<I>b</I>) stimulate competitiveness, and (<I>c</I>) ensure that 
government decisions are open and transparent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Madam Speaker, I am very proud to submit this 
motion to my colleagues because it concerns a basic right in our 
society, the right to information. In this case, the information 
sought from the government concerns all contracts it concludes 
with the private sector.
<P>
	The reason I am presenting such a motion is that since I was 
elected to Parliament, I have found it very difficult and 
time-consuming to obtain information on all kinds of contracts 
awarded by the federal government.
<P>
	If we as members of Parliament can only obtain this type of 
information with great difficulty, I really wonder how an 
ordinary citizen goes about obtaining it. I see this as an 
inappropriate barrier to information.
<P>
	Indeed, in a democracy, how can one hold back and not make 
freely available information related to contracts that are fully 
paid by taxpayers? How can one tell taxpayers that they cannot 
know what goods and services the government buys with their 
money?
<P>
	I think this is undemocratic and violates our great principles 
about the right to information. I would like to make an aside here 
about our rights as elected officials in this House, more 
specifically on one way we have to obtain information, namely a 
question on the Order Paper.
<P>
	On February 18, I asked the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services to give us complete information on all 
contracts awarded by his department for the period from 
December 1, 1992 to December 1, 1993 and from December 2, 
1993 to February 18, 1994.
<P>
	As usual, the minister has 45 days to answer this question. 
Yesterday, after waiting more than three months, the minister 
answered this important question. What a surprise! Three little 
pages of statistics that were already known. However, at one 
point, the minister telephoned me to say that the answer to this 
question would require tabling a huge pile of documents, a sea 
of boxes full of papers. Yesterday I got his answer in three  
pages! The minister must be a magician. He transformed dozens 
of boxes into three little pages. What a feat he accomplished.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	A letter accompanying these three pages says: ``This 
document is only a summary of the contracts awarded by the 
former Department of Supply and Services during the five-year 
period which ended on February 28, 1994. It is only reliable to 
show the number of contracts awarded, negotiated and signed 
during a given fiscal year''.
<P>
	The letter goes on to say: ``The statistics in this report cannot 
be used to determine the impact of these contracts on Canadian 
economic activity''.
<P>
	The minister can keep his useless document. The minister is 
laughing at taxpayers. He does not give a damn about those who 
pay for all these contracts. He hides behind unjustified reasons 
to scorn the taxpayers' right to be informed. The minister is 
afraid. He is scared to get caught with his pants down. He does 
not want to provide all the information on contracts awarded 
because he may have something to hide. Is this why the Liberal 
government and its minister are so reluctant to provide 
information? The minister's answer is inadequate and totally 
unacceptable. His answer to a question on the Order Paper raises 
doubt in our minds and in the minds of Canadians. It is a 
legitimate doubt based on the popular belief that government 
contracts are a form of patronage, and on concrete examples of 
blatant suspicious dealings which make you sick.
<P>
	The Conservatives were very good at this. They are not here 
any more, because the people woke up and told the Tories to stop 
undermining the voters and supporting the friends of the 
Conservative Party. Voters send a very clear message that 
remains the same for the Liberal government. Taxpayers expect 
openness and honesty from their government and, to date, the 
Grits have followed in the path of the Tories.
<P>
	All the rhetoric and the promises of openness by the Liberals 
were only idle talk, shameful promises that do not meet the 
expectations of the people.
<P>
	If members opposite do not agree with me, they should prove 
me wrong. I challenge them to urge the minister of Public Works 
and Government Services to answer truthfully and openly to 
question Q-16 on the Order Paper. I do not think they will be 
willing to meet this challenge. You are all proud of your 
policies, but when the time comes to support intelligent and 
reasonable demands, you all turn up as mild as a lamb, following 
the orders of the ministers. I am sure that makes you uneasy at 
times. I am sure that, in your ridings, you feel like bowing your

<P>
heads in front of some of your voters who are unhappy with the 
policies your party has laid down.
<P>
	Go ahead, ask the minister to table all these contracts and the 
relevant information. Prove us wrong! Prove to the population 
that these contracts were awarded according to the rules and 
from a completely impartial standpoint!
<P>
	That is a lot to ask. It is especially hard to shed some light on 
contracts that are potentially embarrassing.
<P>
	The government is also aware of all the pressure coming from 
lobbyists, from its friends and from people who make 
contributions to its war chest. Does the government have 
anything to hide from the public? Are so-called goodies an 
obstacle to the disclosure of information on government 
contracts? Are we still stuck with the old-style system of 
awarding contracts, where transparency and openness were 
ignored to serve the interests of certain people?
<P>
	Members opposite are saying: no, no, no. The Liberal 
government is not like that or, at least, not any more. All right, I 
believe you. The public believes you. But give us proof and 
release the supporting documentation.
<P>
	Question Q-16 on the Order Paper is no small matter. I would 
rather not have to go through the whole procedure again, which 
does not work anyway in this case because the minister can use 
his magic wand to make any changes he wants.
<P>
	The motion before the House today is a proposal to set up an 
information system. We want the government and its agencies to 
table regularly all the contracts they award, and to do so on a 
monthly basis.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals will say this is impossible, the job is too big and 
too complex and the cost of the operation exorbitant. Come on! 
What about the electronic highway and sophisticated computer 
programs? The government spends a fortune on top-of-the-line 
equipment, so let us use it.
<P>
	Tabling these contracts on a monthly basis will make it much 
easier for taxpayers to get the facts and find out which 
companies are getting their tax money. However, the system 
must be clear and accurate. We do not want a pile of documents 
dumped every month. We want information presented in an 
orderly manner, neatly classified to make it easy to consult but 
also presented in such a way that we can analyse how the 
government spends taxpayers' money.
<P>
	The Minister of Public Works and Government Services alone 
is responsible for awarding 175,000 contracts annually. Last 
year, the department acquired $13 billion worth of goods and 
services under 17,000 general categories. It made purchases on 
behalf of 158 federal departments and agencies. This is the 
largest share the government purchases. In addition, there are 
purchases made directly by the departments and agencies 
themselves.
<P>
	I would like to know who benefits from all those billions of 
dollars. Taxpayers have a right to know which  companies do 
business with the government. That is a basic right. The federal 
government also has a duty to abide by its great principle of 
equity, a principle the Liberals like to flaunt in this House: 
regional development, equalization, redistribution of wealth, 
fiscal fairness. The Liberals keep repeating the same old story 
every day. Tabling government contracts would give us relevant 
information on the government's effectiveness in its Robin 
Hood role.
<P>
	According to an article that appeared in <I>Le Droit</I> on May 16, 
Robin Hood does not necessarily do a good job in the case of 
federal contracts. According to the article, Ottawa-Carleton 
gets 99 per cent of $2.5 billion worth of federal contracts, while 
the Outaouais region gets the rest, a meagre 1 per cent. In the 
National Capital region, 25,000 contracts are awarded annually, 
and only 250 of those 25,000 are awarded to companies on the 
other side of the river.
<P>
	In view of these figures, one is entitled to ask the following 
question: On one hand, is this problem of concentration 
happening in other areas in Canada, and on the other hand, is the 
government trying to dilute, so to speak, this extraordinary 
concentration? The tabling of all the contracts, every month, 
would answer our first question. The conclusions would be easy 
to reach. Well organized information would rapidly show 
whether there are other areas like Ottawa-Carleton which are 
reaping the federal manna.
<P>
	The second question deals directly with the government's will 
to allocate all its contracts, in a fair and just manner and, in so 
doing, spreading around all this federal manna which always 
benefits the same lucky few, in the same area.
<P>
	Does the federal government make it possible for every 
contractor to have access to its contracts? Better yet, should it 
not favour contractors in other areas, even in remote areas? 
Contractors outside of the larger centres would create jobs and 
stimulate the regional economy. Of course, goods and services 
might cost a little more, but in the end, it would have a positive 
impact on the economy as a whole and on these areas which have 
been hard-hit by unemployment.
<P>
	In reality, the truth is very different. Moreover, instead of 
opening up the whole process, and favouring remote areas, it 
would appear that the federal government itself is creating 
obstacles for contractors. One of them is language. Since my 
election, I have met several contractors who have been 
complaining, or at least, wondering about their chances to get a 
contract when they answer in French a call for tender in English.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4803"> 4803 </A></B>
<P>
	I draw the attention of the House to the fact that, in his 1992 
report, the Auditor General states that 80 per cent of 
specifications sent to Quebec contractors are written in English. 
O Canada! Bilingual? Not when it comes to contract 
specifications or calls for tender, which only appear in French as 
summaries. Such a situation is unacceptable and contrary to our 
language legislation.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	I wonder about the treatment that the supply service of a 
department would give to a tender entirely in French from a 
Quebec company. Would it receive the attention it deserves? 
Some French- speaking contractors told me they had doubts 
about that.
<P>
	This motion, if it is received by the government, will shed 
light on all these questions pertaining to contracts. We believe 
that it is high time that the government comes clean in this area, 
and our demand is backed by the people.
<P>
	The motion has another objective, and it is to promote 
competition. Disclosure would certainly pike the interest of a 
great many companies. They would then seek to offer their 
products or even to diversify in order to produce the goods 
required by the government.
<P>
	It is not everybody who knows that the government buys flour 
or soybean oil for CIDA, and that it rents aircrafts or buys 
textiles for National Defence. Disclosure would draw attention 
to the opportunities offered. With more people interested in 
tendering, we can expect lower prices and therefore savings for 
taxpayers. In my opinion, these savings should be reinjected 
into the system in order to support the companies based in the 
regions. With a real development policy for local companies, 
specific measures could guarantee a fair redistribution of the 
savings. In the long run, such measures would be economically 
worthwhile.
<P>
	I am fully aware that, unfortunately, this motion depends 
entirely on the government's will. I am sure the Liberals, the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services being the 
first, will refuse to even consider my request. It is easier to 
evade one's responsibilities using false pretences than it is to 
fulfil the legitimate expectations of the population.
<P>
	I urge them to seriously think about the ultimate purpose of 
this motion, that is the right to information. Nobody in this 
House can object to such a fundamental right. Refusal by the 
Liberal government to systematically table every month the 
information required to keep the taxpayers appropriately 
informed of the spending of their tax money would be perceived 
as an important breach of proper democracy.
<P>
	Such a refusal would also clearly prove the lack of courage of 
the Liberals, stemming no doubt from the fear of disclosing 
embarrassing information. Transparency and openness were 
your campaign leitmotiv and are the main themes of your red 
book. Your leader keeps repeating that you are a good 
government with nothing to hide. Now is the time to prove it!
<P>
	The government and the minister have not heard the last about 
the transparency of government's contracts. We will always be 
watching because the population has the right to know. The 
small king of government services can stop ruling over his 
kingdom because he showed us his colours: red, red, red; a sure 
sign of lack of transparency. One day soon, he will have to 
answer to the population and on that day he will find out that 
acting like a king can be very dangerous.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada):</B> Madam Speaker, the member of 
Parliament for Laurentides has moved that the government table 
all contracts entered into by federal departments and agencies 
on a monthly basis.
<P>
	According to the motion the purpose of this activity would be 
threefold: to keep taxpayers informed; to stimulate 
competitiveness; and to ensure government decisions are open 
and transparent. There is no doubt these are worthy goals. 
However, I would like to assure the member and the House that 
these concerns are already carefully and responsibly addressed 
by this government.
<P>
	What the member is suggesting with this motion is the 
creation of another layer of bureaucracy. It would duplicate and 
overlap with currently existing services which disseminate the 
information being sought by the member. What the member and 
her party are calling for is a waste of taxpayers' money.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Obviously, administering the procurement process is an 
enormous task for the federal government. However, a number 
of systems enjoying an excellent cost effectiveness ratio are 
already in place at Public Works and Government Services 
Canada. These systems ensure that the Canadian public is served 
fairly and efficiently and is given unrestricted access to 
information concerning government procurement.
<P>
	Therefore, there is no need to waste taxpayers' time, energy or 
money tabling reports on the procurement process, since this 
information is already available and readily accessible to the 
Canadian public.
<P>
	The questions raised in the motion now before us for debate, 
namely access to information about contracts, competitiveness 
and the integrity of the procurement process, have and continue 
to be priorities of this government.
<P>
	As one of the largest purchasers of goods and services and as a 
major administrator of real property holdings, Public Works and 
Government Services Canada ensures that basic information 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4804"> 4804 </A></B>
<P>
enabling all companies in Canada to do business with the federal 
government is readily available to them.
<P>
	One of the tools it uses is the Open Bidding Service. Also 
known as the OBS, this system is an electronic bulletin which 
posts information and provides everyone with an equal 
opportunity to bid on government procurement contracts. The 
OBS supplies information on contracts that will be opened 
shortly and on the documents businesses will need to have in 
order to submit bids. All Public Works and Government 
Services Canada construction or maintenance services contracts 
valued at $60,000 or more, as well as all other types of contracts 
of $25,000 or more are posted in the OBS. Each year, more than 
$5 billion in purchases are made through the OBS.
<P>
	The OBS ensures that every person, regardless of where he or 
she lives in Canada, has access at the same time as everyone else 
to the same information and for the same price.
<P>
	Public Works and Government Services Canada also 
publishes a printed journal entitled ``Government Business 
Opportunities'' which, like the OBS, lists all contract 
opportunities. This journal, which is published three times a 
week, also provides information as it becomes available.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This information is also available in the federal business 
bulletin and the R and D bulletin.
<P>
	The federal business bulletin, which appears twice a week, 
gives a brief description of the contracts awarded across 
Canada. With about 100 editions of this publication produced 
every year, approximately 1,200 contracts awarded by the 
government are announced in this way. The document is 
available to anyone who asks to be put on the mailing list.
<P>
	The R and D bulletin provides information on contracts in the 
science and technology field. On a monthly basis it provides up 
to date information on federally funded science and technology 
contracts that have been awarded.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In addition to providing information about contract 
opportunities with the federal government, OBS also gives 
advance notice of contracts to be awarded. These are notices of 
contracts that the government intends to award without tender, 
called sole source contracts. Advance notice is displayed in OBS 
to give companies an opportunity to challenge the government's 
decision to call on only one supplier. If another supplier proves 
that he can meet the requirements of a contract that is to be 
sole-sourced, a call for competitive bids will be issued. This is 
another effective way that the government uses to stimulate 
competition.
<P>
	Besides providing all Canadians with information on 
opportunities to bid, the government also makes available to 
them information on contracts already awarded on a regular 
basis. Canadians thus have access to this information as soon as 
it is available, and not only once a  month, as the hon. member 
proposes. The Open Bidding Service also offers a historic data 
base with which any Canadian can find out all competitive 
contracts announced since 1989.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Thus anyone in Canada can find out what companies obtained 
contracts by open bidding, for what good or service and when.
<P>
	The Open Bidding Service was designed so that everyone 
could have easy access to information on current purchasing 
possibilities and on contracts already awarded by the 
government. This system meets all the requirements for access 
to information, competition and accountability.
<P>
	Easy access to relevant and timely information is the key to 
ensuring the fairness and openness required for the purchasing 
process. Nevertheless, our government believes that suppliers 
must also have an appeal mechanism at their disposal if they 
think that the government has not kept its commitment to act 
fairly and openly.
<P>
	The Canadian International Trade Tribunal is an independent 
body that gives suppliers quick recourse at low cost for 
contesting the awarding of contracts subject to the North 
American Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
	If they win their case, they can receive compensation or be 
allowed to participate in a new bid. This is a mechanism to 
ensure the integrity and honesty of the purchasing process.
<P>
	More generally, each department accounts for its activities 
and acquisitions to Parliament, and thus to suppliers, to the 
media and to all Canadians, through the Main Estimates and the 
Auditor General's Report, which are tabled annually.
<P>
	The public sector is under constant scrutiny, Madam Speaker. 
Canadians demand not only that the government keep its 
expenditures and the cost of its services under control, but also 
that it show integrity.
<P>
	With all the procedures already in place, there is no doubt that 
government contracting is open to all, that the process is 
equitable and that all related information is already available 
and accessible to all Canadians.
<P>
	There are a number of problems with the motion before this 
House today. The mere fact of tabling in the House the 
information relating to all contracts awarded will not make this 
information more readily accessible to the Canadian public.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4805"> 4805 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Up to date information on contracts awarded is currently 
available every day to any Canadian anywhere across Canada on 
the OBS. This information is very time sensitive for suppliers. 
With the information currently available and accessible, 
suppliers know right away whom to approach for example for 
subcontracting activities.
<P>
	A monthly printout is not only a duplication of information 
already available but of very limited benefit to suppliers as it is 
only an historical record. The cost of producing monthly reports 
of this nature must also be taken into account. Given the volume 
of contracts let by the federal government every month this 
would be an extremely costly and time consuming activity. The 
tabling of monthly reports of contracts awarded is a duplication 
of efforts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the hon. member herself told this House, we must strive to 
eliminate duplication and overlap so as to reduce costs, save 
money and ensure efficiency.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This government is streamlining and eliminating waste. It is 
not the intention of this government to spend taxpayers' dollars 
reproducing reports which already exist and are an effective and 
proven means of accessing the same information.
<P>
	On the very day that one Bloc member is calling for the 
reduction in duplication and overlap, another Bloc member is 
also calling for another layer which duplicates an existing 
program, creating once again administrative chaos. The Bloc 
cannot suck and blow at the same time.
<P>
	This government's commitment to the integrity of the 
procurement process was made very clear with the recent 
release of new guidelines for public and open research and 
advertising contracts by the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services. This announcement by the ministry 
clearly illustrates the commitment of the Prime Minister and 
this government to an open and fair process for the Canadian 
people.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	Once again Canadians already have access to up to date 
information everywhere in Canada on the government 
procurement activities. Not only here is there no need for 
repackaging this information, but it would be a waste of effort 
and energy. The government strongly believes in the importance 
of the integrity of the procurement process. Canadians have the 
right to know how their government does business and who it 
does business with. They also require that their government not 
waste money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is ironic that all those years in opposition the Liberals wanted 
accountability and now we hear them talking like they do not 
want it. This is a request for information.
<P>
	Although the information that is being requested may have 
some problems with it in that it is voluminous and the 
information on a monthly basis may be quite a tribunal to 
produce, especially in this world of paperwork in Ottawa, I 
suppose we might be able to look at limits on the types of dollars 
that are reported, and so on. Nevertheless, the Liberal 
government would be very wise to keep an open mind on what is 
being asked here of my colleague.
<P>
	I am a member of the public accounts committee and it is 
again ironic that I have asked for information relating to current 
expenditures of this government and I have been unable to get it 
on a current basis. Once a year we produce a public accounts list 
and you can get it at that point. What we are looking for here is 
money that is unwisely spent at the time it is spent, not a year 
from now that we go complaining about it.
<P>
	Why are we asking for this in the first place? Why are we 
asking for the government to disclose what it is spending and 
why and how?
<P>
	How often have we wished in this country that we could elect 
politicians who possessed the fortitude, the integrity, to be 
frugal, to spend the taxpayers' money as though it were their 
own, who end the practice of patronage and have the greatest 
desire to be held accountable to the people? It seems like we 
threw the Liberals out in 1984 in the hope that the Conservatives 
would exercise these responsible attributes. What happened? 
The Conservatives were just as bad, if not worse, than the 
Liberals.
<P>
	Here we are in 1994 throwing Canadians back into the 
political pot with the Liberals, who already have shown signs of 
poor judgment, political patronage and wasteful spending.
<P>
	Is it any wonder why today in this stage of our country's 
development millions of Canadians cannot tell the difference 
between the Liberals and the Conservatives?
<P>
	My colleague who just spoke from the government side said: 
``Carefully and responsibly addressed by government'. That is 
how he is suggesting that moneys are being spent in this country 
today. Earlier this week we disclosed in this House that if you 
call giving prisoners in this country old age security, CPP and 
GST rebates responsible, I am afraid there is quite a difference 
of opinion as to what is responsible and what is not. We do not 
consider that responsible.
<P>
	Let us take the political placement of the NAFTA 
headquarters in Montreal, the millions in grants to the Prime 
Minister's riding for a museum of industry, and a $30 million 
grant to Quebec City for a conference centre. One can only 
wonder since they are basically patronage payouts how many 
people are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4806"> 4806 </A></B>
<P>
getting contracts within those allotments that are indeed 
inappropriate.
<P>
	What the member is asking for here is some legitimizing of 
the process, some information going back to the taxpayer that 
discloses what is going on.
<P>
	The fact is that there is no difference between Liberals and 
Conservatives of the past, they are both out of touch. They are 
both big spenders and firmly believe in spending your money the 
way they prefer and not the way you prefer.
<P>
	What must all Canadians do to protect ourselves these days? I 
think the hon. member for Laurentides has a solution to part of 
the problem at least. Systematically table every month all of the 
contracts awarded by departments and by the agencies that 
report to them. What is so difficult about something like that?
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	It will be interesting to see whether or not this flaccid Liberal 
government supports this motion. After all, it does have the 
potential of keeping the taxpayer appropriately informed, 
stimulating competitiveness and ensuring that government 
decisions are open for public scrutiny. We will see when the vote 
comes. It is probably Monday or Tuesday night, and we will be 
watching for it.
<P>
	Since we know that the Liberals and Conservatives are 
kindred spirits in the same world of politics, let us look at some 
expenditures of the past that were made on behalf of the citizens 
of our country. They can judge for themselves whether they 
would have spent money on these projects. If they disagree, they 
should write their members of Parliament and tell them what 
they think. They should confirm that they want some safeguards 
instilled to protect them and their hard earned income from the 
Liberal process of mismanagement.
<P>
	I want to run through a couple. I want to make it very clear that 
these were expenditures within the Conservative government. 
However, I am making my point here that there is very little 
difference between this Liberal government with regard to 
management of fiscal resources in this country and the 
Conservatives.
<P>
	Let us look at what the National Capital Commission spent in 
1991; $10,800 of taxpayers' money to finance a poll to find out 
what Canadians thought about Christmas lights. Is that a wise 
expenditure? I do not think the people of Fraser Valley West 
would think that way.
<P>
	In 1990 the finance department spent $300,000 to produce and 
distribute 40,000 videos explaining how the federal government 
spent money-very good. We will be watching for these 
expenditures all through the next five years. If the government 
thinks it is going to get away with it, it has another thing coming 
with the Reform Party because we are going to watchdog every 
expenditure it has.
<P>
	I will give a couple of more because there are so many. Let us 
talk about the $147,000 to examine lullabies, the form and 
function in infant directed music-very good. I think the people 
watching are getting the point.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What have you got against children?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> One of my colleagues asks 
what I have against children. I have absolutely nothing against 
children. In fact, that is one of the reasons I am here. The 
children of this country are not going to fare very well with a $40 
billion deficit this year. They have to pay that debt. It is going to 
be on their backs. What have I got against children?-nothing. 
We are here to protect their future, not like this government.
<P>
	Once the report is issued, if it were issued on a monthly basis 
or a semi-monthly basis or whatever, what do we do with the 
information? Do we fire a bureaucrat? That is unlikely, the way 
we are looking at things here. We cannot even get at the jumble 
of fish and find out, as they say, who done it. Do we question the 
House on the merits of these expenditures in Question Period in 
the House of Commons?
<P>
	If anybody has been watching Question Period in the House of 
Commons since it has opened, we have yet to get decent answers 
from this government when we ask the ministers questions. How 
do we get at these kinds of issues?
<P>
	Perhaps we take it to a committee of the House of Commons. 
Maybe we should take it to the public accounts committee. We 
are back to the vicious circle where I started. Actually I had 
asked the question time and time again in public accounts and I 
get the answer: ``Wait until the public accounts report comes out 
from the Auditor General or the Comptroller General''. That 
comes out once a year. Here we are retroactively dealing with it.
<P>
	If contracts are going to be let, let us give the people in this 
country the ability to look at the repercussions, the patronage, 
the unwise spending of this government. It is truly unfortunate 
we Reformers are here to be the watchdog on this Liberal 
government to protect the public's interest, but it is a necessity.
<P>
	Let us hope we make a difference because certainly this 
government will not.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on May 4 the hon. member for Laurentides proposed:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the government should systematically table, every month, all contracts 
awarded by departments and by the agencies that report to them, with any 
related information, in order to (a) keep the taxpayer appropriately informed, 
(b) stimulate competitiveness, and (c) ensure that government decisions are 
open and transparent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4807"> 4807 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	As the member for Dauphin-Swan River I want to assure the 
hon. member that from the very outset of its mandate this 
government has been committed to fairness and openness in 
government contracting. This government has stressed the need 
for maximum use of competition by departments and agencies 
when contracting for the goods and services it requires from the 
private sector to fulfil its various programs.
<P>
	I believe there is a compelling need especially these days for 
strict fiscal restraint to ensure that each dollar spent by the 
government is a necessary expense and that it represents the best 
value that can be achieved in the use of that scarce resource. At 
the same time I agree that all government contracting must be 
undertaken in a manner that keeps the taxpayer informed, 
stimulates competitiveness, and ensures that government 
decisions are open and transparent. Treasury Board already has 
in place contracting policies that address these specific goals.
<P>
	I should like to point out the magnitude of the government's 
contracting activities. The Government of Canada is the 
country's largest user of private sector supplies. There are over 
200,000 transactions each year ranging from small purchases 
such as items of stationery to major procurements such as 
military equipment.
<P>
	By relying on the program experts of departments, only a very 
small percentage of government contracts often associated with 
large and risky initiatives require the collective review of 
ministers. All contracts however are subject to the requirements 
of the Treasury Board contracting policy whose principles and 
procedures I again emphasize ensure an open, transparent and 
competitive contracting process.
<P>
	While the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services undertakes many contracts on behalf of other 
departments, close to half of all contracts are awarded under the 
authority of individual departments.
<P>
	In these circumstances I cannot agree that the government 
should impose the suggested detailed monthly consolidation of 
all this contracting information. The cost of preparing such a list 
and the time spent preparing it would far exceed any benefit. 
Information on the magnitude of government contracting 
already exists.
<P>
	This government is making improvements to ensure even 
greater transparency. Each year the public accounts include 
substantial information on contract expenditures. This is listed 
by individual department. It is then further broken down by 
individual contractor for all contracts which exceed $100,000.
<P>
	For professional and special service contracts, an area which 
has grown over the past decade, I refer the hon. member to the 
convenient summary in the public accounts. It groups contracts 
for each department under the most common types of services 
the government acquires, such as accounting services, 
engineering and  architectural services, information services, 
legal services, training and educational services, and the like.
<P>
	In addition, there is Canada's international trade 
commitments which require specific detailed reporting on 
contracts awarded. For example the comprehensive reports 
required under the North American Free Trade Agreement are 
currently being implemented.
<P>
	In this regard I would like to inform the hon. member that 
under the terms of this agreement the government is committed 
to the use of open and competitive contracting for all the 
procurements in excess of the NAFTA thresholds. This means 
ensuring that American and Mexican as well as Canadian 
companies are aware of the government's needs and have an 
opportunity to bid to provide them.
<P>
	Even as we are adjusting to the international aspects of this 
new operating environment, we must also make preparations to 
provide the other parties with the annual report which I 
previously mentioned. This will prove that we are fulfilling the 
terms and the spirit of the agreement. I know that achieving 
trilateral agreement on the nature and precise detail of what is to 
be recorded has not been easy.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, at least in Canada's case, there is a related 
ongoing period of difficult adjustment. As departments develop 
and begin to put in place systems to collect the required 
information, I can assure the hon. member that the end result of 
this long and arduous process will be a publicly available 
document which will more than meet any need for statistical 
information on government contracts.
<P>
	As well, because this report will be public, departments will 
doubtlessly consider this to be a further incentive to use the 
competitive contracting process.
<P>
	As the member for Dauphin-Swan River I agree that 
interested suppliers need to know what acquisitions the 
government plans to make. This is the key to a truly competitive 
process.
<P>
	Treasury Board policy encourages the use of open bidding 
service for advertising upcoming purchases of goods and 
services. The open bidding method uses both electronic 
information technology and the print medium to advertise bids. 
It is compulsory for advertising all procurements subject to 
NAFTA.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works and Government Services 
uses this means for communicating with industry for all 
procurements over $25,000.
<P>
	When the government knows that it must acquire a good or 
service it uses the open bidding service and the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4808"> 4808 </A></B>
<P>
business opportunities publication to inform suppliers of a 
proposed purchase and thereby to solicit proposals from them.
<P>
	The related notice of proposed procurement is carried by 
these media for either 40 days if it is subject to the NAFTA or 30 
days if it is not covered under the NAFTA. The notice identifies 
what is needed, how much of it, any related technical 
specifications, the supply timeframe, and any other relevant 
information which pertains to this proposed acquisition.
<P>
	As well it lists the criteria which will be used to evaluate 
whether the supplier is qualified to provide the good or service 
and the second set of criteria which state what will be used to 
evaluate the proposals of the qualified suppliers.
<P>
	By providing all this detail up front business is assured 
sufficient time to decide whether it could supply the item, 
whether it wants to supply it, to seek any further clarifications 
which it may wish and then to develop and submit its proposal.
<P>
	There are of course other situations where the government 
anticipates that it will need a good or a service in the next little 
while but it does not need it immediately. Again, the open 
bidding service and the government business opportunities can 
be used to identify a list of possible suppliers which can be 
turned to when the item is actually needed.
<P>
	In this case the government places a notice of planned 
procurement on them for either 30 or 40 days depending on 
whether or not the item is covered under NAFTA. This particular 
notice will in a comparable manner to the notice of proposed 
procurements state what is wanted, the quantity thereof, and the 
like.
<P>
	In this case though it will only identify the financial, 
commercial and technical aspects which will serve as the 
criteria to be used to evaluate whether a supplier is qualified to 
be included on the suppliers' list.
<P>
	Again by using the open bidding service and government 
business opportunities to create this list companies are placed in 
a position of having ample information and time to determine 
whether they are interested in pursuing this possible business 
opportunity.
<P>
	In view of all the preceding, I cannot agree that the imposition 
of more detailed and expensive reporting requirements on 
departments and agencies would serve the best purposes of 
either the House or the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	This government strives to have the most effective public 
service in the world. The motion proposed by the hon. member 
would require a transfer of human and technological resources 
from areas where they could better serve Canadians and redirect 
them to meet the proposed monthly contracting reports. This 
simply cannot be justified as a cost effective use of these limited 
resources. In this context, I would suggest that the hon. member 
especially think about the many small departments and agencies 
which do not have the resources to assume an overhead burden 
like the one which has been proposed.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	If this suggestion were to be adopted these organizations 
would end up redirecting their resources with the possible result 
and that thereby could be diverted from meeting their primary 
mission to Canadians.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Madam Speaker, as 
member for Charlevoix, I am pleased to rise today to support the 
motion moved in this House this afternoon by the hon. member 
for Laurentides, Quebec, and seconded by the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	What does the Bloc Quebecois demand in this motion? 
Simply that the government put all papers on the table and fulfil 
through concrete measures the promises made by the Liberals 
during the election campaign, namely to be transparent, to act 
with integrity and to hide nothing from Canadians.
<P>
	I am terribly surprised at the beginning of this debate on the 
motion of the hon. member for Laurentides because we are 
simply asking the government to table all contracts awarded 
during the month. It is very transparent, very normal. The 
government has the responsibility-just as we do as the Official 
Opposition-to ensure that public funds, that the taxes paid by 
Quebecers and Canadians, are well administered.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Laurentides told me about her 
motion, I was sure that it would not make waves, that it would be 
adopted by unanimous consent in this House, that the Liberals 
would always throughout their mandate-and not only during 
the election campaign-want to preserve this great spirit of 
transparency.
<P>
	We want to raise another issue. Quite recently, I attended with 
the hon. member for Laurentides a meeting where the Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services was present. That is 
where the shoe started to pinch.
<P>
	Would you, Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services who, with your officials, administer a very large 
budget, agree-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but the hon. 
member must address his remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin: </B>Madam Speaker, I was asking the minister how 
he would feel if, some day, he was accused of patronage. I know 
that the minister does his best to monitor his department but, as I 
asked at a conference on taxation: Is it the civil servants who 
spend too much, or is it the politicians who are bad managers? 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4809"> 4809 </A></B>
<P>
The Minister of Finance replied that it was the politicians who 
were spending too much.
<P>
	I think politicians spend too much, often because of a lack of 
adequate controls. To provide us with the list of contracts 
awarded is simply a form of control allowing us to monitor the 
money spent in each department.
<P>
	During the proceedings of a commission on public works and 
government services, I asked a question to the Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	My question was: ``Minister, are you prepared to confirm and 
to pledge to this commission that you will make public tenders 
in the newspapers, prepare a public notice and adequate 
specifications, review the tenders, and then accept the lowest 
qualified bid?''
<P>
	You will not believe the minister's answer. He said: ``I will 
not pledge to accept the lowest qualified bid''. Again, we are 
talking about the lowest qualified bid. As I said at the beginning 
of my speech, a minister's responsibility is to administer public 
goods and taxes; yet, the minister will not pledge to accept the 
lowest qualified bidder.
<P>
	This means that the minister who, I am convinced, spoke in 
good faith, runs the risk of being betrayed some day by someone 
who might give a contract to a friend, with the result that the 
newspapers would relate another patronage decision benefitting 
some friend of the party who may have paid $1,000 to attend a 
fundraising dinner, or who may have made significant 
contributions to the party's finances.
<P>
	This would be unfortunate for the minister, and also for 
department officials. We want the government to do what it, not 
us, said it would do. Indeed, the Prime Minister himself said 
that, if elected, he would promote total openness and integrity, 
and would open all the government books.
<P>
	As Mrs. Guay said, patronage decisions were made during the 
nine years of Conservative government. If we do not provide a 
way to monitor the process, the present government may well be 
faced with a similar situation.
<P>
	They also say they want to reduce the deficit. I think it is an 
excellent idea to prevent waste by agreeing to call for tenders 
and give all bidders a chance to bid on a contract and give them a 
chance to work for the government.
<P>
	To give them that chance, the government has to give public 
notification and publish such notices in the media. We do not 
want a situation like the one the Conservatives created when 
they agreed to privatize Pearson Airport, something the present 
government could have ratified.
<P>
	The present Liberal government could have ratified this 
contract and the helicopter contract as well. Why did it refuse? 
Already there are some doubts. They should abide by what was 
said during the election campaign and what they said in the red 
book. You said you would be open to a fault. You said you would 
reduce the deficit,  although the government's last budget 
predicted a deficit of $39.7 billion.
<P>
	You also said you would get rid of the GST, although the 
government is getting ready not to abolish the tax but to change 
its name-VAT, TOC, whatever-but the GST will not 
disappear. I think the government has a responsibility to manage 
our tax money. They are responsible for managing the revenue 
they get from taxpayers. And we in the Bloc Quebecois who with 
other Quebecers send $28 billion annually in income tax to the 
government, are concerned about the way our tax money is 
being administered, and this does not include what we pay 
through the GST.
<P>
	We think that the government is ashamed or just does not want 
to table the documentation which is simply a way to find out in 
which ridings in Quebec and Ontario contracts have been 
awarded.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	It might be interesting to find out how much it costs the 
government to do something within its own administration. If 
the government does not table this information, that is because it 
is a poor manager. The government should manage taxpayers 
money as carefully as municipalities do this in Quebec, and I am 
sure in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	I was a municipal councillor for 14 years in Baie-Comeau, 
and according to the legislation on cities and towns, the 
municipal council was obliged, by resolution, to award a 
contract to the lowest bidder. I would ask the government, which 
manages far more money than the municipalities, to be as 
careful as they are about managing taxpayers' money.
<P>
	As the parliamentary secretary pointed out, I know I can have 
access to certain documents thanks to the Access to Information 
Act, but this is quite a production. You need the nature of the 
contract, the contract number and the date on which the contract 
was awarded, and the result is still zilch.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Time for Private 
Members' Business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing 
Order 96(1), the order is dropped from the Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Madam 
Speaker, last week, I asked the government why members of the 
Cabinet had all refused to attend the annual convention of the 
Association canadienne-française de l'Ontario. In view of the 
outcry raised by that refusal, the Minister of Health recently 
agreed to attend, but not necessarily for the right reasons. This 
behaviour is typical of the historical approach taken by the 
federal government towards French reality in Canada. 
Federalist members of Parliament do not seem to have the time 
and, most of all, the desire to defend the interests of French 
people in this country.
<P>
	No, Liberal members are much too busy condemning the fact 
that the Association canadienne-française de l'Ontario had the 
impudence to invite the Leader of the Official Opposition to its 
annual convention. The Liberal member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell even had the gall to compare 
Franco-Ontarians to little chickens that were contributing to 
their own misfortune by inviting Colonel Sanders to their annual 
convention. The member and his sorry associates were quickly 
taken down a peg or two by representatives of the French 
communities outside Quebec.
<P>
	Indeed, several Canadian newspapers reported the response of 
these French leaders, on May 27, to the scornful words of the 
hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, among others. 
For instance, in the newspaper <I>Le Droit</I>, the president of the 
ACFO, Mr. Jean Tanguay, was questioning the work done by 
their Liberal members in the following words: ``When time 
comes to denounce the injustices promulgated by the provincial 
government, do they make the front page? Have they denounced 
the fact that we have lost the management of literacy in 
Ontario?''
<P>
	The same day newspaper also reported the comments of the 
president of the ACFO in Prescott-Russell, Mr. Rolland 
Saumure, who denounced even more violently the attitude of his 
own federal member. He declared: ``It is not by burying our 
heads in the sand as Mr. Boudria does that we will make any 
progress. Is Mr. Boudria afraid of information? Should we just 
listen to our good Liberal ministers in Ottawa?''
<P>
	The newspaper <I>La Presse</I> reported the comments of Mrs. 
Claire Lanteigne, president of the Fédération des communautés 
francophones et acadiennes du Canada. She was infuriated with 
the lack of respect demonstrated to them by some Liberal 
members who tried to screen the information that could get to 
them.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to say that I find very disgraceful that 
some members of the House of Commons try to limit the 
freedom of speech of members of another political party for the 
sake of a federalist doctrine that they are unfortunately ready to 
defend at any cost, as we could see.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Madam Speaker, I am  glad 
that the members from the Bloc Quebecois, like the government, 
is concerned about the faith of minority French-language 
communities. The Bloc is making interesting promises to these 
communities, but whether they will be carried out remains to be 
seen.
<P>
	There is no doubt, however, that the federal government is 
supporting these communities, and the official languages policy 
already provides them with a lot more than this political party 
which is only passing through Ottawa can promise them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is in the vital field of education that the federal government 
contributes most significantly to the development of minority 
communities.
<P>
	In Ontario alone we have contributed approximately $334 
million in the last five years for the teaching of our official 
languages, of which $200 million went for minority official 
language education for nearly 100,000 young francophones of 
this province, thus contributing to reducing dropout rates in 
illiteracy as well as increasing participation in post-secondary 
education.
<P>
	To these amounts we have added a contribution of $50 million 
over the next five years to help establish a network of three 
post-secondary colleges for the French speaking minority of 
this province. This includes La Cité collégiale in Ottawa.
<P>
	We also fund francophone community associations 
throughout this province that are active in community 
development.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Several members of this government will attend the ACFO 
convention and I would like to remind my colleague from the 
Official Opposition that government members meet, on a 
regular basis, with representatives of minority communities, 
from all over the country, to discuss concrete measures.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our commitment to these communities goes much beyond 
simple rhetoric. We will continue to work in partnership with 
them to ensure their full development.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5) the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. The House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.36 p.m.)
