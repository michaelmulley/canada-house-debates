	Mr. Speaker, December 6 is the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women in Canada. Established in 1991, this day coincides with the poignant anniversary of the deaths of 14 young women who were tragically killed on December 6, 1989, at École Polytechnique in Montreal because they were women.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this day is to remember and honour those who died, remembering is not enough. We must also educate and take action. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence against women is all too common. It is an issue that simply will not go away. December 6 is a day for communities to consider concrete actions that each Canadian can take to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children who live in violent situations learn that violence is a way to gain control and power over others. This perpetuates the problem even further.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Clearinghouse on Family Violence can provide Canadians with a list of publications that can be ordered free of charge, as well as information about video resources on wife abuse that can be borrowed. Most important, women and children who live in fear of violence need to know they have a place to go for help. They need to know that they are not alone and that violence is simply not acceptable.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, under the watch of the federal Liberal government, crime in Surrey has reached a five year high with nearly 50,000 criminal code offences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surrey has high auto theft, marijuana grow-ups, assault, break and enter,  arson and property damage cases. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the lower mainland, drugs, gangs, prostitution and other organized crime is rampant. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among Indo-Canadians alone, 70 youths have been murdered since 1995. The Surrey RCMP is understaffed and has heavy caseloads, yet the Liberal government has done nothing to help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance believes that the rights of victims of crime must take precedence over those of criminals. We believe in truth in sentencing and will ensure that sentences handed down are actually served. Parole should be harder to earn and easier to lose, and multiple convictions should draw consecutive rather than concurrent sentences. There should be deterrence to commit crime, not motivation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will this weak Liberal government subscribe to these beliefs and act so that the people of Surrey will feel secure on their streets?</p>

	Well, Mr. Speaker, once again we have new, though hardly improved, levels of political correctness to go with the Christmas season.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own Canadian Mint is running an ad to sell coins. It is calling the ad “the 12 days of giving” instead of “the 12  days of Christmas”. Apparently the jingle won out over some other trial balloons like “we wish you a merry loonie” and that other old favourite “have yourself a merry little time at the Mint”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, people of faith get used to this political correctness. After all, removal of Christian liturgy at the Swiss air memorial, removal of  Easter and Christmas from  the Department of Heritage calendar, and the rejection of prayers of all faiths at the September 11 ceremonies here on the Hill are examples of what happens all too commonly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Toronto has raised a decorated tree at city hall, but of course it is not called a Christmas tree, heaven forbid; it is a holiday tree.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for a little steel in the backbone, I figure. I admire the Canadian Jewish Congress for supporting the right of Christians to publicly display their faith, because we do not promote understanding and tolerance in a multicultural country by forcing any faith to go underground with its celebrations.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today, I want to highlight the 30th anniversary of the Canadian Egg Marketing Agency. The agency, which was the first one to look after the interests of Quebec and Canadian producers, created a supply  management system that is now used by other agricultural agencies, namely the turkey, chicken, hatching egg and milk agencies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fédération des producteurs d'oeufs du Québec and its then president, Ovila Lebel, were among the pioneers who quickly realized the importance of the collective management of production and marketing operations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were convinced that supply management is the best way for farmers to make a good living with their production, while promoting the development of human size farms.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also not forget that supply management ensures constant and quality supply for consumers, without direct government subsidies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievements of the Canadian Egg Marketing Agency benefit Quebec society and all those who make a living in this sector. Supply management must be protected by the government. It must not be watered down. Quebec producers are expecting stronger measures on the part of this government, which must now put its money where its mouth is. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few institutions in Canada provide this professional training. Besides the protection and health of  domestic and farm animals, one must recognize that what is at stake ultimately is human health.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to praise the efforts of Alberta Solicitor General Heather Forsyth and Alberta Justice Minister Dave Hancock for their promise earlier this month to be the first province in Canada to have the AMBER alert system up and running by the end of the year. They both recognize the need for a system to be in place for child abduction cases. It will be a valuable complement to their high risk offender registry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many lives have been saved in the United States because of this program. I challenge the Liberals to follow the lead in both the U.S. and in Alberta and set up an AMBER alert program on a nationwide basis. Canadians would undoubtedly support this issue and every child would benefit from it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Prime Minister really wants to leave a legacy, then why not borrow an idea with a proven track record for success? What better legacy could one leave than the protection of our children?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put simply, there is a functional disconnect between revenues and responsibilities in Canada.  Clearly the provinces and municipalities need a greater share of the existing fiscal pie.  For municipal governments, that means access to new sources of funding.  Canada's municipal leaders will tell us that solving these issues takes a commitment from all levels of government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fall the federal government committed to meet with municipalities to put in  place a 10 year infrastructure program. Like many throne speech commitments, the government has backed away from that promise.</p>

With federal spending rising at the rate of about 8% a year, and the government talking about another $20 billion of spending in the throne speech, the finance minister has already been suggesting that spending is out of control and a new fiscal watchdog is needed over there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does the government intend to get the additional dollars it says it will need for health care?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, we will have the pleasure to say to the Leader of the Opposition at the time of the budget how much money we can allocate for health care.  However, for the past for nine years the opposition has wondered what we were going  to do. We have been the first government ever to have five surplus budgets in five years, and it will be the sixth this year.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, that is true, but it started that process by cutting spending for health care.  I see the Prime Minister applauding that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nine years the government has opposed structural reform of the health care system.  The government and Roy Romanow have opposed harnessing private investment and alternative delivery within the public health care system.  The government has dealt with problems by spending more tax dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the government still believe that spending more tax dollars alone will solve the problems of the health care system?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, we have not received the report yet so I cannot make specific comments on that. However, there is one thing.  Our neighbours to the south are spending 14.5% of their GDP on health care.  Within the Canadian system, which is a better system than theirs, we are spending 9.4% of  GDP.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister I suppose makes the point that health care has not really been the priority of the government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year it raised spending in health care by less than other things like corporate welfare, hiring more bureaucrats and other departmental spending.  This is why the finance minister is now warning that the government may not have enough money to spend on health care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask again, it is something we have asked before, will the government commit to finding money for health care within the existing budget envelope and commit to ruling out tax increases for health care?</p>

However, they want more money for this and more money for that.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, far from being in the face of the provinces, just a few months ago we were able to agree to dispute avoidance and resolution mechanisms.  Therefore if there is a dispute between the provinces and the federal government around the interpretation of the Canada Health Act, or something the provinces or the federal government are doing, we have a mechanism, a third party mechanism, by which these disputes can be avoided.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I can say is that on this side of the House we have worked very hard to work in partnership and collaboration with the provinces.  We acknowledge the fact that the provinces are the deliverers of health care.  In fact, the accord of September 2000 spoke to not only more money for health care but a new partnership in delivering health care to Canadians.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am always very honoured when I am criticized for having to manage a surplus. As for whether of not we managed it well, I believe that it was split about 45-55%.

	Mr. Speaker, that is ridiculous. Every year, the size of the surplus has been hidden, as we know, intentionally. The public has been kept in the dark about the size of the surplus and the full amount was put toward the debt. All of the money was used on the debt, when there was a promise to divide it 50-50.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that if there is a responsible party, one that is  most responsible for all of the problems with health care, it is this government, which has made cuts to health care on the backs of the provinces, and on the backs of the sick, just like it did with the unemployed for EI?</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having had the opportunity to review the <i>Debates</i> of November 19, I heard the hon. member for Saskatoon-Humboldt who rose on November 20 to reply to the allegations of the hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My predecessors have on many occasions commented on the always difficult issue of determining what language is unparliamentary.  They have often characterized this issue as a question of balance and they have been clear in insisting that every hon. member shares a part of the responsibility for using respectful language and so helping to maintain order in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer hon. members to page 526 of the <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice </i> where it states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>In dealing with unparliamentary language, the Speaker takes into account the tone, manner and intention of the Member speaking; the person to whom the words were directed; the degree of provocation; and most importantly, whether or not the remarks created disorder in the Chamber.  Thus, language deemed unparliamentary one day may not necessarily be deemed unparliamentary the following day....   Although an expression may be found to be acceptable, the Speaker has cautioned that any language which leads to disorder in the House should not be used.  Expressions which are considered unparliamentary when applied to an individual Member have not always been considered so when applied “in a generic sense” or to a party.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only to be expected that we in this chamber will hear strong language and forceful expressions of opinion where there are strongly held views on contentious issues.  The House of Commons is a place where competing ideas are tested and conflicting passions are given expression.  Here in the chamber, members enjoy the privilege of freedom of speech that permits them to speak freely.  This freedom however implies a great responsibility as well.  We must bear in mind the potential impact of our comments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can have come as no surprise to the hon. member for Saskatoon--Humboldt that objection has been taken by members of this House to being characterized as “modern day Klansmen”.  This is the phrase he used in his original statement and a phrase he made a point of repeating in replying to the original objections raised.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be little doubt that the hon. member meant to provoke his colleagues, not merely to make a strong statement of his views.  Under the circumstances, I find that the language used is unparliamentary and I ask the hon. member to withdraw his comment immediately.</p>

	I am now prepared to rule on the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Acadie--Bathurst on behalf of the hon. member for Windsor--St. Clair concerning events in the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and Natural Resources on Thursday, November 21, 2002.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the hon. member for having drawn this matter to the Chair’s attention as well as the hon. Government House Leader and the hon. members for South Shore, Sherbrooke and Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for their contributions on this question.  I would also like to thank the member for Nickel Belt, Chair of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and Natural Resources and the hon. member for Windsor—St. Clair for their later interventions.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is alleged that, while the hon. member for Windsor—St. Clair was in the process of speaking on a motion to summon a witness to appear before the committee, the Chair intervened to suggest that the question be now put on the motion. This was done notwithstanding the fact that the hon. member for Windsor—St. Clair had not concluded his remarks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Speaker, I appreciate the responsibility that I have to defend the rights of all members and especially those of members who represent minority views in the House.  At the same time, it is a long tradition in this place that committees are masters of their own proceedings. Ordinarily the House is only seized of a committee matter when the committee reports to the House outlining the situation that must be addressed.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not an absolute requirement. As Speaker Fraser said in a ruling given on March 26, 1990 (<i>Debates</i>, p. 9756):</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>—in very serious and special circumstances, the Speaker may have to pronounce on a committee matter without the committee having reported to the House.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened carefully to the interventions that were made when this question was first raised and I have also examined the blues of the committee meeting which is at issue.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points   I would like to draw to the attention of all members.  First of all, I would remind everyone that the liberty given to committees by the House to organize their business is not an absolute liberty. Standing Order 116 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>In a standing, special or legislative committee, the Standing Orders shall apply so far as may be applicable, except the Standing Orders as to the election of a Speaker, seconding of motions, limiting the number of times of speaking and the length of speeches.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committees are expected to follow the rules and practices of the House, unless specific exceptions are made, as in the rule just cited.  Further, I think all members will agree that if a committee chooses to exercise its judgment in an area where it is not bound to follow the practices of the House, it must do so in a regular and orderly fashion.  By this I mean it ought to proceed by adopting motions that set out the rules that the committee will follow in governing its work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second important point to make in this particular circumstance is that the use of the previous question, that is “that the question be now put”, is not permitted in committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i> points out at page 786, the previous question is not permitted in any committee of the House, even a committee of the whole.  This rule is found in all of our authorities dating as far back as the first edition of Erskine May in 1844. It is expected, not just by the Speaker, but also by the House itself that its committees will conduct business that is before them with consideration for these time-honoured practices.</p>


	<A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1515)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, it is true as well that committees are permitted a greater latitude in the conduct of their proceedings than might be allowed in the House. It may not always be clear in a particular set of circumstances how best to proceed and so the ultimate decision is left to the committee itself.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the rulings of the chair of a committee may be made the subject of an appeal to the whole committee.  The committee may, if it thinks appropriate, overturn such a ruling.  In the case before us, I note that no formal appeal of the chair's ruling was made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where irregularities occur, or if a committee feels that there has been some disrespect of its authority, the committee may draw the matter to the attention of the House and the Speaker to the problem, by means of a report to the House.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case the Speaker has been asked to reach into the proceedings of the committee to overturn something that was done there.  Such requests have occurred on many occasions in the past and previous Speakers have, without exception, resisted the temptation to intervene.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue raised originally by the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst concerning the experience of the hon. member for Windsor—St. Clair is an issue that lies within the power of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and Natural Resources to resolve. That is where it properly belongs. Although this  is a serious matter, it is not one in which the Speaker feels compelled to intervene.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I would like to thank all hon. members who intervened on this matter.   </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have two points of order but I will start with the first one, which is regarding a lock-up announcement for the Romanow report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter was sent around from the Minister of Health indicating the commission's conditions for the lock-up tomorrow at 7:30 a.m. As you know, Mr. Speaker, we have our own practices with respect to lock-ups and they are laid out in Marleau and Montpetit.  The practice allows staff to attend and allows members to leave at any time they want. The commission's rules do not comply with our practice. As they say, when in Rome, or in this case, when in Parliament. On page 767 of Marleau and Montpetit it states in the footnotes:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small> Members' research staff are usually allowed to attend... Members may not be prevented from leaving a lock-up room.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the commission's conditions do not comply with these two practices I would think that since the lock-up is taking place on our turf, for a report intended for our use in the House, then our rules should apply. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask that you do whatever you need to do, Mr. Speaker, to ensure that members' staff are permitted to attend this lock-up.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday this was raised at our House leaders' meeting and I undertook at the time to do my best to ensure that the lock-up would be in the way in which we are accustomed to having it. I understand that there was, later that day, resistance on the part of some. I am happy to report that whoever it was changed his or her mind earlier today and that we are now able to have the lock-up tomorrow in a way that respects the traditions of the House.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for having raised this point of order.  Perhaps we could have more clarifications regarding the traditions of the House. According to the most recent news that we have received, each member will be allowed one employee. There is also a great deal of confusion regarding whether or not members will even be allowed to leave the lock up, and things to that effect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would really like to maintain the tradition used in Parliament. We are used to it and we need our employees to help us with our work.  We would like to know from the government what the tradition really is and which rules will be used.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<A NAME="Int-352378"></A><a HREF="#Int-352381"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-352373"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Don Boudria: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, this is  not a government-sponsored lock-up. It is one that is organized by the commission. We have intervened everywhere that we could and I was given assurance today that a staff person could accompany a member to the lock-up, and pursuant to those traditions, staff people could use technical equipment such as recording devices, computers and so on. It is not a tradition to remove those from the room because it is the same as carrying documents out of the room. Those of course will have to remain behind.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone were to suggest that an MP could not leave a lock-up inside a Parliament Building, I would suspect, although I have not heard that, that if anyone were to prevent an MP from leaving a lock-up within the building, it would probably result in another question being raised in the House. I believe the issue then would be similar to the one that was brought to the attention of the U.K. House of Commons in relation to one of the guards at Westminster.  That incident has often been quoted in this place and I would not want that very badly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think everyone is aware of the rule that one cannot stop an MP from leaving a lock-up, particularly one who wants to attend to other parliamentary duties.</p>

Wayne Easter (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advise the House that the government has listed six more entities, pursuant to the Criminal Code, bringing to 13 the total designated since last July under Canada's Anti-terrorism Act.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly listed entities are the following:  Islamic Army of Aden, Harakat ul-Mudjahidin, Asbat Al-Ansar, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hamas. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to list an entity is a very serious one.  The consequences are severe, not only for terrorists but for those who support them.  The listing is a public confirmation that these entities are engaged in terrorist activity.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now a crime to knowingly participate in, contribute to, or facilitate the activities of these entities.  Any person or group that is listed may have its assets seized and forfeited.  People or groups who deal with the property or finances of these entities are subject to severe penalties, including up to 10 years imprisonment.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the work to prepare for this listing is very thorough and deliberate.  The listing of such entities is a work in progress.  As we are listing these six entities today, steps are already underway for the next additions to the list.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the House and Canadians that there will be more.  The government has always taken seriously its responsibilities to keep Canadians safe and secure.  The tragic events of September 11, 2001, made this job even more important and its success even more critical.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting terrorism is a top priority for the government and this list is one of the many steps we have taken in our fight against terror.  After September 11 we moved quickly to implement our anti-terrorism plan which has four objectives: first, to stop terrorists from getting into Canada and protecting Canadians from terrorist acts; second, to enhance the tools we have to identify, prosecute, convict and punish terrorists; third, to prevent the Canada-U.S. border from being held hostage by terrorists who would want to affect the Canadian economy; and, fourth, to work with the international community to bring terrorists to justice and to address the root causes of this kind of hatred.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important part of our effort to fight terrorism and keep Canadians safe and secure.  It sends a strong message that Canada will not tolerate people who carry out terrorist acts and those who would support them.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise today in response to the Solicitor General's statement regarding the listing of a further six entities pursuant to the Criminal Code.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is somewhat of an understatement to say that the Solicitor General's claim that the government “moved quickly to implement the anti-terrorist plan” is a misnomer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 received royal assent on December 18, 2001, yet it took the Solicitor General seven months to bring forward the first group of entities to be listed as illegal terrorist organizations.  It took seven months for the government to determine that al-Qaeda was in fact a terrorist organization.  It has now taken an additional four months for the government to finally determine and list Hamas as a terrorist organization, a fact that has long been recognized by the United Nations as well as many other countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamas, the Tamil Tigers and Hezbollah are among the over 200 organizations identified by the United Nations as terrorists.  In July when the first seven entities were listed we, as well as many others, publicly criticized the government for failing to list Hezbollah.  There have been ample justification and evidence, such as the 1983 truck bombing of a United States marine barracks in Beirut and the 1994 bombing of the Israeli cultural centre in Buenos Aires, proving that not only is Hezbollah a terrorist organization but it is one of the most violent.  Hezbollah is known for using terrorist tactics, such as suicide bombings and missile attacks, to promote its agenda of imposing an Iranian style Islamic rule in the Middle East.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well-known fact that  Canadian intelligence agencies say that Hezbollah has operatives in every major city in the country and that it has been using Canada as an offshore base for a decade.  In its 2000 report on international terrorism CSIS reported that Canada was a primary venue of opportunity to support, plan or mount terrorist attacks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just recently Senator Bob Graham of the senate intelligence committee in the United States described the leader of a Canadian cell of Hezbollah as making bin Laden look like a schoolboy.  According to the United States, Canada is proving to be a true haven for Hezbollah and not only will the government not ban this known terrorist organization, we will not extradite Hezbollah members to the United States to face justice as it is requesting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government were in fact truly committed to the global war on terrorism, the Solicitor General would ensure that the list is complete and that it does not take such an inordinate amount of time to bring forward those names and entities.  Clearly, our intelligence agencies, particularly CSIS, are overwhelmed by the tremendous workload thrust upon them since September 11.  By the CSIS director's own admission, more resources are needed if we are to determine and list all terrorist activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I implore the Solicitor General to list Hezbollah, to recognize that it is a threat to world peace and to the safety of Canadians.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, given the importance of this issue, it is disappointing to see the shortness of the statement of the Solicitor General on terrorists, terrorism and innocent civilian victims. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity given to ministers to make statements in the House is usually a solemn occasion marking a major change in government policy. However, the Solicitor General's statement, far from meeting these criteria, shows the government's flippancy when it comes to fulfilling its responsibilities in the fight against terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not serious. In the fall of 2001, Bill C-36 was rammed through Parliament as if terrorism were a new reality. Then, it took the government almost a whole year to realize that the  Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas are terrorist entities. Yet, for years now, they have been claiming responsibility for suicide attacks. Normally, it should not have taken close to a year to add these organizations to the list. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addition at this point of these six entities to the very short list of organizations having direct or indirect ties with terrorist activities in Canada or abroad is stunning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to us that merely mentioning the name Hamas should be enough to trigger thoughts of terrorist activities in the Middle East and all over the world. The same is true of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been interesting to know why the government suddenly woke up today. This would have given some substance to the minister's statement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the government singled out  these organizations and put them on its list of terrorist entities, I am surprised that Hezbollah is not mentioned anywhere. We are fully aware that, as charities go, this entity is nothing like the Knights of Columbus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, we feel  that the government, particularly with Bill C-17, formerly known as Bill C-42 and Bill C-55, has not managed to strike a balance between public safety and individual rights and freedoms. The comments made by the Privacy Commissioner are evidence of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is pleased that these entities were added to the government's list, but it is disappointed to see the Solicitor General using a piecemeal approach on such an important issue. We would to know when the list will be made longer, to paraphrase the Solicitor General, and we would like to know why it is currently not as complete as it should be. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I see the minister is returning and I am pleased he is. First, I want to congratulate the minister on the practice of making a statement to the House of Commons. It is a practice that should be followed much more regularly by the government and I regret that is not the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Solicitor General's department, his statement proves that it is not fatal to give information to Parliament on questions of security. I raise that because this Government of Canada is probably the most secretive in the western world; secretive of all the democracies with respect to the information that it makes available to the elected Parliament of Canada with respect to matters of international security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raised the other day a position taken by the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service in which it claimed, as a matter of policy, that it did not reply to questions of members of the House of Commons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker may recall that on an earlier occasion I asked the Prime Minister for information about al-Qaeda. He said that it would be a breach of national security to present that information. That very night, precisely the information that I had outlined of the al-Qaeda network was published on the website of the prime minister of the United Kingdom, indicating a far different standard for Parliament in that case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very real concern as to whether information on security matters is not only shared with Parliament, but is shared among departments of government. I am particularly concerned that the department, of which I once had the honour to be minister, the Department of Foreign Affairs, is not being kept advised on matters that should be within its purview because of turf wars over intelligence in the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am bound to say that I think all of us in the House have heard enough from the Solicitor General saying that there is a process in place when we put questions to him.  The only process in place that we have been able to identify is to keep this Parliament as much in the dark as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it very curious in his statement today that the minister says that there will be more lists. Is that a guess or does he know of other organizations that will go on the list? If he knows, why is he delaying adding those organizations to the list? This is not a matter about which the Solicitor General should tease public opinion. There will be a stigma attached to organizations that are not on the list, knowing that there is another shoe to drop and knowing that the minister has a group in mind but he is not, for some reason or another, prepared to add them to the list yet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things we would like to know is the procedure that is followed by the government and what sources of information and intelligence it bases its decisions on when it adds to this list.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Yesterday in the other place a point of order was raised regarding the Kyoto motion that I believe must be raised in this House as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, the motion in the Senate is identical to the motion before the House.  While the Speaker in the Senate has reserved his decision, I do not think that should be a deterrent to raising it at this time, since the Senate Speaker's ruling, while we would of course consider it, is not binding on the House and in the past conflicting rulings on an identical matter have been brought down. Bill S-13 from the last Parliament comes to mind.  The Senate Speaker ruled that it did not infringe on the financial privileges of the Commons and the Commons Speaker ruled that it did.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, I hope the Senate Speaker rules  before Françoise  Ducros gets appointed there and becomes the Senate's next Speaker.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister appoints the Senate Speaker,  another reason why we should be raising the matter here with our duly secret-ballot elected Speaker.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I will go over the points made in the Senate and add a few more to those arguments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Points were made regarding statements in the press that Parliament would ratify the Kyoto protocol and the statements were attributed to statements made by the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister gave the impression that Parliament would ratify Kyoto, and the motion that we ended up with calls on the government to ratify.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this adds to the confusion over the issue, what is more important is that Senator   Cools and Senator Kinsella argued that the government motion calling on the government to ratify the Kyoto protocol could not be considered a government motion.  They argued that a motion that calls on the Senate to recommend something to the government could hardly be considered a government motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our case, the motion calls on the House to recommend something to the government.  That is the job of private members during private members' business and it is the job of opposition parties on supply days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to the government that if it thinks that by passing a motion calling on itself to do something it will get action, I advise the government to check its own record in these matters.    The government should know that it does not listen.  The last NDP supply day is a perfect example.  Our supply motion dealing with the conditions that must be met before Kyoto is ratified is another example.  The government ignored those motions and many others like them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or maybe the government will comply only with motions that call on itself to act.  The government does not mind telling itself what to do; the government just does not like it when others tell it what to do.  I have some news for the government: the House speaks with one voice, and when it adopts a resolution the respect given to the motion should be the same no matter who sponsors the motion. Motions should not be judged by the colour of the sponsor's party banner but by the content of the motion adopted by the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, you made a ruling in regard to the motion in the name of the right hon. member  from Calgary.  He had placed a motion on the Order Paper instructing a committee, asking it to determine the level of provincial support for Kyoto.  The motion was listed to be moved under the rubric “Motions”. I suspect it was there because the member asked that it be placed there. However, Mr. Speaker, you ruled that it should properly be placed on the Order Paper as a private member's motion.  As a result, its designation was changed and it was moved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important to get these things right, Mr. Speaker, because as you know there are different rules for different motions. The case of the motion from the right hon. gentleman is a good example. If the member's motion would have been allowed to be placed under “Motions”, it could have been moved as early as today at routine proceedings.  Now that it is a private member's motion, the member will have to wait until his name is drawn in a lottery, and by the time that takes place Kyoto will have destroyed our economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This illustrates that the Speaker can decide these matters and it also illustrates what a difference a designation makes with respect to a motion.</p>


	<A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points made in the Senate was in regard to the Senate's rule of closure.  The same argument can be made in the House.  It is not a surprise that the Canadian Alliance will do whatever it can to prevent any ratification of the Kyoto protocol. With the government's record of using 80 closure motions, it is no surprise that it might use closure.  In any event, the motion is eligible for closure and any motion that is closure worthy will be too irresistible for the government House leader to pass on his favourite pastime of moving closure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator Kinsella  pointed out the absurdity of the government asking the House to ask itself and then forcing the issue through closure of the government asking the House to ask itself.  It is kind of a schizophrenic situation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has many prerogatives that private members do not.  It controls most of the business of the House.  It can move certain motions and bills that private members cannot, like bills requiring royal recommendations.  It can raise taxes through ways and means motions and it decides how the money is spent.  Does it really need to be muscling in on private members' turf?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it need to beg itself to do something?    While it is not always dignified, it is the role of private members and the opposition to beg the government.  Maybe the Liberals see the writing on the wall and are already in opposition mode, calling on the government to take action.  Maybe they have some internal polls they are not sharing with us.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, I am tempted to recommend that this motion be moved to private members' business or be considered as a supply motion, but since it is sponsored by a cabinet minister it is disqualified. It is disqualified as a private member's motion, a supply motion and a government motion. To complete the set, I would argue that it cannot be moved as a motion under routine proceedings either because, as you have pointed out many times, Mr. Speaker, very few opportunities exist for private members' motions  or motions of a private member's nature to be moved under the rubric “Motions”.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of the motion, Government Business No. 9, should be that it be removed altogether from the Order Paper.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I would also ask again for your considered opinion.  Until you have given us a decision on this point of order and the other point of order, I would recommend for your consideration the actions of the Speaker in the other place, whereby he set aside the motion until he could come back with a decision as to the efficacy of moving forward with the motion at this time. </p>


	<A NAME="Int-352710"></A><a HREF="#Int-352734"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-352617"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Geoff Regan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that for the most part you have dealt with the substance of this point of order already.  When the hon. member for Kootenay--Columbia speaks about statements of the Prime Minister in the media that Parliament would ratify the Kyoto protocol, it is clear that we all know  here that we use words in different ways. We do not always, when we are outside this place, and even inside, use words in the strict legal sense.  I am sure that my hon. friend and his colleagues would be  the last ones to want us to always use legalistic phraseology in this chamber.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case  it has been made clear that the Prime Minister and cabinet do respect Parliament and want to hear from Parliament on this.  They have asked for Parliament to give its advice on the question of ratification, and yes, they have made it clear it is their intention to do so, but they certainly want to hear from Parliament, and I think they would like to hear from all sides of Parliament, not just repetitive statements from one side of the House, which we have heard over and over.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we know that the hon. member for Red Deer has told the Speaker he is going to repeat himself.  He said nine times that he was going to repeat himself.  Nine times he stated this to the Speaker, so it seems to me that if he is going to say that nine times that is a clear admission of repetition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any rate, Mr. Speaker, I think you will find that this point of order is not a point of order and that, as you have ruled already, clearly  the motion is in order.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me the government can put before the House any motion it wishes. We have had some motions in my own experience urging the government to proceed with a war, urging the government to do this or do that, stating the opinion of this House, and all those motions have been held to be in order.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view this motion is in order. We are debating it. The debate is underway. The motion was put to the House. I had numerous arguments before it was put as to whether it was acceptable and in every case I ruled that it was.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the point of order is not well taken and the motion is in fact properly before the House and is one that can be debated by the House, as we have been enjoying for the last couple of days.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it  is certainly nice to be back.  I  got out of the swing of talking about Kyoto.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most exciting part of this is  that Canadians are engaging in the debate.  The e-mails and calls  are  amazing.  I would not believe that I would suggest to anyone watching, to those reporters watching, that they make sure to tell people to send their e-mails and faxes and make their telephone calls to the Prime Minister's Office so he can know what Canadians think about this whole issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as not to repeat anything that I said in the last couple of days, I want to start off by talking about the provinces.  We need to talk about   the fact that the provinces were supposed to have a meeting on November 21 but it was postponed by the government.  There was no new material.  The second edition did not rate any change.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting was postponed until Friday, November 29, two days from now. That meeting has now been cancelled and has not been rescheduled.  All the provinces say the federal government is not proceeding in good faith.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will use  some quotes from across the provinces  so that members understand what the various provincial ministers and premiers are saying about the government's action to ram through this debate in the House and to ratify this very important treaty before Christmas.  That is what this is all about.  It is all about the actions of the government, which  has known about climate change since 1992 when it signed the first agreement. In  1997  it signed the Kyoto accord, and now, all of a sudden, it has to be ratified by Christmas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason it has to be ratified by Christmas is that  the government fears that when Canadians find out what it is  the government is committing them to, they will be totally and absolutely opposed to it.  The Canadians out there who really matter are the moms and dads who will be taking their kids to the hockey game tonight after work. They are   the single moms who are trying to make a go of it. They are the   people on fixed incomes who, because of our demographics, are increasing. Those are the Canadians who matter. Those are the Canadians who will  be affected by Kyoto.  The government is ignoring them by ramming this through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine where the provinces are at on this issue.  Let us start way out west in British Columbia, a long way from planet Ottawa.  Let us hear what the premier  had to say, who by the way the Prime Minister called down here to try to divide and concur, and with whom he tried to make a special deal. The only problem is  it did not work very well. The premier was on television last night saying it is a bad deal, that it is something  we should not be going ahead with, that it  is something that needs a lot more discussion, a lot more costing and a lot more discussion on the implementation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak about the first plan and the second plan.  For  people to keep track of what this is, the first plan is the one that was issued on October 28.  The second so-called plan was the one that was prepared for the meeting on November 21.  These are the closest things the government has to  some kind of statement as to what it is going to do, what implementation might include, but it will not reveal any of the costs of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Campbell, the Premier of British Columbia, said that this is no way to build a country.  He said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>We are not going to stand by while the federal plan,  the favoured plan, blows away 11,000 British Columbia jobs.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is his evaluation of the first plan. Then we go on to the second plan. Remember that the Prime Minister attempted to coerce him in between.  He said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>British Columbia has grave concerns about the Kyoto accord.  There is no implementation plan, there are no targets that have been set.  The federal scenarios that we see,  British Columbia seems to be taking a greater hit in terms of job loss, a greater hit in terms of gross domestic product and that is not acceptable to us.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is fairly clear. I could quote the energy minister and  the environment minister of British Columbia, but I think that gets the point across. British Columbia is saying no way to the Kyoto accord, no way to ratification by the end of December, and no way to proceeding with the plan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to Alberta, many people do not know Alberta's stand on this but let me quote Mr. Klein about the first plan. There have been many quotes but I will  choose one. “We are giving as strong a signal as we possibly can that the Kyoto protocol, as it is now written, is the wrong way to go”. That was on November 5.  The energy minister, Mr. Smith, around  the same time said  , “It is a long way from completion. It is very clear that they are not ready”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the environment minister, who largely has carried the ball  for Alberta, has made many comments about how there is no plan, there is no costing, how they have not been consulted, and how there has not been anything to allow the ratification of this protocol. Remember, as I pointed out, there are penalties when we ratify.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Taylor commented on  the second plan, the one issued    a month later. He said, “It is a clear breach of trust. It looks just like the original plan that all of the provinces rejected. One might say it is like putting lipstick on a pig”. That is fairly clear as to how acceptable this plan is to Alberta and how ready Alberta is that the government should ram through the  ratification, should do it now, and then force it on the provinces, on industry, and on the Canadian people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving east to Saskatchewan,  Mr. Eldon Lautermilch, the industry and resources minister, has had a lot to say on television. A lot of people would be familiar with him. Saskatchewan derides the document as a non-plan. “No detail, no specific information, no cost estimates”, said Mr. Lautermilch, the Saskatchewan industry minister. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he got the second draft, which I intend to review today. I reviewed the first draft yesterday and I will review the second draft today. He said, “I can say from our perspective it is not acceptable in any way, shape or form from what we see”.  Three provinces have spoken out. He   further said that the province will not accept the plan for the ratification of Kyoto. It will not accept the plan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If members recall, we have a Prime Minister who does not care. there is  a potential future prime minister who says we should not ratify this agreement unless we have the full cooperation of the provinces. It is time that the future prime minister stood up,  was honest with Canadians and said, “That  is what I believe. I know the implementation can only work if the provinces are on side, and I do  not believe they are on side yet”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on to the Prime Minister's beloved Manitoba, the one province that is on side.  Mr. Tim Sale is the minister of energy for Manitoba. Remember that Manitoba  wants to take hydro power, get credit for it, run it to Sault Ste. Marie, provide however many thousand kilowatts per day and have a guaranteed source of income from Ontario because it  will capture half of that energy market. That is not about the environment; it is about economics. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us hear what he has to say about the first plan.  The New Democratic provincial minister said,  “Everybody in Canada now agrees that we've got to lower our greenhouse gas emissions and that's a real step forward. The question is what is the plan going to be and  how are we do it so we share the load and share the benefits? That hardly sounds like a great endorsement for Kyoto or for the plan.  That is reading between the lines.  We do not know what the plan is so we do not know if we are for it.  Remember, they are supporters of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second plan, the conservation minister, Steve Ashton,  said, “It's time to move beyond the issue of Kyoto, yes or no.  It's time to move on to the issue of whether we can have a real Canadian plan that's going to have a substantive response in terms of greenhouse gases”.  That is a question.  He is saying that he wants to see the plan and how how it will be implemented, then he will support it.  He is saying that there has to be a real Canadian plan.  Who does not believe that?  If that is outright support, then I would hate to see the ones who are opposed if that is the best they can say about this government. That is almost a condemnation of the government for not having a plan.  That is the best friend the government has in terms of Kyoto.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if you were part of this before, Mr. Speaker,  but I would like to give an update of the number of cars parked out front because a lot of viewers are very interested in that.  Just prior to Question Period 13 cars were parked out front and three were running. It is interesting to note that so many were turned off in a day.  I wonder if next week they will still be running.  At present the Prime Minister has four big black limos outside, with red lights on top, and they are all running.  That is just an update so people will know what kind of example the government is showing in front of the House of Commons.  Obviously we would not want anyone to catch a cold.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to Ontario where I can provide lots of quotes from the Ontario environment minister. Speaking about the first plan, the Ontario environment minister said, as noted   in <i>The Star</i>, “Candidly I think the federal government has misread the provincial mood and the public's mood.  They want the information and without the information they are not prepared to take a flyer on this one. We should not have a vote until we can have a first ministers meeting to really seriously look at a plan”.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes a lot of sense.  All those people in Hamilton on Sunday said they did not know about this.  They never thought it would to affect them.  They did not know they would have to slow their cars down.   They did not know they would have to have smaller cars.  They did not know they would have higher power bills and heating bills.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government did not tell them its plan and how it would be implemented.  That is exactly the point.  The government has not told the provinces, industry, the small businessman, Canadians, or  the mom who is taking her kid to hockey after school.  The government has not told anybody its plan.  It does not know what the plan is.  It does not know how it will be implemented.  It does not know what it will cost.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go on to the second plan and what the environment minister had to say about it.  He said “We haven't seen any funds set aside.  We have not seen any commitment to dollars and we really haven't seen the cost projections of what Kyoto will be”.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no plan.  The government does not know what it will cost.  The government does not know how it will be implemented.  Ontario is a long way from being on side as well and is asking for a plan and a cost of implementation.</p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on to Quebec, the other friend of the federal government.  Let us look what the environment minister had to say on the first plan.  He said, “We stopped debating the opportunity of the ratification and we then decided to concentrate ourselves and our efforts on the implementation plan of the federal government”.    Quebec wants to talk about the implementation plan and it has given up trying to get any ideas about ratification: let us do it and let us get on.  However,  it has asked for the costs and how it will be implemented.  That is hardly an endorsement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Boisclair tabled a motion calling for a new deal with Ottawa and all the parties in the legislature supported him. He said, “If the current plan is far removed from the principle of polluter pays, it is geared toward the principle of polluter pays. This approach goes against Quebec's vision because it attempts to protect the businesses that produce the most greenhouse gases.  This proposal softens the impact of the protocol implementation on the sectors that emit the most greenhouse gases to the detriment of the manufacturing sector which is very present in Quebec”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an endorsement.  In other words, he is saying that we  have have to give them credit for a lot of different things, that we have to have a whole different plan if they are to buy in and that  we had better not count on support for the implementation plan unless we take these things into consideration.  That is a big caveat.  That is why all provinces are not showing up on Friday, including Manitoba and Quebec.  They do not agree with this government's mini me plan which simply will not work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on to New Brunswick.    Jeannot Volpé said, “Within the next few weeks or month, we will be in a much better position to see what the financial impact will be on New Brunswick”.  New Brunswick is concerned about the financial impact on it</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second plan, the energy minister went on to say that  the Kyoto accord was a moving target. He said his main concern was remaining competitive with the United States and getting credit for emissions cut on power sold to the U.S.    He said, “Eighty-eight  per cent of our exports are going to the United States.  If the emissions reductions that we are achieving in New Brunswick cannot be credited it will be a major challenge”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I apologize. I went through all the reasons why we will get clean energy credits.  The bottom line is Europe will not give them to Russia for the natural gas that Russia provides Europe so why would the Europeans agree to give them to Canada for sending clean energy to the U.S. which is a non-Kyoto participant?  We cannot have a deal with a non-Kyoto participant because it would totally upset the whole European plan and would require a great deal more credits that it would have to buy from Russia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, New Brunswick has a major concern.  I come back again to the guy that picked me up at the airport when he said, “Hey, you guys in the federal government are about to knock us down when we have our first chance to stand up on our own two feet”.  That is exactly what that minister  had to say.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on to Nova Scotia and hear what Mr. Gordon Balser the vice chair of the committee had to say.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have been listening to the member and I am a little confused.  I know he has been going on for a couple of days.  For me to understand, is this somebody who picked him up at the airport a minister?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Alliance has complained that we have nothing to do, but it is about time the hon. member start making some sense.  A minister does not pick him up at the airport.  It must have been a taxi driver.  Therefore, I am confused as to who picked him up at the airport.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Grant McNally:</b> That is not a point of order. That is debate.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will move on to Nova Scotia and will quote the energy minister there, Mr. Gordon Balser, who is also the vice-chair of the province's committee.   He said, “They have repeatedly treated the provinces and territories, I think, with contempt”.  The Nova Scotia energy minister went on to say that this was a charade of a partnership and the way the government has treated the provinces and territories had been fairly dismissive.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously we are getting our verdict and I hope that the future prime minister is hearing that message loud and clear, about the cooperation of the provinces.  All these quotes are from the last month and are on where the provinces stand on the issue today.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us finish off with Newfoundland.  Premier Roger Grimes has been the major spokesman there.  He said that what they were being told was  “It doesn't matter what you say.  We're doing this anyway”.  He went on to say, “From what I know of it today, I think we will be left with no option but to examine every single avenue for us to resist any unilaterally imposed sanctions upon Newfoundland and Labrador”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is pretty clear.  I have gone through the provinces and everyone has heard what each one has had to say about the government plan.  The last comment probably summed it up best.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday someone from the other side stood up and said that it really did not matter what we said in the House.  The government will not listen to the provinces, members of Parliament, the Canadian people or the Canadian industry.  It will ratify Kyoto by the end of the year and if we do not vote for it, there will be an election.  That is where it is at.  No blackmail.  No ifs, ands, or buts. That is a dictatorship.  That is how dictators talk and I think Canadians are starting to get pretty tired of that kind of action. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want to understand what Kyoto  is.  They want to cooperate.  They want their provinces to participate.  They want industry to participate.  Now, industry is ready to participate.  Somebody yesterday said that industry did not care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am holding an ad by Shell Oil from <i>The Economist</i> in which it promotes clean air.  Shell Oil is saying that it wants to clean up the air and to be players. It is interesting that it has also invested 25% in alternate energy for the future.  It wants to sell energy, whether it is carbon, solar or hydrogen.    How can anyone say that industry does not want to participate?   It wants to participate  but it does not want to be dictated to.  Those people who industry does not want to participate are obviously not on top of this issue and do not know what they are talking about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to cooperation, I think we have demonstrated that there is none,  that this will be rammed through and that members of Parliament will have to go home.  As Kyoto unfolds and as its implementation begins, the price of fuel will go up and the requirements of implementation will start to grind down, because remember that by 2005 we have to show substantial decreases in CO<sub>2</sub> levels.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that starts to happen, members of Parliament will have to answer their constituents' questions.  Their constituents will pull out some of these quotes, and the media is aware of  these things, and ask us where we  were in informing them about Kyoto and its implications and did we tell the Prime Minister that he needed to consult.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am saying  that   consultation must occur and  that the provinces must  be brought on side.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a number of items that I would like to cover today.  One of them has to do with   the IPCC modelling that has been done; that the government has chosen to nitpick and cherry-pick the good stuff and leave out the bad stuff.  I also want to talk about the analysis of the second report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately,  I  only  analyzed the first report   into about four or five pages.  The second report I thought we should do in a little more detail. I have about half of it completed at this point.  I would like to do a clause by clause discussion of that.  I will try to abbreviate it as much as I can  but we really  need to do  a pretty major analysis of it, which   is what no one else has done, and certainly the government has not done.  It certainly has never been sent  to a committee where  a committee could call witnesses and try to analyze what exactly Kyoto is all about and its impacts.  Obviously if it had been sent to a committee it could have done this clause by clause study and analyzed this protocol.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However  it has been thrown into the House and we are told it will  be ratified, whether we like it or not, and that it will  happen before Christmas and tough luck.  None of the provinces agree.  Nobody agrees but it will  happen to us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess if there is one purpose of my standing here it is to let the government know that we do not agree with the way it is  handling this file.  It should have been dealing with this file in a committee in a proper and democratic way in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously there are  many things  we could say as we get into this.  The major thing is that the government says that Kyoto will only cost pennies.  Only  3¢ will be added to a barrel of oil and only   13¢ will be added to a barrel of oil for its extraction, which is an additional cost from the tar sands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to remember the importance of the tar sands.  They represent a supply of oil bigger than Saudi Arabia, that it is a major part of Canada's economy and that 60% of the dollars spent on the tar sands are spent in the province of Ontario;  60% of that money will go  to manufacturing jobs in Ontario.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received a call from a truck driver who owns five trucks.  He had a contract to haul pipe from Hamilton to Alberta as part of the oil industry.  All of a sudden he was given 30 days notice that his  contract was over, that he would stop hauling pipe.  He asked, “Is it because I have done the job poorly or is it because I have not delivered on time?  I thought everything was fine”.  The company said that everything was fine and that he was doing a great job.  Everything was right on time.  However the uncertainty of Kyoto has resulted in an investment freeze in that industry and the company will not  take that pipe any more. The owner of those trucks here in Ontario said that he  had to lay off four of his drivers because of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure  the people producing the pipe also had to lay people off because that pipe was not in demand any more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For people to think that Kyoto will not have an impact across this country, they are totally wrong.  Anybody who says that it will not have an impact is simply not telling the truth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously there have been all kinds of reports.  I want to talk about the modelling.  We see headlines that state that Kyoto could push the cost of gasoline to $1 a litre.  I think if the Europeans had their way they would probably like to see it at $2 a litre.</p>


	<A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only person who will benefit, certainly in the cabinet over there, will  be the environment minister  who drives an energy efficient car. However when he tried to encourage the other ministers to drive energy efficient cars, none of them responded.  Now we only have two.  We also will have a check soon on how many cars are outside and how many are running, just to  keep everyone posted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a recent report done by an economist here in Ontario about the  costs.  There have been many reports, and I do not want to say that this one is the most accurate, but this is just one example of the costs. The report came to the conclusion that we should go with a middle of the road model.  We must remember that the government cherry-picked the bottom end model, but going with sort of the middle of the road model, this is the report's findings. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report states that to get to 6% below 1990 levels under a fully implemented Kyoto, which is what we are talking about,  we would need to have a natural gas price increase of 90%.  We would need to have a gasoline price increase of 50% as a minimum or between  30¢ to 35¢ per litre.  The average household would expect to pay $2,700 per year.  The Kyoto plan will do nothing to reduce global warming.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government talks about all   this voluntary stuff.  I have driven on the highways in Ontario.  If people would slow down to 100 kilometres per hour, that would be a huge saving. The speed limit of course is 100 kilometres per hour, but the government is talking about reducing the speed limit, putting tolls on roads and having people drive smaller cars. Will Canadians  do that when they do not see the benefits, when they do not see the results, when they have not bought into the plan and  when the provinces are not being consulted?  I do not think so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can go on to talk about the effects of GDP.  We can talk about the industry minister's officials who did their research and said that the government was underestimating in its modelling by at least 30%. If one government department is saying that it is under by 30%, who knows what that might be?  When has anyone found government to be accurate in its estimate of costs?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us will remember Bill C-68, one of the most famous bills, where the government estimated $87 million and now it has been  estimated at $1.53 billion for  the next couple of years. That is how inaccurate government estimates usually are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I come back to the point that every single member in the House, every one of us, you and me included, Mr. Speaker, will  have to tell that fixed income person, that mom and dad with two kids, that lady driving her son to the hockey game right now, before we knew the costs, before we knew how it would  be implemented and before we knew the plan, why we agreed and how we could possibly vote to ratify something like that. How does one justify that?  I really do not have any idea.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard the minister often say that there was no investment freeze and nothing was happening.  However we have headline after headline. This one involves EnCana, which says that it has shifted investment out of Canada for the fourth quarter because of the uncertainty of what ratification will do.  That is a large company.  The article is dated November 20.  It is pretty recent stuff.  That is exactly what is happening in company after company after company. They are sending--</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  I appreciate that the members across the way are  giving me a break and giving  me a chance to have a drink of water. I appreciate their consideration and  concern but I am just fine. I believe so strongly that what the government is doing and how it is misleading the Canadian people  that I think I could stand here until Christmas or after Christmas just to make that point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go on. One company has said that Kyoto will cost oil sands projects  $100 million.  Others are announcing a billion dollars here and a billion dollars there. I have an interesting one. The president of Syncrude is   a friend of the government, has consulted with the government and has  had dinner with the Prime Minister when he was here. He has done so much for the development of the tar sands but he has been a very close friend of the Prime Minister. He says that Canadians do not realize that the reductions promised are so significant that only if we eliminated all transportation, planes, cars, trucks, rail, could we meet the targets. If we shut down all the oil, natural gas and coal industries, we would only get halfway there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the  targets we will be signing onto.  A friend of the government is telling us to look at  the targets  and to look at how  big they are. What does the government not get about that? How can the government not get it when even a friend has said  that and has delivered that message during a   dinner at 24 Sussex.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This friend has said that Kyoto means that these projects will be put on ice.  That means jobs, income, GDP and our standard of living, which is what we all  depend on in  a modern industrialized country. Does the minister want to  drive this country into third world status? Is that what his aim is? Kyoto, obviously, is just one more part of the legacy of the Prime Minister to drive us under.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to repeat this, and I apologize for repeating anything, but  there is so much that needs to be said. According to the Marrakesh accord, “Nations that  ratify Kyoto but do not meet their targets in round one  by 2012, will be penalized another 30% in emissions cuts and, in addition, such nations cannot sell carbon credits in round two. If at the end of this period, a party's emissions are still greater than its assigned amount, it must make up the difference in the second commitment period, plus a penalty of 30%. It will also be barred from selling under emissions trading and within three months it must develop a compliance action plan detailing the action it will take in order to meet this commitment”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accord goes on to say that a nation can make up a deficit if it wants by buying the credits from a country like Russia, a country that has much dirtier industries than we do, but we will   send Russia  money to buy its hot air under the Kyoto accord.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we ratify Kyoto and do not meet those targets, there are penalties.   For any future prime minister to stand up and say, “Look Canadians and industry, we will let him   ratify it. It  is good to give him his legacy, but if it is going to hurt our country or our industries, we will just opt out of it.  We just will not do it”.  That  does not put much onus on one's signature.  I like dealing with people where word of mouth is everything and  a handshake means they will  deliver. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously if we sign on, if what a future prime minister is suggesting, we are not even good for a signature let alone a handshake. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that say about our country? What kind of legacy is that for our children and grandchildren? I do not think the minister or the Prime Minister care about that. They want to bull ahead with this thing and they really do not care. I do not think that is where Canadians are at. I am sure of that. It is an irresponsible action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people are saying that  we need to have a lot of things happen before ratification. I have four letters here that have been written by pretty important groups: the Canadian manufacturers and the Canadian coalition for responsible environmental solutions. I have a letter from the mayor of my city written to the Prime Minister, which is after a great deal of discussion about Kyoto. I have another letter written by the chamber of commerce. All of these people say that we should  not ratify Kyoto until we know the cost and we have an implementation plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people who are saying that is huge. In fact 71% of Canadians are now saying that, until there is a plan and until we have the cooperation of the provinces, we should not ratify. Boy, is that a change? A year ago I could probably not have interested anybody in talking about Kyoto. Today I could go to any city anywhere in Canada and get a crowd to talk about Kyoto. That is how much more interest there is. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are some Liberal members who want to put together some ridings and have me debate Kyoto with the environment minister, I would love to have that challenge. That would be the thing to which I would look forward to more than anything else. But I imagine that the minister will not accept that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pretty interesting to be at a breakfast meeting in Victoria and realize how little a large number of the business community and professionals know about Kyoto. That is from the minister's riding. It is shocking that they know so little about Kyoto. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously Canadians do not understand it very well. Canadians also need to be sure that they understand the 12 requirements of the provinces. I meant to mention that when I was talking about the provincial issue. I will not read all 12 at this point, but I really think that the 12 issues that the provinces want to hear, want to have answered, are the ones that the government needs to address.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk about the modelling. The government says that models are the key. We had a few members across the way make sarcastic comments about models yesterday. Obviously they think it is a fairly funny issue. I do not find any humour at all in Kyoto. I do not find any humour at all in the potential of what it could do to our country. I find it an extremely serious matter. So when I talk about modelling, it is important that we look at some of the input.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must go back in time to look at what changes have happened over the last 1,000 to 2,000 years. We must remember that the science has been done, the figures and the detail on how much rain there was, how many droughts there were, what kind of life existed and what was the chemical makeup of the air. The science has been done through ice samples and cores. There was a major study done in western Canada where cores were taken out of slough bottoms and interesting things were found.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is pretty amazing that the government keeps trying to play these games.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came back here for a throne speech and in the throne speech the government promised all kinds of weird and wonderful things.  We have not seen anything.  All we have seen is reintroduced bills.  Committees have just been studying old bills.  The government has been playing games month after month and now all of a sudden, as we get close to Christmas, it starts introducing things like the Romanow report and Kyoto.  What kind of a game is the government playing? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would we agree to do things differently for it when in fact it has had nothing on the agenda? It has had to filibuster its own motions and has had to close the House on several occasions because it did not have any speakers here. For the most part quorum could be called here a hundred times a day and there would be no one here.  Those are the kinds of games that the government plays.  It has its nerve to stand up and do that sort of thing.   Canadians are getting pretty sick and tired of that kind of non performance from their government and the  kind of dictatorial nonsense that it is trying to impose on us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get back to talking about Kyoto and the issues. I will wrap up at a point and at that point we will have all kinds of opportunity to hear other members, unless the government is so afraid to hear the facts that it would use something like closure. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that there was a lot of data available on what kind of CO<sub>2</sub> levels there were, and so on, in the past.   I do not think there is too much point in stressing the sources of many of these.  There are many scientific studies and I do not think a lot of parliamentarians or Canadians want to hear about them.  Let me summarize some of this work. This work has been collected by the IPCC, which is a United Nations group of 200 different scientists.  I will not read this into the record, although some members might like me to.  However, I would like to quote little pieces of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study done from 1000 to 1900, which was the first block the IPCC looked at, it found in that period that there was a trend of lowering temperatures.  It got that information from ice cores and samples from the bottom of the ocean.  Samples were taken from the mud going down into the  earth's core, through glaciers, the rings on trees and so on.  That is how all this data was collected.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientists found that in the 20th century there has been an increase in temperature.  There was a decline and then there was an increase.  They also found that there was a period of major cooling between 1400 and 1900.  The minister may have even published some of the work in another life.  The big threat  in the 1970s was that there was an ice age coming.   Of course that was another Chicken Little thing.  Running  across the country talking about that is similar to the Chicken Little that we see now.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a period of time in the 12th century when we had a two to three degree Celsius warming.  We have had an ice period, a cooling period, and in the 12th century a major heating.  The models show that, and the scientists have developed those models and tried to analyze why that all happened.  According to the data the snow line in the Rocky Mountains was about 300 metres higher than it was in 2001.</p>


	<A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone says that the ice caps are melting and the mountains are being exposed.  That is something that happened once before in the 12th century. Through modelling it can be shown why that happened. Moreover the data seems to indicate that there has been a regular recurrence of episodes like the little ice age and the medieval warm period  in roughly 1,500 year climatic cycles over the last 140,000 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our minister to all of a sudden come running through the fence saying that the sky is falling, that we have floods, ice storms and droughts, and that when we sign Kyoto they will all be gone is not the way it works. None of the IPCC models say that. None of the data says that. None of the science says that. Not a scientist would agree with that, yet the minister uses that as his number one prop, that if we do not do this, these are the disasters that will befall all of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next major analysis period was from 1856 to 2100. What is going to happen in that period? The interesting part is that they have broken it down into 40 models. These 40 models, determined by what is put in, determine the predicted outcome. One model says that we will actually have a decrease in temperature of 0.4°C to 0.8°C. Another model, using the same data but forgetting about the cloud factor, shows that we could have a 5°C increase. The models on which the government counts, from those 200 scientists and many other scientists, have a range of reduced temperature or raised temperature. I do not know. I think we should err on the side of caution. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should get CO<sub>2</sub> levels under control. They are higher than they have been for the last 100 years, but there were periods when they were much higher. Let us err on the side of caution and say that we will deal with climate change, but really what Canadians want us to deal with is pollution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pollution is killing people in the Fraser Valley and southern Ontario. Pollution is the big problem in Toronto and why it has 45 smog days. Canadians think that signing Kyoto will fix that problem. Well it is nothing about that. Kyoto is about climate change. I am even saying that we should deal with that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the questions that the IPCC raises. How much effect does CO<sub>2</sub> have on the temperature? We have this greenhouse gas around the earth. It is made up of 97% water in the form of clouds and water vapour, and 3% is made up of things like CO<sub>2</sub>, ozone, methane and various gases. Kyoto has decided to target one of the major greenhouse gases representing part of that 3% as CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At townhall meetings a lot of people think that carbon monoxide is CO<sub>2</sub>. A lot of people who do not have chemistry or biology backgrounds do not understand that. Carbon monoxide also comes out of cars but that is not what this is targeting. This protocol is targeting CO<sub>2</sub>. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the greenhouses gases around the earth that keep us from getting too cold. The model says it would make a 37°C difference if we did not have the greenhouse gases. The reason that the climate would warm up is because the greenhouse gas sheath becomes too thick.</p>


	<A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1650)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first question is, how much effect does CO<sub>2</sub> have on temperature?  The important question is not whether the climate is affected by human CO<sub>2</sub> but by how much.  If the effect on the climate of any increased amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is slight, global warming may not be particularly important. This is sort of like the premiers' endorsement of this whole proposal.  These scientists are quite a long way from really endorsing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, they ask, could there be other causes behind the increased temperature?  They are asking.  They do not know for sure that it is CO<sub>2</sub>. They do say further on that  they believe that  within 10 years  they will have perfected the science to understand global warming much better and will be able to really get the model right and know that they have the answers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They go on to ask, “Are the greenhouse scenarios reasonable?” They then examine all of them, asking what the consequences are of a possible temperature increase.  What are the consequences if the temperature goes up?  What about cost curbing?  What is it going to cost us to reduce those emissions and how should we choose what to do?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously in Kyoto it was decided that CO<sub>2</sub> is the thing to target.  Is it the right thing to target?  Obviously the modelers are saying  they do not know.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to point out that all of the IPCC's predictions are based on such climatic computer model simulators, and it has found that many of  its models are not accurate now. Every year it changes the model and  comes up with other answers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IPCC basically tells us that its previous models were wrong.  Either it will not  be warming up as much as previously claimed or something is hiding the warming. The scientists are saying that maybe it was not CO<sub>2</sub> that was causing this global warming.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are about to embark on a signing of the Kyoto protocol, ratifying it and committing  every man, woman and child in this country to a 20% cut in the use of carbon products.  We are committing to do that when the scientists are saying that maybe the models  this whole thing is based on  are not accurate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that maybe going a  bit slower and waiting until after Christmas might be a pretty good idea.  I do not know that after Christmas the scientists will know if they have it right or not, but I sure as heck know that they do not feel that they have  it totally right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is wrong with a made in Canada program? It would not be held up by problems if the scientists say, “Yes, definitely it is CO<sub>2</sub> and we have  to deal with it”. Obviously then Canadians would get behind that, but when they read stuff like this I just cannot believe that they  will be as solidly behind it as the government says they will: “...most...modelers still believe that accurate models are a decade away.  Moreover, the simplistic models used by the IPCC appear to overestimate” climate change. It is changing every day. At this point, turning to the 40 new IPCC scenarios, the modelers have explicitly abandoned the idea, and if I can repeat that, they have explicitly abandoned the idea of predicting the future and instead they talk about  projections and possible futures. As one of the modelling groups fairly honestly points out, the IPCC scenarios are an attempt at computer-aided storytelling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are about to embark  on this major impact on Canada and we are dealing with something that may not be totally accurate.  How can we do that?  How can we as politicians in the House in good conscience say that we will be going ahead because of a potentially incorrect model?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we do that?  How in conscience can we do that to the people of Canada, to our constituents, to the single family mom, to the people on fixed incomes?  It is not possible.  Even scientists do not agree that we should be doing that, yet the minister cherry-picks these ideas and says they are fact.  Again, I really think that Canadians need to ask some serious questions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to come to what I consider a very well written letter from a person who has many questions about Kyoto, who has examined it and has brought in experts to speak about it.  These experts have not convinced her that Kyoto is the way to go, much as we look at those models, which would hardly be convincing as I quote various parts.</p>

The one I want to read, which I think has a lot of meaning, is from my constituency, but I think it echoes what a lot of people are saying.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter was from Jan Fisher, the Executive Director of the Red Deer Chamber of  Commerce.    She pretty much hits on most issues that Canadians feel are true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again without a plan, without knowing how it will be implemented, without targeting the sectors and telling them what they will be responsible for and without any costs, how can the government possibly bull ahead with the ratification of Kyoto by Christmastime?  That is just an impossible thing to do and obviously an irresponsible thing for any government to do anywhere in the world. I do not think any other country that we are partners with in the industrialized world would operate this way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe everyone heard the evaluation of the first plan.  I would like to now talk about the second plan, which of course was hastily put together for the meeting in Toronto on November 21 with energy and environment ministers. However, that meeting was postponed because there was no real plan. The federal government said it would not listen to the provinces and would not agree to the principles for the meeting. All provinces and territories agreed with those 12 principles.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government said no, that it would not talk to the provinces. The meeting was scheduled for Friday, November 29 and that meeting has been cancelled. So much for consultation and the guarantee that the Prime Minister gave when he said that we would not ratify until we had the cooperation of the majority of provinces, of industry and of the Canadian people. The Prime Minister promised that would be the case.  His promise is turning out to be the same as his GST promise.  He will not deliver on that because he says that his legacy is to ratify Kyoto.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let  us evaluate this clause by clause.  Let us do what committee should do with this bill. Let us analyze this bill for Canadians.  I have heard people say that  what has been happening in here is very interesting. Someone even asked for the transcript.  I cannot imagine reading all those pages, but there are people out there who are that interested and that concerned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no committee. The government is not consulting with parliamentarians.  As was said yesterday, it does not matter what happens in here because no one is listening.  I hope that is wrong.  Just because the government is not listening, does not mean that Canadians are not listening. I think Canadians are starting to listen.  I think they are starting to listen to their industries.  I think they are starting to worry about their jobs.  I think they are starting to listen to their provincial governments.  I think they are starting to listen to their chambers of commerce.  I think they are starting to listen to the MPs who are being honest with them and who are trying to give them all the information they possibly can on the Kyoto accord.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think  Canadians will start to engage.  If they have not engaged before ratification, they will engage during implementation. When they engage during implementation and the costs of their fuel, heating and consumer goods go up,  I think there will be a lot of  questions asked of  lot of members here.  How did they vote on the accord? Did they ask the cost of it?  Did they ask for the implementation plan?  Did they ask how industry would be affected? When pink slips arrive at people's houses, does anyone not think they will ask why this happened? When they hear it was because of Kyoto, I do not think they will be very happy with their members of Parliament who did not inform them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us evaluate it clause by clause. I will go as rapidly as I can.  I would like to wrap this up as soon as I possibly can.  I will certainly make every effort to do that within the next day or so.</p>


	<A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point, I will then turn it over to my colleagues.  I know every one of them want to speak on this most important matter.  I know they want the opportunity to say that when it came time to speak about Kyoto, they were here to speak about it and vote on it.  They want to be able to say that they were here to stand up for that fixed income person, for that mom and dad, for that single mom,  for farmers, for foresters, for those who could potentially lose their jobs, et cetera.  They want to be able to say that they voted to delay this thing so they could have an opportunity to find out what it  would cost, how would it be implemented and how would it affect Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the bottom line.  That is why this place could become relevant again, and I hope Canadians will make it so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us start off with the basic introduction.  I know there is at least one member who will actively follow along with me as we do our clause by clause review. This will be a little different than in committee because I am not sure how many of the members on the other side are listening.  I am not sure how many of them are taking notes and  are trying to evaluate this along with me.  Had this gone to the environment committee, I know that it would have taken it seriously.  I know that it would have given it an evaluation and I know that Canadians would have become informed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this will not go before any committee or anybody else.  In fact the Prime Minister has said that he did not have to take it anywhere and he did not have to even bring it to the House.  That is arrogance.  He has said that we have to rush it through and have it done by Christmas.  Why by Christmas?  He has said that it does not matter what the House has to say.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to do is talk about some of this.  The cornerstone of the arguments against the ratification of Kyoto is the fact that the government has failed to come up with an implementation plan.  The document does not provide us with how this will be implemented.  It does not tell us how Kyoto will affect each sector across the country.  It gives us a bunch of generalities but does not tell us how it will affect business by business.  We need to know that because the people's jobs are a concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has put forward this document called “Climate Change Plan for Canada”, but it is not a plan.  It does not tell us about the costs of anything.  It does not tell us what it will cost Canadians. In this clause by clause analysis then, I would like to, as I did with the first one, show the House how foolish the whole document is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the government has carelessly, hastily and recklessly put together this plan.  It was done quickly.  It was done because the provinces said that they would not meet with the government because it did not have a plan. The provinces are not meeting with them anyway because it does not have a plan.  Therefore it did not accomplish that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on the basis of what has been happening, the risks to the country are not being pointed out to Canadians.  There is nothing in here about the risks to Canada when the document is signed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it does not even come close to meeting the Kyoto commitments.  That is a very serious claim.  The document does not meet the Kyoto targets.  It is short 60 megatonnes and it has no clue from where it will get it.   Again, it has used this sort of false wording, “we will get clean energy credits”.  That is a non-starter and is not acceptable.  That is not what anybody is agreeing to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, it does not mention anywhere that there are penalties for ratifying Kyoto, or not living up to it or not implementing it.</p>


	<A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The document says that we will not meet our targets. We have to assume then in the year 2012 the government will have to buy credits. Where do we buy credits? From Russia and from other East Bloc countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the government has not put forward any kind of legislation, has not talked about how it might go to committee or what the legislation might look like. It has told us absolutely nothing about that. This document, which is  supposedly the next version to go to the provinces, and the provinces will not be there, is nothing different than the first one. Many of the things we said when analyzed the first one could apply to the second one, but let us go a little further through this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I wonder whether all the work in analyzing this is really worth it, the clause by clause study. It has became so obvious, as we have worked through it, that this is a farce. The government is not taking this seriously and is, in a reckless manner, dangerously playing with our economy. The sad part of this whole document is that it does not tell us anything about how we will improve our environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people  who are watching this want more information about this document, I refer them to www.climatechange.gc.ca. This is an overview of the document the government has put together. After reading the first couple of pages, Canadians will be amazed. They will be so shocked that the government would dare say that it will ratify this piece of garbage.  They will not believe what is happening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us start with the preface of this whole thing. “There are few things more fundamental to Canadians than the rich natural legacy we have inherited. Canadians understand the importance of the environment, both to the quality of life we enjoy and to our future economic progress. There is also clear recognition that certain activities are having a harmful effect on the environment and that the choices we make today can determine the health of our environment, not only for tomorrow or next year, but for 100 years from now”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a really good Liberal statement. I really like it and so far that is just perfect. Who could not agree with that? The only problem is the whole document is like that. It is a bunch of feel good, Liberal propaganda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“One of the most pressing environmental challenges is that of global warming. The international scientific community has concluded that the rapid increase in the concentration of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere can be expected to increase the earth's surface temperature and change our climate, alter our environment and endanger our health”. I think the Prime Minister said that in 30 years our children and grandchildren would die of heat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientific truth, as I went through the models, does not say that and it does not agree with that. The problem is a lot of scientists as they learn more about this are starting to ask more and more questions. The international scientific community, which I  have talked about a lot, the IPCC, was formed in 1988 to help coordinate and research the scientific and socioeconomic aspects of climate change. It has been around for a long time, working hard and perfecting its science as time has gone on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we go on through this, we must also remember that 17,000 scientists have disputed the global warming alarmist concept. It is time that we say we need more information. We need to do something. Let us err on the side of caution, but let us not do something that will so damage our economy and our people that we will not be able to recover to fix the real environmental problems which we have.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorne Gunter, a columnist in the <i> Edmonton Journal</i>, addressed this point as well as anyone.  He wrote,  “Our tiny effort is insignificant.  If Canada ruins its economy to cut emissions, will the earth be better off?”  That is a pretty strong statement. It is based on a lot of what we have read.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could read another long story that Lorne Gunter wrote, but I do not want to be found reading something into the record, because up until this point I have tried to speak from the heart in  dealing with the various facts that people really want to hear.  I will pass over this very good article.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> What side is your heart on?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bob Mills:</b> This is the Liberal side for the heart.  When they feel good that they have really done something, that is where they place their hands just so they feel really good about everything, even though they are going to do nothing about what they feel so good about.  That is the Liberal way. That is what it is to be a Liberal.    It is easy to define.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going to read that article.  It is  very good  and if people  want it, they can get a hold of it.  We will keep it.  I am sure  other members will find it so inspiring that they will want to put it in their speeches.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It states,   “That is why in 1992 Canada supported the United Nations framework convention on climate change.  Since then the government has announced its intentions to ratify the Kyoto protocol which sets out specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just read from the document. In 1992   the government said it recognized we had a problem.  In 1992 it said it was going to do something about it.  In fact, it signed an agreement in 1992 that emissions would be stabilized by 2000.  Let me remind  members that in 1999 we were 15% above our 1990 CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In 2000 we were 20% above 1990 emissions levels. Now we are close to 23% or 25% above those levels.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agreed in 1992 that we were going to stabilize our greenhouse gas emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>.  We did not do anything and now the government has the nerve to  bring  a forced ratification to the House.  There will be  an election if we do not ratify this.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House leader had the nerve to come in here and say that we should extend the hours because we need more time.  What has the government been doing for the last 10 years?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago the government said in its own document, which I just quoted, that there was a problem and it was going to deal with it.  It signed an international agreement saying it would and it has done nothing.  What kind of a sham is this?  What kind of a phony excuse is this for the handling of a subject?   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have been saying all along, we can develop and should develop a made in Canada plan.  We should not be going with the made in Japan plan called the Kyoto protocol.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The document goes on,   “It is vital to have a plan that will enable Canada to successfully meet its climate change objectives. The initiatives included in the climate change plan for Canada will do that”.  That is a claim that is made in writing by the government and it is totally not the truth.  It does not have a plan yet. It does not tell us how it is going to implement it.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The document continues,  “Moreover they reflect the priorities identified through the extensive consultations that have taken place with provincial, territorial, municipal, industry representatives, non-governmental organizations, individual Canadians over the years”.  Extensive consultations?  </p>


	<A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder how many Canadians think that they have been extensively consulted on this subject.  The provinces say they have not been consulted.  The Chamber of Commerce says it has not been consulted.  Canadians by the hundreds are saying that they have not been consulted,  yet the government has the nerve to say that it has fully consulted with Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our clause by clause study I would recommend that  we eliminate the first two pages of the document because they are totally incorrect and untrue. Madam Speaker, I know you are not keeping track, taking a dark pen and going through it line by line, but we can probably move faster because we have eliminated the first two pages.  By the end of this I do not think there is going to be very much left.  Probably you can already guess the conclusion, that we need a new document that includes an implementation plan, that includes the costing and that includes full consultation with Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on to say that the Government of Canada is committed to continuing collaboration in an effort to find the most effective ways to build on the proposals presented in the plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just quoted what  every province in Canada  thinks of this plan, and the government has the nerve to say it is committed to continuing the collaboration.  The provinces have said it has not collaborated at all.  How can the government commit here that it will start collaborating?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Participating in the global effort to address climate change is an issue for all Canadians in every region and every walk of life, indeed it will require a national effort, one that summons the best from our citizens, entrepreneurs, scientists, communities and government”. That is a true statement.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will involve a commitment from every single Canadian. Every man, woman and child in the country will have to eliminate 20% of his or her use of carbon.  I have heard some people say that they do not  use any carbon.  Every bit of transportation uses carbon.  Most every manufacturing takes energy and uses carbon.  Electricity is made by burning carbon.  The heat in this building is made by burning carbon.  We use carbon for everything.  Our whole way of life is based on the burning  of carbon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we change that?  Yes we can.  Will alternate energy take over?  Yes it will, but it will not take over by 2005 when we have to show substantial decreases in CO<sub>2</sub> under the Kyoto accord.  That is  the very point.  While we agree that we have to do something, obviously we are showing a real problem with doing that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is while the government is saying these things, it has not done much to tell every Canadian about all of these increases.  I am still quoting:</p>

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that not just wonderful.  These statements are just so Liberal, they are just so feel good.  They  make one feel like the Viagra man, just jump out the door and dance down the street.  They make one feel so happy.  But there is no plan here.  There are no results from this.  We  will not dunk the basketball or dance into the elevator with a smile.  There will not be an elevator because  carbon use has been cut. In actual fact it cannot deliver on these things but they are such feel good  things.</p>


	<A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1730)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that by the time we start to do this, we will have to be close to a 30% reduction in the use of our carbon. That is going to hit every single person.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of evaluation in this document. If I do not get through it all, even  analyzing the graphs, I will be sure  the minister gets it so that he can read  it. I am sure he will be very interested because they are not going to listen to us anyway. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan proposes both short term action and long term perspective. Something can be done now, such as providing Canadians and Canadian businesses with the tools and incentives to make more energy efficient decisions. Others will be done over a number of years, such as investing in more energy efficient technologies and production methods, and switching to less carbon-intensive forms of energy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sums up to investments, both short term and long term, but by the time we tax our companies, by the time we force them into what Kyoto will do, will they have that money to invest in jobs and new initiatives? I question if they will. Most scientists question, the manufacturers question, the chambers of commerce question, everybody questions that the government will have that. By ratifying this without an implementation plan, how can we possibly make these false claims?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our clause by clause analysis of the preface of this document, it is a bunch of feel good Liberal philosophy but none of it is factual or deliverable. It cannot deliver something which does not have an implementation plan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going to go through each word, but I hope people have gotten the idea about how fictitious the whole document is. More than anything else, I think people will understand why the premiers,  the environment ministers and the energy ministers are not booking their tickets to Toronto for Friday. If this is the sort of garbage that the government comes out with, why would they show up? Why would they bother to come when the government shows absolutely no interest in anything but feel good Liberal philosophy?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who are not coming are  from many different political parties. This  has become a non-partisan issue. NDP premiers, Liberal premiers and Conservative premiers, all the premiers of  the provinces are saying, “We have 12 proposals. We want them addressed and if they are not, then we will not come”. They are not going to proceed. I do not think anyone really knows why the Prime Minister has decided to ram this through, including his ministers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another section says,  “With commitment and resolve, we will build that future together”. Who wrote this stuff? It is amazing. Perhaps  the minister's aides could  let me meet the people who wrote this stuff. I would like to know what they are on because obviously, it allows them to spew out this stuff.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It talks about the science. It says, “There is a strong consensus among scientists that climate change is already occurring and that human activity is contributing to it”. There are some scientists who do agree with that. “The earth's temperature is determined in part by a naturally occurring process known as the greenhouse effect. While certain greenhouse gases occur naturally, human activities are releasing additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere”.</p>


	<A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact, 5% of greenhouse gases are produced by humans and 95% are produced by natural activity. I do not want to re-read those words, but those words say that humans have something to do with it. Technically that is true, 5%, but what will the government do? Will it stop volcanoes? Will it stop methane coming out of landfill sites? Will it stop the natural processes of decomposition? Will it outlaw the breakdown of dead plant material? Obviously if humans only represent 5%, the 95% is from nature.  Why would we do what we are doing when 95% is coming into the atmosphere from natural processes? That is the huge question that we have to ask.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have  many other examples here. The government in its  document should probably have  stayed away from the science, because now it really starts to get itself into trouble. It has decided to ignore 17,000 scientists who signed the Oregon petition and who in fact said that this alarmist plan that is Kyoto will really not achieve anything. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has chosen to ignore those people. It has chosen instead to pick a few people, just like it did with the models.  It cherry-picked what it wanted to hear then it went ahead. The most common question I get is:  why would the Liberals do this? The only answer I can give is that it makes them feel good in the Liberal way and it gives a legacy to the Prime Minister. It has to be a political reason because it is not a scientific reason and  not an economic reason.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  a member stands up and says, “We  are ratifying it. I don't care what the rest of you think. If you backbenchers do not ratify it,  I will call an election and you will have me for four more years”, that is the political reason  behind Kyoto.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For today I will wrap up. I will try to wrap this up as quickly as I can tomorrow and we will move on.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Madam Speaker, I would like to speak as long as the hon. colleague who spoke before me; unfortunately, our time is limited. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea for Motion No. 141 was first suggested by the President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac. He suggested the idea that the world needed an international French language all-news  channel. I agree with this objective. Today's world cannot accept English language information only, information with a single colour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, like many of us in this House,   you have travelled pretty extensively. When we travel around the world, whether  for personal purposes or for purposes relating to our   business as federal elected representatives, we realize that, besides the local media, the main sources of information are the American    network CNN and the British BBC. Both play a major role, even an essential one, in   maintaining the flow of information around the world. Two networks is not enough, however. CNN and the BBC cannot meet all the needs for information worldwide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Quebec and the Government of Canada—the latter under pressure from the former—who are fighting for  cultural diversity, and rightly so, should realize that one aspect of this cultural diversity is the basic need for information from various sources and various cultures, each with   a vision of the world quite different from the others. We should not have a  uniform vision of information; that is not good for the whole planet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France is currently looking at three options. The first is to have a French language, French only news network. This would be an exclusively French network based of the public television system, such as France 2 or the LCI news network. It would present the world with almost nothing but the French vision. While it is important, the main player in the Francophonie, France      is not the only important player when it comes to the French language on this planet. This is nevertheless an option being contemplated by France. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second option is a European network, based on the EuroNews system, which we get here, in Quebec and Canada. This would be a multinational but European network that would broadcast to the rest of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third option being considered by France is a multilateral French language network, somewhat similar to TV5. I am of the opinion, and this is the purpose of my motion, that the Quebec and Canadian governments—since we are in the federal Parliament, in Ottawa—should insist that the third option prevail. It would be a matter of telling our partners, our friends, our French cousins that we too want to diversify worldwide news sources, that we too want to be involved in the broadcasting of a different vision of news, and that this option should be examined by the Francophonie, which is an increasingly important forum at the world level.</p>


	<A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1745)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it clear that I am not asking that TV5 be replaced. TV5 is a great success and it works fine. However, one of its objectives is also to broadcast cultural programs and films. That is fine. I want French language culture to be increasingly known all over the world. It is important that this culture be known, regardless of its origin, whether it is French, Quebec, Canadian or African.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it would also be important to have access to a French news source 24 hours a day. When we travel, we often watch TV5. We often find ourselves watching a movie. The only news sources available are the BBC or CNN.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world needs an all-news network in French. Except for English, French is the only language spoken on all five continents. Therefore, I urge this House to ask the government to give consideration to—that is to keep an open mind and to explore the possibility of—creating a worldwide all-news French television network.  Let us send to our French friends the message that we are interested in taking part in a multinational French language project that will help support cultural diversity in all this news, which is essential in the 21st century.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I am tempted, as a response to the motion presented by the member for Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, to remind the House of Canada's presence within the institutions of the international Francophonie, our participation in TV5 in particular, and of the benefits its presence has for Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Francophonie is, first and foremost, the community of peoples who, to varying degrees, speak or use French in their national life or their  international relations.   It is also a group of organizations and associations, both governmental and non-governmental, involved in various sectors of interest to members of the francophone community, including culture. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensitive to its own francophone reality, Canada was one of the first countries to promote the Francophonie, by participating in particular in the creation and development of its many institutions.  Thus it was one of the founding members of the Agence de Coopération culturelle et technique in 1970, which has since become the Agence intergouvernementale de la Francophonie.  I will come back a little later to TV5, which some consider one of the Francophonie's finest achievements.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is now the second largest donor to the multilateral Francophonie, after France of course, while it pays out more than $25 million annually to the various operating bodies of the Francophonie, including TV5.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Francophonie is one of the major focuses of Canada's foreign policy. Domestically, our participation is designed to promote our linguistic duality and to affirm and promote the vitality of the French fact in Canada. Internationally, the Francophonie is a natural zone of influence  for Canada, just like the Commonwealth or the Organization of American States.</p>


	<A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1750)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beyond considerations of a geopolitical order, Canada's membership in the Francophonie is primarily an alliance with the rich network of 56 states and governments that have French in common,  a network that extends from Europe, Africa and the Middle East to the West Indies, the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and of course our continent. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it gives the rest of the world a true appreciation of Canada's contribution to the dialogue among cultures and an opportunity to embrace the values of openness, democracy and tolerance, and to appreciate the richness of our francophone culture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year 2001 reminded us that it is up to the better-off on this planet to lend an ear and listen, but also to share our perceptions and our understanding of the reality that surrounds us.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theme of the most recent Francophone  Summit, held in Beirut last October, was the dialogue of cultures.  I must tell hon. members how very proud I was to accompany the Prime Minister to Lebanon.  The Minister of Canadian Heritage also attended, given her longstanding involvement with cultural dialogue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Beirut summit, the heads of state and government affirmed their desire to breathe new life and new energy into the dialogue of cultures and civilizations, and to bring peoples closer together through mutual understanding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They identified various tools and programs of the Francophonie to promote a closer relationship, be it by increasing Francophone cooperation in international forums on the great issues of the day, by participating in initiatives to prevent and settle conflicts, or by encouraging exchanges among young people throughout the Francophonie.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, TV5, the international French language channel and operating body of the international Francophonie, is also one of the best vehicles for promoting dialogue among cultures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created in 1984, the international channel, TV5, is the fruit of a close partnership among five members of the Francophonie, the Government of Canada, France, Switzerland, the French community of Belgium and the Government of Quebec. TV5 also benefits from the participation of a number of African countries, namely Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Senegal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TV5 is now the third largest television network in the world, after MTV and CNN. The channel broadcasts 24 hours a day by cable and satellite on five continents. One hundred and thirty million households have access to TV5, which means a potential audience of almost 600 million viewers who can watch the best programming from the major public French language channels, including Radio-Canada and Télé-Québec.</p>


	<A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1755)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada pursues two fundamental objectives by participating in TV5: helping to promote Canada on the international scene by offering Canada's Francophone artists and producers a special international showcase; and offering Canadians an additional French language channel and a window on the international community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada has been involved for nearly 20 years in this multilateral undertaking that is unique in the world, and in 2002-03, the Government of Canada provided it with $8 million in funding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of content, TV5 is primarily a generalist channel in which information, in other words news, is the real backbone. In this respect, we should remember the outstanding contribution of Radio-Canada and RDI, which constantly feed TV5 news programming of the highest quality. These programs are broadcast all across the globe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take this opportunity to mention that the professionalism of Canadian journalists is greatly appreciated by the great TV5 family. Their reputation is firmly established. Canada thus makes an active contribution to ensuring that the news broadcast on TV5 is of high quality and reliable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TV5 is also a well-respected undertaking around the world, where it is often the only alternative to local news sources. I am thinking of Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, where TV5 is in turn educational, entertaining and informative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For over 20 years, Canada has been helping to build a world television network that, over the years has, become a news broadcaster on par with CNN and the BBCs of this world.</p>


	<A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian and international news occupy an important place in RCIs programming. The channel also broadcasts programs on culture, economics and politics, thus offering the rest of the world an overview of the realities of Canadian life today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly proud to talk about Radio Canada International because its transmitters are located in my riding, not far from the lovely town of Sackville.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Tantramar Marshes in New Brunswick, near the Nova Scotia border, people around the world can hear via shortwave signal Radio Canada International.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the success of TV5 and the Government of Canada's oft-renewed commitment to this operating body of the Francophonie, and given the existence of other Canadian tools already in place that broadcast quality French language news internationally, I believe  that we should first focus our efforts on consolidating these tools. Of course, it would be interesting to envisage other vehicles for distributing our television programming, but at this stage, such a project is not realistic.</p>

	Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to make some remarks with regard to Motion No. 141.  The motion states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in conjunction [I believe that is a very co-operative approach] with the Government of Quebec and the other partners in the Francophonie, give consideration [that is a word of moderation] to the creation of a world-wide all-news television network.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say to the hon. member for Charlesbourg--Jacques-Cartier that New Brunswick is an equal partner within the Canadian context and the Francophonie. I assume that he recognizes one of those partners to be his neighbouring province of New Brunswick which is the province I reside in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this era of media concentration, the idea is entrenched in the Canadian psyche that the more perspectives we can have that would disseminate news and information regardless of what language they are distributed in is a positive initiative.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a founding partner of the Francophonie, and as a representative of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada which was instrumental in the establishment of the Francophonie, my view is that this initiative deserves consideration.  I think that is what the member for Charlesbourg--Jacques-Cartier is advocating.  A prudent approach should be taken.  My colleague from the Bloc sits on the standing committee on official languages. It may be a reasonable approach to have this committee study the issue itself as to whether this is the track our nation should take.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know there are intrinsic advantages, not just from a cultural perspective but economically as well, of maintaining the French language within the international community.  The Francophonie has provided us with a forum to reach out and speak to nations.  Other nations do not have the same kind of inroads from a north south perspective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the critic on official languages for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada this type of initiative speaks to the same spirit of the strong institution that we have in Radio Canada International.  There is a level of expertise there. Perhaps  there could be some form of joint venture done in conjunction with France, Quebec and New Brunswick. I am quite comfortable going down that track.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party, I will be supporting the motion by the hon. member for Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier.</p>

	Madam Speaker, from the outset, let me say that I support the motion put forward by my colleague from Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier. I wish to read the motion again, because the hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac was misinformed or he misinterpreted—at least that  is what I humbly believe—the motion before us and found it to be not realistic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion states:</p>


	<p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last I heard, there were approximately 42 members countries in the Francophonie.</p>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are examining, with our partners in the Francophonie, the possibility of having a worldwide French language all-news television network.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that this motion is much in keeping with the new realities of the francophone community.  Francophonie summits, which emulate to some extent Commonwealth events, are relatively new in the francophone community. The involvement, and even its establishment, of the International Organization of the Francophonie is relatively new. The Francophonie is growing. It is a community discovering itself, a community with very different realities within it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of countries in the Francophonie are African countries. They have French in common, but also the evolution and promotion of this language. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. member for Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier aptly said, and also my hon. colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party, with this evolution of the Francophonie, we can seriously contemplate the possibility of creating a worldwide all-news information network.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the outcome of these discussions within the international forums of the Francophonie is a matter that should be brought up at the next  Francophone Summit. Perhaps the outcome will be to say no. But, for the time being,  how can one do like   the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac and state that it is not realistic before even looking at the possibility of creating a network, when such an all-news network exists in English. I am referring to the BBC. There is also CNN, although this is a private network.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are national news networks within countries. Could we, within the Francophonie, use this news, these structures, to make international news from primarily French speaking countries around the world available and accessible in French? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that information goes hand in hand with democracy. I was surprised to hear my Liberal colleague say that it was not realistic to imagine giving information to countries that, all too often, suffer from a lack of information, such as countries in Africa. In many cases, these new and emerging democracies are deprived of international news about what is going on among their neighbours, their allies and around the world. These days, we live in a global village, and we are being told it is not realistic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One only needs look at what the member states of the Francophonie have accomplished in recent years. The Sommets de la Francophonie have, more often than not, been a great success.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have witnessed the role of the Francophonie in education. Countries with a common interest in the French language, such as Canada, form committees to assist, communicate and consult. It is not that some have a monopoly on the truth and the others are wrong. We are there to share knowledge and information about education and to give access to the member states of the Francophonie that are less developed to this education, to help  people who are in circumstances that are all too often regrettable improve their lot.</p>


	<A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1810)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An all-news network could broadcast information on the various means of education that are available to these different countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true for culture. The member states of the Francophonie share a common culture, which is language, but we could learn so much more if every country in the Francophonie shared its own culture by making it available through information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an election takes place in an emerging democracy, the Francophonie sends an observer mission to monitor and observe what happens. An all-news network could broadcast what is happening in these countries to the rest of the world, particularly to concerned Francophones. I do not think it is not realistic to share the emergence of democracies, the emergence of events that carry hope in certain countries, these types of news, with other countries in their language, which is French.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the issue of the economy in certain emerging countries of the Francophonie, where we share an interest through microcredit; the same could be said with regard to the status of women, and other issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that a million and one subjects could be addressed by a French language all-news network.  All countries need to be aware of all this information, as well as of international events as broadcast in English and in French by our networks in the western world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend and colleague from the Progressive Conservative party has had an interesting idea.  We might suggest that the motion of our colleague from Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier be examined by the new standing committee on official languages.  This used to be the joint official languages committee, which was made up of MPs and senators and has had a number of successful outcomes to its credit.  We now have the pleasure of having a committee made up solely of members of the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last summer, hon. members will remember the ruckus about Radio-Canada not wanting to continue to carry hockey in French, thus depriving all French Canadians of a heritage they had enjoyed on state television for 50 years.  The committee was one of those instrumental in remedying that situation, and now hockey is available to all Canadians, francophones in particular.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the situation involving the use of French on Air Canada, the committee was in large part responsible for rattling their cage so that minority language communities' rights were respected.  Within a few weeks, there will be comment sheets available on planes in recognition of the rights of members of francophone communities who fly Air Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, the debates of this House are broadcast across Canada by CPAC.   Until recently, francophones from Manitoba westward were not able to tune in in French, because the French language channel was not available to them.  The committee addressed this, and now it is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of our Progressive Conservative colleague, to refer this question to a committee, is very interesting and could be adopted by the members of this House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go on, I must say that I believe my colleague from Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party and myself have managed to demonstrate the importance of this motion, which unfortunately is not votable, because of the rules and procedures governing the business of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to quite simply  seek unanimous consent of the House to allow this motion to be put to a vote, in order to lend a little more weight to it. I believe that will be unanimously supported. </p>

	Madam Speaker, I am disappointed to see that there is not unanimous consent. The members who said no are mostly members who live in a French minority. Through their vote, they willingly accept not to benefit from another all-news network in their own language. It must be because they already have enough, or because they do not want it. One would have to ask them in order to find out. But it is somewhat surprising and disappointing that they would not want to create, together, this all-news French network.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members are wondering what they opposed. I just told them that they said no to an all-news network in their language. I am sorry to tell them, but they should know what they are saying yes or no to. I am sorry for them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were told “Sure, but where will the money come from?” This issue, the money issue, will be discussed at international forums. However, if we were to follow the example of TV5, there would not even be a money issue, since we share the news and the technology of the countries that are part of this network. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we read the motion as presented, we can see that we are asking that consideration be given to the creation of an international French language televison network. He jumped the gun by declaring the idea impractical before even considering it. Allow me to question the seriousness of the approach and    pronouncements of the hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point I absolutely want to bring to the attention of those listening.   Both speakers who opposed considering having an international French language network are francophones in minority communities, namely the member for Madawaska—Restigouche and the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac. These are two individuals who should normally be very sensitive to the importance of    promoting French language information tools. These two members of this House refused unanimous consent to make this motion votable. This speaks volumes about their personal and political involvement in championing francophones outside Quebec living in minority communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, we have learned today that the House will be changing its rules to allow each and every member of this House to bring in at least one votable bill per Parliament. I wish to announce, therefore, that I will very seriously consider reintroducing this motion or one very similar, so that it can be declared votable. This way, members will have to publicly take a stand  for or against such a proposal, which, I repeat, is intended as a response to  the suggestion by the President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac, about creating an international French language all-news network. </p>

	Madam Speaker, we arrived at this point a little earlier than I expected.  I am glad I came over to the House a little early.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week or so ago I asked the Minister of Health a question  on bioterrorism.  The point  I was making was that Canada simply was not prepared for a bioterrorist attack.  What  I specifically spoke about  and questioned the minister on that day was  the fact that if terrorists had the  ability  to deliver the smallpox virus to  Canada it would have a catastrophic effect on our country.  I compared the preparedness of the United States and the United Kingdom to that of Canada.  I pointed out that the United States was prepared to vaccinate 280 million people within a week if it became necessary.  I also pointed out that the United Kingdom had taken steps to vaccinate its people in the event that something like that should happen. The fact of the matter is, it can happen and we must be prepared for it.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also questioned the antidote.  When people receive the vaccination that would protect them against smallpox, an antidote is required to counter the effect of that particular drug.  Out of every 10,000 people who are vaccinated against smallpox there will be at least one death and  possibly more.  The antidote is something that we never even considered in Canada and the government does not have a supply of it, yet that antidote itself is manufactured in Canada.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question would be, if the United Kingdom and the United States are prepared, why are we not prepared?  That was the point I was driving at in my question to the minister that day in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quote from  an article that appeared in the  <i>Edmonton Journal</i> on November 14,  about two weeks ago, in which   the Defence Science Advisory Board  said:</p>


	<p>

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article goes  on to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went on again to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>And health-care cuts have left provinces “with minimal capacity to respond to any emergencies beyond the scale of a bus crash.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are saying is that we have to be prepared, we should be prepared and it is important that the Government of Canada act on this real possibility.  If other countries have done it we should do it. Why does the government not act?  Why does the minister not act?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, the bioterrorist advisory group that the government set up about a year ago has not yet met. It has been over a year.  The only thing it has had is a long distance telephone conference.  This advisory group that the Government of Canada thought was so important to set up in response to any terrorist attack on the biochemical front has not met. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question for the minister is:  Why has it not met?  Why will it not do something?  Why will it not prepare Canada, as the United Kingdom has prepared itself, as has the--</p>

	Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's question. I will try, in the next few minutes, to give him the exact status of where we are today, the position the government has taken as well as the position of the Minister of Health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure my colleague, and obviously all of my colleagues that are listening, as well as all Canadians, that our government is working with public health officials from the provinces and territories to ensure that in the unlikely event that smallpox were used as a terrorist weapon, we will be prepared to deal with the threat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These preparations are twofold. The first element consists of a plan. The second element is having a sufficient quantity of smallpox vaccine in Canada. On both of these fronts, we have taken the necessary measures to protect Canadians. Allow me to explain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the Canadian contingency plan for smallpox. We have obviously consulted with the Chief Medical Officers of Health from every province and territory.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very important step because any plan must reflect the way we work together in a real emergency situation. For this reason, Health Canada  officials have carefully examined the plan with all of the appropriate provincial and territorial stakeholders, the Chief Medical Officers of Health and their staff, as well as emergency services and emergency social services staff.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contingency plan has been carefully studied. The final version will soon be released to the public. What does this plan call for?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken the research and confinement approach recommended by the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health and the World Health Organization. This strategy was applied successfully in the years prior to 1979, and led to the eradication of the disease.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this approach, the spread of smallpox is contained by identifying infected persons and any persons who may have contact with them. The vaccine is administered to these people in the four days following their exposure to the smallpox virus, and to those who work with smallpox carriers, health care workers and laboratory workers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been very actively involved in procuring the vaccine.  Our intention to get it from a Canadian supplier has been revealed today as part of the government tendering process.  Public Works and Government Services Canada issued an advance contract award notice via MERX, the government  electronic tendering service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our objective is to have a stock of smallpox vaccine available that would be sufficient to react to multiple smallpox outbreaks in Canada, should that event  ever occur. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we will have the capacity to produce more doses in Canada expeditiously.  This would be required if ever we were required to expand the vaccination effort, even to the entire population if circumstances required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the immunoglobulin, which is used to treat serious vaccine side-effects, there is a limited quantity of this in the world, because it is produced from the blood of recently vaccinated individuals, and most countries stopped doing systematic vaccination in 1972. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States has recently begin to rebuild its stocks of immunoglobulin, by vaccinating a small number of volunteers who then donate their blood to produce the immunoglobulin.  Via discussions with the U.S. Center for Disease Control, Health Canada is taking steps to obtain a certain quantity of the immunoglobulin.  I can assure hon. members that Canada has no intention of vaccinating anyone whatsoever against smallpox until this immunoglobulin is available. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, obviously, part of our campaign against  smallpox, which includes what we call pre-exposure vaccination.  Before any outbreak whatsoever occurred, a certain number of individuals would be immunized in order to be in a position to provide medical care to anyone who might be exposed subsequently. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, we do have a plan and will do everything in our power to implement that plan, if ever the need arises.  </p>

	Madam Speaker, thank you  for reminding me that I had a one minute response to the minister's response to me.  I appreciate that. I was captivated by his speech and I forgot  that I had  one minute, although now I am down to 50 seconds.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After  listening to the parliamentary secretary's response, I do not think we are really   ready for a bioterrorist attack.  I do not think we can simply hide under our desks and pretend or hope that it does not happen, because the fact is that it could happen.  That is why these other jurisdictions have prepared themselves for that eventuality--I should not say it in those terms--that possibility is probably a better way of saying it because we are hoping and praying of course that it does not happen, but  we have to be ready if it does happen. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, obviously, other countries have taken  a different approach. Their approach is to vaccinate the entire population, while we came to the conclusion, following consultations with experts in the field, that here in Canada, we will only vaccinate groups at risk, and confine these people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have procured the vaccine required for this need. If the entire population needed to be vaccinated, we could meet this objective using the dilution factor.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a choice that we made based on consultations with experts who suggested it. This is also, incidentally, the approach suggested to us by the World Health Organization. We are fully aware that other countries have preferred to take a different approach.</p>
