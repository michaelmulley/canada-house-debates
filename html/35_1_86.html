Association québécoise des pré-retraités et des retraités is 
marking its 15th anniversary. Membership in this association is 
growing every year as more people join the attack on the federal 
government's unacceptable scheme to impose a graduated tax 
on individuals earning more than $25,000 a year.
<P>
	Senior citizens can rest assured that the Bloc Quebecois will 
defend their dearly won rights and will oppose any measure 
designed to cut the deficit at their expense, given that so much 
administrative duplication between the federal and provincial 
governments could be eliminated.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois also intends to keep a close watch on the 
government to ensure that it stops giving preferential treatment 
to this country's millionaires who can shelter their money from 
taxes using the loophole known as family trusts.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
August 1992, 73-year old William Dove was lured from his 
cabin near Whitewood, Saskatchewan and brutally beaten to 
death by two men and a teenager. Unbelievably, Hubert Acoose, 
one of the two men convicted of manslaughter, was granted a 
day parole last week. This is less than two years in jail for killing 
a person. This is the kind of decision that many Canadians find 
incomprehensible.
<P>
	What guarantees can the Solicitor General give Canadians 
that Mr. Acoose is not a threat to public safety? Are the Solicitor 
General and the members of the Parole Board who released Mr. 
Acoose willing to accept personal responsibility and liability for 
any crimes Mr. Acoose may commit while on day parole?
<P>
	Are parole members willing to be personally responsible for 
their bad decisions? The government is running a huge social 
experiment and Canadian people are assuming all the risks. 
Canadians are demanding that the government make public 
safety its number one priority, and the government's response is 
to let killers out on our streets.

	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
agriculture is extremely important to the economy of Atlantic 
Canada. In recognition of this fact the co-operative 
subagreements between the federal government and the Atlantic 
provinces have been extended for 1994-95.
<P>
	However, to date only provincial contributions have been 
made to these agreements.
<P>
	The funding of these subagreements is used for valuable 
projects such as land development in my home province of New 
Brunswick and in my Carleton-Charlotte constituency. They 
are extremely important in building the self-sustaining 
economy, a goal which we are all working toward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	I encourage the minister and the departments responsible to 
provide the federal funding required for these agreements as 
soon as possible so that we might continue to build our 
agricultural economy and the self-sufficiency of Atlantic 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
some individuals delight in insinuating that the political 
situation in Canada and Quebec is the cause of the instability 
affecting the Canadian bond market.
<P>
	It is important to set the record straight and to say that nothing 
could be further from the truth. Japanese investors sold off large 
numbers of Canadian bonds which they owned in March, after 
the budget was tabled and well before the Leader of the Official 
Opposition made his trips abroad. The bond divestment was 
prompted by the negative reaction of financial markets to the 
Liberal government's budget.
<P>
	Mr. Masakazu Mizutani, Vice President and Treasurer of the 
Bank of Tokyo in Toronto, confirms that investors have eased up 
considerably on their sales of Canadian bonds and that today, 
``they do not have many left to sell''.
<P>
	In short, the hike in interest rates and the massive divestment 
of Canadian bonds in March are the result of ill-conceived 
budgetary and monetary policies on the part of the Liberal 
government.

remind the House that voting in North America's first electronic 
referendum started this morning.
<P>
	Voting on the Young Offenders Act will continue 24 hours a 
day until Monday, June 20. This should give all members ample 
time to vote in the referendum using the secret PIN numbers 
they received earlier. The Hill phone system will not allow calls 
to 1-900 numbers, therefore members wishing to vote must do 
so from off the Hill and are therefore subject to the same 
user-pay principle as all other Canadians taking part in this 
historic event.

	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax):</B> Mr. Speaker, St. Georges 
Anglican Church opened its door to Haligonians in 1800. The 
church was built by Edward, Duke of Kent, father of Queen 
Victoria, then the commander of the Halifax garrison. It was 
architecturally a perfect circle and for almost two centuries a 
unique landmark in our city.
<P>
	In 1917 the church was seriously damaged in the Halifax 
explosion. It survived and in 1983 the Prince and Princess of 
Wales attended the rededication ceremony which stood in 
testimony to the devotion of those who undertook the task of 
restoring it.
<P>
	In 1990 it was designated a national historic site.
<P>
	Unfortunately two weeks ago this magnificent building was 
nearly ruined as a fire gutted its walls and destroyed a third of its 
structure. It is estimated that the total restoration cost will far 
exceed the $1 million in insurance.
<P>
	To date congregation members have begun a nation-wide 
fundraising campaign to restore this historic landmark to its 
original beauty.
<P>
	All Haligonians, all Nova Scotians and indeed all Canadians 
want to stand with them and hope that they will restore this great 
site.

	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
my place today to briefly comment on the current debate over 
what shape the country's gun control legislation should take in 
the future.
<P>
	Gun enthusiasts in my riding have told me that three 
initiatives would help greatly in solving Canada's gun problem. 
First, Canada's laws regarding the safe storage of firearms must 
be followed through. Two recent tragedies that have involved 
guns in my riding occurred when legally purchased firearms 
were stolen and used in criminal matters.
<P>
	Second, I urge this government to look at the form of a picture 
ID for firearms acquisition certificates. This would enable gun 
sellers to be sure that the individuals possessing the firearms 
acquisition certificate are the ones who earned it.
<P>
	Third, many individuals in my riding support the concept of 
needing to use a firearms acquisition certificate to purchase 
ammunition. The middle way must be tried.
<P>
	I urge this House to aim for innovative and modest ideas.

although we were saddened by the riots in Vancouver last night, 
I am very proud and very honoured, as the member of Parliament 
for Vancouver East, the home of the Vancouver Canucks, to 
congratulate the players, coaching staff and management on a 
remarkable play-off season and for nearly capturing the most 
coveted of all sporting prizes, the Stanley Cup.
<P>
	Few predicted that the Vancouver Canucks would have 
reached the Stanley Cup finals. They demonstrated 
extraordinary maturity, talent and perseverance in overcoming 
numerous challenges, including stretching the finals to a 
seventh and deciding game.
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate the New York Rangers. They 
were formidable opponents. On behalf of all Canadians,

pictures and reports out of Rwanda. The discovery of a mass 
grave where close to 20,000 men, women and children were 
murdered in a convent near the Tanzanian border has shocked 
people all over the world.
<P>
	This lunacy must stop. The international community can no 
longer stand by and watch this venting of hatred, this systematic 
genocide that is increasing daily and reflects the worst aspects 
of human nature.
<P>
	The Rwandan situation is critical, and political decision 
makers must take the necessary steps to put to an end this 
carnage, which historians in the next century will find difficult 
to explain. In the midst of all the vicissitudes facing the peoples 
of Africa, the killing of Rwandan citizens merely because they 
are who they are is quite simply shameful. It is time to do 
something about it.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, just as 
high government debt and deficits distort decisions in financial 
markets, so tax and spend policies distort family decisions.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	Monday's CTV poll demonstrates that 3 million Canadian 
families would rather have one parent stay at home with the 
children but cannot afford to do it.
<P>
	This year families will have to pay 48 per cent of their income 
in taxes and so their lifestyle decisions are effectively dictated 
by the state.
<P>
	Unfortunately, governments are then forced to become more 
and more interventionist by giving selective tax breaks and 
running expensive national programs. What parents really want 
are the resources to do good parenting jobs themselves.
<P>
	By easing tax burdens on all Canadians, Reformers would 
increase lifestyle options within all families. Reform would 
empower parents to make employment arrangements according 
to their preference; free to work outside their residence or free to 
work at home with their own children.

North America was elected in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	On June 15, 1944 Tommy Douglas and his team of candidates 
from the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation came to 
office and with rolled up sleeves, a people first agenda and lots 
of hard work they set about the undaunting task of pulling 
Saskatchewan out of debt and improving the quality of life of its 
citizens.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan the legacy of Tommy Douglas and his 
successors Woodrow Lloyd, who made hospitalization a reality, 
and Alan Blakeney, who presided over 11 consecutive balanced 
budgets, is is being taken up by current Premier Roy Romanow 
and a team of New Democrats who are successfully tackling and 
reducing what was the highest provincial per capital debt in 
Canada while at the same time establishing progressive health 
care reform.

remember with respect and admiration Tommy Douglas and the

	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West):</B> Mr. Speaker, we should all 
recognize the importance of removing the internal trade barriers 
which are obstacles to economic competitiveness and growth in 
Canada.
<P>
	Internal trade barriers raise the cost of doing business. There 
are over 500 internal trade barriers in Canada with a cost to 
Canadians of approximately $6.5 billion annually in lost 
income.
<P>
	Negotiations under way between federal, provincial and 
territorial governments will lead to an agreement by June 30, 
1994. The federal government is committed to working toward 
the agreement that will start the process of building open, 
efficient and stable domestic markets.
<P>
	The agreements sought will put in place a framework that will 
lead to dismantling the barriers that have been erected by 
governments since Confederation 127 years ago. It is time to put 
an end to the trade restrictions that we would neither tolerate nor 
impose on international trade. We have for too long divided our 
country into many small restricted segments.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today's <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> outlines the policy on lobbyists 
to be announced tomorrow by the Prime Minister. In its red 
book, the Liberal Party promised to tighten controls on lobbyists 
by implementing the June 1993 recommendations of the House 
of Commons standing committee.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister, on the basis of the information made 
public in this morning's <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, whether we are to 
understand that, in fact, the government policy on lobbyists 
proposes nothing more than a more or less improved status quo.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock we will table the bill and 
answer questions after the bill has been made public.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after all the time we have been waiting to see where the 
government stood on its election campaign promises, we now 
have in a respected newspaper an undisputed report on the 
contents of the policy. We want to question him today on this 
issue.
<P>
	In particular, I want to ask the Prime Minister how he can 
argue that his policy will reinforce controls on lobbyists, when it 
allows them not to disclose their dealings related to government 
contracts or bills and even to hide the identity of the ministers 
they are directly trying to influence.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we had the courtesy to consult the Leader of the Opposition and 
the leader of the Reform Party on this issue; the Government 
House Leader and Mr. Pelletier from my office have met with 
them, told them whom we wanted to appoint as ethics counsellor 
and given them an outline of the bill.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party had the courtesy to respond, 
while the Leader of the Opposition did not even respond to our 
consultations with him.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am a little surprised by the Prime Minister's 
behaviour, when he knows that this meeting only led to a general 
exchange of views without anything specific on the contents of 
the lobbyists bill. Since the Prime Minister is getting ready to 
answer our questions tomorrow, I would like to give him some 
food for thought and ask him if he wants his commitment to

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. Today, the provincial social 
services ministers gathered in Halifax will issue a joint 
statement to warn the Minister of Human Resources 
Development not to make his action plan on programs reform 
public without first consulting them and more importantly, 
without having addressed their concerns. So, the deadlock 
between Ottawa and the provinces persists because, as the Nova 
Scotia Minister of Community Services put it: ``I do not think 
that we have backed down. We will stand very firm. We are not 
wimps.''
<P>
	My question is as follows: Will the Prime Minister recognize 
that this stern warning from the provinces is an indication that 
social programs reform, the only major project initiated by this 
government since coming to power, is stalled because of his 
government's obstinacy in imposing its views on the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the lead minister has consulted on several occasions with the 
ministers in question. In the joint statement released earlier 
today, all the provincial ministers agreed that a Canada-wide 
reform of social programs was required and they invited the 
minister to discuss the process with them. He has done that in 
the past and intends to do so again in the weeks to come. The 
deadlock exists only in the hon. member's mind, because 
consultations are ongoing and these consultations are the reason 
why things are taking longer. Last week, we were criticized for 
not imposing immediately our choice of a solution and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5340"> 5340 </A></B>
<P>
reason for that was simple: we were not through consulting with 
the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> What the provinces 
want, Mr. Speaker, is to be consulted all together, not 
individually and one pitted against the other.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not realize that the provinces have 
taken the legitimate stand that they have because they refuse to 
bear the brunt of a reform that would result in lower federal 
transfer payments and enable Ottawa to off-load once again part 
of its deficit onto them?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the Minister of Finance tabled his budget, he made it quite 
clear that we were not going to reduce transfer payments. This 
was clearly indicated. The provinces were also said to want 
some idea of what the spending would be like over the next two 
or three years, and the Minister of Finance provided them with 
just that, a precise account of the expenditures for this year, next 
year and the year after that. The provinces know exactly what 
funds are currently available, pursuant to the commitment made 
to include in transfer payment arrangements procedures 
allowing for the necessary planning by the provinces. The 
budget is perfectly clear on this issue. I do not understand the 
provincial ministers' concern. In fact, that is what the minister 
will reiterate in the meetings, bilateral or multilateral meetings 
as the case may be, he will be having with the provincial 
ministers.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	On numerous occasions spokespersons for the government 
have referred to the small business sector as the major engine of 
the economy and a major job creator. Yet a recent survey of 
small business conducted by the <I>Financial Post</I> reveals that only 
14 per cent believe that the government's small business 
initiatives will create jobs and 87 per cent believe that the 
government is not representing their interests particularly with 
respect to the deficit.
<P>
	When will the government formally recognize that the only 
thing most small business people want from the federal 
government is for it to get off their backs and out of their 
pockets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly noticed the survey that the leader of the Reform Party 
mentioned. It did indicate, although clearly according to the 
polls that were included in the survey this was not, you might 
say, our natural constituency, we were gaining in support even 
among that constituency in every part of the country, save for 
one province. That indicates that the program the government 
has put in place is winning support among the small business 
community.
<P>
	It might be helpful to the Reform Party to understand that we 
do understand exactly the point that removing burdens from 
small business will help them succeed. That is why in the 
February budget the Minister of Finance announced that we will 
be reducing the payroll tax on unemployment insurance 
premiums. That is a key way to help small business create jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
speaking of burdens then, 70 per cent of the entrepreneurs 
surveyed by Arthur Andersen said that the biggest single 
obstacle they faced was high taxes. The next largest group said 
that their biggest problem was intrusive government legislation 
and regulations. These are the obstacles that small business 
people themselves say prevent them from expanding and 
creating more jobs.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister what new measures the government 
is prepared to take to remove the two greatest government 
created obstacles to job creation in this country which are high 
taxes and red tape.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
over the last few months in the ongoing work in the industry 
committee, which in fact I appeared before yesterday to discuss 
small business issues, we have seen a very co-operative effort 
among members from all three parties with respect to focusing 
on the issues which concern small business.
<P>
	With respect to the level of taxes and the regulatory burden 
together with issues such as access to capital and the ability to 
apply new technologies, there is a co-operative effort under way 
to particularly address the issues that concern small business.
<P>
	It is clear from the studies with respect to the impact of small 
business on the Canadian economy that is where the job creation 
will be. If we can continue to work co-operatively with our 
friends across the floor looking for solutions that address 
particular problems, then we can put together a package 
building on the initiatives the government has already 
announced, building on the promises we made in the red book 
and which we are fulfilling to help that sector create jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a further supplementary to the Prime Minister and to the 
minister.
<P>
	Canadian entrepreneurs say the best thing the government 
could do to promote job creation would be to reduce government 
spending and provide tax relief. According to the Arthur 
Andersen survey 97 per cent of the entrepreneurs surveyed said 
that the government should have cut more deeply in the federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5341"> 5341 </A></B>
<P>
budget and 86 per cent of them did not believe that the 
government is serious about deficit reduction.
<P>
	If the government is serious about reducing the deficit, if it 
wants to send a strong, clear message to these job-creating 
entrepreneurs over the summer, will the Prime Minister commit 
to bringing in a minibudget in the fall which redoubles the 
government's deficit cutting efforts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, having spent a reasonable amount of 
time in that particular sphere to which the leader of the Reform 
Party addresses, I happen to know that the one thing 
entrepreneurs want from their government is a firm commitment 
to their objectives and credibility.
<P>
	They want us to hit our targets. They do not want a panic 
reaction. They do not want minibudgets. They wanted us to 
bring forward a budget that would attain its target. We did that.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Next September, as we promised in the House, we will be 
setting our new economic scenarios as a prelude to the 
consultations for the February budget. Again at that time we will 
give an indication of where we are going. We are on target. We 
are going to hit our target.
<P>
	The only thing I really have to say I will say to the Prime 
Minister. I do not want to wash any dirty linen in public but I 
would disagree with the Minister of Industry. He said that 
according to the survey we are leading in nine out of the 10 
provinces. It is my understanding, Mr. Prime Minister, that we 
are leading in all 10.

connection with the thirtieth summit of the Organization of 
African Unity in Tunis, an immediate cease-fire agreement was 
reportedly concluded between the forces of the provisional 
government in Rwanda and the Rwandan Patriotic Front.
<P>
	This cease-fire would end the massacres in which more than 
half a million people may have been killed, including 60 Tutsi 
children slain yesterday after they were taken from a church 
where they had sought refuge.
<P>
	Does the minister confirm that a cease-fire agreement was 
reached between the belligerents and can he tell us where 
matters stand on this subject?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course we hope that a cease-fire between the parties 
will be respected. Like the hon. member, we already had word 
that a cease-fire had been declared. Unfortunately, subsequent 
information told us that it had already been violated, in fact.
<P>
	So at this time I cannot give more specific information than 
the latest reports that the parties had concluded an agreement 
which would allow a United Nations contingent to come soon to 
help the parties in question observe a cease-fire and restore 
order in that country, which has been particularly affected in 
recent weeks.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East):</B> Mr. Speaker, in view of the 
information which the minister has just given us and which does 
not seem to be complete, I nevertheless ask him if, in case a 
cease-fire is declared, he can tell us if he intends Canada to play 
a role in a United Nations mission in Rwanda and can he also tell 
us if the Canadian government intends to increase its 
humanitarian aid efforts in that country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Yesterday the Fraser Institute announced that tax freedom 
day, the day when Canadians stop working for the government 
and begin working for themselves, will not come until June 23 of 
this year. This is four days later than last year and represents a 
total tax load of 48 per cent compared with 44 per cent last year.
<P>
	Instead of fiddling with the method of taxation, as the 
minister is preparing to do with the GST, when will the 
government eliminate the deficit so that the level of taxation can 
be reduced?
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we fully appreciate the terrible burden 
of taxation that Canadians have had to bear as a result of the 39 
separate tax increases introduced by the previous government. It 
is one of the reasons why in the last budget we did not seek to 
increase taxes but rather sought greater tax equity.
<P>
	I am sure the member opposite understands the absolute 
necessity of building fairness into the tax system. In fact, in the 
last budget we announced certain potential tax decreases. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5342"> 5342 </A></B>
<P>
would never disagree with the Minister of Industry and in his 
previous answer he talked about the reduction in unemployment 
insurance premiums. That is a tax decrease.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the minister for his answer. I address my supplementary 
question to him as well.
<P>
	Recently the International Monetary Fund pointed out the 
connection between persistent deficits, deeper recessions and 
unemployment.
<P>
	Does the minister agree with the IMF when it says that 
deficits cause unemployment and recessions and therefore the 
deficit must be the number one priority if Canada is to 
experience lower unemployment and economic growth?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the relationship between high deficits, 
low productivity and consequent high unemployment is one 
with which no one would disagree.
<P>
	However the reduction of the deficit must come in many 
ways, certainly a reduction of government spending, but at the 
same time an increase in employment. By far the best way is by 
putting Canadians back to work, in addition to cutting spending.
<P>
	I would also say that I agree with the IMF, so ably cited by my 
colleague, when the IMF said that Canada next year would lead 
the industrialized world in job creation, economic growth and 
productivity.

that can be taken to deal with the smuggling of illegal weapons 
into the country.
<P>
	Second, I have written to my provincial and territorial 
counterparts to ask them to see to the enforcement of subsection 
85(1) of the Criminal Code which deals with minimum penalties 
for those who use firearms in the commission of offences.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member as well that we are considering 
changes to that section to make the consequences for the 
criminal misuse of firearms more severe. At the same time, 
through consultations with caucus and in taking into account all 
perspectives on the issue, we are going to come forward in the 
fall of this year with proposals to strengthen the regulation of 
firearms in the country, balancing always the need for safety in 
our community with the interests of those who have legitimate 
uses for rifles in hunting and on the farms.

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. The 
commissioner of the coast guard has stated the annual savings 
associated with destaffing lighthouse stations on the west coast 
is $7 million.
<P>
	On June 2, in an appearance before the Senate transport 
committee hearings, officials stated the total costs of servicing 
B.C. light stations at $3.4 million for salaries, operating, 
maintenance and direct costs.
<P>
	How can the minister achieve $7 million in savings by cutting 
a portion of a $3.4 million program that would need major 
capital spending to implement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I do not think the question of destaffing lighthouses should only 
be dealt with on the basis of exact and specific savings. It goes 
far beyond that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> The question is coming from a party that is 
always looking for savings but does not want to listen to how we 
can achieve it.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	We are saying that the technology available in Canada and 
around the world has resulted in the automation of this kind of 
facility in many countries. In the United States there is one 
lighthouse left; it is a historic one at Boston. In Australia and in 
the United Kingdom there has been destaffing of lighthouses. In 
the maritime provinces of Canada we have destaffed 
lighthouses.
<P>
	We understand the impact of that action on the people, the 
men and women who have worked in this traditional activity for 
many years.
<P>
	The Department of Transport has a fiduciary responsibility 
for the safety and security of those who use the sea as a means of 
navigation. We will are going to that obligation. We are going to 
make sure that the Canadian sea navigation system is as good as 
any in the world. Unfortunately, as we move into the 21st 
century, some of the practices of the past will have to be 
changed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a supplementary question.
<P>
	The local population knows the value of these lighthouse 
keepers to public safety. Lighthouse keepers are designated as 
an essential service. In making this designation the federal 
government has explicitly recognized the crucial role lighthouse 
keepers play in marine safety.
<P>
	Could the minister explain how the government on one hand 
declares lighthouse keepers an essential service and on the other 
hand announces an intention to eliminate them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians understand that the lighthouse system, the 
navigational aid systems that have existed in Canada were based 
on systems that came in from Europe.
<P>
	For example, the United Kingdom by 1997 will have 
completely destaffed its lighthouses. Australia and other 
seafaring nations around the world have understood the need for 
change. We recognize how important it is to the people who are 
directly affected.
<P>
	If the hon. member is asking whether we are concerned about 
the impact on the human beings who are going to have their lives 
disrupted, lose their jobs or be shifted into other occupations, 
the answer is yes. Our responsibility is to deliver modern 
technological navigational aids to Canadians and those who use 
the sea. That is what we are going to do.
<P>
	It would be far more useful if hon. members opposite, who are 
always looking at ways to try to improve the efficiency of 
services provided by Transport Canada at a reasonable price, 
would support us rather than play petty politics.

The company's top management, including the president, are all 
from Quebec and live in Montreal. Astral employs more than 
800 Quebecers and, thanks to federal assistance, it is investing 
$17 million in a technical centre on Sainte-Catherine street. 
That is the type of company that the hon. member from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata judges not to be concerned with 
Quebec's interests.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last Wednesday, the Minister of Natural Resources 
indicated that a major international public relations campaign 
was needed to convince foreign buyers that British Columbia's 
forestry practices were consistent with the imperatives of 
sustainable development.
<P>
	Yet, when they testified before the natural resources 
committee, Canada's ambassadors to the European Union as 
well as to the Federal Republic of Germany stated that the 
companies involved were not doing what they could to defend 
their own interests on the international market.
<P>

she agree with the views expressed by these two ambassadors

kind.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Secretary of State for the Status of Women 
supports special interest groups that discriminate if she thinks 
that they are in the interest of society. It is clear the government 
will only fight discrimination when it favours its policy.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister explain exactly what criteria the 
government uses when it decides to discriminate or not to 
discriminate?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course I listened carefully to the observations made 
yesterday by the Secretary of State Responsible for the Status of

After verifying my sources, I wish to inform the House that the

<P>
	Obviously, the minister was no more aware than I was that

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to 
rise in the House to advise fellow parliamentarians of the 
signing of the second international protocol on sulphur dioxide 
emissions. Canada signed this new United Nations agreement in 
Oslo, Norway yesterday. It is a major step forward in the 
ongoing battle against acid rain.
<P>
	The first international agreement on sulphur dioxide was the 
1985 Helsinki protocol. Under that agreement Canada pledged 
to reduce its sulphur dioxide emissions by 30 per cent starting in 
1993. Thanks to excellent co-operation by the provinces, 
environmental groups, consumers and industry, Canada has met 
its commitment. Our sulphur dioxide emissions have now fallen 
below the 3.2 million tonne limit set for Canada in the 
agreement. By the end of the year emissions in eastern Canada 
will have been reduced by more than 40 per cent from 1980 
levels. That is a success story.
<P>
	The 1985 Helsinki protocol set the foundation for the 
Canada-United States air quality agreement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that sometimes, very complex 
international agreements can make a difference and do make a 
difference. Canada wants to remain a leader in acid rain control 
and that is why we signed a new protocol in Oslo yesterday.
<P>
	This international agreement was signed following extensive 
consultations with the territories and the provinces.
<P>
	I am very pleased to report that the international negotiators 
have adopted an important concept developed by Canadian 
scientists from Environment Canada. This new concept which 
was adopted in Norway is that of critical levels.
<P>
	What this means in simple terms is that beyond a certain level, 
sulphur dioxide emissions become harmful to the environment. 
This level can vary from one part of the globe to another and, 
within a country, from one region to the next.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is important that we are now moving to set sulphur dioxide 
emission levels based on science and regional targets within 
countries rather than just national limits. This allows Canada 
and other countries to direct their efforts to where the real 
problems exist. We believe that the provisions of the Helsinki 
agreement will lead to improving the effects of reduction of acid 
rain in the areas of Canada where the problem lies, namely in the 
seven eastern provinces of our country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5348"> 5348 </A></B>
<P>
	However, the Helsinki protocol, good as it was, will not end 
acid rain in the long run in about 10 per cent of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada has accepted to set a ceiling on emissions in that part 
of the country which requires a longer term commitment. We are 
therefore creating within Canada a sulphur dioxide management 
area, with specific goals attached to it, which take us well into 
the 21st century. In the long term, we want to bring sulphur 
dioxide emissions in the southeastern part of Canada down to an 
environmentally benign level. We will focus on the area most 
affected, that is to say the area south of a line going from the 
St-Lawrence estuary to the bottom of James Bay and on to the 
northern part of Lake Superior.
<P>
	This new area will include southern Ontario, the southern part 
of Quebec as well as all of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
Prince Edward Island, the latter provinces being really seriously 
affected.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our target for this area is sulphur dioxide emissions below 
1.75 million tonnes beginning in the year 2000. This is an 
important breakthrough in international negotiations. The 
problem was that the national levels were arbitrary, particularly 
for a country as large as Canada.
<P>
	Our environmental problems are not the same in every part of 
the country and this new agreement recognizes that. The new 
Oslo protocol also sets tough new standards for reporting and 
compliance by countries. This agreement is a major step 
forward but it is not the total answer to the entire acid rain 
puzzle.
<P>
	The United States has not yet agreed to sign the protocol. The 
Government of Canada believes and hopes that this new 
agreement will act as an impetus to the United States just as the 
previous protocol opened the way to our bilateral treaty on air 
quality.
<P>
	Indeed, I have scheduled meetings next month in Washington 
with the director of the Environmental Protection Agency in 
which we will be discussing very specific air quality issues like 
carbon dioxide emissions and in particular sulphur dioxide 
emissions to look at what bilateral actions we can take, not at the 
exclusion of multilateral activity but to complement it.
<P>
	We have set new long term limits for the region of our country 
that produces sulphur dioxide flowing into Canada and the 
United States. We want the United States to take reciprocal 
action to reduce its sulphur dioxide flowing into Canada.
<P>
	If there is one thing Canadians are unanimous about, it is that 
our country must take a leadership role on the problem of acid 
rain and the problem of air quality generally. By signing the 
Oslo protocol, we are continuing to do so.
<P>
	May I conclude by saying that Canada's representative at the 
signing ceremony was appropriately the hon. member for 
Davenport who serves as the chairman of the Standing 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. 
Anyone who knows the hon. member will know that he was one 
of the first Canadians to wear the pin which was so strongly 
identified with the coalition on acid rain activity that actually 
led to the first international agreement.
<P>
	He has pushed longer and harder than any other member of 
Parliament for control on sulphur dioxide emissions. By 
identifying our problem area and agreeing to long term emission 
limits for our region, Canada is accepting its responsibility to 
protect our lakes, maple sugar producing trees, wildlife, fish, 
buildings, forests and above all, its citizens from the dangers of 
acid rain.
<P>
	We will continue to work with concerned Canadians and 
provincial governments in the ongoing development of the 
national strategy on air issues. There are no overnight solutions 
but there are some solutions. I think on this file we have found 
some real solutions that have improved the situation and will 
continue to do so.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
Official Opposition critic on the environment, I want to salute 
the federal government's initiative in signing yesterday in Oslo 
the new UN protocol on sulphur dioxide emissions.
<P>
	The new international agreement sets for the first time 
emission quotas for each country based on nature's resistance 
capacity in each of the signatory countries.
<P>
	The approach used in the protocol shows once again that 
countries, peoples and regions facing the same problem must 
sometimes apply different solutions taking into account their 
environment and social characteristics. It goes without saying 
that this is in line with the aspirations of Quebecers, who believe 
that the Quebec government should have all the powers of a 
sovereign state while co-operating with its neighbours on 
international issues.
<P>
	The signatory countries have different goals to reach in the 
coming years. I would like to give you a few examples. Germany 
plans on reducing its sulphur emissions by 87 per cent compared 
with the 1980 levels by the year 2005, by renovating the obsolete 
factories and thermal power plants of the former East Germany.
<P>
	Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Austria will join in this effort 
by reducing their emissions by 80 per cent by the end of the 
century.
<P>
	Greece and Portugal will only have to reduce their emissions 
by 3 to 4 per cent because their soil is rich in limestone, which 
neutralizes the acidity of sulphur dioxide naturally. This 
approach is more interesting than that of the 1985 Helsinki 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5349"> 5349 </A></B>
<P>
Protocol, under which the  signatory countries had to cut their 
sulphur emissions by 30 per cent compared to the 1980 levels by 
this year.
<P>
	Canada, for its part, must create a sulphur dioxide 
management zone including the Atlantic provinces, southern 
Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	It goes without saying that all the initiatives affecting this 
management zone will first have to be approved by the 
provincial governments concerned. With respect to the sharing 
of environmental responsibilities, we know that the initiatives 
against acid rain in Canada are put forward by the provinces, 
which pass regulations by negotiating voluntary agreements 
with polluters.
<P>
	The federal government, for its part, tries to reduce the acid 
pollutants that make their way into Canada, from the United 
States for instance.
<P>
	Problems such as acid rain call for the co-operation of all 
stakeholders. Sulphur dioxide is a colourless and very odorous 
gas. It comes mainly from oil and gas processing, mineral 
smelting, and coal and heavy oil combustion. Each day, the 
chimneys of our incinerators spit out tons and tons of this gas 
into our atmosphere.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Many reports have been made on the very harmful effects of 
acid rain, especially on forests and particularly Quebec's maple 
trees, as well as the problems for human health that can in many 
cases lead to increased sensitivity among those who suffer from 
asthma and bronchitis and make breathing more difficult for 
some people. We must also mention the deterioration of green 
spaces and the damage done to very valuable cultural artifacts.
<P>
	I think that there is a very serious problem with the Oslo 
Protocol: the United States did not sign it. You know as well as I 
do that the United States is a huge consumer, and whoever 
consumes produces waste. As Lavoisier said so well, in nature, 
nothing is created and nothing is lost. And, as if by some 
unfortunate chance, warm winds from the United States blow 
regularly towards Quebec.
<P>
	I seriously wonder how come the Minister of the Environment 
was unable to convince our powerful neighbour to sign this Oslo 
agreement. She just said that she will go to Washington next 
month, so I hope that she will return with good news for Quebec 
because you understand as I do that the acid rain we have does 
not come only from Quebec smokestacks. Most of it comes from 
Ontario or the United States.
<P>
	Clearly, for Canada this means that the scope and 
effectiveness of the protocol will be less. Indeed, it is essential 
to co-ordinate action on both sides of the border.
<P>
	According to the 1992 report of the Sub-Committee on Acid 
Rain of the Standing Committee on the Environment, although a 
unilateral Canadian program to fight emissions that cause acid 
rain is morally or politically defensible, any permanent solution 
must include the United States. That is why we support the  
environment minister's efforts, which coincide with Quebec's 
interests, in her talks with the American authorities about acid 
rain.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is proud of this Oslo convention but we 
also have high hopes for the environment minister's visit to 
Washington next month.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too would 
like to salute the minister on the signing of this agreement. 
Clearly, as she said in her statement, if there is one thing that 
Canadians are unanimous about it is that our country must take a 
leadership role in the problem of acid rain.
<P>
	At the same time I would like to make special mention as she 
did of the hon. member for Davenport. He has been a thorn in the 
side of people who have been satisfied with the status quo. I 
would like to commend him for his efforts, particularly on this 
issue.
<P>
	The minister stated it is important that we are now moving to 
set sulphur dioxide emission levels based on science and upon 
regional targets within countries rather than just national limits. 
This is particularly important.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	What she is stating as I understand it in plain English is that 
the standards are going to be based on science. Very frequently 
in environmental issues we have the problem of emotion; if it 
looks bad it must be bad, if it smells bad it must be bad. This is 
very bad science and so again I commend the minister and the 
department on the fact that the standards are going to be based 
on science.
<P>
	I also reflect the comments made by the member from the 
Bloc and underscore the fact that the United States has not 
signed the protocol. I underscore that fact primarily from the 
point of view of competitiveness. Surely as human beings, as 
Canadians and as Americans, we must have an awareness-we 
do have an awareness-a consciousness of the fact that we can 
no longer continue with the old ways where we end up with 
trees, forests, indeed streams and rivers being polluted or dying. 
We cannot continue with that and surely Canada is taking a 
leadership role.
<P>
	However, the fact that the United States has not signed the 
protocol I believe is a major problem from the point of view of 
Canadian competitiveness. We have to be very conscious and I 
would encourage the minister in her discussions with the United 
States envoys and the negotiators to make sure that Canadian 
business interests are protected because if not these are our jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5350"> 5350 </A></B>
<P>
	At the conclusion of the minister's statement she said we will 
continue to work with concerned Canadians and provincial 
governments in the ongoing development of a national strategy 
on acid rain.
<P>
	Two items continuing with the thought that we will continue 
to work with concerned Canadians, we have to make sure that 
among the stakeholders whose point of view is being considered 
that businesses are deeply and heavily involved in the process, 
they are fully consulted and that the impact this has the potential 
of having on our competitive Canadian position, business wise, 
is fully taken into account.
<P>
	She mentioned the fact that there will be further consultation 
and an involvement of the provincial governments.
<P>
	For exactly the same reason we can have within Canada 
duplication of standards based on very well-meaning laws and 
rules and regulations and legislation that may be brought before 
this House or provincial legislatures and by the very fact that 
there is duplication, again we end up putting an extra burden on 
the businesses in Canada.
<P>
	I do not stand here speaking for business for the sake of 
business. I stand here speaking for business because it is 
business that employs Canadians. It is business that generates 
real wealth, that can be taxed. It is business that drives the 
finances of our nation and when we forget that we stray an awful 
long way from the reality that we must be careful that we are not 
killing the goose that is laying the golden egg with a very 
benevolent attitude toward these concerns.
<P>
	The minister concludes there are no overnight solutions but 
there are solutions and again I commend the minister, the 
department, on the signing of this accord and I do believe it is a 
major step in the direction of reducing sulphur dioxide 
emissions to a reasonable and responsible level.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley)</B> 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-260, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (replica firearms, theft, import or unlawful sale 
of firearms).
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for 
Yorkton-Melville for seconding my private member's bill.
<P>
	There has been a great deal of concern expressed in the House, 
in the media and by ordinary Canadians about the criminal use 
of firearms. There is only one effective way to combat the 
criminal use of firearms and that is to go after the criminals who 
use them.
<P>
	I was pleased to hear in the House today that the Minister of 
Justice is considering changes to the Criminal Code to deal with 
this issue. I would suggest that this private member's bill gives 
the government the option of dealing with the matter 
immediately.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to amend section 85 of the Criminal 
Code. The bill would remove the difficult onus on the crown of 
having to prove that the object used in the commission of a 
criminal offence meets the legal definition of a firearm. This is 
accomplished by adding replica firearms to the section. In 
addition, the minimum sentence for a first offence is increased 
from one year to five years and for subsequent offences the 
minimum is increased from three years to ten years.
<P>
	This bill also creates two new offences. The first is theft of a 
firearm, which will carry a minimum sentence of three years. 
The second new offence is the unlawful importation of a firearm 
for the purpose of using it in the commission of a criminal 
offence or to be illegally sold. This offence will also carry a 
minimum sentence of three years.
<P>
	The last part of this bill would go after those individuals who 
sell firearms illegally. They will now be deemed to be a party to 
any offence that the buyer commits with that illegally purchased 
firearm.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	The bill sends a clear message to criminals. If they use a 
firearm in their criminal activity they are going to go to jail for a 
long time.
<P>
	If the House is serious about going after the criminal use of 
firearms, let us put the right target in our sight; the criminal who 
uses firearms.

	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (for the Minister of Transport)</B> 
moved that Bill C-22, an act respecting certain agreements

2 at Lester B. Pearson International Airport, be read the third 
time and passed.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>

<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak at the third 
and final reading stage of this most important bill. This bill is an 
act respecting certain agreements for the redevelopment and 
operation of Terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. Pearson International 
Airport. In layman's terms that means it is the bill to formally 
cancel the agreement which was entered into by the former 
government. This issue has been debated at length in this House 
and in committee.
<P>
	This bill reflects another election commitment made by this 
government. During the course of the election, our leader who 
was the Leader of the Opposition at the time, gave notice that 
after the election the agreement would be reviewed by the 
incoming new government.
<P>
	True to his and this government's word, upon election of the 
Liberal government we had Mr. Nixon review the agreement to 
ensure that the public interest was being served. His conclusions 
and recommendations which formed part and parcel of the 
Minister of Transport's recommendation has resulted in this 
bill.
<P>
	To make it clear to everyone, including the opposition parties, 
the bill effectively and formally cancels the agreement. Both 
opposition parties agree with the government that the agreement 
should be cancelled. There is unanimity in this House with 
regard to its cancellation. There seems to be no dispute 
whatsoever as to whether or not this agreement needed to be 
cancelled. I am happy to thank both opposition parties for 
supporting this legislation.
<P>
	Having said that, the opposition parties have given their 
qualified approval but have voted against the bill at report stage. 
They will probably also vote against it tonight because in their 
opinion they have serious reservations with regard to the bill. 
Therefore, it is only appropriate for me to take the opportunity 
to try to answer the questions put by both opposition parties and 
the improvements which in their minds need to be done to this 
bill.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois throughout the course of debate on this 
bill seems to be fixated with putting blame, or finding out where 
the blame lies. The government side understands that is 
important and essentially that is why we introduced the bill to 
cancel the agreement. We knew the agreement was flawed in its 
process and its substance. The process was questionable not in 
legal terms but in terms of the role of the lobbyists in putting 
together such an agreement.
<P>
	Bloc Quebecois members have insisted that a public inquiry 
by a royal commission was needed to find out who was to blame 
for putting this agreement together in the first place. We could 
go on a wild goose chase to find out who was to blame. At the 
end of the day however even after a public inquiry by a royal 
commission, legislation would still have to be put in place to 
effectively and formally cancel the agreement, not to  mention 
the millions of dollars and the time that would be wasted in such 
an exercise.
<P>
	The Canadian people themselves gave a verdict to the people 
involved in that deal, namely the former Conservative 
government. The agreement was signed two weeks before the 
election, after being given notice by the present right hon. Prime 
Minister not to do so but to wait for the new government to 
review it. Despite that warning, the former Conservative 
government signed the deal. We know what happened to that 
government. Public opinion was that what had occurred was not 
in keeping with what was perceived as good government 
practices. Hence, that government was defeated. There were 
many other reasons for that but I suggest this agreement was part 
and parcel of it too.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the other parties that signed this agreement, 
the testimony at committee hearings and Mr. Nixon's report 
makes it clear that while we may not have liked the process and 
we might question the roles of the government, the partnerships 
and the lobbyists, the fact remains that an agreement was signed 
legally and formally by another government and another party.
<P>
	During the hearings this government and its members did not 
stand in the way of asking for witnesses to come before the 
Standing Committee of Transport to question the people who 
were directly involved. I heard someone mention yesterday that 
perhaps all the parties did not avail themselves of that 
opportunity. That is perfectly true.
<P>
	The solicitor from the Pearson Development Corporation was 
there. The Paxport people were there, including Mr. Don 
Matthews. The former president of Paxport was there, Mr. 
Hession, and a number of other witnesses. However, a number of 
witnesses, including former government members and 
lobbyists, indicated they could not or would not appear before 
the committee. That is regrettable because the government and 
the people of Canada deserve to know all the facts. We would 
have wanted that, but that did not occur.
<P>
	There was some mention of putting subpoenas before 
witnesses as suggested by the Bloc. As worthy as that might 
seem however, that process was fraught with peril in terms of 
time and of whether or not we would ever get to the bottom of the 
story.
<P>
	One fact is clear: The government, the opposition parties and 
the Canadian people agree that this deal should be cancelled. So 
what would be accomplished by going on a so-called witch hunt 
to look for that person who may or may not have done something 
right or wrong? Mr. Nixon said that nothing illegal occurred, 
that in fact, as we have all agreed, the process and the substance 
was flawed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5355"> 5355 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill has essentially tried to do a number of things. First 
and foremost however it was necessary to cancel the deal 
formally because there was no cancellation provision in the 
contract. The government needed to do that formally.
<P>
	Second, the bill outlines what can or should be paid to the 
parties to this agreement. The bill does provide guidance and 
restrictions to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	This government has said it does not believe that the process 
was as it should be and that lobbyists played a very big part, 
perhaps too big. In the next day or two the Minister of Industry 
and the parliamentary secretary will introduce changes to the 
lobbyists act to ensure that the rules are clear to everyone as to 
what lobbyists can and cannot do with government or members 
of Parliament. It will put in place a code of ethics among other 
things.
<P>
	However, the purpose of Bill C-22 is not to debate or discuss 
the role of lobbyists. That is a bigger issue which will come 
later. The bill does say the government will not pay one cent in 
lobbyists' fees. We will not pay one penny toward lobbyists' 
costs.
<P>
	The bill also says we will not pay for the lost profits or lost 
opportunities that Pearson Development Corporation or the 
limited partnership might think that in cancelling the agreement 
they are entitled to.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	This government has said clearly no lost opportunity, no lost 
profit. The only thing that we think this government will pay and 
should pay is legitimate out of pocket expenses that can be 
justified, that in fact show value for work received because there 
are a number of third party claimants that are part of the whole 
apparatus. They are to a certain extent innocent parties to an 
agreement, parties which might have done some architectural 
work, engineering work or other legitimate work which was 
invoiced to the partnership. The government is prepared to 
consider those invoices and to meticulously look at them to 
ensure that in fact they are legitimate, that they were for the 
purposes of Pearson airport and not for something else.
<P>
	We have a negotiator presently looking at each and every one 
of those invoices. Some 60 volumes of paper need to be gone 
through to ensure that, as the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Transport said, the government does not pay a penny more than 
what needs to be paid. We want to ensure that our process can 
withstand the scrutiny of the public, the opposition and the 
Auditor General.
<P>
	We want to make sure that the cabinet by order in council only 
pays those invoices that are in fact legitimate. That is the 
process. There is a negotiator and that is what is happening now.
<P>
	The Reform Party has had some problems with respect to the 
question of transparency. What is it that we are paying? Who 
should decide what should be paid? It was suggested that the 
parliamentary committee on transport look at those invoices and 
make recommendations to the minister and in fact have a 
hearing on what invoices should be paid. Those are legitimate 
questions.
<P>
	The minister and I and others have stated that the system, the 
bill, the process within this House of Commons and government 
operations are transparent. Before even one cent is paid the 
Auditor General will obviously be very interested in this.
<P>
	There is a public accounts committee of this House of 
Commons, chaired by the opposition that can ask for all the 
documents to be brought forward. There is the accountability of 
government. The cabinet is accountable to the people of Canada 
for making those kinds of decisions. There is an apparatus in 
place to ensure that the process is transparent, that 
accountability is clearly to the government.
<P>
	The minister indicated, and I think we passed an amendment 
by the Bloc at committee, that he will table with this House all 
the documents that he can table respecting freedom of access to 
information and guidelines and rules as to what can and cannot 
be made public. There was a commitment made to this House 
that would take place.
<P>
	The bill says, yes, we might pay something, but you will have 
to prove to us that each and every invoice is legitimate. One 
must take this bill in its context. This is a very unique bill, 
unheard of really in terms of Canadian history, where a 
government would move so boldly as to cancel an agreement 
and say no loss of profit and no lobbyist fees. It says something 
much more important.
<P>
	It says that we need to get on with managing the future of 
Pearson because it is an important transportation hub in this 
country. It is a nationally significant airport that impacts the 
west, the east, Quebec and Ontario. We need to get on with 
planning the future of Pearson. This bill is absolutely necessary 
for us to do that. We cannot plan its future unless we formally 
cancel the agreement and deal with this matter once and for all.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	The bill also says that if there is no successful completion to 
negotiations, 30 days after proclamation of the bill there shall be 
no payments at all. That is a pretty strong stick for this 
government to use to try and bring all the parties at the table to a 
reasonable completion to the negotiations. That is an important 
aspect to this bill because we cannot and I am sure the 
opposition parties would not want us to continue to carry on 
fruitless negotiations. This bill does put in place a sunset 
provision that says 30 days after proclamation, if there is not a 
negotiated settlement there shall not be one penny paid.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5356"> 5356 </A></B>
<P>
	It also protects the government against lawsuits. We cannot 
take it to the courts because we believe we need to get moving on 
it.
<P>
	I know that the debate will continue somewhat today and that 
both opposition parties will try to make their case again for more 
transparency, more accountability. The Bloc will suggest that 
we cannot deal with this bill because we do not really know the 
true facts about what happened behind those closed doors. That 
is true and it is regrettable but we have to deal with reality. The 
reality is that we need to get on with planning Pearson's future, 
dealing with the bill. There will be other opportunities to discuss 
the influence of lobbyists and so on and that will come in a 
subsequent bill.
<P>
	I want to touch base on a couple of points that I think are 
absolutely necessary. Talking about expediency, when the bill 
moves to the Senate where it will go through a similar process, 
we hope that the Senate will respect and move expeditiously in 
passing this bill. It is in the best interests of the country to do so 
in order that the government can get on with planning for the 
future of Pearson and assisting the travelling public as much as 
possible.
<P>
	We believe that this is a very unique bill in Canadian history 
because of some very unique circumstances. Hopefully they will 
never occur again.
<P>
	I believe we all will have learned from this process what 
governments can and should do prior to an election, especially 
on nationally significant issues. Perhaps decisions do not have 
to be made in the last minutes before the end of a government's 
mandate, especially on an issue that captured the attention of 
this House some one and a half years before the election. Our 
party spoke very often and very forcefully to the government, 
raising concerns about the process and as to whether we ought to 
divest ourselves of a nationally significant piece of property 
which serves millions of travelling Canadians as well as people 
visiting this country.
<P>
	I know how frustrated we were. The Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Industry will tell you that we were very 
frustrated because we had no opportunity to discuss whether or 
not the concept of privatization of Pearson should even proceed. 
We were not given the opportunity. It was done in a very 
heavy-handed way by a former government. It paid the price for 
those kinds of actions that Canadians saw as being very cynical 
and having caused an awful lot of problems for politicians in 
general as well as the House of Commons with regard to its 
credibility and integrity.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois wants to accuse us of essentially doing 
the same thing as the former government. Heaven forbid. The 
fact is that we are cancelling this contract. We will not pay 
compensation to lobbyists for profit. We will only pay invoices 
that are legitimate. They will perhaps say there are some 
Liberals somewhere in there that we are trying to protect.
<P>
	This government before, during and after the election and up 
until now has made one commitment to the Canadian people. It 
did not fudge, hedge, or anything else.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill does cancel the agreement totally. The only thing left 
is to decide if there is any compensation to be given to the other 
party that signed that agreement.
<P>
	I would hope that the opposition parties, as I said at the 
beginning of my remarks, support the government in cancelling 
this agreement and also recognize that no bill is ever perfect.
<P>
	We agree that amendments sometimes are made. In fact the 
committee did report an amendment and the government side 
supported it. We agree. Yes, there were amendments put 
yesterday by both opposition parties. I tried to tell the 
opposition parties that transparency and accountability are built 
into the bill as well as built into the system.
<P>
	Yes, we are all mistrusting of the system. We have been here 
only seven or eight months on the government side. We will 
have to show members and restore everyone's faith in the 
system. There are checks and balances in the system to ensure 
that only those invoices that need to be paid shall be paid and we 
will, as a government, be subject to the court of public opinion.
<P>
	I am not sure that the public wants us to write a cheque to rid 
ourselves of this problem. Of course not. The minister and the 
Prime Minister have said that we will not pay a penny more than 
we have to. It was a legally signed agreement. As repugnant as it 
was that a former government should even do it two weeks 
before an election, it did it. That government did it.
<P>
	Therefore we have obligations. When a government does 
what it is doing today by this bill, it has to consider its impact on 
future contracts, on the international reputation that we have as 
to whether or not a government can be trusted that once it enters 
into an agreement, it will in fact fulfil its contractual 
obligations. That is a worry and members should understand 
that.
<P>
	That is why it allows the discretion in the bill to pay for the 
legitimate expenses. I hope as we wrap up debate on this issue 
that the opposition parties will understand that this government 
wants to get on with planning the future of Pearson airport and 
the aviation industry in this country.
<P>
	The only way we can do that is to finally put this agreement 
behind us and get on with completing the negotiations. In fact, if 
the negotiations are not completed and this bill is proclaimed 30 
days thereafter there shall be no compensation.
<P>
	We hope that our friends in the other place, the Senate, do not 
play any games with this bill and the public interest is best 
served. We hope it expedites this bill as quickly as possible so 
that we can get on with again planning the future of Pearson.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand 
before you today somewhat disappointed, but not beaten. On 
Tuesday, June 14, this House adopted the report of the Transport 
Committee, despite the amendments proposed, warnings given 
and negative vote entered by the Official Opposition and the 
third party. Yet the amendments we presented would, we hoped, 
have enlightened our colleagues on the compensation which the 
government intends to give to the former directors of Pearson 
Airport, namely the Pearson Development Corporation.
<P>
	I was very disappointed to see and hear the Chairman of the 
Transport Committee tell this House yesterday that he did not 
intend to spend a million dollars to call witnesses who, in one 
way or another, would repeat what we already know. He also 
mentioned that even if witnesses were called, the result would 
be minimal because the process is too cumbersome and it simply 
would not be worthwhile. He informed us that the last time 
witnesses were subpoenaed was in 1913, when the matter had to 
be taken to the House and the Sergeant-at-Arms was sent to get 
the witness. The outcome was that the person wound up in jail. 
This is not what we are requesting. What we are asking for is the 
application of quite recent precedents, one of which was set on 
Tuesday, August 20, 1991, before the finance committee, where 
the following motion was introduced. I will read it in the 
language of Shakespeare so that everyone can understand:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On a motion by René Soetens, it was ordered, that-Diane Woodruff, from 
Price Waterhouse, Frank Kolhatkar and James Goodfellow, from Deloitte &amp; 
Touche, be summoned and required to appear before the Committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another precedent was set on Monday, October 21, 1991, 
when the hon. member for Windsor, the current Government 
House Leader, who was in opposition at the time moved:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Anwar Khan be summoned to appear before the Committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After debate, the question being put on the motion it was by a show of hands, 
agreed to: YEAS: 3; NAYS: 2.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The motion was agreed to. More recently, on Tuesday, 
December 8, 1992, the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs agreed to summon the Minister of 
National Defence to appear before the committee on February 2 
to discuss the Auditor General's 1992 annual report.
<P>
	I wanted to set the record straight and I can tell you that both 
the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport 
and the chairman of the transport committee were aware of these 
facts yesterday because I had made the same presentation in 
committee. The chairman of the transport committee and the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport refuse to 
spend $1 million to make the truth known to Canadians.
<P>
	At the same time, their party is considering paying as much as 
$250 million perhaps to friends of the two older parties -the 
Liberal and the Conservative Party- although we do not even 
know yet if we should pay a single penny in compensation or if 
Pearson Development Corporation should not be reimbursing 
the government instead.
<P>
	Also, my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport in this Liberal government, has no qualms 
paying the bills Pearson Development Corporation may submit, 
because, as he indicated: ``The Auditor General has a job to do 
and he will report any irregularity in the bills paid by the 
government.'' Let us not forget that, as is always the case with 
reports from the Auditor General, observations are made after 
the fact.
<P>
	That is why we in the Official Opposition, wanting to prevent 
such occurrences and ensure that the taxes of Canadians and 
Quebecers are used wisely, have reacted. We proposed that a 
commission of enquiry be established to uncover the truth. That 
is not serious.
<P>
	I trust the Auditor General and his recommendations but I am 
not confident that the current government will take them into 
account and recover the amounts actually spent, even if it was 
recommended by the Auditor General. If this government is 
really serious, it should read the Auditor General's latest report 
and make the requested corrections immediately. We may then 
believe that it is possible to act first and then to make the 
recommended corrections.
<P>
	Yet some members of the transport committee such as my 
colleague from the Reform Party asked only for incremental 
measures, a certain openness and a transparency that the 
Canadian people want to see right away. Liberal members do not 
seem interested in seeing again Tory ghosts like Otto Jelinek, as 
my colleague, the hon. member for Hamilton West, stated in 
response to my speech on June 13.
<P>
	I am not interested either in seeing these ghosts again. In any 
case, we only have to look at how often the current leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party and hon. member for 
Sherbrooke sits in this House to be convinced that if we saw him, 
we would have the impression of seeing a ghost. That is true, but 
I would like to compel them to come before the transport 
committee to shed light on the previous government's actions in 
awarding the Pearson Airport privatization contract.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="5358"> 5358 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	We are now at third reading and I am trying one last time to 
inform my colleagues properly on the history of the Pearson 
Airport privatization. Together let us look at some important 
dates.
<P>
	On April 8, 1987, the government published its policy on 
airport management in Canada and recommended that airports 
be operated by local authorities. On June 22, 1987, the 
Government of Canada designated Airport Development 
Corporation, Claridge, to build and operate terminal 3 at 
Pearson.
<P>
	In September 1989, Paxport presented a proposal to privatize 
terminals 1 and 2 which was rejected by the government. On 
October 17, 1990, the government invited the private sector to 
help modernize terminals 1 and 2. No details were provided at 
that time.
<P>
	On February 21, 1991, terminal 3 began operations under 
Claridge Holdings Incorporated. On March 11, 1992, the 
government officially called for proposals to privatize terminals 
1 and 2 at Pearson. A single sentence, no prequalification.
<P>
	Early June 1992, bidding closed. Two bids were received: one 
from Paxport, the other from Claridge.
<P>
	On December 7, 1992, Paxport's proposal was selected; it had 
until February 15 to show that its proposal was financially 
viable. This condition was not met.
<P>
	On February 1, 1993, Paxport and Claridge merged in the 
T1T2 Limited Partnership. From February to May 1993, the 
financial viability of the project and Air Canada's lease were 
discussed.
<P>
	In May 1993, official negotiations began and Claridge took 
control of the T1T2 Limited Partnership. On June 18, 1993, a 
memorandum of agreement was signed on the privatization of 
terminals 1 and 2. On August 30, 1993, the Minister of Transport 
announced a general agreement between the two parties and 
promised a final agreement would be signed in the fall.
<P>
	On September 8, 1993, the Government of Canada called an 
election. On October 7, 1993, the legal agreement on privatizing 
terminals 1 and 2 was signed. On October 25, 1993, the federal 
election was held. On November 29, 1993, the Nixon report was 
published, and on December 3, 1993, the Prime Minister 
announced the cancellation of the agreement to privatize the 
airport.
<P>
	Before the final signature, the leader of the Liberal Party of 
Canada and present Prime Minister warned the parties that he 
would not hesitate to cancel this agreement. Following that 
statement, the chief negotiator asked for written instructions to 
proceed to the signing of the contract. The then-Prime Minister 
requested specifically that the transaction be completed that 
same day. Mr. Nixon found in his report that the lobbyists' role 
in this matter went beyond the usual normal bounds. In fact, 
lobbyists were directly responsible for the  reassignment of 
several senior public servants and the request from some others 
to be replaced.
<P>
	The 90-day call for tenders was surprisingly short, and it was 
impossible for groups other than those already involved in the 
administration of the airport, such as Claridge and Paxport, to 
submit a valid bid. This explains why only two bids were 
received. Paxport had previously submitted a privatization plan 
in 1989, and Claridge was already operating terminal 3.
<P>
	It is surprising that no prior financial analysis was required in 
this proposal. It is not usual democratic practice to sign a 
transaction of this magnitude during an election campaign, 
thereby binding the soon-to-be-elected government to a policy 
established by the previous government.
<P>
	From a financial standpoint, as previously mentioned, 
Pearson is the only profitable airport in Canada. The agreement 
prohibits Transport Canada from making investments that might 
have a detrimental effect on Pearson's traffic in any airport 
within a 75-kilometre radius of the Pearson Airport; this clause 
gives preference to Pearson over other airports in the region.
<P>
	My purpose in reviewing the events of 1987 to 1993 in this 
matter, first of all, is to make sure that my colleagues in the 
House are aware of the importance of the decision we will be 
called upon to make-a decision that will make people aware of 
the kind of democracy in which they live.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Parliament has all the instruments it needs to find out the truth 
and decide accordingly. But we must be prepared to forget 
partisan considerations and to probe some apparently disturbing 
facts. We have four instruments: the House of Commons, the 
committees, royal commissions of inquiry and finally, the 
justice system.
<P>
	In this particular case, the Prime Minister quickly cancelled 
the privatization contract because he thought there might be 
misappropriation of funds. However, since he made that 
decision, what did we find out? Not much, but it was not because 
the opposition lacked the political will. Here in the House we 
asked for a royal commission of inquiry. Our request was turned 
down. In committee, we invited witnesses. What happened? 
They did not appear.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, with your leave, I will go through the list of 17 
witnesses I tabled in the transport committee. We invited Ray 
Hession, who agreed to appear. We invited Robert Nixon, but 
our Liberal colleagues said that his detailed report was clear 
enough. Ramsay Withers refused. Herb Metcalfe refused. Fred 
Doucet refused. William Rowat refused. Huguette Labelle 
refused. Former minister Jean Corbeil refused. In the case of 
Robert Wright, our Liberal colleagues made the point that since 
Mr. Wright was responsible for negotiations between the 
parties, it was perhaps irrelevant to invite him to appear before 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5359"> 5359 </A></B>
<P>
committee. We agreed. Jodi  White, the former prime minister's 
chief of staff. Doug Young, the Minister, who agreed. Robert 
Bandeen refused. Peter Coughlin refused. Don Matthews 
agreed. Former minister Otto Jelinek refused. Representatives 
for Air Canada agreed to appear, and finally, Liberal Senator 
Leo Kolber refused.
<P>
	That was the list of 17 witnesses I invited to appear before the 
committee.
<P>
	When we look at the connections of these people, I understand 
why my Liberal colleagues refused to let people testify before 
the committee, when we are talking about certain 
representatives or lobbyists who are close to the Conservatives. 
I disagree in the case of people with very close connections with 
the Liberal Party. For instance, Otto Jelinek, a former 
Conservative minister who is now president of the Asian branch 
of the Matthews group, and Ray Hession, a former Deputy 
Minister of Industry and senior executive at Supply and Services 
under the Trudeau governments.
<P>
	We could add Herb Metcalfe, a lobbyist with the Capital Hill 
group, a former representative for Claridge Properties and a 
former organizer for Jean Chrétien. We could mention Ramsay 
Withers, a Liberal lobbyist with very close connections to Jean 
Chrétien and a former Deputy of Transport.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! I wish to remind 
hon. members that the proper procedure is to refer to a member 
of this House by his title. For instance, when speaking about the 
Hon. Jean Chrétien, members should refer to him as the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	I would also mention at this time that the same holds true for 
our colleagues in the other place. I wanted to point this out as we 
begin this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. In the heat of the 
moment, I forgot the rules, most likely because of my lack of 
experience.
<P>
	I was speaking about Mr. Ramsay Withers, a Liberal lobbyist 
with very close ties to the current Prime Minister, and a deputy 
minister of transport during the tender process for Terminal 3 at 
Pearson Airport.
<P>
	Let me also mention a member of the other place, Mr. Léo 
Kolber, who also happens to be a member of the board of 
directors of Claridge, according to the <I>Financial Post Directory 
of Directors.</I> This same person hosted a $1,000-a-plate dinner 
at his Westmount home. On hand for the occasion were, among 
others, Charles Bronfman and the current Prime Minister, who 
was in the midst of the election campaign.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Finally, another player in the deal is Mr. Peter Coughlin, a 
senior official with Claridge Properties who has twice refused to 
testify before our committee. I suggested that we subpoena him, 
but my proposal was defeated by the Liberal majority on the 
committee. The same thing occurred when we wanted to 
subpoena former minister Otto Jelinek.
<P>
	So, since the witnesses did not appear, and since we had 
unsuccessfully asked the committee chairman to insist that the 
witnesses appear, I asked the transport committee to employ the 
means provided by our ancestors to find out the truth, namely to 
subpoena the witnesses and thus force them to appear. The 
motion was again defeated in committee.
<P>
	Even if we would have had to take the matter again before the 
House, even if the Sergeant-at-Arms would have had to take the 
necessary steps to bring the witnesses before the committee, 
even if it had cost a million dollars-which I seriously doubt-, 
we should have made use of the tools at our disposal to shed light 
on some worrisome facts, as the Nixon report indicates.
<P>
	Democracy has its costs. If we want to preserve democracy, 
we must be prepared to assume those costs. It is the only 
possible way to protect society from certain abuses by 
individuals who would do anything for their own personal gain.
<P>
	To prevent certain people from appropriating public assets to 
which they are not entitled, it must be made clear to those people 
that the government will use whatever means are available to it 
to ``air out the dirty laundry'', so to speak.
<P>
	By failing to act like a responsible government and to assume 
its responsibilities, the government is encouraging certain 
groups to bypass normal channels and to try to turn quick profits 
without worrying about tomorrow.
<P>
	Why is the present government in such a hurry to pass this 
bill? Is it worried about having to pay a few dollars in interest on 
unpaid invoices? But perhaps there will not be any 
compensation. How could there be any interest if there is no 
compensation? Or is the government rather afraid of losing 
contributions to its election fund?
<P>
	The government cannot, for partisan political reasons, 
suppress such a scandal that might impact upon previous and 
future generations of politicians. We must clear up this matter. 
We must show that we act openly. We must restore the trust of 
Canadians. The money owed to the government must be 
recovered, and we must stop making handouts in this matter.
<P>
	For the sake of social justice, we must let the public know the 
truth.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise today on third reading of Bill C-22.
<P>
	I was interested in the remarks of the hon. member for London 
East about the process that we are going through. I am sure he, 
like many other members when they were campaigning in the 
last election, was absolutely distraught at the level of cynicism 
that we found among the voters as we went door to door. I must 
admit the mistrust they had of politicians put me at an all time 
low.
<P>
	Bill C-22 really focuses on the mistrust and the cynicism that 
people have toward politicians. I believe that mistrust was 
reflected in the fact that we had such a huge turnover in members 
in the 35th Parliament. When we start talking about the Bloc 
looking for blame, or the Reform Party looking for 
transparency, really what we are talking about is trying to 
establish the credibility of politicians and returning the trust 
that has been lost in this place.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	I am sure the Canadian people applauded the decision to 
cancel the Pearson contract because during the campaign it was 
obvious it was under a cloud. I would suggest that those same 
people would not be very happy with the fact that the 
negotiations for any possible compensation are proceeding 
under what appears to be a cloud.
<P>
	It was suggested that the Nixon report did not say that there 
was anything illegal. While that is true, a lot of questions were 
raised in that report. Indeed, beneath the questions that were 
raised there may be something illegal. We will never know how 
things are proceeding because of this reluctance to open up the 
process to public scrutiny and working toward restoring trust in 
ourselves and in the system.
<P>
	I see two contradictions with the red book in Bill C-22. First, 
the government was elected on the premise of jobs through 
infrastructure development. Here we are talking about what 
arguably could be the biggest piece of infrastructure in Canada. 
Much needed development is being held up because of 
negotiations regarding compensation which are going on behind 
closed doors. Six months have passed since the contract was 
cancelled and nothing has happened toward construction or job 
creation.
<P>
	Mr. Nixon stated in his report that construction should 
proceed. I would like to quote from his words on page 13, 
para-graph 4:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I further recommend that Transport Canada continue for the time being to 
administer Terminals 1 and 2, and proceed with necessary construction. Thereafter, I 
recommend that Transport Canada recognize the airport authority. Once operational, 
the airport authority would receive from Transport Canada, the responsibility of the 
day to day operations of the airport complex. It would also deal with the planning, 
financing and construction of airport infrastructure. In particular, this would include  
Terminals 1 and 2 and the runways, taxiways and aprons at Pearson.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To this point, nothing is happening as far as construction goes.
<P>
	The other contradiction is the reluctance to open up the 
process to the light of day. This again flies in the face of the red 
book promise of governing with integrity. I would like to quote 
from chapter six of the red book, which deals with this particular 
issue. I think it fits very well with what we are talking about 
tonight:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This erosion of confidence seems to have many causes: some have to do with 
the behaviour of certain elected politicians, others with an arrogant style of 
political leadership. The people are irritated with governments that do not 
consult them, or that disregard their views, or that try to conduct key parts of the 
public business behind closed doors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is very significant in what we are doing here in Bill 
C-22.
<P>
	We in the Bloc have attempted to open up the process. The 
Canadian people should be aware of what is going on. They are 
the ones who will be paying whatever compensation may or may 
not be agreed on.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the Nixon report raised a lot of 
questions and yet provided few answers. We owe it to the 
taxpayers to answer those questions. We owe it to the people 
who were identified in the report. They should have an 
opportunity to clear their names and reputations.
<P>
	However, transparency is not to prevail. The cloud over the 
initial deal under the Tories is now covering the compensation 
that may or may not be paid.
<P>
	Why are we even considering one nickel of taxpayers' money 
to a group that does not deserve a penny of hard earned dollars? 
Let me review. The deal was signed on October 7, 1993, just 18 
days before the election was called, knowing full well that the 
deal likely would not survive a change of government.
<P>
	We were not dealing with people who were political novices, 
unfamiliar with the system. We are dealing with both Tory and 
Liberal supporters, politically well connected people who 
apparently were about to line their pockets at the Canadian 
taxpayers' expense. When you consider the challenge, you have 
a government run operation generating some $70 million of 
profit each year.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Some years more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Some years more. 
Governments do not have that reputation for making money. In 
fact the reverse is true. There have been cases where they have 
taken over money making propositions and soon run them into 
the red. Here is an unbelievable opportunity, a government run 
venture about to be turned over to the private sector.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5361"> 5361 </A></B>
<P>
	Under normal circumstances there should have been a 
stampede to bid on this project. The term, a licence to print 
money, is very appropriate here; a sure winner, you cannot lose. 
Making money with this deal is as sure as death and taxes.
<P>
	The original Tory group made a big issue in its proposal that 
there must be competition in terminal 3. That was a key part of 
its proposal. This was the only way to ensure protection for the 
public using this facility. When it was discovered that the group 
did not have the financing or financial ability to proceed, it went 
looking for a white knight.
<P>
	Again, when you remember the fact that this was a guaranteed 
money maker, you would have thought that there would be no 
problem finding a suitable backer for such an airtight money 
making project. We do not know how many people sought to 
become a part of the plum, but what we do know is that the 
operators of terminal 3, the Liberal connection, turned out to be 
the white knight. Out the window goes competition. Any 
possible challenge to future profits was removed and the 
taxpayers and the travelling public are now in the hands of a 
monopoly.
<P>
	Canada's most important piece of infrastructure is now shared 
by both Tory and Liberal supporters. A suspicious mind might 
consider this to have been a very smart move to insulate the deal 
from political interference.
<P>
	What is interesting about the Nixon report is that it did not 
deal with the Liberal connection with the same intensity to 
which the Tory group was subject. They might have been 
successful had the public not reacted so strenuously to this deal. 
A shady deal by the Tories is no different than a shady deal by 
the Liberals. The Canadian taxpayer does not know the 
difference in shades of dirt.
<P>
	Let us go back to the deal for a moment and see if we can find 
any reason for paying taxpayers' dollars to anyone. No evidence 
exists of any work being done between October 7 and the 
cancellation date; not one load of gravel, not one shovel in the 
ground. In my opinion, nothing happened during that period 
because of the uncertainty.
<P>
	The original Tory group had presented an unsolicited bid for 
this project back in September 1989 and no compensation was 
requested or paid when it was rejected at that time. No doubt a 
great deal of work went into this proposal and it placed the group 
at a very distinct advantage when the government in March 1992 
decided to request proposals for privatization.
<P>
	The fact that 90 days only had been allowed to produce these 
proposals gave the original group of 1989 a tremendous 
advantage, a point not missed in the Nixon report.
<P>
	Our problem is that no compensation as opposed to something 
in the order of $25 million to $30 million for out of pocket 
expenses or $180 million if we buy the ridiculous argument of 
lost profits. Why not let the principals prove in an open forum 
what money was spent on this project between October 7, the 
signing date and December 2, 1993, the cancellation date. If any 
costs were to be justified, this is the only timeframe that should 
be considered.
<P>
	Today's Toronto <I>Star</I> reports that this review could cost 
taxpayers as much as $98,000, a further expense in salaries and 
expenses to Bob Wright, the lawyer appointed by the 
government to handle this wrap-up. Mr. Wright is a former 
fundraiser and law partner of the Prime Minister. I would 
suggest without questioning Mr. Wright's integrity or ability, 
the public perception is not the one we wanted them to have. 
Here we are trying to restore this level of trust and confidence 
and with an appointment like this one the public perception is 
that it appears to be more of the same.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	One has to ask why the Liberal government is going out of its 
way to protect the previous Tory government. If the deal is half 
as bad as the Nixon report speculates, the taxpayers of Canada 
deserve a full explanation. If more time were required to 
accumulate witnesses who were prepared to attend, why not 
allow for it? For reluctant witnesses, why not use the subpoena 
process available to committees to force their appearance?
<P>
	In closing, while many voters supported the government's 
decision to cancel the project, those same taxpayers are sure to 
be offended at the way the compensation package is being 
negotiated. The fear we share with so many Canadians is that 
there is the potential for possibly millions of hard earned tax 
dollars to be paid to people who are more deserving of criticism 
than compensation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We now move to the next 
stage of the debate where members will have a maximum of 20 
minutes for their interventions, subject to 10 minutes for 
questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity 
to participate in third reading of Bill C-22.
<P>
	Before I get into the main body of my remarks I would like to 
say to the member from Simcoe in the Reform Party through 
you, Mr. Speaker, that the bill states quite clearly under 
subclause 10(2) entitled ``No compensation'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No amount is payable under an agreement entered into under this section in 
relation to</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) any loss of profit, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5362"> 5362 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) any fee paid for the purpose of lobbying a public office holder, within the 
meaning of subsection 2(1) of the <I>Lobbyists Registration Act</I>,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>in connection with any agreement,</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Minister of Transport said quite clearly in the House last 
week that not a nickel's worth of taxpayers' money would be 
spent unless it was directly related to the contract.
<P>
	All this is subject to the auditor general, which ultimately 
means that the Reform Party will have access to it. We will be 
publicly accountable for any decision the government takes in 
terms of using taxpayers' money with regard to Bill C-22.
<P>
	It is never after the fact when one is talking about a 
transaction like this one. The previous government paid a very 
heavy price because in opposition we took a very strong stand on 
the issue of privatization of the Lester B. Pearson airport. I am 
happy to say that I have not wavered on the issue. I have always 
considered the Lester B. Pearson airport not to be a metro 
Toronto airport. It is not even an Ontario airport. It is an 
international airport.
<P>
	There is a great misunderstanding about the contribution of 
the Pearson International Airport to the economy of Canada as a 
whole. That is one of the reasons I personally do not support the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> position of handing over the Pearson International 
Airport to an LAA, a local airport authority.
<P>
	I acknowledge the member for Simcoe Centre was absolutely 
correct when he mentioned that it was a very profitable 
operation. The profit from Pearson International Airport has not 
just gone into the Toronto region. Traditionally the profit from 
Pearson has been used to help other disadvantaged airports in 
this country.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The airport system, whether it be North Bay, Hamilton or any 
other part of the country, is inextricably intertwined with 
Pearson International Airport.
<P>
	We said this in opposition and we said this during the 
campaign and we said to the Prime Minister of the day, Ms. 
Campbell, not to proceed with that contract.
<P>
	I am proud to be part of a government which immediately 
upon assuming office the Prime Minister appointed someone 
with real credibility to look at that contract and it was 
discovered that it was not a good contact.
<P>
	There are a couple of things that bug me about the previous 
government's contract on Pearson. The thing that bothered me 
the most was the flip clause. There was a flip clause in this 
contract which meant that there was a possibility that if Claridge 
Holdings Inc. or the Matthews Group Limited wanted to sell 
Pearson that option existed in that contract. The possibility 
existed in that contract which we have cancelled that we could 
have been in a situation in which Pearson would have been  
owned by the Taiwanese or by the Libyans. Think what could 
have happened.
<P>
	I was very rigorous in my opposition to selling off Pearson 
International Airport. I believe that selling off Pearson is no 
different that selling off the East Block or the West Block. I 
believe that Pearson is an instrument of government which does 
not just look after air travel but is intertwined with some of the 
disadvantaged regions of our province and of our country. I also 
believe it is an instrument which can affect our tourism policy, 
our trade policy. It it not only the gateway to Toronto but one of 
the major gateways to our country. I believe this is the room, this 
is the Chamber that should be ultimately responsible for making 
decisions on how Pearson is managed.
<P>
	There are times when we have been very tough on the 
bureaucrats who have operated Pearson international. Is it not 
interesting that these same bureaucrats, and the member for 
Simcoe Centre acknowledged this, managed to always make a 
profit at Pearson International Airport?
<P>
	The argument from the private sector will be: ``We could 
make a lot more''. I accept that point of view from the private 
sector that there probably is room for improvement at Pearson 
International Airport. I think we should consider bringing in the 
experts. Hire some people, give them a four or five year 
management consulting contract.
<P>
	Why should we give away Pearson when we can give a 
management contract? If the management expertise wants to 
compliment or support the officials of Transport Canada in 
increasing the profits or developing other options of 
profitability and testing them, bring in the management 
consultants and give them a contract. If they meet certain levels 
of profitability pay them. If they go beyond their budgets and 
produce more profit then pay them a bonus.
<P>
	With all due respect to captain Messier of the New York 
Rangers, and he made a tremendous contribution in helping the 
team win the Stanley Cup, you will give him a good salary but 
you will not give him the franchise.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	That is where I have strong views on this issue. The catering is 
done by a very good firm in terms of the way it manages and 
operates it and gives a percentage back to the Crown; the 
parking, the taxi service, the construction. We do not want the 
construction. Put all of that out to the experts, but the notion of 
giving to the private sector an instrument of public policy-it is 
an instrument of public policy, not just for the Toronto area but it 
affects every region of this country-I believe is not the way to 
go.
<P>
	Another thing I want to touch on is the way these public 
servants who are managing the airport tend to be 
underestimated. Is it not ironic that the manager of the airport, 
Chern Heed, is now respected as one of the top three airport 
operators in the world and is now running the Hong Kong 
airport?
<P>
	It is a pity that we lost such a great airport manager and I hope 
there will be a day when we can bring him back as a public 
servant to participate in managing the Toronto international 
airport.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5363"> 5363 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to go back to this notion of a local airport authority. A 
local airport authority usually is made up of representatives of 
the city and the surrounding boroughs in the greater Toronto 
area. I am sure we would have some representation on that 
board.
<P>
	My concern with that is twofold. When you are only 
concerned with issues as they relate to your own city, you tend to 
be a little parochial. The difference between being involved in 
city politics or provincial politics versus national politics is 
centred around the fact that when we deal with issues in this 
Chamber, it is our responsibility to not just think of our own 
communities, our own ridings, but we have to think of them in 
terms of how they would affect each other's ridings on a national 
basis.
<P>
	My concern about a local airport authority stems from the fact 
that I do not think that unit would have the capability of really 
dealing with the national interest. That is point number one.
<P>
	Point number two is the member from Simcoe Centre in his 
speech talked about a sum of money of revenue somewhere in 
the neighbourhood of seventy-odd million dollars for 1993. 
That was a bad year. Our passenger count is down by a 
tremendous amount right now. Imagine when the economy 
comes back and we can develop some more efficiency in that 
airport.
<P>
	Think four or five years from now when that airport could be 
generating a couple hundred million dollars a year. Imagine how 
we would feel as national members of Parliament if four or five 
years from now we saw a local airport authority that was 
generating close to a couple hundred million dollars a year. The 
private sector would say we are getting the first $25 million or 
$30 million. Forget it, this airport is there for the national 
interest.
<P>
	I am speaking now as a member from Toronto. Four or five 
years from now, after we have renovated the airport and cleaned 
it up, because I really do hope that the money that the airport 
generates between now and then can go into the renewal and go 
in the deal, on the point the member from Simcoe Centre was 
making, we have to get some jobs going in Toronto.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	We have talked about infrastructure. The member is right. The 
airport is a terrific area where we can begin. Let us plough some 
of that money back into the airport and renovate it, renew it, do 
the things we have to do. Four years from now after those 
renovations have been made it still will be the Government of 
Canada operation working in partnership with terminal 3 which, 
by the way, is a private sector operation. That to me is a pretty 
good compromise.
<P>
	Personally I would not have supported the privatization of 
terminal 3. Ideologically I do not support that thrust. However, 
there could be a compromise, a private sector operation in 
terminal 3 and Government of Canada in terminal 2. I do not 
think we can sustain terminal 1 the way it is right now. It is a 
mess.
<P>
	The point is that is a good competitive synergistic approach. 
Let us be proud of the fact that five years from now when all of 
those renewals are done the cash flow coming from that airport 
can go into other projects in the national interest.
<P>
	I say to members of the Bloc, the notion of a royal inquiry is 
only going to delay the process. We already know it is not a good 
deal, so why kill a dead cat? The Prime Minister announced that 
the deal is cancelled. Why take another year and a half, spend 
millions of taxpayers' dollars to find out what, that there were 
some Liberal lobbyists involved?
<P>
	Well Liberal lobbyists were involved. Naturally some of my 
best friends are Liberal lobbyists. Do you think they did not try 
to lobby me to change my mind on the airport? That is their job, 
but it is up to us to either agree or challenge their lobby. What do 
you want to do? Is it going to be such a big deal?
<P>
	The member from the Bloc mentioned some Liberal lobbyists 
so the Bloc wants to have a royal commission of inquiry into 
what happened. We are going to bring a bunch of Liberal 
lobbyists forward and they are going to say they lobbied the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood or other members. That is 
irrelevant. It is not important because we stopped the deal. We 
took a stand; the lobby did not work on us.
<P>
	A public inquiry is not going to produce anything different 
from what the Auditor General's analysis will produce. The 
Auditor General is going to look at the disbursements the 
Minister of Transport will make in terms of settling this deal. He 
will analyse those things. Opposition members will analyse 
them. The press will analyse them. If there is a nickel's worth of 
taxpayers' money which has been spent inappropriately they are 
going to raise hell in this House which is fair ball.
<P>
	I have to talk about my city for a minute. Toronto is going 
through a very difficult economic period with close to 600,000 
people out of work. We want to put this file behind us so we can 
come back at it with a renewed thrust in order to get something 
going. As Mr. Nixon has recommended I believe that the airport 
is a good place to get some activity going, but we said not at any 
price. That is why we stopped the deal. It was tough to say no to 
that deal when there were so many jobs, but we just cannot give 
it away at any price.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5364"> 5364 </A></B>
<P>
	It is important that we get this behind us so we can come at it 
with a renewed and fresh approach involving the Government of 
Canada. Once we get the renovation and renewal done on the 
whole Pearson operation, then let us hope that three to five years 
from now the cash flow that place throws off can help every 
other region of the country.
<P>
	I encourage hon. members to please let us put this bill behind 
us so we can start with a fresh slate.
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before we proceed to

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his 
speech the hon. member talked about stalling this project and 
trying to expedite this matter as quickly as possible. There are 
repairs to be made to terminal 1, it is in pretty bad shape.
<P>
	Could the member update us as to when Pearson started to 
make money? The Canadian people probably put a lot of money 
into it before it actually started to make money. At what point in 
time did this airport start to make money?
<P>
	I know it is a big generator of jobs in Toronto. There must be 
at least 20,000 people working there.
<P>
	Also, how quickly would they get the runways and the 
infrastructure on terminal 1 going?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know the precise year Pearson started to make money. It used to 
be Malton Airport before Prime Minister Trudeau named it 
Pearson on December 13, 1983. It was his last supper in Toronto 
when he announced the name as Lester B. Pearson. I do know 
that the now Pearson International Airport was making money in 
1980.
<P>
	The member has touched upon a very good point. He is 
alluding to the fact that over several years Canadian taxpayers 
have invested millions and millions of dollars in developing the 
airport and infrastructure, bringing it to the point it is at today.
<P>
	About five or six weeks ago there was a study which ranked 
Pearson airport in its current state as seventh in the world. We 
are tough on Pearson, but the operators of terminal 3 have done a 
very good job. It is working well.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	I agree with the member that terminal 1, the terminal in the 
middle, the original terminal, is not in good shape. We all 
recognize that. However terminal 2 has gone through a constant 
renewal, both in terms of construction and efficiency. The 
officials at Transport Canada have done a remarkable job.
<P>
	The member has raised a very good point. When we talk about 
20 million passengers a year, all of them are not from Toronto. 
They are from every part of the country.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to our colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Industry, and I still do not understand why he is 
refusing to convene a royal commission of inquiry to look into 
this very dubious affair, the likes of which I have not seen in the 
20 years that I have been in this country, and to examine the 
lobbying issue as well. Some light needs to be shed on  this affair 
and on the role played by lobbyists. In my opinion, all of these 
issues need to be clarified.
<P>
	Tomorrow, the government will be introducing a bill aimed at 
regulating lobbying activities. I hope that they will be very clear 
and that we will have the opportunity to debate this very 
important bill.

the one hand, the government says no compensation will be 
awarded, while on the other hand, the bill allows the minister to 
grant sums of money to the parties involved. Could the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry enlighten 
me on this apparent contradiction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, through 
you I say to the member for Bourassa that we should be perfectly 
clear and should not leave the impression with the people of 
Canada that there will be any compensation for lobbyists.
<P>
	The bill states very clearly in subclause 10(2):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No amount is payable under an agreement entered into under this section in 
relation to</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) any loss of profit, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) any fee paid for the purpose of lobbying a public office holder-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We should make sure that point is clear. Somehow the Bloc 
mixes the lobby issue with disbursements that might be paid for 
the leadup to the conclusion of the contract. Lobbyists will not 
be paid.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a point we have to make. I believe my colleague and 
seatmate, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport, tried to make the point about the seriousness of the 
bill to the Bloc. The bill has no precedent. We have taken a 
contract that was signed by a previous government, as the 
member acknowledged, 18 days before election day.
<P>
	There is a convention in our country that in the last period of 
an election campaign senators are not appointed, deals are not 
signed, and we await the outcome of the election. The previous 
Conservative government broke that convention and the victim 
was that private sector firm.
<P>
	Now we have to be fair to the victims, the subcontractors and 
other people who led up to the packaging of the bid which was 
called by a duly elected government. We are trying to 
communicate to the opposition, not the Reform Party but to the 
Bloc Quebecois, that there will be no compensation for future 
profit and no lobby money will be paid. We believe the small and 
medium size operators that were part and parcel of the bid and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5366"> 5366 </A></B>
<P>
had some legitimate expenses that went into that consummated 
transaction should be treated fairly.
<P>
	We are trying to strike a balance which is accountable. We are 
accountable once it is over. I want to say to members opposite 
through you, Mr. Speaker, that a royal inquiry will take millions 
of dollars and another 18 months. During that same period we 
could have the renewal and renovation of an airport which is so 
vital to the national interests of the country looked after.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased again to be able to speak on Bill C-22 at third 
reading. I will not hide from you that the Bloc Quebecois is 
against this bill, especially the part that allows the government 
to pay the compensation it sees fit to those who signed the 
contract for privatizing Pearson Airport, without releasing full 
information on the circumstances which led from the decision to 
privatize the airport to the signing of the contract.
<P>
	The Prime Minister promised us a clear, open, rigorous 
process to get to the bottom of this failed transaction and to fully 
elucidate the involvement of political staff or former political 
staff and lobbyists in this affair. Remember the summary report 
prepared by Mr. Nixon. He said that political staff and lobbyists 
had an uncommon role in negotiating this transaction, but it 
stops there.
<P>
	Some even say that this could be one of the biggest 
contracting frauds ever on Canadian territory. The conditions 
under which this contract was awarded are suspect and we are 
being kept in the dark about them. Bill C-22 even leaves open 
the possibility or gives the government complete latitude to 
compensate those who might have lost when this process of 
privatization was halted.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Why not get right to the bottom of this question? It could 
prove useful to deal with similar cases in the future, because we 
must not lose sight of the fact that in many cases, the political 
staff and the lobbyists who were involved in this transaction and 
in the whole Pearson Airport privatization process are the same 
ones who are now working on other files, whether to promote the 
interests of the companies they represent or simply as 
professional lobbyists.
<P>
	As we have said over and over and will continue to repeat for 
the next three years if necessary, we from the Bloc Quebecois 
are under the impression this is one of the worse cases of 
patronage in the history of this country. I am starting to wonder, 
and even if I never managed to get an answer since Bill C-22 has 
been under consideration, I put the question to the Liberal 
government: Is it because it realized that the interests of friends, 
former friends or great friends of the party were at stake that, on 
the strength of a simple report, the Liberal government now 
refuses, or so it seems, to answer to an extensive and in-depth 
commission of inquiry into the whole process, a process which 
according to Mr. Nixon's summary report, was mind-boggling, 
full  of inappropriateness, oddities and things never heard of in 
this sort of transaction?
<P>
	This was a contract to privatize one of Canada's most 
profitable airports. So, all the considerations, the entire process 
which have led to this contract being drafted should be brought 
out in the open. The players should also come out in the open. 
Let me remind you, Madam Speaker, the names of a few of the 
friends of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party who were 
involved in this process, this privatization attempt. It is always a 
pleasure for me to name names because, so far, the government 
has refused to clarify the involvement of these people, when we 
know full well that they are very closely tied to the Liberal Party 
of Canada and perhaps, in fact certainly, to the party fund as 
well.
<P>
	As you know, the Liberal Party of Canada, like all major 
Canadian establishment parties, is not subject to any legislation 
on political party financing or rather on the financing of 
political parties by the people, unlike the Bloc Quebecois. So it 
is quite normal that a contract of this nature or a process leading 
to the privatization of the biggest Canadian airport would bring 
up the names of people, organizations or business owners who 
contribute large amounts of money to political party funds. 
Something like that could not happen with the Bloc Quebecois 
because our hands are not tied by corporate, anonymous and 
impersonal contributions. We are disciplined in this respect and 
only accept contributions from real Quebec citizens. I think it is 
good for us and for democracy.
<P>
	It is probably because they realized that friends of the Liberal 
Party of Canada were involved in this deal that they refuse to 
shed light on it. I repeat, as it can never be repeated often 
enough: the list of the people involved may help us understand 
not only why the Liberal government refuses to disclose all the 
facts but why its bill gives it all the latitude needed to bribe 
those directly or indirectly linked to the failed Pearson Airport 
privatization process.
<P>
	You remember Senator Leo Kolber. He was the one who 
organized the cosy $1,000-a-plate dinner where the guest of 
honour was the Prime Minister. Guests could shake hands with 
the Prime Minister in the midst of the election campaign and 
talk to him about their little problems, perhaps in connection 
with the Pearson Airport privatization or to the money they 
would lose if the privatization deal was cancelled. In short, 
Senator Leo Kolber was a stakeholder in this event and 
especially in the whole Pearson Airport privatization process.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5367"> 5367 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	There was also Mr. Bronfman, who did not hesitate either to 
attend this $1,000-a-plate dinner to shake hands with the future 
Prime Minister. Herb Metcalfe was also present. He is a lobbyist 
and former organizer for Mr. Jean Chrétien before he became 
Prime Minister. He is close to the Prime Minister and was very 
involved in the whole process to privatize Pearson Airport.
<P>
	Ray Hession was also present. He is a former deputy minister 
of Industry and senior civil servant with Supply and Services, 
under the Liberal government of Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Mr. 
Hession was also involved in the process to privatize Pearson 
Airport.
<P>
	There were others too, including some Conservatives. The 
current government is Liberal. I think it is worth repeating that 
we have serious doubts about the purpose of Bill C-22, given the 
names of the key players, the contributors who finance the 
Liberal Party of Canada, and also the inclusion of a clause 
designed to compensate those who may have suffered a 
prejudice when the Prime Minister decided to cancel the 
privatization process.
<P>
	In addition to the fact that this government refuses to shed 
light on the role of these players, who are known to be very close 
to the Liberal Party of Canada, there is also the fact that the 
contract for the privatization of Pearson Airport is full of very 
unusual clauses.
<P>
	That document is something else. Let me give you some 
examples which are still mind-boggling at the conclusion of the 
review process of Bill C-22.
<P>
	The contract was for a 37-year period expiring on October 31, 
2030, with an option to extend that period for an additional 20 
years. Why is that? It is because the Ontario legislation provides 
that, on leases longer than 50 years, a provincial tax applies to 
any transfer of property.
<P>
	Normally, if the duration of the lease had not been split, those 
involved in the transaction would have had to pay around ten 
million dollars to the Ontario revenue ministry. Just imagine, 
with the federal government's complicity, individuals were 
making deals and the terms of their contracts were such that they 
could avoid paying legitimate taxes to the Ontario government. 
That is rather amazing.
<P>
	When in this country's history have we ever seen the federal 
government paving the way for a party to avoid provincial 
taxation? This is quite extraordinary.
<P>
	Rent is calculated on the basis of gross revenue. According to 
the contract, Pearson Development Corporation was to turn over 
30.5 per cent of its gross revenues for the previous year to the 
government, up to a maximum of $125 million in gross 
revenues. For any amount in excess of $125 million in gross 
revenues, Pearson Development Corporation was required to 
pay the government 45.5 per cent of its gross revenues from the 
leasing operations.
<P>
	Calculating gross revenue is an extremely technical process, 
but very important nonetheless because this type of clause is 
rarely found in contracts, even in those far less important than 
the one to privatize Pearson. For the purposes of this 
calculation, gross revenue includes all revenues generated 
through the operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson, excluding 
ten significant deductions, which reduce the buyer's rental, 
accommodation and contracting costs.
<P>
	The deductions amount to the taxes collected from consumers 
and passengers which are pocketed by Pearson Development 
Corporation on the government's behalf. Extraordinary sources 
of revenues are discounted for the purposes of calculating gross 
revenue. This is unusual when determining basic rent in a 
transaction such as this.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	When we look at revenues which, although not unusual, are 
infrequent and are not generated through the normal operation 
of the terminals, including access sales, we see that these too 
were not included in the calculation of gross revenue on which 
rent will be based.
<P>
	The same holds true for investment revenue. The contract 
contains a number of bizarre provisions. Unless these are 
closely scrutinized and unless those individuals associated with 
the privatization process, the principal players in this deal, are 
called upon to testify -I named a few of these players a moment 
ago, but there are many others -until such time as we can ask 
them questions, we will not know the whole story as far as this 
deal is concerned. There are many incongruous aspects to the 
Pearson privatization contract.
<P>
	Many questions also arise about the rebates and refunds 
awarded by Pearson Development Corporation in the case of 
airport equipment. Here again, we find some strange provisions. 
There is also something odd about the way the government will 
recover the costs associated with the occupation of airport 
space.
<P>
	I will not give you a complete list of all the incongruities since 
time will not allow it. During the course of this debate, we have 
been able to bring to light a number of the contract's 
incongruous provisions which make this deal unparalleled in 
Canadian financial history.
<P>
	We could have also talked about severance pay for Transport 
Canada employees. That situation is also disgusting. If you look 
at the facts, even dispassionately -passionately it is worse- if 
you think that the government of Canada had offered separation 
allowances to 160 of its own employees despite the fact they 
were guaranteed employment for two years with Pearson 
Development Corporation-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5368"> 5368 </A></B>
<P>
	Separation allowances totalling $5.5 million would have been 
paid to 160 federal employees while allowed to keep their jobs. 
That is revolting! It is totally unacceptable, particularly in view 
of the unemployment levels and the housing situation, when 
people are asking for social housing and getting none. I am 
bringing up social housing because I just attended a meeting on 
the subject and once again, the government has refused to at 
least consider alternatives so that the neediest -some 1.2 
million households nationwide- can find decent housing and 
not have to spend in the neighbourhood of 50 per cent of their 
income on rent.
<P>
	You can imagine how I feel about a government that does not 
want to listen to the complaints or the cries of despair of the 
most ill-favoured members of our society, that does not want to 
pay any attention whatsoever to the social housing situation in 
Canada and is pursuing the very policy it had been denouncing 
in no uncertain terms since 1992. I am speaking on behalf of all 
their spokespersons when I contrast this with the government 
allowing employees guaranteed to keep their jobs for the next 
years at least to be paid $5.5 million in compensation. I am at a 
loss to know how social justice works in this government.
<P>
	The latitude the government is giving itself as well as the 
almost impudent fashion it presents the capacity the government 
has to compensate friends of the system without specifying any 
amounts -it could be in the millions- can also be contrasted 
with the brick wall we are facing when we want to raise issues 
like social housing and unemployment insurance cuts with the 
government. However hard I try to stay cool in face of such 
injustice and double standard, my blood boils. Friends of the 
party -the very rich friends of the Liberal Party of Canada and 
contributors to the party fund- get to be treated one way while 
those who have no voice, no power and no lobbyists 
representing them on the Hill, in ministers' offices or in the 
office of the Prime Minister are treated differently.
<P>
	I think there are enough grounds -and I still cannot see why 
the government is so obstinate- for making an effort to bring to 
light the whole story regarding the privatization process at 
Pearson, with all the dealings involved and all the financial 
inconsistencies. I think this deserves an answer from the 
government. If it is not true that the friends of the system had 
their palms greased and stand to benefit even more under Bill 
C-22, then let us get to the bottom of this business and get all the 
facts.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	We want to believe you but not on the basis of a superficial 
analysis commissioned by the Prime Minister, which probably 
has some value-I am referring to the Nixon Report-but not as 
much as a thorough, serious review of all the elements 
surrounding this deal and of what it could involve in the future.
<P>
	I think we will be able to continue this debate beyond Bill 
C-22 after the lobbyists bill is tabled. We should find out the 
general provisions tomorrow. Let us not forget, however, that 
many of the Pearson players, as I pointed out at the beginning of 
my speech, are professional lobbyists. These people will 
continue to haunt the halls of this building and try to persuade 
the government to go back on its decisions, sometimes perhaps 
with bad intentions.
<P>
	I am not saying that all lobbyists have bad intentions. On the 
contrary. I know lobbyists who express their clients' views in a 
quiet manner, but I also know other lobbyists whose integrity 
can sometimes be questioned, especially when they are much 
too close to this government and when they represent interests 
contributing to the election fund of the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will vote against 
Bill C-22. We are still demanding a commission of inquiry to 
uncover all the facts on this deal, and it is not true that such an 
investigation would cost millions of dollars and take a year and a 
half. I think that the House of Commons has all it needs to 
conduct such an investigation and that, if we act in good faith, 
we should be able to proceed rather quickly by having the 
principal players in the failed Pearson Airport privatization deal 
testify.
<P>
	I also think it is worthwhile for transparency's sake that the 
people of Quebec and Canada find out how the government deals 
with such important issues and how much influence lobbyists 
exert, often in an underhand way. Lobbyists often cast a shadow 
over government decisions, especially when they may represent 
the interests of the Liberal Party in some respects.
<P>
	I hope the government will respond favourably to our request. 
It would be a good example of what it claims it wants to achieve 
during this mandate, that is, acting with honesty and 
transparency and serving the people of Quebec and Canada well. 
I think it would be a good start. If members on the other side of 
the House share our sense of democracy, they should agree to the 
Bloc Quebecois's request.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to what our colleague said. The 
hon. member recalls the commitment which the present Prime 
Minister made in the last election campaign. First of all, if we 
were elected, we would immediately conduct a full review of the 
Pearson transaction, which we did, and that we would have a 
person of some standing to conduct this inquiry. In fact, the 
person who did it is a former representative of Ontario in 
London, a former minister, a former deputy premier of Ontario, 
someone who is well known, at least to all the provincial parties 
in Ontario, as really qualified and of unquestionable integrity.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5369"> 5369 </A></B>
<P>
	On this point, the member opposite would have trouble 
finding anyone in the Ontario Legislature, in the present NDP 
government, in the provincial Liberal party or among 
Conservative members at Queen's Park, who would disagree 
with what I just said.
<P>
	So we had a person of that stature to do the work. He 
recommended that we end the contract. The government did so. 
Then the government said that it agreed to defray only the 
expenses of those who entered this contractual agreement with 
the previous government but not lobbyists' expenses.
<P>
	I wonder what the member opposite is driving at. Obviously 
the lobbyists will not be compensated; we know that. The profits 
that the companies lost will not be compensated; we already 
know that. We know all those things. The parliamentary 
committee heard just about all the witnesses who wanted to 
appear before it, maybe not all the witnesses that my colleague 
opposite wanted, but still a good representation of the 
population and we did what we promised Canadians.
<P>
	The hon. member will have to explain to me and to Canadian 
voters what more could be asked for. We did what we promised 
Canadians. We did it in good faith. We terminated that 
agreement which of course was contrary to the interests of 
Canadians.
<P>
	The hon. member must understand that this agreement 
concluded by the government was not good and we ended it. Our 
government ended it. The hon. member should speak up and 
recognize the good decision made by the Liberal government. I 
tell you that if the hon. member searches his conscience in the 
next few minutes and answers us after Private Members' 
Business, he could easily see that he is wrong to oppose this bill. 
He could even vote for it a little later today on final reading.
<P>
	I submit this proposal to you.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! I hesitate to 
interrupt the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
but I am certain that the House would like to hear from the 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot before we move on to 
Private Members' Business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the few 
remaining seconds which my colleague wanted to take up.
<P>
	No one here has ever doubted Mr. Nixon's integrity-far from 
it. Mr. Nixon fulfilled the mandate given to him by the Prime 
Minister. But the Prime Minister had stated that he would shed 
light specifically on the twists and turns surrounding the 
Pearson Airport privatization process. So why stop halfway, 
after getting a summary evaluation, after even Mr. 
Nixon-whose integrity was never in doubt-stated that there 
were very weird things in this matter involving extraordinary 
influence by former political staff and lobbyists, and that he had 
never seen anything like it. So why be afraid to shed light on the 
subject. As I mentioned previously, if there is no truth to the 
assertion that these are friends of  the Liberal Party of Canada, 
why be afraid to get right down to it? We want the truth, the 
exact truth.
<P>
	Mr. Nixon identified certain problems that were sufficient to 
justify immediately stopping the privatization process. But we 
do not know everything there is to know about this whole 
process, the players involved, the fact that unseemly behaviour 
may have occurred, gross irregularities in the financial 
transactions, and we cannot know it without an exhaustive 
public inquiry into the specifics of this matter, in which the 
people who were closely or remotely connected with the 
privatization process would be made to appear as witnesses. But 
the truth about this attempted privatization and the influence 
wielded by the lobbyists involved will never be entirely known. 
This is why we are calling for an exhaustive review, and never 
did I or my colleagues cast any doubt on Mr. Nixon's integrity. I 
believe that satisfactorily answers my colleague's remarks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. It being 
5.51 p.m., the House will now proceed to the consideration of 
Private Members' Business as listed on today's <I>Order Paper</I>.

	The House resumed from May 25, consideration of the 
motion; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, on January 
20 this year, the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam tabled a 
motion whose purpose-and I say this for the benefit of our 
listeners who may be wondering where all this started-was to 
allow members to express themselves freely and to vote against 
the party line, without fear of bringing down the government 
should a vote, fortunately or unfortunately, go against the 
government, and the hon. member made it clear such a vote 
should not be interpreted as a motion of non-confidence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5370"> 5370 </A></B>
<P>
	That being said, there are a number of elements in this motion, 
and I am trying to put them in order because to discuss the 
amendment to the amendment without discussing the main 
motion would be to overlook the broader implications. When we 
talk about a free vote, and I read the hon. member's speech, we 
are talking about seeking the views of constituents to ensure that 
the member responds to these views through the way he votes in 
the House. Supporters of a free vote claim this is necessary if the 
member is to fully represent the views of his constituents.
<P>
	Nothing could be further from the truth. You will agree, Mr. 
Speaker, that the member's role is not just to represent the views 
of his constituents but also and above all to promote the interests 
of those constituents. In fact, we all realize that our constituents 
do not all share the same views. There is a wide range of views. 
There is also a range of interests. So how do we pick and choose 
between these views and interests? Are we supposed to turn into 
a calculator and wait until the telephone rings and the mail 
comes in and see which pile is the biggest? This pile is bigger so 
we should do that. Good heavens, if that is what a member is 
supposed to do, a calculator could do the job.
<P>
	I believe members are also and above all elected for their 
good judgment, or at least I hope so. Whatever we discuss, the 
member will have to examine the issues, talk about them, do 
research and finally get a handle on the subject. This is not a 
matter of opinions or interests, it is a matter of having a good 
grasp of the issues. Through his membership in various 
committees and through his own research and the research done 
by his staff, a member is able to develop and define his position, 
in the best interests of all his constituents. This exercise cannot 
take place in a vacuum.
<P>
	We have to meet our constituents. Like all members, when I 
am in my riding on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, I try to meet as 
many constituents as possible. I go to various meetings, I take 
part in a number of festivities, I meet members of municipal 
councils, senior citizens clubs and chambers of commerce, I 
meet business people, workers and various types of employees, 
and I listen. I listen to what they have to say, I check their 
interests, I tell them about the results of my research and my 
studies, and I explain what I have seen and heard.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Through dialogue, and not through the use of a calculator, I 
can better identify the real issues and ensure improved services 
and a happier life for my fellow citizens. Our constituents' 
opinion serves as a guide helping us to better target our research 
and better serve our ridings.
<P>
	In reality, an MP is never alone. He or she works with a caucus 
and also with all the other parties in this House. Indeed, even if I 
thought I had the best ideas for my constituents, I would still 
have to convince my peers, first  the members of our caucus and, 
eventually, the members of this House.
<P>
	How can that be done, if not through the processes in place? I 
am not saying that these processes are great. In fact, I think they 
are totally outdated and ineffective, but they are there and we 
must make do with them.
<P>
	I would first check in committee to see if my ideas get the 
support of my peers, and then I would turn to my caucus. I would 
also try to find out if other MPs from my region share similar 
views. We all have constituents who, up to a point, share the 
same concerns, worries and hopes. We have to find solutions 
which suit the population as a whole.
<P>
	So, are those ideas of mine as good as I think they are? The 
regional and national caucus would enable me to find out what 
my colleagues think. They too, of course, have ideas. I am not 
the only one to have useful information or brilliant ideas. My 
colleagues express their views and this dialogue eventually 
leads to a decision, by the caucus, as to which solution is the 
most adequate for all the members.
<P>
	Within our caucus, my vote is strictly a personal decision. I 
can always freely express and discuss my views, hear other 
opinions, and eventually accept a consensus. Consequently, 
when I come here in the House, I back the position developed by 
the caucus, and not just my own point of view.
<P>
	It would be extremely simplistic and probably somewhat 
pretentious on my part to think that I have this ability to come up 
with the best solutions. In that context, it is easy to see that a free 
vote would become an excuse to bypass party colleagues and 
openly express dissenting opinions. This is not what the 
democratic process is all about. Rather, it means that we go and 
get the information from our constituents, that we get any other 
information available, that we put it all together to come up with 
acceptable solutions, all the while benefitting from our 
colleagues' experience and knowledge, before finally reaching a 
consensus on the best solution, which we, as members of a 
caucus, then defend in this House, in accordance with its rules.

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wanted to point out to the hon. member from the Bloc 
that my motion today has nothing to do with any wonderful or 
brilliant ideas I might have as a member of this House.
<P>
	What we are talking about today is representing our 
constituents in this House. Those are the people we were elected 
to represent and we are responsible to them.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to begin the debate in the last 
hour of Motion No. 89 which advocates the relaxation of the 
confidence convention and, flowing from that, freer voting as 
party members of this House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5371"> 5371 </A></B>
<P>
	I have listened with interest to those who have spoken in the 
debate in this place and I have also listened attentively to 
witnesses who have come before the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs who have addressed the issue of 
freer votes.
<P>
	There are those who argue against the motion of dissent being 
exhibited through freer voting by the attempt to change the basic 
premise upon which this motion is founded in order to argue 
against it. For example, the member for Vancouver Quadra 
explained that we are not all here as independents elected on our 
own. I agree. We in the Reform Party realize this fact. We do not 
want to reduce the House of Commons to chaos and we do not 
believe that the timely expression of dissent by a few members 
would do so.
<P>
	The opinion of those involved in the writing of the McGrath 
report in 1985 and those who sat on the House management 
committee in 1993 was that dissent should be allowed to be 
expressed without fear of retaliation by the leadership of the 
political party concerned. They thought it would make this 
House a healthier place where members on occasion would not 
have to vote the party line on all legislative matters.
<P>
	It might help members better represent their constituents and 
it may also allow those constituents to feel that their views were 
being directly represented on the floor of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Speaking of representing the views of constituents, I want to 
thank the member for Hamilton West for referring to this matter 
in his speech on this motion. He stated, referring to me: ``The 
hon. member opposite is sadly mistaken if she thinks I or anyone 
else on this side of the House can be blindly led. If I supported a 
government objective that went against any of my well known 
principles I would be laughed out of this House, out of this job''.
<P>
	However, at the end of his speech he wavered from this bold 
statement when he said: ``It is not the individual vote, it is the 
collective. It is the understanding of what we believe to be in the 
best interest of our constituents, of our riding, of our province 
and of our country''.
<P>
	I am not sure but I believe this second phrase contradicts the 
earlier bold one in which the member stated he would support 
his constituents' points of view against any attempt to be led 
around by the nose by his party.
<P>
	I also want to assure my friend from St. Boniface that by the 
adoption of this motion the kinds of judgments we have to make 
as members of Parliament will not be automatically replaced by 
views advanced by constituents. It is the belief of the Reform 
Party that matters will come along in the life of a Parliament 
which were not addressed either directly or indirectly during the 
previous election. There is no prior party position on these 
matters.
<P>
	It is our belief that if a member wishes to dissent from the 
position eventually taken by the member's political party, the 
member should be able to do so without fear of retribution at the 
hands of the party leadership.
<P>
	We are not advocating, as was expressed by the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, that everything be a free vote. I 
listened to the hon. member when he spoke in this House on May 
25 and I appreciate the fact that confidence was taken out of the 
standing orders of the House of Commons as a result of the first 
report of the McGrath committee.
<P>
	However, what I do not believe the member realizes is the fact 
it was removed made little difference. The attitudinal change on 
the part of the member so strongly advocated by McGrath has 
not taken place.
<P>
	By comparison with Great Britain, Australia and New 
Zealand, Canada's political parties are the most tightly 
controlled by their respective leadership. In Australia and New 
Zealand, while voting against the party line is tolerated, the 
influence of the private member is greatest when there is a 
labour government. In that situation the caucus elects members 
to sit in cabinet and the Prime Minister allocates the portfolios.
<P>
	As I have said before, this situation leads to constant 
interaction between leadership and backbench members 
wherein the views of backbench members have great influence 
on public policy. Is that not what we want?
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	In order to be elected by caucus to serve in cabinet one must 
have the support of those who will not be in cabinet. To be 
re-elected to cabinet one surely must have demonstrated a 
willingness to listen to the concerns of caucus members and 
adjust legislation accordingly. This would result in increased 
influence over public policy being placed in the hands of 
backbenchers. That is a good sign.
<P>
	However, it is in Britain where in recent times backbench 
independence has been asserted with members voting against 
the party line and in some cases defeating government 
legislation.
<P>
	Professor Philip Norton, an academic on freer votes in 
Britain, explains that this phenomenon of cross-party voting led 
to a growing awareness of what could be achieved by such action 
and a recognition that the consequences expected from 
government defeats such as resignation or punishment by the 
leadership did not materialize. They did not perceive it as a 
threat.
<P>
	This produced a change of attitude of many MPs as the old 
differential attitude was replaced by a participatory attitude. 
Backbenchers became involved in and were influencing 
government policy. This situation continues today in Britain.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5372"> 5372 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, I want to refer to the evidence given by Professor 
Robert Jackson when he appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs a few weeks ago. He 
does not believe in freer voting by members and he is a strident 
critic of the McGrath report, a report that is really accepted by 
members in this House. His main concern was that freer voting 
would result in chaos, with the government virtually unable to 
govern. This is absurd.
<P>
	We are only advocating limited dissent expressed from time 
to time without fear of repercussions from the leadership. We in 
the Reform Party want to see the House express itself positively 
on this motion and therefore we accept the amendment advanced 
by the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	However, in recognition of the fact that freer voting or the 
expression of dissent from the party line rarely occurs in this 
place I wish to make a further amendment.
<P>
	I move, seconded by my friend from Calgary West, that the 
amendment be amended by adding immediately following the 
word ``continue'' the word ``increasingly'' so that the motion as 
amended would read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should continue 
increasingly to permit members of the House of Commons to fully represent 
their constituents' views on the government's legislative program and spending 
plans by adopting the position that the defeat of any government measure, 
including a spending measure, shall not automatically mean the defeat of the 
government unless followed by the adoption of a formal motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to speak on the motion put forward by the hon. member 
for Mission-Coquitlam who raises some very important issues. 
First, there is the question of confidence mentioned in her 
motion. Solidarity is the corner stone of party discipline which 
is the guiding principle behind the party system in Canada.
<P>
	The system of government in Canada is based on cohesive 
political parties. The Canadian parliamentary system is a system 
of responsible government. The party with a majority in the 
House of Commons must prove that is has the support of the 
majority of members of Parliament. A majority government 
seldom has problems, since the voters have used their power to 
make their wishes known. So, why erode this principle?
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	In a responsible government, the party in office is mandated 
by the voters to implement a specific legislative agenda. How 
can members think they can better serve their constituents by 
choosing not to support their own political party? Party 
discipline is linked to the concept of responsible government 
and the principle of confidence. The Constitution Act of 1867 
provides Canada with a responsible executive within a 
parliamentary government.
<P>
	In 1983, the Canadian Study of Parliament Group ordered 
Gallup to conduct a poll on public perception of Parliament. It is 
mainly in Quebec that members of Parliament are seen as 
proxies rather than delegates. That is due to the differences in 
the way constituents perceive their elected members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	The issue of freer votes is linked to the role each hon. member 
must play. Freer votes would tend to imply more autonomy for 
individual members of Parliament. Yet, members can express 
their views, for example, before their party caucus, where 
members regularly hold discussions to define and clarify the 
positions to be taken. I do not think that we have been elected to 
reform the parliamentary system of Canada.
<P>
	Of course, a relaxation of party discipline would increase the 
autonomy of backbenchers. But what would the collapse of our 
system give us? Short-sighted freedom. Let us have a look at the 
wording of the motion. It says that the government should 
permit members of the House of Commons to fully represent 
their constituents' views, which suggests that MPs do not 
represent their constituents' views, in short that the present 
system of representation is not working. Why is the member 
making no mention of the notion of party? Are MPs working in 
isolation and did they not explain, during the election campaign, 
the policies they would support? MPs are members of a political 
organisation which they support, they are closely intertwined.
<P>
	Voters who elected the 54 Bloc members voted for the ideas 
the Bloc Quebecois is promoting. They form a strong delegation 
and when I vote, I feel I represent my constituents in the House. 
People in my riding placed their confidence in me because they 
knew what to expect. They voted for a program, they voted for 
the ideas we are promoting here on their behalf.
<P>
	I chose the Bloc Quebecois because this party is in my 
likeness. It opens its arms to anyone who is concerned with the 
well-being of Quebec and tries to promote our country, either 
here or elsewhere. I was elected on a political platform for a 
good reason, I share the ideas promoted by my party, and I 
cannot see how I could be unfaithful to my constituents by doing 
what they elected me for. This way of looking at things opposes 
elements which, far from being contradictory, are in reality 
interconnected. To come to such a conclusion shows a total lack 
of understanding of our political system.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois presented an electoral platform to the 
people of Quebec who, democratically, elected 54 members of 
our party to represent them in the House of Commons. I repeat 
that saying that I am not in touch with my constituents because I 
would be voting with my party is absurd. It negates the fact that I 
belong to a political party that I joined because of a very deep 
conviction. Joining a political party means sharing a vision and 
therefore being stronger. The platform of a political party is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5373"> 5373 </A></B>
<P>
intended to regroup people who have  something in common, 
who share a number of points of view.
<P>
	The people in my riding elected me because I belonged to the 
Bloc Quebecois and I do not see how and for what reason I could 
separate myself from my group. I have a clear mandate from my 
constituents and voting along party line seems only natural. As I 
said, we cannot play the wishes of our constituents against the 
party line because the people who elected us also chose our party 
and our leader. We have a clear and concrete program, and what 
the hon. member is suggesting does not apply to us.
<P>
	The wording of the motion does not take into account the fact 
that those who voted for the Bloc Quebecois share a number of 
objectives. They mandated their member to defend Quebec's 
interests. Obviously, Quebec spoke loud and clear during the 
last election. Quebecers decided to send to Ottawa a large group 
with a clear mandate. We are not an old party, we do not have the 
problems associated with a weak ideological cohesiveness.
<P>
	Our constituents trusted us. They gave us their votes on 
October 25. We are not worn out by years of politicking, and 
unlike others we are not uprooted. We were given a mandate and 
that implies responsibilities. Quebecers exercized their rights 
under a universal suffrage system.
<P>
	As for the amendment by the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, that the motion be amended by 
adding after the word ``should'' the following: ``continue to'', I 
have only one comment. This, Mr. Speaker, is simply playing 
with words, it seems to indicate that members always have the 
possibility to vote as they please. Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois 
is against the amendment and against the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak to this much 
discussed motion again today. The member who introduced the 
motion said in her motion, first of all, that the government 
should permit members of the House of Commons to fully 
represent their constituents' views, and so forth.
<P>
	The motion assumed that members were not doing that, since 
its purpose was to permit them to do something that was 
apparently prohibited before. As was pointed out by the hon. 
member for the Bloc, nothing could be further from the truth. 
Parliamentarians are here to represent the interests of their 
constituents. If they already represent their constituents, they 
need no permission to do so. However, if we dig a little deeper, 
we see there is something else in this motion which asks the 
government to permit members to fully represent their 
constituents' views. If one asks the government, presumably 
this means a member on the government side, because after all, 
the Bloc member opposite seldom asks me, in my capacity of 
Deputy Government Whip, how to vote. Of course this also 
applies to the hon.  member for Mission-Coquitlam, who 
seldom asks me how to vote on a bill, and I do not expect her to.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	So presumably, the hon. member's request was for 
government members to be allowed to vote freely. I do not see 
why she did not mention opposition members. Was this an 
oversight? A few days ago, there was a vote in this House on a 
proposal for a high-speed train between Montreal and Toronto, 
if I remember correctly. The Quebec City-Windsor corridor-of 
course, the train would not be built simultaneously in the entire 
corridor. No one was suggesting that. The proposal was for 
building this high-speed train. We on the government side 
noticed that members of the Bloc Quebecois all voted the same 
way, that members of the Reform Party all voted the same way, 
and that members of the Liberal Party, the government 
members, were the only members to vote on the basis of a free 
vote. Some were in favour and others were against. So it is clear 
the motion should have been amended. Members of the 
government already had the right to vote freely, and they did so 
on that day.
<P>
	There were two options: first, amend the motion to allow 
opposition members to vote freely. After all, members on the 
government side were already voting freely. Or the motion 
would be amended to say that we would continue to permit 
government members to vote freely since they were already 
doing so. That is when I moved my amendment that government 
members be able to continue to vote freely.
<P>
	However, I am always a little worried about members 
opposite. I really would like Reform Party members to be able to 
vote freely as well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	How pleasant it would be if Reform members could vote 
freely as we do in the Liberal caucus. Mr. Speaker, you will 
understand my concern in that regard because they have not yet 
had free votes in the Reform Party. The same applies to the Bloc. 
I only wish that they could vote as freely as we do on the 
government side.
<P>
	In any case the Reform Party now says that the motion should 
be amended so that it would read that the government should 
continue to increasingly permit free votes. I am not sure how one 
does that but I am certainly not against it because government 
members already have that freedom I previously described.
<P>
	I was hoping that the member for the Reform Party would 
amend the motion to finally provide for a means by which 
opposition members could vote freely. That really would have 
been innovative. That would have made the Reform Party a truly 
modern parliamentary institution as is the present government.
<P>
	I guess we will have to wait for that motion to occur some 
other time. Perhaps I could put a motion on the <I>Order Paper</I> 
which would read something like this: ``That this House permits 
the third party to vote freely as does the government''. That 
would be a good motion. I  think my colleague, the member for 
St. Boniface, would agree that it would be a very progressive 
thing to do, to permit opposition members to vote as freely as we 
do on this side of the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5374"> 5374 </A></B>
<P>
	I heard the discourses of hon. members from the Reform Party 
and others. There is a statement or at least an insinuation in there 
to the effect that the rules right now make it such that everything 
is a matter of confidence. Nothing could be further from the 
truth. We have already explained, and I have given evidence, 
how in private members' hour the government side is the only 
side that votes freely. The opposition maybe some day will come 
around to it.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	On the issue of supply days, members know very well that the 
report of the Special Committee on the Reform of the House of 
June 18, 1985 already has made that change to the standing 
orders. It is on pages 106 and 107 and highly commended to the 
people across the way. It is excellent bedside reading. Members 
will know, having read it, that at least as it pertains to supply 
days and opposition days, they are no longer automatically a 
matter of confidence. That was passed on June 18, 1985.
<P>
	I know that the Reform Party is not a progressive bunch but it 
has been nine years. One would think that after nine years even 
its members would have been aware of the change. It is three 
days short of nine years, mind you, because this is June 15, 
1994. It was passed on June 18, 1985. Perhaps over the next 
three days, members will become aware of it.
<P>
	Finally, members of the Reform Party have a misconception 
that works something like this. Government MPs are coerced to 
vote for the government and opposition MPs spontaneously all 
vote the same way without coercion. Of course that is sheer 
nonsense. Members of the Liberal Party vote similarly on many 
issues because fundamentally they believe in the same things. 
Reform members presumably vote similarly because they 
believe in the same things.
<P>
	If members across the way, particularly the member from 
Calgary who is paying close attention to this and I think is 
getting ready to take copious notes, do not realize this and if the 
hon. member thinks that government members are somehow 
coerced into voting in a similar way then surely the argument 
has to be extended to say he does it too. After all, I understand he 
is the deputy leader of his party. Therefore he would probably be 
in a position to dictate to other members of his party.
<P>
	Members can see that the arguments presented by the 
members across just do not work. When they say the 
government members should be voting more freely, they should 
put a mirror in front of the first desk in the House and look 
within to see that in their own party they, least of any political 
party in the House of Commons, have anything that could even 
be remotely considered a free vote.
<P>
	On the other hand, we in our party have proven in the past and 
the voting record of the House would demonstrate that we have 
voted freely on the government side. Such has not happened 
either in the Reform nor in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I am not trying to defend the Bloc. That is the last thing I 
would ever do, as most members know, but at least they do not 
pretend they are doing otherwise. The member has given an 
excellent discourse on how he believes the constitutional 
conventions have worked traditionally and how a party stands as 
a unit and how it works that way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of course I think he took this assumption a little further than it 
should be taken, but in any event, at least he did not claim to go 
against the party line. But when I hear the Reform Party, for 
instance, that wants to set rules for others which the party itself 
is not prepared to follow, I say: Let us not get carried away!
<P>
	Hon. members opposite know perfectly well that Liberal 
members in this House were elected with an excellent prime 
minister and a red book we are now busy implementing. We 
intend to offer the people of Canada good government, while 
exercising the freedom I just described in the last few minutes.
<P>
	I intend to indicate to this House that as far as I am concerned, 
I will support the motion on the amendment to the amendment as 
moved by the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a 
point of order, can you tell me how much time I have? I gather 
we are near the end of this.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member will have 
until 6.39 or approximately five to six minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. I 
am addressing the motion of the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam to permit free votes more frequently in the 
Chamber, specifically for MPs to fully represent the views of 
their constituents of the government's legislative program, and 
that a defeat of the government not automatically be considered 
a measure of confidence.
<P>
	I am happy to follow the previous speaker, the hon. member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, not only because he 
endowed a promotion on me today but because he raised a 
number of issues that are crying with such misinformation that 
they demand a response. I am happy to do so if anyone is still 
watching after that particular discourse.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5375"> 5375 </A></B>
<P>
	The member gave an example of what occurred in Parliament, 
that there has not been very much cross party voting. It is a good 
illustration of what we are talking about here. The motion does 
not talk about members wildly firing off in all directions on 
every particular issue. It implies that under certain conditions 
and for very particular reasons of constituent representation we 
would expect and allow members of various parties to represent 
those views.
<P>
	So far, as we all know, the government has presented a very 
light legislative agenda to the House. The issues that are 
divisive between the parties have in every single case touched 
directly upon the program on which we as members of the 
Reform Party and which they as members of the Liberal Party 
were elected.
<P>
	The one instance the member provided of some free voting in 
the House was when three Liberal members broke with the 
government to vote different from government members on one 
particular private member's motion which he chastises our party 
for not having split on. That particular motion was that we build 
an expensive infrastructure of high speed rail between Windsor 
and Quebec City. Given the ridings of members of Parliament of 
the Reform Party, it is not hard to figure out that they would be 
unwilling unanimously and freely to agree to such a ridiculous 
proposition from the point of view of their own constituents.
<P>
	That should clear up some of the misconceptions raised about 
free voting and about what it means. Voting freely, which we 
favour and which we have advocated, is not that we would vote 
stupidly as the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
suggested.
<P>
	The second point that really should be made concerns 
background. We should remember when we get into notions of 
cabinet confidence and caucus solidarity a bit of history. I 
seriously hope the member is not trying to convince the House 
and Canadians that there is no such thing as confidence in the 
Chamber today, any more than there is no such thing as parties. 
These kinds of positions are maybe legalistic but clearly 
ridiculous.
<P>
	Historically the function of confidence has changed 
dramatically. We should remember that in the early days of the 
parliamentary system the purpose of the confidence convention 
was to ensure that ministers of the crown, who originally were 
representatives in a very true sense of the Monarch, had the 
confidence of the elected people to function in their capacities. 
Today the meaning or the context has entirely changed. Today 
the Monarch is not usually a direct participant in the political 
affairs or daily affairs of the nation. The cabinet is 
representative of the outcome of general elections. The cabinet 
confidence and the confidence convention applied to the 
Chamber in this day and age is not to make cabinet report to the 
House. It has been turned around in the new context to make the 
House responsible to cabinet. That is the problem we have to 
look at.
<P>
	I fully support the motion. We should give some thought to 
why it is, in spite of the legalistic declarations that appear in 
some of the standing orders and others, that the confidence 
convention has not been broken. We should ask ourselves what 
needs to be done to create a new kind of system.
<P>
	We have suggested from time to time that the Prime Minister 
could rise and suggest to the House that there be the freedom to 
vote more freely. It is true, but in and of itself it is not adequate. 
It suggests that the Prime Minister possesses such power that he 
or she could simply determine whether or not votes were free 
and, that raises questions about whether votes really are free.
<P>
	There are a number of mechanisms in other countries; the 
three line whips in Great Britain, the fact that political 
parliamentary parties are organized on a more bottom-up basis 
in countries like Australia. This allows a very different style of 
leadership to emerge whereby it is not just the formalities of 
practice that apply but there are real issues of diversity of power 
within political parties that give members greater say and a 
greater ability to represent their constituents, particularly where 
those conflict with more broad party interests that are not 
necessarily representative.
<P>
	There is a lot I want to say on this issue of how we should 
examine the deficiencies of the power structure. Unfortunately, 
I do not have the time. I appreciate the Chair's patience and I 
will terminate my remarks now.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for Calgary West. I would like to extend to the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam, whose private members' motion it is, 
M-89, the opportunity to close the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to sum up 
today. This is my first experience with having a motion drawn in 
a private members' situation and I am honoured that it was 
deemed to be a votable one.
<P>
	I and members of the Reform have really enjoyed debating 
this issue that is so dear to our hearts with other members in the 
House. I respectfully urge all members to support Motion 89, for 
this is why we are here in the House, to democratically make 
change. Nothing is stagnant. I am not asking to make change for 
the sake of change, but relaxation of the confidence convention 
will result in a more accountable and workable House of 
Commons. I urge everyone to support us on this motion.
