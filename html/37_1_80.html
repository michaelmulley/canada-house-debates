	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our response to the tragic events in the United States
					 cannot be limited to avenging this one atrocity. We cannot simply launch a
					 quick retaliatory strike against the immediate culprits. Canada must, as
					 President Bush has promised Americans, launch a massive and sustained campaign
					 against international terrorism in general. However, as pointed out numerous
					 times in the House yesterday, our security and intelligence agencies, like our
					 national defence forces, have been starved for so long that the Canadian public
					 is not confident that we have the capacity to fight such a sustained
					 war.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not confident that our present laws allow for
					 apprehension and retention of terrorists and their associates. Therefore, today
					 the Canadian Alliance asks the Government of Canada to immediately consider the
					 question of anti-terrorism legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that this request was not
					 born solely out of last week's events. We on this side of the House have been
					 urging the Liberal government for some time to get tough with organized
					 criminals, to eradicate senseless acts of violence, to effectively close the
					 doors to undesirable migrants who so readily and easily take advantage of our
					 generosity, and also to make aiding and abetting terrorists an
					 offence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed, I will say to you, Mr. Speaker, and
					 to my colleagues that I mean no disrespect or animosity toward any of the many
					 of the legitimate and trustworthy immigrants making Canada their home. We know
					 that the vast majority of these people are law abiding citizens who have and
					 will continue to contribute to the economic well-being of our nation as well as
					 the cultural mosaic of the country. I refer only to those individuals who seek
					 Canada as a stage, a stage to wage war against the United States and other
					 nations.</p>

	I asked the government a number of months ago to
					 introduce and enact legislation that would make it hard for terrorists and
					 their supporters to get here and stay here, and furthermore to make it
					 impossible for terrorist supporters to raise money while here. I also asked
					 that for those caught supporting terrorist activities in any way, shape or
					 form, here or abroad, criminal charges with severe penalties be handed
					 down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solicitor general rejected such recommendations. He
					 did so despite knowing from intelligence sources that terrorist groups from
					 around the world were and are extremely active in Canada, raising funds for
					 bomb plots or other violent activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated earlier, we are formally asking that the
					 government immediately consider the question of anti-terrorism legislation
					 similar in principle to the United Kingdom's terrorism act 2000. That
					 legislation provides for the following: first, the naming of all known
					 international terrorist organizations operating in Canada; second, a complete
					 ban on fundraising activities in support of terrorism and provisions for the
					 seizure of assets belonging to terrorists or terrorist organizations; third,
					 the immediate ratification of the International Convention for the Suppression
					 of the Financing of Terrorism; fourth, the creation of specific crimes for
					 engaging in terrorist activities in Canada or inciting terrorist activities
					 abroad; fifth, the prompt extradition of foreign nationals charged with acts of
					 terrorism, even if the charges are capital offences; sixth, the detention and
					 deportation to their country of origin of people illegally in Canada or who are
					 failed refugee claimants who have been linked to terrorist
					 organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lead critic for the official opposition, I am asking
					 the solicitor general to effectively equip, adequately fund and sufficiently
					 empower CSIS and the RCMP. We must ensure that our first lines of defence
					 against terrorism can do their job, including all emerging threats. What types
					 of threats? There is perhaps the threat of anthrax, the threat of a potentially
					 deadly biological weapon for terrorists, which could decimate the population of
					 any metropolitan area. Yet despite general security warnings in 1998 regarding
					 the possibility of anthrax being brought into this country, the government has
					 done nothing to prepare us against a potential attack.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recommended by an expert from John Hopkins
					 University, we should be stockpiling drugs and vaccines and developing and
					 distributing rapid tests for agents and we should come up with effective ways
					 of isolating infected people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 11, the world received a huge wake up
					 call, one so powerful that this government had no choice but to react. There
					 have been other times. There have been other attempts to provide wake up calls.
					 CSIS has tried in the past to wake a slumbering government, but the government
					 has reached out and hit the snooze button.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSIS tried to warn the government and provide a wake up
					 call in regard to the growing threat of terrorism, the more sophisticated acts
					 of terrorism; however, the government hit the snooze button. CSIS tried to wake
					 up the government in regard to its caseload, how it did not have enough
					 resources and how it has to risk manage the threats, but the government hit the
					 snooze button.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance has tried to wake a slumbering
					 government in regard to bills, criminal acts and terrorism. In disdain the
					 government has reached out and hit the snooze button.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCMP tried to provide a wake up call when they said
					 8,000 Tamil tigers were living and training in Toronto. The government reached
					 out and hit the snooze button, except of course for our finance minister who
					 happened to be out for lunch with them at the time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCMP also complained about the crippling effects of
					 few dollars and limited resources, but the government hit the snooze
					 button.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will concede that this government is now awake, but
					 the question remains, will the government remain awake or will it roll over and
					 go back to sleep?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this really the end of the age of complacency? Time
					 will tell.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the
					 opposition's subject choice for the debate today. I personally support the
					 motion that we review all the things we have done in the House in the area of
					 anti-terrorism legislation, et cetera. With so many members wanting to speak
					 today I will need to make my three points in a short period.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I support the Prime Minister. Whatever we do
					 must be in keeping with the value system of the country and especially to be
					 ultra sensitive to the multicultural reality. When we make our recommendations
					 for CSIS and the RCMP, we must make sure that in their future staffing they
					 will reflect the multicultural reality of our country because that could be a
					 good resource for exchanging information with other countries involved in
					 terrorist activities as well as our own.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to acknowledge the right hon. leader of the
					 Conservative Party who yesterday said that the debate was an exercise for all
					 parliamentarians. I totally support that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we as members of parliament should not just
					 listen to our trusted officials, whether they be with immigration, CSIS, the
					 RCMP or even experts with our embassies abroad. I know nothing about this issue
					 but we know that countries have been experiencing this problem over the last
					 many years. We have been sheltered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe elected MPs have a unique opportunity to
					 develop good anti-terrorist legislation. My view is that we should visit our
					 elected counterparts in the countries that have been experiencing terrorism for
					 many years. We should learn from their experience and get their ideas so that
					 whatever legislation we develop has the benefit of world expertise. Those are
					 my comments to the opposition.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, now is the time when we are called to
					 action. Now is not the time to begin a committee structure and do a lot of
					 travelling. Yes, we do need to look at what other countries have done. We need
					 to emulate countries that have provided anti-terrorism, such as the one that is
					 already there in the United Kingdom. The United States also has an
					 anti-terrorist bill. I think it brought in an effective ant- terrorism and
					 capital punishment bill in 1996.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at all countries that are dealing with
					 terrorism but we also need to let the world know today that we stand shoulder
					 to shoulder with our American friends and closest neighbour, and that we will
					 do everything within our power to stand beside them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern is the levels of CSIS and the RCMP. Since
					 1997 I think we have lost 2,200 RCMP personnel. We have lost $175 million in
					 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police budget and $133 million from CSIS.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about commitment, the Canadian public is
					 looking at the government and asking how big a commitment it has against
					 terrorism acts when every budget is being cut.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is the time for the solicitor general to ask the
					 government to put in place the appropriate measures to fund CSIS and the RCMP
					 and to be sure that our first and frontline of defence is prepared.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, yesterday this House presented a united
					 front. All MPs deplored the terrible attacks against innocent victims that took
					 place a week ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were united in our grief. We were united in our
					 compassion. We were united in our desire to solve the problem. Now, however, we
					 must move from those emotions that united us to concrete policies that will
					 help us to move on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will still be united as far as some of those
					 solutions are concerned, but others will find us less so. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing in which there was unanimity was that the
					 events of September 11 have changed the world and now we must ask the tough
					 question of how these tragic events must change our laws and our
					 policies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acts that launched this debate were committed in
					 the United States. The perpetrators may have come from many countries in the
					 Middle East and Europe and their deeds may yet lead to Canadian forces fighting
					 overseas, but the war against terrorism begins here at home in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After last week, even a country like Canada, which is
					 used to thinking of itself as a peaceful and non-violent country, finds itself
					 at risk. Of course, we are not immune. We did have the tragic Air India bombing
					 which killed 329 people. That originated in Canada. Thankfully we have not
					 often seen lethal acts of terrorism on our soil. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However other countries have not been so fortunate.
					 They have had the bitter experience of dealing with terrorism and have been
					 forced to modernize their laws to deal with these threats. Two countries with
					 very similar democratic values to our own, the United Kingdom and the United
					 States, have already brought in comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation. While
					 the events of last week show strong laws alone will not in all cases stop
					 determined terrorists, they can at least give to police, prosecutors, border
					 security and others the tools they need to fight terrorists and terrorism. We
					 must examine and learn from the experience of our British and American allies
					 and see where their legislation could possibly be a model for our
					 own.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996 in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, the
					 United States did bring in comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation in the form
					 of the anti-terrorism and effective death penalty act which was signed by
					 President Clinton.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada the interdepartmental intelligence policy
					 group reviewed the U.S. legislation in 1997 and made a conclusion saying that
					 the need for such a scheme could not be established. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000 the United Kingdom, which already had strong
					 anti-terrorism legislation on the books at that time to deal with the threat of
					 the IRA, brought in new sweeping anti-terrorism legislation to deal with
					 international terrorism that could possibly be operating within the U.K.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition has pointed to the British
					 terrorism act of 2000 as an example of the kind of effective legislation that
					 Canada should look at, but so far the government has not chosen to emulate the
					 example of our British friends and our allies. The U.S. and the U.K.
					 governments under the Clinton Democrats and Tony Blair's Labour Party felt that
					 it was possible to bring in comprehensive terrorism legislation without
					 endangering the democratic values that are important to us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that Canada can do no less. We want to
					 support our Prime Minister and the government in terms of this type of
					 legislation and approach. This is not about posturing politically. This is
					 about being able to stand tall together and protect our citizens and answer
					 their concerns and their cry for security. This is one of a number of areas.
					 Security of markets is something we will also be pursuing but we need to look
					 at this in terms of security of the person and the people of Canada.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it must contain a comprehensive definition of
					 terrorism. We need a way to distinguish between genuine acts of terrorism,
					 whether committed at home or abroad, from political protest and dissent. Those
					 are two very clearly different things. While the CSIS act does not have a
					 definition of terrorism, we do need a comprehensive definition of terrorism and
					 specific charges associated with it in the Criminal Code of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, effective anti-terrorism legislation must name
					 and outlaw specific terror groups. Both the U.S. and the U.K. legislation do
					 this. It also must take steps to not just outlaw the organizations but to ban
					 fundraising or other support activities. It is not enough just to take away the
					 charitable status, we must ban fundraising for these activities. The government
					 so far has avoided this approach of naming and banning specific terrorist
					 organizations and their front groups. I believe it is the will and the hope of
					 the government to do that. I am optimistic. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to questions from the official opposition on
					 fundraising activities of various groups, we did not always receive favourable
					 responses. We even had a response that CSIS does not provide a list of
					 terrorist organizations and it does not provide a list of people or other
					 organizations that it is targeting. Clearly that needs to change. The solicitor
					 general has implied that the strength of Canadian law and policy is to not name
					 those groups. In fact I think we would all agree now that it is a
					 weakness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.K. and the U.S. legislation provide specific
					 lists of terror groups and outlaws their activities. We must do the
					 same.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998 CSIS stated that some 50 international
					 terrorist groups were operating in Canada and that the names included some of
					 the most deadly enemies of peace and democracy in the world today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the groups that were banned by the British
					 terrorism act of 2000 and are known to have operated and do operate in Canada,
					 according to CSIS documents, are the Babbar Khalsa, the International Sikh
					 Youth Federation, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil , Hisbullah, Hamas, the
					 Kurdistan Workers Party and the Irish Republican Army. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kelly report, a recent report from the Senate
					 special committee, stated in 1999 that “Canada is a primary venue of
					 opportunity to support, plan, or mount terrorist attacks”. Contrary to what
					 some people wishfully think, what happened in New York can happen here, perhaps
					 even worse. Attacks like the New York attack could be planned and orchestrated
					 from Canadian soil by groups attempting to take advantage of the weaknesses of
					 our legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada signed the UN International Convention for the
					 Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism of 1999. We need to do more. We need
					 to take extra steps in that regard.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-16, which is before parliament, would make it
					 possible to strip of their not for profit status certain groups that are
					 financing terrorism. This is, of course, a good start, but we are still very
					 far from true anti-terrorism legislation that would ban fundraising in support
					 of terrorism in Canada and would eliminate the presence of such groups within
					 this country. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-terrorism legislation should not simply ban
					 terrorist fundraising but all kinds of support activities. That would include
					 training activities, recruiting, propaganda or communications. Terrorist groups
					 should not be permitted to use Canadian Internet web servers to promote their
					 cause or communicate through their supporters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British legislation calls and creates new crimes
					 for members of terrorist groups. We need to look at these areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also change our laws regarding the extradition
					 of suspected terrorists. Terrorism is a world without borders. We cannot let
					 Canada become a safe haven for those who would rely on the humanitarian
					 compassion of Canadian laws and yet avoid justice in their own countries or the
					 countries where they have committed crimes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a government like the United States seeks people
					 accused of terrorism in Canada we must be convinced that there is reasonable
					 evidence. This is a very important point and I know some of our colleagues in
					 the House have some sensitivity on this. If there is reasonable evidence, we
					 should turn terrorists over regardless of the fact that they may face a penalty
					 in that country, for instance in the United States, that would not apply here.
					 That move would require a change in Canadian law to send a signal to terrorists
					 that they cannot take advantage of Canada to avoid facing justice for their
					 crimes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can only imagine the outrage if one of the
					 perpetrators of the acts in New York and Washington, perhaps even the criminal
					 mastermind who so carefully co-ordinated the flight schedules of the
					 terrorists, found his way to Canada and we found ourselves unable to extradite
					 such a person to the United States to face justice. Canadian law must address
					 this possibility now because Canadian citizens will demand it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are only some of the areas that we must address.
					 Over the weeks ahead the official opposition will continue to ask for the kinds
					 of changes that we feel are necessary to restore confidence to our citizens,
					 confidence in safety and security, confidence in the markets and confidence
					 that we continue to grow both socially and economically. However the one thing
					 we cannot afford is complacency. As Edmund Burke famously said “all that is
					 necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing laws alone will not stop terrorism. We are
					 legislators and drafting and changing laws is what we do. Let it not be said
					 after the next horrific terrorist incident that it happened because the good
					 men and good women of the House chose to do nothing.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I return to my earlier question to the
					 leader of Her Majesty's loyal opposition. With respect, I did not feel the
					 answer was clear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the review of the RCMP and the Canadian
					 Security Intelligence Service. They obviously will need more resources, more
					 staff and more agents. Does the Canadian Alliance support the notion that the
					 agencies should reflect the multicultural reality of the country as they
					 rebuild themselves?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, we have been out of touch with the
					 terrorist activities which have been happening in many countries around the
					 world for many years. Those countries, our elected counterparts, could be a
					 tremendous source of information that would allow us to craft good legislation
					 here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Leader of the Opposition and his party
					 support the notion that elected members of parliament should visit our
					 counterparts in those countries to make sure that whatever legislation we craft
					 here has the benefit of their years of experience of seeing terrorism on a
					 firsthand basis?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-48990"></A><a HREF="#Int-48993"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-48989"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Stockwell Day:
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, those are two important questions. First,
					 regarding whether the hiring practices of CSIS and the RCMP should reflect the
					 ethnic and cultural diversity of our country, it is more important to respect
					 that than to reflect it. The Canadian Alliance does not agree with policies of
					 blind affirmative action. It has not been proven to lead to the best
					 performance in any area, venture or enterprise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are sound reasons, and there are, we would
					 want to make sure there were members of various groups within CSIS and the RCMP
					 that understood the various components of Canadian society. That would make the
					 operation a better one. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we do not support strictly conforming to what
					 have been shown to be failed policies of blind affirmative action. That has
					 proven to be counterproductive. We want this to be the most productive means
					 possible. Engaging people from across the spectrum is a way of doing
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on the question of visiting other
					 jurisdictions, we want to make very clear that we want action in this regard.
					 When we agreed to look at the wording of the original motion and add that it
					 should go to a committee and a draft should be prepared, we agreed because we
					 sensed there was goodwill from all members of the House to have legislation
					 such as this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we are careful to acknowledge that when the
					 public sees members of parliament send something to committee it is often the
					 death knell of that initiative. The public is more than aware of the
					 glacier-like speed of government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned about that. That is why the dates are
					 there. There must be a date, which we have affixed to this amendment, outlining
					 the various stages at which the bill must move along. If there is to be travel
					 to other jurisdictions to gain expertise, that is fine. However it must be
					 within the dates we have laid out within the amendment.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my question is for the learned Leader of
					 the Opposition. The definition of terrorism is in many instances nebulous. In
					 Northern Ireland the political wing of a terrorist organization, Sinn Fein on
					 behalf of the IRA, takes part in the political process. This is something I am
					 sure we will need to delve into in great detail when we examine the question at
					 the committee level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Leader of the Opposition have any insights he
					 could share with us on this point? How can we define terrorism in a suitably
					 precise way? Examples in recent days go beyond the pale, but certain activities
					 in the world operate close to the edge of what we in North America would define
					 as terrorism.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-48996"></A><a HREF="#Int-48998"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-48993"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Stockwell Day:
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the member for
					 Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough raises a key concern. One of the challenges and
					 dilemmas facing legislators continually is the question of security. We know,
					 and it has been stated by others who have drafted legislation that has stood
					 for 200 years, that any time people are willing to give up freedom for security
					 they risk losing both. That is why we must be careful to make sure our citizens
					 are secure but that freedom is respected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why defining terrorism is so important. There
					 are groups that will protest government, and so they should. We must be careful
					 that we do not tread into areas of justified protest, even at times loud or
					 uncomfortable protest that we do not like.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not speculate today on what the definition
					 should be, but it should contemplate the concerns raised by the member that we
					 do not intrude into areas of freedom. Groups to whom we may be opposed in
					 principle or in politics must be allowed the freedom to clearly do what they
					 do. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism can and must be defined in a way that is
					 acceptable. These are some of the variations we will need to look at carefully
					 to protect our freedoms.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My compassion and my prayers go first of all to those
					 who have been directly affected by these acts of terrorism.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, I share with many a sense of loss for the
					 world we took for granted before last Tuesday. Concern for national security,
					 for freedom and for peace are now foremost in our minds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days since and the days to come our thoughts
					 will move between sorrow, despair, anger and worry. I sincerely hope that from
					 all this we will be able to build, in partnership with other nations, a
					 stronger world community. We must take further steps to fight terrorism so that
					 those who commit these crimes understand that we will not be paralyzed by their
					 acts of aggression.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to this tragedy is a worldwide challenge and
					 the government is prepared to do its part in meeting it. The safety and
					 protection of all people is of the highest priority to the
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canada's Attorney General and Minister of Justice, I
					 pledge to lend my full co-operation to the attorney general of the United
					 States, my colleague John Ashcroft, and to provide the support necessary to
					 further the efforts of the world community to confront terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the United States, we too share a commitment to
					 freedom and the rule of law and are committed to overcome the efforts of
					 terrorists to weaken these pillars of democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date Canada has been reasonably secure from
					 terrorist incidents within its borders, but we have not been immune. It is
					 important that we have effective tools in place to keep Canada free of
					 terrorists and that we have mechanisms for co-operating with our closest
					 neighbour, the United States, and the larger international
					 community.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, Canada has always worked with the United
					 States and the international community to develop international agreements and
					 conventions, as well as developing its own domestic anti-terrorist legislation.
					 </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the international level Canada has a long history of
					 working in concert with the international community to pursue initiatives that
					 reduce the threat posed by international terrorists. Canada has signed all 12
					 UN counterterrorist agreements. Ten of these have already been ratified,
					 including those that target unlawful acts committed on aircraft, unlawful acts
					 of violence at airports serving civil aviation, actions threatening civil
					 aviation and the unlawful seizure of aircraft. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently completing the ratification process of
					 the remaining two agreements, the convention for the suppression of terrorist
					 bombings and the international convention for the suppression of financing of
					 terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convention for the suppression of terrorist
					 bombings covers new offences relating to the targeting of public places,
					 transportation systems, government or infrastructure facilities with explosives
					 or other lethal devices. It will require states that have ratified the
					 convention to criminalize these offences when committed outside their borders
					 and prosecute or extradite offenders found within their borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international convention for the suppression of
					 financing of terrorism is intended to cut terrorists off from the financial
					 support that permits them to continue to operate. The convention requires state
					 parties to make it a crime for a person to provide or collect funds with the
					 knowledge that they might be used in terrorist activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our signature on these conventions is a commitment by
					 Canada to move forward to their ratification. I anticipate bringing
					 implementing legislation before parliament that will allow us to prosecute
					 these offences in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to participating in the development of
					 international protections against terrorism Canada has undertaken several
					 bilateral commitments with the United States. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These include the Canada-U.S. cross-border crime forum
					 which furthers co-operation and information sharing between Canada and the
					 United States in the fight against transnational crime; the U.S.-Canadian
					 Consultative Group on Counterterrorism which furthers collaboration between
					 agencies and departments of both governments that are involved in the fight
					 against terrorism; and the Canada-U.S. mutual legal assistance treaty and the
					 Canada-U.S.A. extradition treaty which facilitate our ability to work together
					 to fight terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also several domestic laws under my
					 jurisdiction that are relevant to our counterterrorist policies. Hijacking,
					 murder and other acts of violence can be prosecuted under the criminal code. As
					 well, the criminal code has been amended to give Canadian courts the
					 jurisdiction to try terrorist crimes committed abroad to ensure that terrorists
					 are denied sanctuary and brought to justice after the commission of a terrorist
					 crime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criminal code already provides powers to law
					 enforcement officers to assist them in protecting and keeping the peace. I have
					 also introduced organized crime legislation, Bill C-24, which is now in the
					 Senate. Provisions in the bill would allow designated law enforcement officers
					 investigating terrorist activity to undertake certain activities that would
					 otherwise be illegal. The measures have been carefully crafted to protect us
					 against and prevent organized crime while at the same time maintaining law
					 enforcement accountability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapidly evolving technologies are being used to shield
					 unlawful activities including terrorism. Although current provisions of the
					 criminal code provide grounds to lawfully intercept communications and to
					 search and seize information in computer systems, new and constantly changing
					 technologies challenge our capacity to do so. We are working to develop better
					 methods to counter the use of information technologies that facilitate and
					 assist terrorist activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these criminal code protections it is my
					 intention to propose amendments to the Official Secrets Act. These will address
					 intelligence gathering activities by foreign states and terrorist groups that
					 could threaten Canada's essential infrastructures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, I am planning to propose amendments to the
					 Canada Evidence Act to better govern the use and protection of information that
					 would be injurious to national security were it disclosed. These amendments
					 would also protect information given to us in confidence by our
					 allies.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we search for effective means of security, privacy
					 issues will be important. My department has been reviewing the privacy regime
					 in Canada and in the course of this work the balance between the privacy and
					 safety of Canadians will be a key consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enormity of last Tuesday's tragedy provokes extreme
					 emotions in all of us. We cannot let terrorism and the fear of future terrorist
					 acts justify casting aside the values upon which our great country has been
					 built and from which it derives so much of its strength and richness,
					 democracy, freedom of belief, freedom of political opinion, justice and
					 equality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we respond to last Tuesday's attack and as we take
					 measures to ensure our safety and keep Canada free from terrorists we must
					 remember not to blame. As the Prime Minister said, we must remember that we are
					 in a struggle against terrorism, not against any one community or faith. We
					 must reaffirm Canada's fundamental values, the equality of every race, every
					 colour, every religion and every ethnic origin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's strength lies in its ability to accept
					 difference and to recognize our common humanity. Let us continue to nurture our
					 respect for justice and respect for diversity. We have always governed
					 ourselves by the rule of law, abiding by its even-handed guidance even in the
					 face of brutal actions that belie all that civil society stands for. We must
					 continue to do so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule of law reflected in the laws and conventions I
					 have referred to today is a fundamental part of the framework that will bring
					 the perpetrators of terrorism to justice and preserve the values for which we
					 all stand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have mentioned at the beginning that I am
					 splitting my time with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General of
					 Canada.</p>

					 what more can be done to make sure we are doing all that we can to protect
					 Canadians and Canadian interests from terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What more can be done to ensure that Canada stands with
					 its friend and neighbour, the United States of America, in this fight? What
					 more can be done to encourage the creation of an international net so tight
					 that no terrorist can escape?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new millennium the world community is
					 witnessing great turmoil including the increasing use of violence for political
					 and ideological purposes. As a government and a nation we understand that our
					 domestic safety and well-being are very much tied to global security. Our
					 situation is shared by all western democracies. Our wealth, values,
					 institutions, rights and freedoms make us an attractive venue for terrorist
					 support activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are not alone in our resolve to redouble our
					 efforts to take the kind of action that will preserve our way of life: the
					 values, beliefs, hopes and dreams of free and civilized people wherever they
					 live. Our shared commitment remains to strengthen co-operation and action at
					 the domestic and international levels, and to better anticipate, defend against
					 and defeat terrorist threats. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together through our solidarity we will prevail in the
					 war against terrorism. We will prevail because we have in place the
					 institutions, the expertise and the strong international working relationships
					 we will need to continue to muster in the days, weeks and months to come.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister said in the House yesterday, we
					 have the patience and resolve to deal effectively with the threat of terrorism
					 through a measured and sustained response. Let us make no mistake. We will
					 prevail.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know Canadians are up to the task. We have seen this
					 so profoundly in the last week through the acts of compassion of ordinary
					 Canadians across this great country of ours, in the words of unity and support
					 from all Canada's leaders, and in the continuing work of Canadian men and women
					 whose jobs are devoted to upholding public safety and security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's national security structure has many
					 components involving many departments, agencies and levels of government, each
					 with a critical partnership role to play. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal efforts to counter terrorism draw on the
					 resources of the portfolio of the Solicitor General of Canada through the
					 national security directorate, the expertise and advice of the Canadian
					 Security Intelligence Service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the
					 broader federal counterterrorist community. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the key partners within this group include the
					 departments of foreign affairs and international trade, justice, citizenship
					 and immigration, national defence, health, transport, and the Canada Customs
					 and Revenue Agency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Department of the Solicitor General that is
					 responsible for the national counterterrorism plan which is practised through
					 operational exercises conducted as part of the ongoing readiness program
					 managed by that department. Through its emphasis on co-operation and
					 co-operative action to ensure readiness to new and emerging threats, the
					 operational readiness program is an important tool for creating broad based
					 understanding and engagement in our national counterterrorism arrangements, and
					 for ensuring they are as effective as they possibly can be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practical terms this means working at the local
					 level with police, firefighters and emergency health services, and at the
					 international level with our allies through exchanging intelligence and
					 tactical information to improve our domestic preparedness and response
					 capability. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada continues to develop and
					 implement a range of tough new measures that will make it more difficult for
					 terrorists to use Canada as a base for terrorist activities.</p>


	<A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1100)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the investments in Canada's ability to combat
					 terrorism is important proposed legislation known as Bill C-16, which contains
					 a broadly based and integral part aimed at the suppression of terrorism. The
					 bill proposes measures to deny charitable status to those groups that might
					 seek to abuse Canada's charities registration system by collecting funds to
					 support terrorist organizations and their activities around the
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementing these measures will allow Canada to
					 fulfill its commitments toward implementing an international convention aimed
					 at cutting off sources of funding in support of terrorist
					 activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year the federal government established
					 the Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Preparedness.
					 This was done to develop and implement a comprehensive approach to protecting
					 Canada's critical infrastructure in both its physical and cyber dimensions
					 regardless of the source of threats and vulnerabilities. This new entity will
					 play an important ongoing role in Canada's national security network and will
					 be an important partner in international efforts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last year the federal government allocated $1.5
					 billion to the RCMP, CSIS, CIC, and other Canadian security and safety partners
					 to ensure that they continue to have the tools required to do their jobs
					 effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to collaborative partnerships with the
					 United States of America. Canada is committed to taking a leadership role in
					 strengthening international co-operation aimed at preventing terrorist acts.
					 This is most clearly reflected in the strong alliance between Canada and the
					 United States in the fight against international terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RCMP, CSIS, local police, customs, immigration and
					 transport officials work daily, hourly and by the minute with their American
					 counterparts each and every day around the clock. They are dedicated to
					 ensuring the safety and security of all our citizens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint investigations and operations and the sharing of
					 information and intelligence characterize the unique and strongly collaborative
					 relationship between our two great countries. These activities are firmly
					 rooted in continued dialogue and co-ordinated action at the policy and
					 operational levels by national law enforcement, intelligence, security, customs
					 and immigration agencies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and the United States have and will continue to
					 have a long record of successful collaboration in combating terrorism and
					 transnational crime. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of practical examples of partnership
					 initiatives that have contributed to the success: for example, the shared
					 border accord which encourages the flow of people and goods across the border
					 while protecting the health and safety of Canadians and Americans alike and,
					 for example, the cross-border crime forum, an achievement unique in the world
					 for its success in furthering co-operation and information sharing between our
					 two countries in the fight against transnational crime and other emerging
					 cross-border security issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his visit to Canada this past summer to take part in
					 this annual event, American Attorney General John Ashcroft underlined his
					 country's gratitude for the continuing collaboration of the Canadian
					 authorities in the fight against terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bilateral consultative group on countererrorism
					 also brings together agencies and departments in both governments engaged in
					 the fight against terrorism to enhance collaboration, co-operation and
					 information sharing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada has pledged its complete
					 co-operation with the United States and other international authorities in
					 finding those responsible for these horrific attacks and strengthening
					 international security co-operation to prevent such a catastrophe from ever
					 happening again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a complex, far reaching investigation that
					 reaches into virtually every corner of the globe. At all levels Canadian
					 officials are following up with their American and international counterparts
					 to repeat the Prime Minister's sincere offer with respect to assistance and a
					 pledge for complete co-operation with authorities investigating these
					 unspeakable crimes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians can rest assured that in all we do and in all
					 we will do in the days and weeks to come, we will continue to keep in mind our
					 ultimate priority to ensure the safety and security of the Canadian
					 public.</p>

					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It behooves us to listen to all the speakers before we

					 that it will never ever happen again. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to work in a concerted, careful, co-ordinated

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion that there should be the creation of
					 specific crimes for engaging in terrorism is one that many of us find
					 compelling. In the current criminal code there are offences that would apply.
					 It would have application for murder and for transportation of explosive
					 devices, all of that. The member who engaged in police activity would know that
					 as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the specific offensive nature of terrorism,
					 particularly in light of the horrific events of last week, would the member not
					 agree that delving into the definition of terrorism and the creation of a
					 specific offence would act as a greater deterrent for those who chose to engage
					 in this type of nefarious activity?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform you that I will
					 share my time with the member for Laval Centre, our party's citizenship and
					 immigration critic. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore with sadness that I rise to speak today
					 in this debate on terrorism, following the attacks against the American nation
					 and against the entire system of western values.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go back over the adjectives that might be
					 used to describe such acts. They have almost all been used and, in any case,
					 there are no words powerful enough to express my utter repugnance at actions
					 that are beyond my comprehension in a land of democracy and freedom.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we realize just how shaken the U.S. was last
					 Tuesday as a world power in defence and national security, it makes us stop and
					 think about Canada's ability to fight terrorism effectively with the means
					 currently at its disposal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, our borders have holes in them. Doubtless,
					 the length of the country does not help border control. However, Canada's
					 policy of openness to refugees and its very minimal control over the movements
					 of individuals make them even less secure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With questions such as “Where have you come from? How
					 long have you been gone? and What are you bringing back?”, customs officials
					 are clearly far more concerned with the movement of alcohol and cigarettes than
					 with identifying criminals and terrorists. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the main concern of the Canada Customs
					 and Revenue Agency is to keep tabs on the extra mickey that slips across the
					 border, costing the government a few dollars in lost taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency must change its
					 strategy and focus first and foremost on increasing surveillance on nationals
					 from countries known to be particularly tolerant of terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this does not mean doing ill-timed
					 searches. Discretion is the watchword. In other terms, controls must be
					 tightened, but we must avoid becoming xenophobic and paranoid. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, as the president of CP said on Friday in
					 Calgary:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>For
						  the United States to keep an open border with us, it must have confidence in
						  our ability to maintain the security of our borders. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would draw your attention, as well, to certain
					 passages in the annual report of CSIS for the year 2000, which caught my
					 attention particularly. The report provides at page 7 that, and I
					 quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Canada
						  belongs to international institutions and bodies, participates in peacekeeping
						  missions and hosts major international events, all of which are potential
						  targets for terrorists.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further on, the report states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>—Canadians, now more than ever, are potential victims and Canada
						  a potential venue for terrorist attacks. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of these excerpts are of particular interest, for
					 different reasons, if only when one considers the fact that the next G-8 summit
					 will take place from June 26 to 28, 2002, in Kananaskis, Alberta. Clearly it is
					 imperative that we act and provide for means to ensure the protection of both
					 participants and residents during this summit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This threat is real and cannot be taken lightly. We
					 know that there are terrorist groups planning certain terrorist acts from
					 Canada, and the fact that they are already here makes it that much easier for
					 them to take action. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pages 7 and 8 of the report read:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Individuals with links to international terrorist groups use
						  Canada primarily as a base from which to orchestrate terrorist activities
						  abroad.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not hard to guess why terrorist groups choose to
					 live in Canada to plan their acts. The reason is quite simple. There is no
					 anti-terrorist legislation in Canada. They know that as long as they are on
					 Canadian soil they can act with impunity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example of this is the case of Ahmed Ressam, who
					 organized an attack on the Los Angeles airport while living in Canada without
					 ever being inconvenienced by Canadian authorities. As a matter of fact, Ressam
					 only started having problems when he reached American soil.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only has the Government of Canada demonstrated that
					 it is unable to protect its citizens and its territory, but Canada was also
					 severely criticized by U.S. authorities, who stated that we constituted a
					 threat to their national security.</p>


	<A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1115)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not surprising, when one considers that the
					 only coercive measure relating to terrorism currently in effect in Canada is
					 the deportation of foreign nationals connected to terrorist activities under
					 the Immigration Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, this measure raises another problem. In the
					 Suresh case, which the Supreme Court of Canada heard this past May 22, but on
					 which it has not yet brought down its decision, the court is confronted with
					 the following dilemma. Suresh being suspected of fundraising for a Sri Lankan
					 terrorist group, the preservation of national security would require him to be
					 deported to his country of origin. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since he has made a refugee claim involving
					 fear of torture, returning a refugee in danger of mistreatment to his country
					 would be contrary to all of the principles of human rights defended by the
					 United Nations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the supreme court reaches its decision, it will
					 have to decide whether to move us down to the lowest United Nations ranking as
					 far as the protection of human rights is concerned, or to send the message that
					 Canada constitutes a refuge for all the undesirables of the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With anti-terrorist legislation such as that passed in
					 the United Kingdom—this is just an example—or with a criminal code that deals
					 with terrorist activities, such as the one adopted in France, Suresh could have
					 been punished in Canada. This would have been done in the respect of human
					 rights, while also indicating to terrorists that we are not a haven for them.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such examples, the Bloc Quebecois feels perfectly
					 right in asking the federal government to introduce anti-terrorist legislation
					 that would, of course, respect our fundamental values. Moreover, contrary to
					 what some believe, a more aggressive fight against terrorism does not mean that
					 rights and freedoms would necessarily be affected. For example, the fact that
					 we have a criminal code and that we fight crime does not make Canada a police
					 state.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, when we talk about acts that have teeth and
					 mete out appropriate punishment, we are not talking about something as
					 meaningless, from both a practical and legal point of view, as Bill C-16. It
					 might be useful to remind hon. members that this bill, the object of which is
					 to prevent the funding from Canada of terrorist groups, simply seeks to strip
					 charities taking part in the funding of terrorist activities of their status as
					 registered charities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are confronted with people who, in order to
					 promote an ideology, take pride in sacrificing their own lives by taking
					 thousands of innocent lives, can we seriously believe that the mere fact of
					 preventing an organization from issuing tax receipts can be effective in the
					 fight against terrorism? Once again, the government is much more concerned
					 about tax issues than about safety issues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have very little time left, I will simply say
					 that the Bloc Quebecois cannot agree with the Alliance motion, because in its
					 current wording that motion does not respect the fundamental values advocated
					 by the Bloc Quebecois, which is opposed to the death penalty. </p>

					 Centre, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the debate we are holding today in
					 response to the official opposition motion obviously has an impact on everyone
					 because for one week now Americans, as well as Canadians and Quebecers, have
					 been directly affected. They have realized that we are no longer invulnerable.
					 It is therefore important to take part in this debate in order to establish our
					 values.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin by reiterating what the leader of the Bloc
					 Quebecois said on the day of the attack. His statement encompasses values we
					 hold dear:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The
						  Bloc Quebecois considers that this barbaric act is directed not just against
						  the United States, but against all nations. If those responsible for these
						  horrific deeds believe that they are furthering any sort of cause, they should
						  know that they have achieved the opposite, that they have failed, and that
						  their cause will remain forever stained by the blood of the victims. The Bloc
						  Quebecois will support unconditionally any initiative by the Canadian
						  government to provide assistance to the United States and to the American
						  people, whether for humanitarian purposes or in order to track down the
						  perpetrators and bring them to justice.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any discussion of terrorism has to be about trying to
					 find those responsible for deeds such as those we witnessed on September 11.
					 But, this is no small matter. What is terrorism? Who is a terrorist? When may
					 one be considered a terrorist? All these questions and what we think are the
					 answers must of course be included in a bill, whose purpose will be to prevent
					 terrorism and foil tragic deeds because they threaten the balance and democracy
					 which it has been our privilege to enjoy and which we wish for all of
					 humanity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the reality of terrorism between 1981
					 and 2000, we note that internationally, it reached a peak in 1987. The question
					 which arises is this: Will 2001 be a repeat? In the past five years, there has
					 been an increase in the number of instances of terrorist activity in Asia and
					 in Latin America. Everywhere else, such activity has decreased. Does 2001
					 signal a significant return to earlier levels?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important that Canada take into
					 consideration the fourth recommendation of the UN security council. This
					 recommendation was drafted shortly after the events which concern us and
					 provides that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Calls
						  also on the international community to redouble their efforts to prevent and
						  suppress terrorist acts including by increased cooperation and full
						  implementation of the relevant international anti-terrorist conventions and
						  Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 1269 of 19 October
						  1999.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's debate is in keeping with this logic. As
					 terrorism has neither nationality, border nor respect for human rights, the
					 measures that nations such as ours may take must consider needs and the major
					 international agreements aimed at protecting individual and human
					 rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-16 is currently being considered in committee.
					 It falls within the context of anti-terrorist legislation. We fully expect that
					 Bill C-16 will come back before the House. One of the elements of the motion of
					 the official opposition refers to a total ban on fundraising activities. It is
					 clear that Bill C-16 has a long way to go to totally ban fundraising
					 activities.</p>


	<A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1125)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we must look at the problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a recent international agreement on the
					 elimination of funding for terrorism. Canada has yet to ratify it. It might be
					 useful, if not essential, for Canada to continue to give thought to this. I do
					 not doubt that today's debate will contribute to advancing discussions on this
					 matter, among others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before continuing, I would like to recall here the
					 values Canada considers important. I was very pleased to hear the Prime
					 Minister yesterday reminding Canadians and Quebecers, along with the
					 international community as a whole, that Canada will not back down in matters
					 of human rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day terrorist groups succeed in making a country
					 like Canada back down with respect to human rights will be the day Canada takes
					 an enormous step backwards, in my opinion. Because of this, it is vital to
					 reaffirm the desire of all citizens of Canada and Quebec, and this desire must
					 be affirmed by parliament, to honour international agreements, including the
					 Geneva convention on refugees and the Geneva convention on torture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this spirit, I am sure that the House fully
					 understands the meaning of the amendment proposed by my colleague, the member
					 for 
					 Saint-Bruno--Saint-Hubert, that the words “the prompt
					 extradition of foreign nationals charged with acts of terrorism, even if the
					 charges are capital offences” be struck from the main motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all aware that since the Canadian Charter of
					 Rights and Freedoms was adopted in 1982, the supreme court, in good conscience,
					 rules on what is fair and in compliance with the charter of rights. The ruling
					 handed down in the Burns case, just a few months ago, was very clear on this
					 subject. This is therefore something to which we are fundamentally
					 opposed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We regret that the rigidity of some parliamentarians
					 did not allow for this whole debate on terrorism, on ways to counteract
					 terrorism and to come up with legislation to this effect that would be useful,
					 not perfect, but useful, and all related aspects of terrorism to be fully
					 examined in committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is good and extremely motivating about committee
					 work is that we can, in good faith, discuss important issues, and terrorism is
					 indeed an important issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this spirit, I would like to ask, for the second
					 time, that the House give its unanimous consent to refer this debate on
					 terrorism and the prevention of terrorism to the Standing Committee on Justice
					 and Human Rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the profound values we all share here, I
					 believe, I hope that the House will give its unanimous consent, in the name of
					 justice.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, before I ask a question of my colleague, I
					 too wish to extend my sympathy to those who have been affected by this terrible
					 drama. Many people in my region of Abitibi—Témiscamingue have been affected by
					 this terrorist action as well and are very sensitive to what will happen next.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are concerned, of course, but at the same time
					 they want to see effective action taken against terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, and I believe my colleague will share this
					 opinion, care must be taken to not move too precipitously and to take steps
					 that, while clearing our consciences, might not necessarily be
					 effective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the motion by the Canadian Alliance
					 MPs, reference is made to the necessity of extradition to country of origin of
					 persons charged with acts of terrorism. But there is one thing we do not know:
					 acts of terrorism committed where? Merely on the basis of a charge, they would
					 be returned to their country. A state with the death penalty, or some other
					 place in the world with the death penalty, would charge someone and, merely
					 because he had been charged with an act of terrorism, he would have to be
					 returned to his country. This is contrary to a number of international
					 conventions, ones with which the hon. member is more familiar than myself, I
					 realize.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does she not find it somewhat of an aberration that
					 someone can be returned to his country of origin merely because he has been
					 charged? I would add, just to show how little homework has been done by certain
					 Canadian Alliance MPs in this connection, that the United Kingdom's legislation
					 states that, when a state has the death penalty, extradition is not automatic.
					 The Canadian Alliance seems to be creating the illusion, by the way they have
					 worded their motion, that it is. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hear what my colleague from Laval
					 Centre has to say on this.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-49044"></A><a HREF="#Int-49046"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-49043"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Madeleine
					 Dalphond-Guiral: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, our position is very clear. We will always
					 be opposed to having people in Canada be extradited to a country where they
					 could face the death penalty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know about the recent case of Haroun M'Barek. This
					 young Tunisian, who was denied refugee status, was sent back to Tunisia in
					 early January, even though we had every reason to believe he would be tortured.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, once he was back in his country, our fears were
					 confirmed. In the end, things got better for him, since he is now back in
					 Canada. He arrived at Mirabel airport in early September, following the
					 issuance of a ministerial permit. Canada recognized that it had an
					 international responsibility to people who ask to settle here. In the case of
					 Mr. M'Barek, the mistake was corrected. He is now back in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we fight against torture, which is something
					 despicable, should we not be opposed to the death penalty?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude with a thought. By definition, acts are
					 like men: they are not perfect. As is the case with men and women, we must work
					 to improve them. An act to deal with terrorism in Canada should be the result
					 of a fair, full and vibrant co-operation between all the parties of this House.
					 No parliamentarian wants incidents such as those that recently took place in
					 the United States to happen here, in the United States, in Mexico, in France,
					 in Israel, in Palestine or in Rwanda. No one wants that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore we have a responsibility. I call on our
					 social conscience as parliamentarians and citizens to do a job that we will be
					 proud of.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the floor of the House of Commons is
					 always an interesting place. We see a development in the debate today, which is
					 interesting and which I hope will yet resolve itself in a way that permits the
					 House to speak with one voice on this important matter of anti-terrorism and
					 the need to refer the subject matter of anti-terrorism legislation to the
					 Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened with care earlier to the leader of the
					 official opposition who talked about the need for unity and the fact that what
					 his party was engaged in was not any kind of political posturing, but rather an
					 effort to enable the House of Commons to appropriately act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what has happened so far, but I reserve
					 judgment because the day is not yet out and the jury is not yet in on what the
					 final response of the Alliance will be, is that there certainly seems to be
					 unanimity in the rest of the House about referring the subject matter of
					 anti-terrorism legislation to the justice committee so that the committee, on
					 behalf of all us, can begin the serious work that I think Canadians want us to
					 do, and that it is a good idea to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice members of the House have sought unanimous
					 consent of the House to withdraw the motion that we now have before us and to
					 permit the putting of a motion which would have that effect, and twice that
					 unanimous consent has been denied. I hope that by the end of the day members of
					 the Alliance will see that it is in its interest to agree, but not perhaps in
					 terms of political tactics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Alliance's intent was to make the rest of
					 us look somehow soft on security or terrorism, but I hope it will see that it
					 is in the interest of the country to have the House of Commons act in an
					 appropriate way, both procedurally and politically.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say procedurally because a lot of the concerns I have
					 with the motion that we had before us were not just matters of substance. We
					 certainly had some concerns about the motion, not just in terms of the
					 substance of the motion but also procedurally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were being asked to refer a matter to committee, but
					 in doing so to adopt in principle approval of the anti-terrorism legislation of
					 the United Kingdom. Thinking about this procedurally, without any reference to
					 the substance of the matter, to me this is a bit like having second reading
					 before the matter is even discussed or before we even know what the legislation
					 is. Often we have second reading before we hear witnesses, but we do not have
					 second reading before we have the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Alliance thinks about it for a minute, it will
					 realize that if the government were to have come forward with a motion
					 referring something to committee with this much work of the committee already
					 predetermined, it would say that this is unacceptable, that this was not the
					 kind of motion it could live with and that it would be like a motion which
					 created the maximum possible freedom for the committee to look at whatever it
					 felt was relevant to the issue at hand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that by the end of the day, perhaps by repeated
					 argumentation of this sort and repeated opportunities for the Alliance to show
					 it is serious about having the House act in a unified manner, we may yet be
					 able to agree on a motion to refer the subject matter of anti-terrorism
					 legislation to the justice committee. I do not want to say yet that it is
					 calling the Alliance's bluff with respect to posturing. Someone else may want
					 to say that later in the day, if the situation does not change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few more comments even though I think we have
					 made our position clear. We would like to see the standing committee study this
					 matter. We believe that Canadians expect it of us. It may well be that there
					 are a number of improvements we could make in our security and legislation
					 having to do with anti-terrorism. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of suggestions have been made by the Minister
					 of Justice with respect to things that have to be done in order to bring our
					 legislative regime into compliance with conventions that we have already
					 signed. All this is something the committee could look at. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it passing strange by reference to the motion
					 before us now that by the Alliance's own admission it is not just a question,
					 and in fact it may not be a question, of the need for the kind of legislation
					 that it has laid out. It may also be, and I listened to the Alliance critic on
					 this, a matter of resources and a matter of current laws not being used
					 appropriately, or not being used as extensively as they could be or not being
					 able to be used as extensively as they could be because of a lack of resources.
					 The Alliance critic himself pointed out that this was a problem in his view.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is tempted to ask him where the call came from in
					 Canada's political culture for the radical cuts to government that worked their
					 way through all the departments, including the ones he now laments the weakness
					 of. One is tempted to ask him that question, but let us leave that aside for a
					 minute and say that the motion which we have before us would bind the committee
					 to looking only at what kind of new legislation is needed rather than questions
					 having to do with other issues that the Alliance itself has raised with respect
					 to the adequacy of the resources that the Government of Canada makes available
					 to the agencies and departments that concern themselves with this issue.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, the motion before us is inadequate.
					 However the idea behind it, that the justice committee should have a free,
					 frank, open and concerted look at this subject matter, is a good idea and we
					 are behind it. We hope that the Alliance will permit that to happen by agreeing
					 at some point in the day to the request for unanimous consent to withdraw its
					 motion and move that the subject matter be referred to a committee. That is a
					 good idea.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Alliance is trying to do basically
					 what its members would object to if the government did it, both procedurally
					 and substantively, by presenting us with a kind of omnibus list of all the
					 things that it is sure about. The Alliance does not like it when the government
					 does it. The Alliance does not like it when the government gives us an omnibus
					 list of things which other people are asked to agree to or be made to look bad,
					 or hope that they will be made to look bad. If the Alliance is going to be
					 consistent, it cannot expect to criticize the government when it does this and
					 then do it itself and expect to be free of criticism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, I would certainly urge the
					 critic for the Alliance party, who I see in the House, to consider the wisdom
					 of accepting the suggestion being made by all other parties, that the committee
					 be given a mandate to look at this matter and that the House be given the
					 opportunity by agreement on the part of the Alliance to act in this united way.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would seek the unanimous
					 consent of the House to withdraw the motion now before the House and to move:
					 That the House mandate the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to
					 study the matter of anti-terrorism legislation and report to the House not
					 later than February 12, 2002.</p>

					 In other words, our motion does say we should get it to the committee and
					 fairly fast. That is obviously due to the fact that we now are aware that there
					 is considerable urgency to this issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be concern on the part of members of the
					 House who are opposed to, or are giving an indication that they will probably
					 vote against our motion regarding the six issues. I believe instead of facing
					 it head on they are trying to talk around it and let the Liberal committee come
					 up with legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have specifically stated six items here, each of
					 which deals with terrorist activities. We are not talking about nice people. We
					 are talking about terrorists. We are talking about the type of people who would
					 do what was done last week in the United States. We are saying that it is time
					 we dealt very harshly with these people. Our motion states very clearly that we
					 want the government to create draft legislation which does not omit the
					 specific points on how to deal with terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My intervention is more a comment than a question. I
					 certainly would like the member to respond to why members suggest that they
					 cannot support the motion. It gives the government clear direction on the type
					 of legislation it should draft. The committee still has the power to amend it
					 and the House still has the power at report stage to amend it and get on with
					 the task at hand.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the member who just spoke accuses the
					 government members, and I suppose perhaps myself by implication as well as
					 others who do not agree with him, of not wanting to deal head on with the
					 matters listed in the Alliance motion. We do want to deal with them. We want
					 the committee to deal with them in a way that is not predetermined by the
					 wording of a particular motion. That is the point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member says that it will just be dealt with by a
					 Liberal committee. I hope this is not the case. The member is not demonstrating
					 much confidence in the members of the Alliance on the justice committee and
					 their ability to make a case for whatever arguments they feel they wish to
					 bring to that committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the committee is dominated by government
					 members. The member's leader himself said that he hoped that this would be an
					 issue on which members of the committee and the House could unite in solemn
					 deliberation and reflection to come up with a solution we all think will help
					 deal with the problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this issue, I do not think the member
					 should prejudge either the substance of what the committee should come up with
					 or the quality of the process the committee might enter into.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, following up in that vein, I can certainly

					 due respect, all too often in the past we have seen the government launch a
					 study. The wording of the substitute proposed motion, if I can call it that,
					 would be exactly that, to study the matter of anti-terrorism legislation. As I
					 said, all too often in the past, even with a deadline imposed, a study

					 and people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the motion as it exists, even as amended
					 this morning, may be too restrictive. In that regard I am certainly concerned
					 with the wording in some of the points contained in the motion and will be
					 addressing that later. However, I am also concerned that if we accept this
					 alternate motion, it basically leaves that wide open.</p>

					 address that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what the hon. member means
					 by the alternate motion, if he means the motion to refer the subject matter to
					 committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not completely open in the sense that there is a
					 date for reporting and not just referring the subject matter to the committee
					 and the committee then decides if it does not want to deal with it. It will be
					 difficult for the committee because there is also a sense of urgency in the
					 country that we deal with Bill C-15 and that we get the anti-luring on the
					 Internet laws passed and laws passed having to do with child pornography, home
					 invasion and disarming a police officer. All of those are urgent on the agenda
					 of the justice committee this fall and properly so. Members of the justice
					 committee will have their work cut out for them to deal with those issues and
					 to deal with this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure whether to refer to the member for
					 Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough as a colleague of the hon. member, and I do not
					 want to prejudice other arguments that may be coming tomorrow. I may refer to
					 him as a geographical seatmate perhaps. In any event I am sure that the member

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his
					 comments on this motion and to take a very brief opportunity to raise some
					 serious substantive concerns as well about the proposal made by the Alliance in
					 its motion today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That party suggests that we should adopt legislation
					 similar in principle to the United Kingdom's Terrorism Act 2000. When we look
					 at some of the provisions of that draconian legislation, deep concerns have
					 been raised about the potential for abuse of that legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the prominent and respected labour backbenchers,
					 the chair of the select committee on foreign affairs Donald Anderson, said that
					 the legislation was trying to restore the divine right of kings. He pointed out
					 that the legislation would in effect deny the right of British citizens or
					 people who had fled from tyrannical regimes the opportunity to speak out
					 against those regimes under this legislation. It is an extraordinary piece of
					 legislation. Whether it is members of the Kurdish community speaking out
					 against repression in Turkey or elsewhere, or whether it was those of us who
					 spoke out against apartheid in South Africa or against the atrocities of the
					 Indonesian government in East Timor, under the provisions of this legislation
					 that the Alliance is so eager to embrace, we could be locked up. There are
					 serious substantive concerns here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the Speaker that one of the Canadian
					 Alliance members of parliament from Calgary defined Nelson Mandela as a
					 terrorist. Under this legislation that provision could be used to deport Nelson
					 Mandela or another person fighting for liberation and human rights and freedom
					 to their death in another country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an assault on refugees. It is an assault on human
					 rights. Certainly it should not guide this parliament in its work in attempting
					 to respond to the very serious concerns that my colleague has addressed on the
					 issue of terrorism.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the member for Burnaby--Douglas did not

					 concerns that I share. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, the nature of the motion before us is to
					 adopt in principle the legislation in the U.K. about which there are obviously
					 many concerns without the committee having the opportunity to study it. There
					 may be merit to some aspects of that legislation but there are obviously very
					 real concerns about that legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that concerns us throughout this
					 debate, and not only on this issue but on the debate on Bill C-16 and others
					 is, what is a terrorist? We know that there are people who have been regarded
					 as terrorists by their national governments but have not been regarded as
					 terrorists by the international community. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anything that we do, there is a strong need to
					 indicate the need for a definition of terrorism that does not include people
					 like Nelson Mandela and others who may be engaged in legitimate forms of
					 struggle against racism and oppression. That need certainly does not manifest
					 itself in the rhetoric or the analysis of our colleagues in the
					 Alliance.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to lend my support to my colleague
					 from Winnipeg--Transcona who is, by the way, a learned and very experienced
					 member when it comes to committee work and the work of the House, so I think we
					 have to pay some heed to his remarks and the suggestion that he is making to us
					 today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I decided how I will vote on this particular
					 motion at the end of the day? No, not yet, because I want to give the benefit
					 to the House and the opportunity for my colleagues in the House to debate this

					 to the government side. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly the suggestion made by the member for
					 Winnipeg--Transcona is acceptable to the government side. We are prepared to
					 meet what is the exact aim of the opposition party. I would suggest that their
					 aim as indicated to us today is to move this issue to committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have any trust and faith in our colleagues on all
					 sides of the House, the aim has been met with the suggested amendment. We move
					 it to committee. We have a full and thorough discussion on the possibility of
					 even having precise anti-terrorism legislation. Or do we do as the minister
					 suggested and amend certain acts within certain ministries, which would make it
					 possible to accomplish the same end that the Alliance Party has put forward?
					 All we are asking for is reasonableness. Let us be reasonable, bring it before

					 issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my question for the member for
					 Winnipeg--Transcona, given the sober second thought of the debate that has just
					 occurred and the aim given by the opposition which would be accomplished by

					 (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am always pleased to follow my colleague
					 on the justice committee, the member for Winnipeg--Transcona. I have no
					 hesitation in calling him a colleague.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be splitting my time with my political
					 proximity, the hon. member for Prince George--Peace River.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps an appropriate place to start is this issue of
					 priorities. Suffice it to say that on the fatal morning of September 11 a lot
					 of people's priorities changed. Some people's priorities inevitably change when
					 they get married, have a child or a new job and I think that catastrophic event
					 caused many of us to change our priorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly the focus of this debate is on how Canada's
					 immigration policies and priorities change. There are matters of internal
					 security and the way in which government allocates resources to those vested
					 with responsibility of enforcing internal security and to those in the policing
					 community and national defence community who have a very important role to play
					 in our society. How do they live up to those priorities? If we can bring the
					 debate back to that focus I think we would be well served.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the opposition day motion, if I may comment
					 briefly on the way in which it is worded, I have no difficulty with this
					 forming the subject matter of the debate and forming somewhat the terms of
					 reference for the justice committee, which will be tasked with the study. I
					 would feel more comfortable if it included somewhere in the text the wording
					 that the justice committee study these issues but not be limited exclusively to
					 these issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly interpret that we can read it in that
					 fashion, because I would not want to see the justice committee in any way
					 precluded from examining acts that may exist in other countries and from
					 looking at other methods by which countries enforce and carry out their
					 internal security matters and immigration policies. I believe that all of this
					 in the broader context has to be on the table if we are to look at this in the
					 most intelligent and most reasonable fashion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we saw many members, both collectively and
					 individually, express their horror on the events of September 11. While the
					 rescue workers are sorting through the concrete and shards of glass, trying to
					 aid those whose lives have been shattered, I think we have to sort through some
					 of the political rubble and rhetoric surrounding this issue. We have to look
					 for real purpose to find some motivation in these events and give this study
					 and issue our laser guided attention in trying to come up with some conclusions
					 and make some sense of this, because this is something with which Canadians
					 have collectively struggled. They ask how we can make some sense of this
					 horrific act and move to the next stage, which is enforcing justice for those
					 who were responsible, but perhaps equally and more important, how do we prevent
					 matters like this from occurring?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard discussions about specific attempts to change
					 the way that airport or airplane security is put in place. The opportunity we
					 have before us with this supply day motion talks about a reference to the
					 committee with the United Kingdom's terrorist act as a starting point. It then
					 goes on to outline some of the elements of legislation that we should be
					 looking at, such as the naming of all known international terrorist
					 organizations operating in Canada. To some extent we have this information
					 available to us now so we are partway there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we be banning any form of participation in
					 terrorism in Canada? On the face of it, yes, but then we have to delve deeper.
					 What defines terrorism? What defines a legitimate form of protest? When does it
					 cross that hazy line into activism that is bordering on violence or on civil
					 disobedience and into activities that endanger people's lives, safety and
					 security?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other elements like banning fundraising
					 activities that support terrorism. We know that these activities are underway
					 now in Canada. There is a bill currently before the other place that will
					 hopefully address this, yet anyone who has looked at the legislation knows that
					 it is insufficient. It simply says that charitable status is lost for engaging
					 in that activity. In light of the horrific circumstances, it is really an
					 insult to suggest that this would be the only repercussion from engaging in
					 that type of activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must go forward. The ratification of the
					 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism is
					 now merely a matter of Canada living up to its obligations, that is, fulfilling
					 its word. There is detail before us on this convention, which was signed and
					 adopted at the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1999.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of those elements that Canada penned and was a
					 participant in must now be brought to fruition. We must give weight to this
					 international convention. We must be prepared to co-operate fully with our
					 international partners. We must be prepared to give the resources that are
					 necessary to implement this convention in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating specific crimes for engaging in terrorism is
					 certainly something we have to do. We have to define it. We have to make that
					 definition and give that definition weight by clearly enunciating that there
					 will be ramifications, that there will be retribution, if you will, for
					 engaging in terrorist acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of our immigration policy with respect to
					 extradition certainly have to be re-examined. There was a time in the early
					 1990s when there was contemplation of putting in place a super department for
					 internal security which would bring together elements of immigration and
					 internal security. Interestingly, at that time there was a great hue and cry
					 from the Prime Minister, who was the leader of the opposition of the day. In
					 essence he alluded to the fact that this would bring about some element of
					 anti-immigration sentiment in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister stated in 1993 that it would be a
					 cynical and manipulative action if the Conservative government of the day were
					 to move in any way in that direction. The Prime Minister went on to define the
					 contemplation of this by stating that it would be unthinkable for a future
					 Liberal government to continue to slot immigration with public
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at that point now where we have to talk about
					 this. We have to contemplate looking at immigration because it is so closely
					 associated with this element of terrorism, this element of violence that can be
					 perpetrated by those who come from away, from this massive global community we
					 live in, over our international borders and carry out acts of horrific
					 implications, either here or in close proximity, in the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these issues have to be given great discussion
					 and insight. Minute details have to be examined because the grave implications
					 are clear. We know now what can happen. We need not look any further than last
					 week's events to see the absolutely apocalyptic implications for not acting and
					 not acting swiftly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the discussion has already touched on the issue
					 of resource allocation, the issue of giving CSIS, our RCMP and our national
					 defence agencies greater resources. There can be no denying that this is an
					 area we have to pursue. Admittedly this is simplistic thinking, but simplistic
					 as it may be, perhaps there is an admission from those who are currently in
					 positions in those agencies. There is an outcry for greater tools, for greater
					 resources to carry out the tasks that they are asked to enforce.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take this obligation seriously it is something
					 that can happen quickly. We saw in the United States an immediate response from
					 congress in allocating $20 billion toward a thorough examination of where the
					 resources should go.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That could be the response of the government as well
					 should it choose to move in that direction. That in the short term would
					 provide some solace and some comfort for the areas in which we are clearly
					 lacking.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a great need and again an opportunity with
					 legislation before the House to make the changes necessary to immigration, the
					 gatekeeper of the country. The majority of Canadians are looking to us now in
					 this time of need to come forward with intelligent, thoughtful and decisive
					 action. We have to take that obligation very seriously. In the justice
					 committee and in the House we will have that task before us now and for some
					 considerable time in the future.</p>

					 had in the House in the debate of yesterday, and that is concrete actions we
					 can take to implement and address this war on terrorism.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, some of the things that could happen in
					 fairly short order, given the situation with the surplus, is a return of
					 personnel and budgets to agencies such as CSIS and national defence. We have to
					 come up with a plan with respect to reservists and recruits in our armed
					 forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that airport security is an area where
					 we can sharply focus our attention immediately. We know that because of the
					 privatization of many airports, for example, there may be a need to put in
					 place stricter guidelines for the hiring of security officers. There was a
					 report yesterday of which all members of the House will be aware and which was
					 alarming. There were dummy exercises in which people were asked to bring mock
					 explosives through airport security. I am sure this caused incredible angst in
					 the country, given the potential for disaster.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are short term solutions we should be looking at
					 right away. We should be looking at the whole range of options and solutions,
					 both short and long term. The information that is publicly available about
					 terrorist organizations operating in our midst and a CSIS report indicates that
					 the government has been advised.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a newspaper account Chantale Lapalme, who is a
					 spokesperson for CSIS, indicated that it was targeting 350 people, possible
					 terrorists, within Canada today, plus 50 organizations. She stated quite
					 rightly: </p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are certainly words I agree with. I would like to
					 see the government now take the action that is necessary. We in this coalition
					 and other opposition members are prepared to work with the government at the
					 committee level and in the House, to address this pending crisis. If we do not,
					 we do so at our collective peril and at our countrymen's peril.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure, despite the topic, to
					 address the opposition motion as put forward by the Canadian
					 Alliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset , I believe Canadians individually and
					 collectively are struggling right now with the fallout from this horrendous
					 terrorist attack, which obviously was launched against our very basic freedoms,
					 our way of life and our society as we know it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of parliament, what I am hearing, and I
					 think what all members of parliament are hearing, from constituents and
					 Canadians at large is what to do. Where do we go? What does it mean? How have
					 our lives changed? We all know that our lives will never be the same after the
					 events of last Tuesday, only one short week ago. What does it all mean?
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke briefly yesterday during an intervention about
					 the very real fear of war. Across the land we have all this talk of war. I
					 spoke of a telephone conversation that I had with my young son who was back in
					 my riding of Fort St. John in northern British Columbia. He asked what me this
					 meant and what did all this talk of war mean to Canada, to Canadians and in
					 particular to the young who might be called upon to fight a war? We have to
					 recognize that. There is a great deal of concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our role as parliamentarians and the role of
					 government to show some leadership on this issue. That is being reflected in
					 the communications from our constituents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly myself and the coalition which I am pleased
					 to represent are strongly supportive of the government stand that we must stand
					 shoulder to shoulder with the Americans because these attacks have been
					 launched on all of us, against the free world, as it were. There is a need to
					 stand strong and to make those commitments known. We support that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to recognize the fears out there and we
					 have to address those fears in a very real way. I received one communication by
					 e-mail from a teacher from Fort Nelson, up in the far reaches of my rural
					 riding near the Yukon. Val Keeler wrote to me and said:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She goes on to list the concerns being expressed by the
					 students at Northern Lights College in Fort Nelson. I think all members in this
					 place are getting similar communication and correspondence right now. We have
					 to address that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have no desire to negate all the kind words
					 expressing angst, sorrow and support for our neighbours to the south, clearly
					 much more is needed than this. The free world needs a plan of how we will fight
					 this new war of the 21st century, which has been thrust upon us. It is not
					 something that we went looking for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday under the guise of a vaguely worded
					 government motion, Canadians were expecting the House and their representatives
					 they sent here to seriously debate the horrendous attack on the United States,
					 what threat this posed to Canada and what exactly we as parliamentarians were
					 prepared to do to ensure that our nation and our way of life would be
					 protected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They expected and deserved an informed exchange on what
					 had been done and what could be done to prevent such an atrocity from occurring
					 in our cities. Instead, sadly, Canadians got exactly what President Bush has
					 been calling for, a return to the way things were before the attack. Again I
					 emphasize, despite the eloquent words of many members of the House, and I do
					 not question for even a single moment how heartfelt those words were, there was
					 little in the way of substance coming from the government in which Canadians
					 could find comfort .</p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In democracy's darkest hour our government needed to
					 provide the Canadians with a reassurance that it was not only concerned for
					 their welfare but was prepared to act. More importantly they needed the Prime
					 Minister to provide true leadership.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government could have appeared before the House
					 speaking with a united voice had the Prime Minister considered the attack on
					 the United States important enough to recall the House or at the very least
					 hold an emergency cabinet meeting. If this despicable barbaric act of war does
					 not warrant such a meeting, I do not know what does.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a true display of leadership, the prime minister of
					 Britain, Tony Blair, did both. The citizens of the United Kingdom knew that
					 their government was on the job and taking the attack against democracy
					 seriously. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government held its first cabinet meeting today,
					 exactly seven days after the attack and six days later than it should
					 have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can only imagine what was discussed this morning,
					 but I for one certainly hope that the debate around the cabinet table was more
					 visionary than yesterday's in this Chamber. I would expect that the government
					 would emerge with a plan of action as to how it would improve safety and
					 security within our borders. I would also expect that the ministers of justice,
					 defence, transport, immigration and the solicitor general were sufficiently
					 prepared to fight for the additional resources. Members on both sides of the
					 House have expressed that they need to do their jobs more
					 effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the PC/DR coalition, I am particularly
					 concerned that the warnings and recommendations of CSIS, our national security
					 agency, either go unheard at the cabinet table or worse are ignored by the
					 cabinet altogether. CSIS has been warning “Like other democratic nations in the
					 developed world, Canada is inherently vulnerable to acts of terrorism” and that
					 “for a number of reasons Canada is an attractive venue for terrorists”. Those
					 are not my words. Those are words from a CSIS report. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its report to the solicitor general, CSIS went on to
					 state that “many of the world's terrorist groups have a presence in Canada
					 where they engage in a variety of activities in support of terrorism,
					 including”, and it lists: logistical support such as obtaining weapons and
					 equipment to be shipped abroad; attempts to establish operational support bases
					 in Canada; fundraising; use of Canada as a base to arrange terrorist
					 activities; and raising money through illegal activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on but my point is this. CSIS is doing its
					 job within its mandate and yet there is no appearance whatsoever that the
					 government takes seriously the threats that CSIS identifies. I am not
					 suggesting for a moment that there be an overreaction but a reaction would be
					 appropriate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSIS needs adequate resources and an effective mandate
					 to expand the work which it has already undertaken. The reality is that we are
					 being confronted with a new breed of terrorist, and we are all in agreement on
					 that, one without purpose and ignores what we previously believed were
					 conventional boundaries. They are high tech and determined, and we need to
					 ensure that our intelligence agencies are capable of operating at their level.
					 CSIS also needs the ability to monitor terrorists at the source, not only
					 within our boundaries. The mandate of CSIS should be changed to allow
					 international intelligence gathering including the use of foreign operatives
					 when deemed necessary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before the House this morning will go a long
					 way to strengthening the role of CSIS and the protection of our way of life. In
					 Canada it should be illegal to belong to a terrorist organization. It should be
					 illegal to engage in terrorist training within our borders. It should be
					 illegal to raise funds on their behalf. To simply remove charitable status from
					 terrorist organizations is an extremely weak response to such a serious threat.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have reservations about suggestion five in the
					 motion, that we promptly extradite foreign nationals charged with acts of
					 terrorism. Many colleagues from various parties have raised this concern as
					 well. The wording of this suggestion is vague and leaves open to interpretation
					 who is doing the charging and who determines what is an act of terrorism. There
					 are countries in the world where Canada and United States support dissident
					 factions that are fighting against oppressive and corrupt governments.
					 Obviously this fighting of corruption and oppression would be considered
					 terrorist by the ruling powers in those countries. I would not want to see
					 Canada forced to return allies to those countries to face death or torture for
					 their actions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would prefer to see the suggestion removed from the
					 motion and have Canada focus on preventing the entry of known terrorists, as
					 identified by CSIS, than spend millions of dollars tracking them within our
					 borders.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed with the remarks made by
					 the hon. member because many of the things that he said about the actions that
					 were taken or were not taken immediately after the tragedy in the United States
					 were not factually correct.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister was in fact on the phones with his
					 ministers, wherever they were, not unlike President Bush whose cabinet was in
					 many different places. Our Minister of Transport acted immediately. I will not

					 Canada, the Government of Canada and members of parliament did this week. That
					 is not the point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that yesterday, immediately on the first
					 day back, we had an emergency debate. Today we respect, honour and celebrate
					 the opposition day motion on dealing with this problem in a very precise and
					 active way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said this morning that I supported the idea of the
					 right hon. leader of the progressive conservative-democratic representative
					 coalition that all parliamentarians should get involved in the debate. However,
					 taking cheap shots at our side of the House is not the way that we will resolve
					 and come together on the issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member can disagree with me but this is a
					 period of time where we could emulate the example of our neighbours to the
					 south and work together. That is what Canadians want.</p>

					 doing was taking cheap political shots.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was expressing some very real heartfelt concerns
					 expressed to members on both sides of the House about what was the government's
					 plan, because we have not seen it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fine for him to say that yesterday we had an
					 emergency debate, however yesterday's reconvening of parliament hardly
					 constituted an emergency. It has been on the books for months. That is the
					 government's idea of pointing to this and saying that it has done something,
					 that it has had a debate in the House of Commons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday's debate was necessary and I supported it as
					 part of the grieving process. All members had an opportunity up until midnight
					 last night to express the grief, the sorrow, and the angst that their
					 constituents are feeling. That is our job. However our job is also to point out
					 that the government does not have an action plan. If it does, it certainly has
					 not been communicating it, not during question period and not during
					 debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I pointed out in my speech, at the very least and at
					 the very most, the young people of Canada are looking to the government for an
					 explanation of what all these words of war mean because we are not getting the
					 answers. Not yet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following today's cabinet meeting I am very hopeful

	Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I speak
					 today for the people of Surrey Central regarding the calculated, tragic
					 terrorist acts in the United States. I too wish to express my shock and extend
					 my deepest condolences to all those who lost their loved ones. My heart,
					 thoughts, sympathy and prayers are with the families and friends of the victims
					 of these cowardly and atrocious acts. I also want to say in the clearest
					 possible terms that I condemn terrorists and those who support them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Canadian Alliance motion asks the government
					 to introduce anti-terrorist legislation similar in principle to the United
					 Kingdom's terrorism act of 2000 that provides for the naming of terrorist
					 organizations operating in Canada, banning fundraising activities and immediate
					 ratification of the international convention for the suppression of the
					 financing of terrorism, et cetera.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time of profound crisis we as a global village
					 should pull together to show solidarity against acts of violence and hatred.
					 There is a river of resolution flowing through the world. I call on people of
					 all faiths and backgrounds to work together to put a stop to terrorist acts
					 that have no place in our civilized society. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have one thing in common around the globe: we are
					 all humans. However we should also realize that the people who did this
					 terrible act are criminals. The wind is knocked out of the human spirit but it
					 will be up once we deal with those who caused it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hate is like a monster that controls the mind and body
					 causing harm to others. The idea of dying for one's faith has been distorted by
					 the evil ones. Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect, does not seem to be a true
					 Muslim as he does not act like a Muslim. However mosques have been attacked.
					 The people of the United States were not guilty because of the acts of Timothy
					 McVeigh in Oklahoma. He was not a Muslim either. This is not a religious thing
					 and let us not make it into one. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retaliation against a religion or a faith is not
					 appropriate. Hatred is our true enemy. Some innocent American and Canadian
					 Sikhs have been assaulted simply because they wear a turban, grow a beard and
					 resemble pictures of bin Laden as shown on TV. Others have been assaulted
					 because they appear to be from the Middle East. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil resides in the hearts of individuals, not in a
					 nation or in a religion. Therefore let us look beyond a person's appearance and
					 instead look into a person's soul.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the days go by we will mourn the dead, but we will
					 also find ways to make sure that no one will ever be allowed to suffer from
					 such terrible acts. The recent acts of violence will only make us stronger and
					 give us the resolve to protect democracy and freedom. We in the global village
					 must bring about changes in our attitudes and policies and rethink the way that
					 governments govern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While thwarting terrorist activities immediately, a
					 permanent and long term solution must be found. We must remember that
					 terrorists are not born. They are made. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fairer foreign policies and fewer double
					 standards, many conflicts could have been prevented or resolved long ago. While
					 we stand shoulder to shoulder with our American neighbours and allies we must
					 remember that the countries in Central Asia around Afghanistan, which is the
					 prime target, have fragile political, social and economic environments. Three
					 of the region's countries are declared nuclear powers and some are undeclared.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ethnic and religious conflicts in the
					 region. Local support for military action may be limited and skin deep. Based
					 on religion or ethnicity, there are chances of polarization or even civil wars.
					 Many bitter wars have already been fought and many border disputes linger.
					 Alternatives like diplomacy, intelligence, economic solutions, co-operation and
					 understanding among nations should therefore be explored or used in combination
					 with military action. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here at home we must ensure that Canada will be neither
					 a target for terrorism nor a launching pad for terror against others. Now more
					 than ever we must work toward peace, preventive diplomacy, restoring hope, and
					 reducing risk rather than increasing it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will mean improving Canada's immigration, justice,
					 defence, intelligence, security and foreign policies and providing the relevant
					 agencies the resources to effectively do their jobs. We do not need to have a
					 crisis before the leadership acts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On many occasions we in our party have stood alone in
					 calling for an end to policies that allow fronts of terrorist organizations to
					 raise funds and claim charitable status in Canada. Some of these terrorists may
					 have found their targets through our country. Corruption in foreign nations
					 continues. The government must change its cover up mentality and take
					 appropriate action. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's immigration policy must be effective and
					 efficient. We should not be seen by organized criminals and terrorists as an
					 easy haven. The charter of rights should not be able to be used as a crowbar by
					 the world's terrorists and criminals. This undermines the quality of
					 citizenship for which immigrants have fought so hard. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to begin by taking the advice of
					 its own intelligence agencies more seriously and moving from there. Our
					 intelligence sources and armed forces remain a shadow of their former selves,
					 unable to back up our commitment to our grieving neighbours to the south. An
					 annual report from CSIS indicates that funding cuts have seriously hurt its
					 ability to adequately do its job. It is the priorities that I am questioning
					 here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a time when we need to come together to fight
					 our common foe and not waste precious time bickering among ourselves. It is a
					 time for action. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore support the motion and call on the
					 government to act forcefully to oppose terrorism in every way possible. The
					 government must help to focus our minds on finding solutions to the problem of
					 terrorism. This is the time to act. This weak Liberal government without vision
					 must act now.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I greatly acknowledge the work of the hon.

					 disgrace. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We read the news this morning about a 15 year old boy
					 who was attacked viciously because of who he was and what he looked like. That
					 is something against which all parliamentarians should stand and say they will
					 not accept in any way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the premise and content of the motion before the
					 House, would the hon. member agree to seek unanimity among all parliamentarians
					 to keep this a non-partisan issue and give confidence to the Canadian public
					 that we are working as a team and not playing partisan politics? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member accept the recommendation of the other
					 four parties in the House of Commons and advise that we withdraw the motion and
					 introduce one that says the act of terrorism should be put to the committee for
					 immediate study? He and other members of the justice committee are doing a good
					 job in that respect. That is where this discussion should be and it should be
					 put forward quickly.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his
					 intervention. Regarding the first point he raised, it is important that we not
					 look merely at appearance. We should look at the individuals who have been
					 living in Canada, contributing to our economic prosperity and strengthening our
					 social safety net and multicultural fabric. We should accept them as Canadians
					 and look at their contribution, not attack them because of their appearance.
					 That is absolutely wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the member's second point he mentioned his concern
					 about the motion. This is a good motion because it asks the government to take
					 immediate action. What we need in Canada is legislation which ensures that
					 various agencies are involved. The government is working in co-operation with
					 many other agencies around the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a small thing affecting only a segment of
					 the world's population. It affects each and every individual in the world. The
					 economy, our way of life and many other things are factors. It is the
					 responsibility of the government to uphold the law. It must make responsible
					 and resourceful adjustments so that it can implement the law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here to make laws. That is why millions of
					 Canadians have sent us here. By way of the motion we are asking the government
					 to introduce anti-terrorism legislation, something it should have done long
					 ago. Prevention is always better than cure, but the government does not want a
					 cure for these kinds of issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion asks not only for ratification but for the
					 naming of all known international terrorist organizations operating in Canada.
					 That is a very good point. If we do not know the people who are operating in
					 Canada, how can we stop their actions? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion asks for a complete ban on fundraising
					 activities. Funding is very important for terrorist activities. When terrorist
					 organizations raise money in Canada they get tax free status. In other words,
					 when Canadians pay taxes to the government, the government gives tax free
					 charitable status to terrorist organizations for raising funds. Taxpayer money
					 is used for sponsoring terrorist activities. That means terrorism is sponsored
					 by the state. This should not happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things to be done including the
					 ratification of the treaty. I ask all members of all parties in the House for a
					 co-operative rather than a confrontational approach. I urge all members to
					 support the motion. </p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to
					 speak to a matter brought to this place by one of the greatest tragedies in
					 modern history. It will undoubtedly be the greatest matter of import dealt with
					 in this parliament and by many of us during our time in this place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of a week ago today hit all Canadians in
					 various personal and emotional ways. My brother was in the World Trade Center
					 the day before the attack. He was to stay in a hotel across the street from it
					 that was destroyed. It brings to mind the role of fate and the randomness of
					 this ferocious violence which has left at least 5,000 families with a great
					 loss from which they will never fully recover.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contemplating these events we sometimes speak glibly
					 about the need to stand by the United States because it is our friend and
					 trading partner. Both these things are true and both are good reasons to
					 support it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However there is a higher reason for us to stand by the
					 United States. So often we Canadians seek to strengthen our sense of self by
					 casting a critical eye on the imperfections of our American neighbour.
					 Regrettably we have even heard murmurs of that old discontent throughout the
					 past week in Canada and throughout the past day here in parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However now is a moment, unlike any in our history, for
					 all Canadians to set aside the habit of small mindedness and unashamedly affirm
					 the nobility of the American experiment in democracy and liberty, values we
					 hold in common.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Trade Center was perhaps the world's greatest
					 symbol of economic liberty and free enterprise. It looked out on to the Statue
					 of Liberty, a sight which itself has welcomed millions seeking the blessings of
					 that freedom which we share. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pentagon is the great symbol of the American
					 resolve to defend democracy, including our own. It stands within sight of the
					 Lincoln Memorial which is itself across from the Capitol building, the temple
					 of American democracy, which itself was another target. The Lincoln Memorial is
					 a powerful testament to American resolve, to how tirelessly Americans will
					 fight to maintain democracy and government of, by and for the people.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no mistake that the forces of destruction chose
					 these as their targets, for it is freedom and democracy that they fear and seek
					 to destroy. It is these common values which we are now being called to
					 defend.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was disturbed yesterday to hear a remark repeated at
					 least half a dozen times in the House. Members of different parties said that
					 the war in which we now find ourselves engaged that has been thrust upon us is
					 not a conflict of good and evil. They said there are no clear, stark moral
					 absolutes here and that we cannot apply normative moral objective categories
					 such as good and evil to the conflict. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have said repeatedly that we must focus on the
					 root causes of this ferocious act of terror. These root causes have been
					 nebulously referred to as social inequity, the growing gap between rich and
					 poor, and the uneven distribution of power in international institutions. This
					 is folly.</p>

						  a moment of moral clarity.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who would have us address the root causes,
					 would they have stood in this place in the fall of 1939 when Poland was being
					 attacked and invited us to contemplate the root causes of German aggression and
					 Nazi anti-semitism, the humiliation of Germany in the Versailles treaty or the
					 economic crisis in Weimar Germany, and to address the social and economic
					 inequities as the root cause of Nazi terror? No, that is not what our
					 predecessors in this place did. They called evil by its name and committed the
					 nation and all its resources to its complete elimination and unequivocal
					 surrender which cost great quantities of Canadian toil, treasure and
					 blood.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that mindset is one which we must now adopt for
					 ourselves at this time. We can have our international organizations and our
					 north-south dialogues. We can address the need to improve living standards in
					 other parts of the world, but that is not what this is about. The attack last
					 week did not come from some nebulous voice of third world inequity. It came
					 from deliberate, evil-minded, malicious killers who were motivated by hate,
					 many of whom have never experienced the kind of poverty that is implied in this
					 reference to root causes. Most of them were well off in some of the wealthiest
					 countries in the world financed by a multimillionaire. This is not about
					 economics. It is not about politics as we would normally understand it. It is
					 about a boldfaced attack on all that we stand for as a western civilization.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not start from that first principle, whatever
					 policy response we have will be inadequate. That is my concern and that is what
					 we have seen reflected, regrettably, in the weakness of response from this
					 country's leadership to date. I hope that will change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no obvious, clear, simple panacea to this.
					 Pointing to the morally objective nature of this struggle between good and evil
					 does not mean that we embrace simplistic solutions to this incredibly complex
					 problem. On the contrary, the war on terrorism, and it is a war, will require a
					 fight on so many different fronts, including the legislative front. We must do
					 what we can in this parliament to ensure that the principal responsibility of
					 the federal government is for the safety and security of Canadians and Canadian
					 sovereignty. That is what part of our motion today calls for and that is why I
					 am supporting it. I hope other parties and members will too.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can change our laws but that of course will not stop
					 the terrorists in their lairs in some 30 countries in which they operate and in
					 the several countries that actively sponsor, support and harbour these people.
					 I want to briefly turn my attention to this problem. What I picked up from the
					 debate yesterday was the notion that all we have to do is some very targeted
					 and limited covert action to remove a few of the most guilty hate mongers and
					 terrorists. I heard that it need not be a broader conflict, that it need not
					 involve conventional warfare conflict and that it need not be a state to state
					 matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the defence minister suggested, this is not a
					 conflict between states. I disagree profoundly and it is folly if that is the
					 basis of our action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the president of the United States said a week ago
					 last night, he will make no distinction between those states that harbour and
					 support the terrorists and the terrorists themselves. I support that principle
					 of action because those states which make this kind of terror possible are
					 equally culpable. The fury of the free world must be focused not just on the
					 terrorists themselves but on those states and that does mean there will be
					 military conflict of some sort.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also means that as a free country, as one of the
					 most blessed and wealthiest nations in the world, we have a profound moral
					 obligation to do our duty, to do our share as Canadians have done before.
					 However we are not in a position to do so now. Our military expenditures are
					 less than half the average of NATO countries. We have the second lowest
					 military expenditure in NATO. That means when our allies call upon us to do our
					 share we are not in a position to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to close with a call for all of us, the
					 government in particular, to begin a massive reprioritization of the
					 responsibilities of the federal government. Protecting sovereignty, peace and
					 order are our first responsibilities. We must think deeply about changing our
					 priorities so that we can do our share and fulfill our moral obligations in
					 this fight against evil.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I share the hon. member's passion at a

					 I am also concerned that the hon. member has fixed his entire debate and his
					 views on how this issue can be best solved on the words of a very narrow and
					 yet ill-defined motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member may want to clarify for the House how
					 he sees the United Kingdom's terrorist act and give his interpretation of
					 whether or not it involves the suppression of the rule of law. The
					 determination of terrorism in countries we are currently dealing with, Israel
					 being a good example of where there have been allegations of people who have
					 been deemed terrorists, would effectively cut off our relationship with those
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the member's commitment and his passion
					 but I fail to see the reasoning in the motion he has put forward
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday was the 19th anniversary of the Sabra and
					 Shatila massacre. The hon. member probably has other examples that he would
					 like to touch upon as they relate to issues of terrorism but he talked about
					 World War II. I am interested in what the resolve of parliament was in World
					 War II.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a modern evil which requires some time,
					 patience and restraint. Will the hon. member show that restraint by modifying

	Mr. Speaker, I do not think it is necessary to modify
					 the motion. These are sound policy proposals gleaned from the legislation of
					 several other democratic jurisdictions and would form the basis of a reference
					 for the justice and human rights standing committee, which could then include
					 the concerns such as those raised by the member and other potential
					 remedies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not brought this motion forward as a complete
					 solution to any problem. We have brought it forward as the basis of some
					 concrete legislative remedies. Instead of nebulous talk about addressing root
					 causes, at least someone is bringing forward some specific ideas here. Let us
					 give it to the members of the justice committee and let them determine
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep hearing the point about being patient. Yes, we
					 must act rationally and not emotionally. We must be deliberate and not chaotic
					 in our response, but let there be no mistake about the urgency of this fight.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quote George Will from an article he wrote
					 last week. He said “the New York and Washington attacks were a minor overture
					 to the cymbal-crash crescendo of violence our enemies are building toward”. He
					 went on to say that when they get nuclear weapons they will use them, so
					 western policy must respond to a closing window for pre-emption.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not agree more. That is the next step of these
					 merchants of violence. It is the unthinkable. It is the unimaginable use of
					 weapons of mass destruction. This is not something where the west can slowly,
					 ponderously, in our typical Canadian way, wait and delay and procrastinate.
					 There is urgency in this matter. We do not know how far these evil people are
					 from getting their hands on weapons of mass destruction. It could be weeks,
					 months or years but we must act as though it were a matter of great
					 urgency.</p>

					 tragedy was totally unbelievable. Even now I do not think I really grasp it and
					 everything that will come from it. The world did change one week ago Tuesday
					 and it will never, ever be the same for any one of us here again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in my riding of Guelph—Wellington phoned me
					 expressing many feelings, but more than that they wanted to do something. It
					 was a call to arms for them. They wanted to donate blood and my office helped
					 to co-ordinate that. They wanted to give money to the Red Cross, a lot of
					 money. Company after company wanted to donate money. The TD Bank, The
					 Co-operators, a whole list of people, phoned my office to take part in drives.
					 Sleeman's pledged to do a drive with John Sleeman matching the amount from that
					 drive. The list goes on and on because my people wanted to do something. They
					 wanted to help in any way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses, doctors, paramedics and lay people phoned
					 asking for their names to be provided to foreign affairs. If needed, they would
					 drive, fly, do anything necessary to get to New York and would do any job asked
					 of them. That is the human spirit of all of this that is alive and well in my
					 community, as well as in many other communities across Canada. That is what
					 being Canadian is. That is who we are. We should not lose sight of who we
					 are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are moving on to a phase as a result of this
					 tragedy, part of which is the prevention of future attacks. The motion today
					 deals with prevention. It absolutely has to be talked about and worked on and
					 we as parliamentarians have to find better ways.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make no mistake, this is not a simple thing. It is
					 complex. It is a new world for all of us and it is a world that is changing so
					 fast and so dramatically that it is difficult to keep up. It is difficult to
					 know where we should go. As elected leaders we must lead and, as the Prime
					 Minister of Canada said yesterday, we must stand with our neighbours. We
					 must.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is terrorism, make no mistake. This is a monster
					 so evil that no one can comprehend the depth and limits that this can reach in
					 any community in any country in the world. It just happened to be the United
					 States, but it could be anywhere. Make no mistake about that. If it is not the
					 U.S., is it Canada? Is it Finland? Is it China? Where? </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has to be a second part to this and that is a
					 response. That again is indeed a tough question. So we move on to the question
					 of future attacks and we move on to response.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said yesterday that “this was not
					 just an attack on the United States”, this was an attack on “the values and the
					 beliefs of free and civilized people everywhere”. He said “The world has been
					 attacked. The world must respond”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are part of that world. We must respond. This was an
					 attack on our freedoms, on the ability to live peacefully, on the ability to
					 live with everyone, all races, all nationalities, all religions. It was an
					 attack on our freedom to speak, our freedom to voice our opinions, our freedom
					 to gather with the like minded and to gather here today, which is enshrined in
					 our Canadian constitution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing that we cannot do is govern by fear. We
					 must look at this and we must act, but we must do as our cabinet and our Prime
					 Minister have been doing, that is, work with the United States and many other
					 countries to proceed into the future and on what our response will be. We will
					 do this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say I am glad that we have so much experience
					 here. We have many people in the government who have been here a very long time
					 and who have seen a great many things. This will afford us well in this new
					 horrible street we are walking down. Make no mistake, the perpetrators must be
					 brought to justice. They have to be, because if they are not what about next
					 month? What about next year? Is there a guarantee? There are no guarantees.
					 There are no guarantees either way. I am getting calls from my constituents.
					 They are afraid. They do not know where we are going. They do not know what it
					 means. Are we entering into war? Will there be loss of life? Will it mean that
					 someone from Canada has to go to war, someone they know, someone's sons or
					 daughters? What does it mean?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have all those answers today, but will say
					 that I believe, based on the calls I have been receiving from my constituents,
					 that they know in their heart of hearts, although there is a broad range of
					 opinions, that there has to be a response. It has to be controlled, it has to
					 be done with a clear, level head, but there must be action and there must be
					 prevention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there is agreement on that. The Prime
					 Minister also said yesterday:</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not. It is evil. We have looked evil in the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister finished yesterday by
					 saying:</p>

	Mr. Speaker, a lot of people say they will remember

					 is the way we lived our lives before September 11 and how we lived afterward.
					 The dramatic change that will take place is why I believe Canadians are turning

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fairness to the hon. member, I would say that he has

					 (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, NDP):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, to reiterate what my hon. colleague on the
					 other side said, that if security needs to be reviewed or upgraded it will be,
					 she is quite close to the transport minister, who yesterday said in the House
					 that he does not want anyone to cancel their trips or their flights or their
					 vacations. He wants Canadians to continue normally. However, one thing the
					 travelling public is very concerned about is pre-boarding screening and the
					 fact that no luggage on a domestic flight and no cargo on a domestic flight is
					 ever X-rayed. Terrorists just have to check in baggage without worrying about
					 pre-boarding screening. They could do the kind of damage that has already been
					 done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member not accept the recommendation coming
					 out, unfortunately due to the tragic events of September 11, to ask the
					 transport minister to review aspects of pre-boarding screening? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of members, customs agents receive
					 a full year of intensive training before they do their job. Pre-boarding
					 screeners in Canada receive 20 hours of training before they are allowed in
					 front of X-ray machines at airports. That is completely unacceptable. Airports
					 are now asking the government to accept complete responsibility for
					 pre-boarding screening. A suggestion from our party is that all articles going
					 onto an aircraft, including cargo and baggage, be X-rayed before that aircraft
					 departs. Would she not agree with those recommendations?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today as we look at the possible
					 legislative remedies, it is imperative that we seek to examine the context and
					 indeed the definitions. All last week we were numb. We said things like, it is
					 unreal, it is a bad movie. We took calls from citizens trying to find reasons
					 and solutions. Our big brother who sometimes was the recipient of our
					 antipathy, who we felt sometimes bullied us or sometimes just ignored us, all
					 of a sudden was clearly undeniably family. Suddenly American flags were on our
					 lapels and in our windows. Our family member was under attack, as indeed was
					 the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked whether we are at war, we will pause. What
					 does “at war” mean in 2001? I remember as a little girl sitting on my dad's lap
					 and for the first time feeling the shrapnel in his neck that he had received in
					 Holland as part of Canada's 30th Battery in World War II.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father-in-law, who had been shot down in the English
					 Channel years after the Battle of Britain this week asked for a copy of the
					 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms so he could take it to the school where
					 he will be speaking on Remembrance Day. He wants to explain about the
					 fundamental freedoms that he had been fighting for, nation state to nation
					 state. It is no longer that same kind of war.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked last week on CBC whether we were at war,
					 Ursula Franklin, the renowned physicist and pacifist answered, “I don't think
					 so”. She went on to explain however that peace is not the absence of war. She
					 knew certainly that we are not at peace. Peace to Ursula is the presence of
					 justice. Obvious to all of us now is the profound lack of justice. As Canadians
					 we have an overwhelming sense of wanting things to be fair. We want justice to
					 be done. We want to feel safe, but what will it take to allow us to feel safe
					 now in the wake of the attack on America last week? The previous gradual
					 transformation on the concept of security has taken a quantum leap.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last December, John Wright of the Library of

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stunning magnitude of the terrorist acts of

						  more governments) will be coerced or intimidated into conceding the terrorists

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, Marcus Gee in the <i>Globe and

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer are there specific demands or just the threat

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could we have predicted this kind of planning and
					 precision? Our definitions have changed for war, for terrorism. Our definition
					 of peace will remain. We must seek justice. That is not vengeance or

					 of peace, but what do we do?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must deal now with this problem in a comprehensive
					 way. We know that we need more money and resources for deportation of people
					 who have been refused Canadian citizenship, such as the millennium bomber. We
					 now know when we go through the Tel Aviv airport that in opening our bags we
					 have had a psychological assessment by someone who has been in an army and
					 knows how to do that. That person is not a minimum wage worker relying on
					 machines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should we do? What should Canada do? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday in St. Paul's I hosted two of my regular
					 neighbourhood check-ups. We have divided the riding into 17 natural
					 neighbourhoods. The two groups could not have been more different. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens assembled at the Bradgate Arms felt
					 strongly that Canada should be measured and smart about the next steps. They
					 firmly disagreed with the group from our upper village who wanted to ensure
					 that we would give unequivocal support to whatever the Americans wanted to
					 do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought about inclusive decision making and hoped
					 that the best brains from around the world would be brought to the strategy.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most poignant intervention came from my neighbour
					 across the street, Rob Tyrie. He had been on the 40th floor of the World Trade
					 Center. He lived through it. He knows it was real. He knows it was not just a
					 bad movie. He wanted to make sure that all of us knew and that I would convey
					 to all decision makers how real it was. He wants from us a solution for the
					 next 100 years. He agreed with the Prime Minister's words yesterday: “We must
					 be guided by a commitment to do what works in the long run, not by what makes
					 us feel better in the short run”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was extraordinarily convincing in his argument that
					 the perpetrators had spent six years planning this assault on our civilized
					 world. If it takes six years to ensure that it can never happen again, he will
					 feel well served by our government and the coalition it is building. We must do
					 what works, not what makes us feel better for a minute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants us to make sure that we are not acting in
					 hatred. He is begging us to protect our multicultural society where we will all
					 feel safe and secure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob had a co-worker with him in New York whose first
					 name was Mazhar and his middle name Islam. Rob wants to make sure that his
					 friend will not be a victim of backlash based on race.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister said yesterday, the terrorists
					 win when they export their hatred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked for a national response to the trauma that we
					 have all felt and that some like Rob and the 26 members of his team that were
					 in Manhattan, four in the tower and 20 in harm's way, get appropriate
					 help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We as Canadians have developed great programs in
					 post-traumatic stress syndrome because of the bravery of Romeo Dallaire. We
					 need to make sure that these programs are available and all health
					 professionals are taught how to recognize it and how to provide the best
					 possible treatment for all victims of trauma and abuse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night Ursula Franklin called upon me as a
					 physician, someone who is trained in healing and well being. We should look
					 upon our situation as an enormous injury, an infection. She wants us to help
					 build up the antibodies, the antibodies of justice and caring.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must cultivate the antibodies. We must work to
					 create the body politic that resists infection. We need to find interventions
					 that produce resistance. We need an effective immune system in every part of
					 this tiny planet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hatred is virulent. It is learned. It is like an
					 acquired affection. It should not be compared to a cancer. There is no gene for
					 hatred. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must commit to improving the caring, education and
					 justice that will immunize the world against the collective weakness that
					 allows terrorism to flourish. We must begin with our children, the children in
					 Northern Ireland, in the Middle East, in Bosnia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must work to support good government around the
					 world which is fair, transparent and takes people seriously. We must use our
					 brains and our technology to deal with this modern lack of justice. We must
					 remember as we seek a solution that will last 100 years, that we ensure that
					 our sons and daughters and grandchildren will live to see it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My son put it best: we are all just earthlings and we
					 have to learn how to share this rock. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now the time for all like-minded nations to work
					 together to make a safe planet for all of us. We must urgently move forward to
					 effect worldwide the presence of justice, a true peace.</p>

					 money and where it is going.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we co-operate around the world in
					 all of these ways. Some of the international agreements that we have signed
					 have committed Canada to do that. When we look at the International convention
					 for the suppression of financing of terrorism, when we look at the things that
					 Canada has signed on to, it is important that we do this in an international
					 way. As the Prime Minister said, if we need laws to be strengthened to get to
					 that end, I hope that is something the justice committee will look
					 at.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I have a specific question. The member has
					 been briefed by ministers and by the Prime Minister. She has quoted the Prime
					 Minister quite often.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the early 1980s there was an organization put
					 together by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police called SERT, the Special
					 Emergency Response Team. It was a full time RCMP staff squad designed to take
					 out terrorists from airplanes, and buildings if they came in with explosives, a
					 nuclear weapon or whatever. It cost millions of dollars to put SERT in place,
					 but it was disbanded.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is saying that the RCMP has the primary
					 responsibility for taking out terrorists, with the military being a backup. We
					 have ended up with a situation where Canada does not have an emergency response
					 team capable of taking out terrorists. We are talking about killing
					 terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member ensure that her ministers address this
					 issue? Can we take action today if in downtown Ottawa a terrorist group were to
					 set up and had a bomb ready to go off? Who would take care of that situation
					 immediately? It will not be the emergency response teams of the Ottawa city
					 police or the RCMP. I was on those squads and they are not capable of taking
					 care of that situation.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the answer has two parts. One is that in
					 the traditional tasks of SERT it would never presume that the person wanted to
					 die. We have a very different situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested. The member from Nepean who is
					 presenting the proposal for a foreign intelligence gathering agency has an
					 interesting concept. No longer will an organization that only has a mandate to
					 do domestic work be effective in the world as we know it today.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my
					 colleague from Nanaimo--Cowichan. It has been one week ago today and how the
					 world has changed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walked into a colleague's office in Ottawa. It was my
					 first stop of the day and his assistant asked me if I heard what was happening
					 in New York. As we watched the television he said that two planes had hit the
					 World Trade Center. We immediately knew this was not a coincidence and that
					 something was happening that no one had ever foreseen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As events unfolded, work ground to a standstill. We
					 heard that people had started to evacuate the Centre Block. Other people
					 working on the Hill left for home, not sure how vulnerable we might be in the
					 capital of Canada, just to the north of what had happened in New York.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the second tower of the World Trade Center
					 collapsed like something in a movie. We knew that thousands of innocent lives
					 had been snuffed out in the span of just a few seconds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was much younger, my husband was mowing the lawn
					 on a long June night. I went to bed and when I woke up the next morning he was
					 not in bed. I found him outside, dead of a heart attack. I have some idea of
					 the grief and the shock that some of the people last week experienced, but what
					 happened to my husband was an act of nature, something that is at least
					 comprehensible. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to thousands of people in New York city,
					 including Canadians, had no comprehensible reason. It was a simple act of
					 slaughter of innocent people driven by hatred and a love of destruction. That
					 is something completely incomprehensible to us, to the families, to the loved
					 ones and friends of the people who are not with us today but who were alive
					 just a week ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time I have visited the U.S. embassy in
					 Ottawa and saw the whole front of its metal railing stuffed with masses of
					 flowers, cards, posters, candles, and messages of condolences, concern,
					 sympathy and prayers. They were reaching out to the people who were affected by
					 this terrible tragedy in New York, including Canadians reaching out to their
					 friends and their neighbours across the border. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had, as have other members of parliament, an
					 outpouring of e-mails and calls from people asking how they can help, what they
					 can do, how they can make sense of and contribute toward rectifying this
					 terrible situation. People are groping for some kind of meaning and some kind
					 of focus after a tragedy that was never before contemplated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are also concerned about what can happen in
					 the future. What does this mean for the future? Will the people who have no
					 morality, no human feeling, who caused the death of these innocent people, stop
					 at this or will there be other targets and deaths? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have concerns about our security system.
					 Canadians do not want to be vulnerable. We do not want to be at risk. We want
					 to know that people in charge of our safety are doing their jobs and that we
					 can trust them to look after our interests. Unfortunately what we know has not
					 been very reassuring.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some of the troubling facts that have been
					 reported recently. A secret CSIS report, compiled in May, shows that terrorist
					 groups from around the world are extremely active in Canada. It lists by name
					 and description the organizations in this country and how they are operating
					 within Canada's borders. It states that these groups are raising money for
					 their activities on Canadian soil. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report describes the Algerian national who was
					 arrested in December 1999 trying to cross from Canada into the U.S. in a car
					 carrying enough explosives to blow up a large building. It also states that
					 there is evidence supplied by the French police and by Interpol that money is
					 leaving Canada and going to terrorist bases in Algeria.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It speaks of a retired immigration official who worked
					 for 31 years with immigration and was one of 10 elite immigration control
					 officers in the world who says that our immigration officials never got their
					 act together. He also claims that groups known internationally for heroin
					 trafficking and links to companies with operations in Canada have shipped
					 missile technology and biological warfare components from Canada to North
					 Korea, Pakistan, Iraq and Iran. However, the study that detailed all this was
					 terminated in 1997 with an order to destroy all the files.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last February, Canada signed the international
					 convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism, but as of yet we
					 have passed no law to actually put that agreement into effect. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other troubling circumstances that have come
					 to our attention. A program on CBC radio last Saturday called <i>The House</i>,
					 featured the vice-president of the Canadian Association for Security
					 Intelligence Studies,who served at senior levels of the public service for 34
					 years dealing with international relations and intelligence matters. He said
					 that about a year ago and very quietly our Canadian government decided to
					 export crypto analytical equipment to foreign buyers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is highly technical machinery for encoding and
					 protecting information which we handed over to terrorists. It would allow them
					 to communicate secretly and therefore allow them to carry out operations such
					 as what happened one week ago, with success. He also stated that we have been
					 making a series of errors and that Canada for far too long has been sitting on
					 institutions that are basically second World War II institutions, cold war
					 institutions. Now is the time to rethink them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a comment made by Major General Lewis
					 MacKenzie who served in the gulf war. He stated that the federal government had
					 failed to fund the military and had left the country unable to contribute
					 anything to this crisis other than a token force.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inadequacy of Canada's security system has been
					 known for some time. Our motion today helps the House take the leadership that
					 our country needs at this critical hour. It addresses the protection of the
					 public in a thoughtful, practical and effective way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All speakers in the House have said that we value
					 democracy, freedom, peace, order and good government. When we value things we
					 protect them. They are important to us and we mean business. Now is not the
					 time to equivocate and falter; now is the time to act. I urge members of the
					 House to support the motion before us today.</p>

					 offer my comments as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened to this entire debate while following
					 what has been going on in the United States of America. When this barbaric act
					 unfolded it was not republicans versus democrats. It was not a political issue.
					 As much as I am encouraged and moved by some of the stories I am hearing, I
					 certainly do not want to see it politicized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will explain what I am referring to. The member made
					 a comment that nothing was being done. That is unfair because Canada did sign
					 the international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism.
					 Bill C-16 exists and we owe it to Canadians to make clear at least that Bill
					 C-16 addresses that issue directly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also very important to indicate that $1.5 billion
					 in additional moneys was added. I am reaching out to the members of the
					 Canadian Alliance and the Conservative Party, urging them that we do not

					 it.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is not a partisan issue. The safety
					 of Canadians is not the purvey of any political party, but in our system it is
					 only the government that can take the concrete steps that are needed to protect
					 our security because it has the majority and it holds the levers of power and
					 decision making.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have attempted to do today with our motion, we
					 can help by entering into a debate, but only the government can act. It is true
					 that the government signed the international convention for the suppression of
					 the financing of terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It promised to pass a law making it a criminal offence
					 to collect or donate money for terrorism, but the government has not tabled
					 such a law. Instead it proposed a more modest bill last March, one that would
					 take away charitable tax status from organizations that channel donations
					 toward terrorist groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member is serious about the government's
					 commitment to protecting our security and to combating terrorism, I urge him to
					 actually put into law what our government signed in that convention.</p>

					 bring that forward.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the list goes on. I was wondering if the hon.

	Mr. Speaker, Great Britain is one of the countries that

					 place for over a year. It is legislation that we can look to for some precedent
					 material. It is not perfect legislation and that is why, in response to my
					 friend's concern, we suggest similar legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it has been found or thought to be defective, we
					 will simply not enact those provisions. We can use the legislation as a good
					 precedent for something that we should and could do here.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, a week ago as we sat glued to our
					 television sets, all of us were horrified by the events that took place in
					 Washington and New York City. None of us will forget the image of that airliner
					 flying into the World Trade Center. As we all try to make sense of those
					 events, surely we would agree that what we saw was a the personification of
					 evil itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we are aware that along with great good in
					 the world there is also great evil. Long before the events of last Tuesday took
					 shape that evil began as a thought, or an attitude or a belief in the minds of
					 those terrorists. What we saw was unfortunately the logical outcome of it.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot grab hold of an evil thought any more than we
					 can grab hold of a loving attitude. They are not something that we can place in
					 our hand and say that this is evil or this is good. So what we are talking
					 about, from my point of view, is a spiritual reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil is a spiritual condition of the human heart and at
					 moments of great national tragedy it is logical for us to ask the spiritual
					 questions. Why did this evil occur? Where did it come from? How can we
					 eliminate it?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our citizens grappled with these questions, tens of
					 thousands of them came to Parliament Hill last Friday where we paid tribute to
					 the other thousands who died or were affected by the terrorist attacks. We came
					 with these questions on our minds and we were looking for a word of hope in a
					 seemingly hopeless situation. However, there was no words of hope for our
					 people as a nation. My own personal word of hope came from watching similar
					 services in Washington and London. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we live in a pluralistic society and that we are
					 so politically correct in this country that we do not want to offend those who
					 may have other beliefs, but the vast majority of Canadians believe in the same
					 God. We may call this higher power God or Jehovah or Allah, but he is the same
					 God worshipped by Jews, Christians and Muslims.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then in this tragic situation would the leadership
					 of our nation, namely the Governor General and the Prime Minister of Canada,
					 not even call out to this higher power to provide the help, the comfort and the
					 hope that we could not provide for ourselves? It saddens me greatly that our
					 nation has become so secular and so politically correct that we cannot even
					 name the name of God publicly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scripture recognized by Jews, Christians and Muslims
					 alike says “Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord”. We must ask
					 ourselves, can we truly be blessed in this nation of Canada if our leadership
					 will not even recognize and call out to God even in times of great national
					 crisis? When will we learn that we are not alone in this universe and that the
					 God who created us still wishes to intervene in our lives? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to express my
					 condolences and prayers for the victims, the rescuers and indeed every one of
					 us who has been so affected by these bold acts of tyranny and hate. I have
					 heard from many of my constituents in Nanaimo--Cowichan who expressed their
					 sorrow, their outrage and their support and solidarity for our American friends
					 in this instance. Like other Canadians all across the country, they have lined
					 up to donate blood, contributed money and sought out ways to offer support.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many people have referred to the events of last
					 week as being surreal or likened it to some kind of scene out of a movie, we
					 know that we cannot go back for our world has been irrevocably changed. We
					 cannot change what has already taken place, but we can now stand firm, first
					 with our American friends and allies, but also with all free democracies around
					 the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deadly assault was not merely an attack on the
					 World Trade Center or the American people, it was an attack at the very heart
					 of worldwide democracy. To heal the past we must grieve and mourn for our
					 losses, but we must also learn from our past and make the necessary changes to
					 ensure that these events and circumstances do not continue in the
					 future.</p>


	<A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism is a hideous thing. We Canadians have been
					 very fortunate to have escaped this terrible reality in the main, but we are no
					 longer innocents. Perhaps as many as 70 Canadians lost their lives in this
					 awful event. Now we must consider how we can make sure that this never happens
					 again. Unfortunately we know that as long as this evil is in the world, the
					 world will never be completely safe. Any action we take, any law we pass will
					 not make us safe. As I said previously, I believe that this is primarily a
					 spiritual issue. It is a condition of the human heart and only when the human
					 heart is changed will we be safe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember what terrorists' objectives are. Their
					 intentions are to strike fear into the hearts of everyone. They intend to
					 disrupt our way of life by scaring our children, by constantly forcing us to
					 look over our shoulder and by disrupting our economies. I for one am not
					 willing to accept that. I will not allow their false ideologies to affect my
					 core values. The faith, principles and values that I live by cannot be swayed
					 merely by someone who violently disagrees with me. I am committed to these
					 beliefs and I will not give them up merely because someone is able to inflict
					 so much widespread pain and suffering. We must remember that terrorists may
					 kill the body but they cannot destroy the spirit. An idea cannot be killed, it
					 can only be changed by a better idea.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember that while Muslim terrorists have
					 called for a Jihad or holy war, this is indeed an oxymoron. War is not holy.
					 Perhaps it has been more succinctly said that war is hell. Let no one be fooled
					 by the ravings of these terrorists. No major religion of the world ever calls
					 for violence as an answer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been accusations and reports that Canada has
					 and is being used as a haven for terrorists. The recent Kelly report from the
					 Senate states that Canada has already been used as a haven for terrorists. We
					 must take steps to ensure that this infiltration stops. There can be no room
					 for debate on the matter. The government must act decisively. It has often been
					 stated in the past few days but the statements bear repeating: “We are at war
					 with terrorism”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the government to listen to the opposition
					 parties in the House. I would urge it to listen to its own members and listen
					 to Canadians. They want action and they want action now. This action may mean
					 changing our old laws. For instance, if it became clear that Osama bin Laden
					 was the leader behind this awful act and for some reason we found him in
					 Canada, would Canada extradite him to the United States to face punishment for
					 his deeds or would we refuse to do so because he might face capital punishment
					 in that country? This is the kind of tough decision that the government may be
					 faced with. The question I ask is this: Is the government prepared to make
					 tough decisions in the face of terrorism?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the government that time and time again the
					 official opposition has called for the bolstering of our defence resources. We
					 made loud calls for changes to our refugee and immigration policy, not to keep
					 legitimate claimants out of Canada but rather to ensure that those who would
					 destroy this great country are not allowed to stay.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the official opposition has made calls for
					 changes to border security, tightening immigration clearances and the provision
					 of adequate resources to our armed domestic forces, the government has often
					 resorted to name calling and false bravado. Such noise will no longer be
					 tolerated by Canadians. Will the government now recognize that past policies
					 have not and are not working? Canadians want to see changes now and now is the
					 time for us to work together as elected representatives and put forward new
					 legislation that will fully address these issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say again that any law or action will not
					 guarantee the end of terrorism. All nations around the world, including ours,
					 must recognize that we are fighting a spiritual battle. As the Apostle Paul
					 says in the New Testament “We are not fighting against flesh and blood but
					 against dark spiritual powers in the heavenly realms”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not allow this evil to overtake us either
					 becoming like the terrorists themselves and seeking only revenge, but let us
					 resolve to seek the will of the Creator whose purpose in the beginning was to
					 make a world that he could look out over and say “It is good”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May God help all of us by his wisdom to make the right
					 decisions in the days that lie ahead.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, one week ago today the world as we knew it

					 much as a mature democracy became much less certain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many citizens have expressed their profound
					 disappointment at the government's extremely weak response to last week's

					 better protection of the safety of Canadians. Experts have been raising the
					 alarm about gaping holes in our security measures for years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The escalation of the terrorist threat should be met
					 with a decisive and competent response by those elected to protect our
					 interests and our well-being. We can no longer afford to have a government
					 asleep at the switch when it comes to this nation's security.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, American confidence in Canada's borders is
					 at an all time low. Before last week's tragedy the Liberal policy of harassing
					 American sportsmen was driving away tourism dollars from rural
					 communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourist outfitters from across Ontario have been
					 inundating my office with complaints that anglers and hunters are being
					 detained for several hours. These Americans have been holidaying in Canada for
					 generations and are a welcome financial benefit wherever they stay.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs and immigration border officers should be
					 directed to screen for suspected criminals and terrorists instead of bullying
					 law-abiding Americans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironic that this government spends millions on
					 tourism ads in U.S. publications then turns the same people targeted in the ads
					 back at the border. Better yet, it should turn the hundreds of millions of
					 dollars that are currently wasted on the long gun registry over to the RCMP to
					 let them do their real job of keeping Canadians safe.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in the aftermath of the horrific tragedy

					 into our memories. At the same time, however, we have seen the heroic response
					 of public safety officers, particularly firefighters. While victims fled, these

					 environment which itself represents a significant risk to their long term
					 health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Commons has often acknowledged their
					 heroism and special contribution. We have considered a public safety officers
					 compensation fund for the benefit of families of firefighters who lose their
					 lives in the line of duty. We have considered improvements to legislation
					 guiding the transportation of dangerous goods and we have considered
					 improvements to the CPP accrual rate so that they can earn an appropriate
					 pension entitlement.</p>

					 will support appropriate initiatives to acknowledge our firefighters. I hope

					 cancer.</p>

					 Tobique--Mactaquac, bordering the state of Maine, our relationship with the
					 U.S. has been particularly close.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday's tragedy has been met with an outpouring of
					 sympathy and solidarity, the likes of which have not been seen for
					 decades.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make particular mention of Candace Salmon, a
					 grade 12 student from Woodstock, New Brunswick. A witness to the horrific acts
					 on television, she felt moved to do her part. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her own initiative, Candace collected over $300 on
					 her lunch hours, purchased flowers and condolence cards and presented them to
					 border guards and high school students at Houlton, Maine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining proceeds were then donated to the
					 American Red Cross for relief efforts. So touched were the students and border
					 guards by Candace's act of generosity that some openly wept.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Candace's noble act exemplifies what is best about the
					 human spirit, and it is my hope that in the weeks and months to come, this
					 spirit will prevail.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, people in Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough
					 and across Canada continue to show sympathy and support for Americans and
					 international victims of the despicable act of terrorism one week ago
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canada deals with its grief and investigates our own
					 vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks, it is obvious we need a strong
					 legislative response to provide CSIS, the RCMP, immigration and our military
					 with the resources needed to preserve safety and sanctity for
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are extraordinary times and Canadians need to be
					 guided by the leadership in government. Before long Canadian troops may be
					 involved in what would be an arduous sustained conflict against terrorist cells
					 or states. Canadians expect their government to instill public confidence by
					 clearly stating its intentions and plan of action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on the Liberal government to face head on the
					 challenges of increased public safety measures. We need to legislate to protect
					 Canadian citizens and to prevent and prosecute terrorism wherever we find it.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PCDR coalition calls for immediate increases in
					 resources and counter terrorist efforts. We must also review immigration policy
					 to ensure refuge for legitimate applicants but close the doors to those who
					 endanger freedom and security at home and abroad.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the events of last week have saddened all
					 of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those whose lives have been so
					 tragically changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This act of terrorism sought to tear us apart. While we
					 all have vowed not to let that happen, it is unfortunate that there are those
					 in our own nation who have allowed it to happen through misguided attacks on
					 their fellow Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports of death threats, vandalism and arson against
					 various ethnic and faith communities in the days following last Tuesday's
					 attacks serves only to acknowledge that terrorism works. Any person who uses
					 fear and terror as a weapon is a terrorist. It is clear that terrorism exists
					 in all societies, in all races, in all religions and in all
					 nationalities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fight against terrorism can start at home by
					 dealing harshly and swiftly with those who would cowardly attack their fellow
					 Canadians in the wake of last Tuesday's horrific events. There can be no place
					 for racism in our vow against terrorism. If after September 11, 2001 we judge
					 our fellow Canadians differently based on their race or ethnicity then we have
					 let terrorism--</p>

					 from the government that they are getting now. Customs officers receive a full
					 year of intensive training. Pre-flight screening officers receive 20 hours of
					 training. Air Canada and other airlines have asked the federal government to
					 accept full cost, full control and full training for pre-boarding screening
					 officers throughout the entire country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the government accept that recommendation and look

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order 56.1 was adopted by the House in April
					 1991. At the time of its adoption concerns were raised about the implications
					 of a rule that provides a mechanism for overriding the very unanimity of the
					 unanimous consent mechanism that the House often uses to expedite its business.
					 Speaker Fraser ruled on April 9, 1991, at page 19236 of the
					 <i>Debates</i>:</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be emphasized that at the time of its
					 adoption it was envisioned that the standing order would be used for only
					 so-called routine motions as defined in Standing Order
					 56.1(1)(<i>b</i>).</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us examine how the rule has been used since its
					 adoption 10 years ago. The government sought to use Standing Order 56.1 in 17
					 cases and failed in two instances. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1991 and 1995 it was used six times to
					 authorize committee travel. This falls squarely within the terms of the
					 standing order. From 1995 to 1997 it was used on the following four occasions
					 to arrange the sittings of the House: in March 1995 and April 1997, to suspend
					 the sitting of the House for the sole purpose of a royal assent ceremony; in
					 March 1995, to enable the House to sit over the weekend to consider government
					 orders Bill C-77, an act to provide for the maintenance of railway operations
					 and subsidiary services, a bill already under time allocation; and in June
					 1995, to extend the sitting to consider government business beyond the
					 extension already provided for under Standing Order 27(1). </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, these four examples illustrate the intended
					 use of Standing Order 56.1 for routine purposes, that is, to enable the House
					 to fix the times of its meetings or adjournments and to arrange its
					 proceedings.</p>


	<A NAME="T1510"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1510"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1510)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1997 there are signs of a disturbing trend in
					 which Standing Order 56.1 was used, or attempted to be used, for the adoption
					 of motions less readily identified or defined as routine. Let us review
					 specific examples of this trend.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 1, 1997 the standing order was used for the
					 first time to dispose of back to work legislation at all stages, Bill C-24, an
					 act to provide for the resumption and continuation of postal services. In March
					 1999 the government attempted to use Standing Order 56.1 for back to work
					 legislation on Bill C-76, an act to provide for the resumption and continuation
					 of government services. This attempt failed, as did a second attempt three days
					 later. Eventually the legislation was dealt with under a special order after
					 the government moved the same motion which it had placed on the order paper
					 under government orders.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1998, the government attempted to use Standing
					 Order 56.1 to rescind a decision previously taken by the House concerning
					 Standing Orders 57 and 78(3). The undertaking failed and members raised
					 objections to this attempted use of the standing order. They argued that
					 rescinding a unanimous decision of the House was not a routine motion and, as
					 such, should not be permitted under this standing order. The Speaker allowed
					 it, although he expressed misgivings, and he urged the Standing Committee on
					 Procedure and House Affairs to examine the appropriate use of Standing Order
					 56.1.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far less problematic are the two occasions where
					 Standing Order 56.1 was used to enable the House to schedule take note debates,
					 in both cases providing for the House to sit beyond its normal hours: in
					 February 1998 to debate Canada's participation in a possible military action in
					 the Middle East, the gulf war; and in April 1999 to consider the situation in
					 Kosovo. So long as we continue to respect the distinction between emergency
					 debates under Standing Order 52 and take note debates, using Standing Order
					 56.1 for scheduling purposes does not appear to violate the spirit of the
					 standing orders.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government again used Standing Order 56.1 in June
					 2001 to dispose of all stages of Bill C-28, an act to amend the Parliament of
					 Canada Act, the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Salaries
					 Act.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on June 12, 2001, the government, under
					 Standing Order 56.1, moved a motion to dispose of business over the following
					 two sitting days. In this instance the motion provided for the disposition of
					 third reading of Bill C-11, an act respecting immigration to Canada and the
					 granting of refugee protection to persons who are displaced, persecuted or in
					 danger, and Bill C-24, an act to amend the criminal code (organized crime and
					 law enforcement) and to make consequential amendments to other acts, and to
					 dispose of Government Business No. 7, the summer adjournment motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition the motion provided that once a recorded
					 division had been taken on the main estimates, all subsequent motions to concur
					 in any vote or votes on the main estimates shall be deemed moved and seconded
					 and the question deemed put and agreed to on division. The effect of this was
					 that there was a single recorded division on the first of 190 opposed items
					 standing on the order paper and the remainder were deemed agreed to on
					 division.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I would like to draw to members'
					 attention the following reference at pages 571-2 of <i>House of Commons
					 Procedure and Practice</i>:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>On
						  April 9, 1991, Speaker Fraser, while pointing out that the range of motions to
						  which the proposed procedure would apply was very limited, also suggested that
						  the new Standing Order was to be understood as another procedurally acceptable
						  mechanism for limiting debate: "There are certain similarities also between the
						  proposal and existing Standing Order 78 respecting time allocation in that both
						  use a ladder-like type of approach depending upon the extent of agreement
						  forthcoming to securing the right to propose the motion".</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would advise hon. members to be very cautious in
					 their reading of this passage. In his ruling, Speaker Fraser drew a parallel
					 between Standing Order 56.1, which requires a prior attempt to gain unanimous
					 consent, and Standing Order 78, the time allocation rule, which requires notice
					 or prior consultation. It seems doubtful to me, having read the ruling in its
					 entirety, that Speaker Fraser really meant to suggest that Standing Order 56.1
					 was to be understood as another procedurally acceptable mechanism for limiting
					 debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expanded use of Standing Order 56.1 since 1997
					 causes the Chair serious concern. The government is provided with a range of
					 options under Standing Orders 57 and 78 for the purpose of limiting debate.
					 Standing Order 56.1 should be used for motions of a routine nature, such as
					 arranging the business of the House. It was not intended to be used for the
					 disposition of a bill at various stages, certainly not for bills that fall
					 outside the range of those already contemplated in the standing order when
					 “urgent or extraordinary occasions” arise. Standing Order 71 provides in such
					 cases that a bill may be dealt with at more than one stage in a single
					 day.</p>


	<A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1515)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, a motion seeking to reverse a unanimous
					 decision of the House is a serious undertaking and should in no way be viewed
					 as a routine motion. It was never envisaged that Standing Order 56.1 would be
					 used to override decisions that the House had taken by unanimous
					 consent.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most recent use of Standing Order 56.1, a motion
					 was adopted which provided for a recorded division on the first opposed item in
					 the main estimates. However, all subsequent opposed items were then deemed
					 moved and carried. The effect of the motion adopted pursuant to Standing Order
					 56.1 was to predetermine the results of all the votes following the first
					 recorded division. It is clear to the Chair that this application of the
					 standing order goes well beyond the original intent, that is, for the
					 presentation of routine motions as defined in Standing Order
					 56.1.(1)(<i>b</i>).</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standing order has never been used as a substitute
					 for decisions which the House ought itself to make on substantive matters. In
					 addition, if the House from time to time should agree by way of proceeding by
					 unanimous consent as, for example, on the application of votes, one cannot
					 assume that such agreements would automatically fall into the category of
					 routine matters as defined in Standing Order 56.1.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I previously indicated, I allowed the motion adopted
					 on June 12, 2001, to go ahead because there were no objections raised at the
					 time it was moved. By the time hon. members expressed concern to the Chair some
					 eight hours later, the Chair saw no alternative but to proceed with the terms
					 of the motion. However, to speak frankly, had the objection been raised in good
					 time, I would have been inclined to rule the motion out of order. This
					 situation serves again to remind members of the importance of raising matters
					 of a procedural nature in a timely fashion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the three years since my predecessor urged the
					 Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to examine the appropriate
					 use of Standing Order 56.1, we have seen further evidence of a trend away from
					 the original intent of this rule. This would seem all the more reason for the
					 committee to consider the standing order at the earliest
					 opportunity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, based on close examination of past
					 precedents and the most recent use of Standing Order 56.1 as a tool to bypass
					 the decision making functions of the House, I must advise the House that the
					 motion adopted on June 12, 2001, will not be regarded as a precedent. I would
					 urge all hon. members to be vigilant about the use of this mechanism for the
					 Chair certainly intends to be watchful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank all hon. members who intervened to

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from Wild Rose.
					 It is interesting that subsequent to the times of national mourning that were
					 held in Ottawa, in Washington and in other capitals around the world, a number
					 of people called my office. They talked to me personally about their deep
					 concern that the whole issue of spiritual values had not been raised at our own
					 national service here in Ottawa.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact one lady was so exercised about it that she was
					 in tears for her nation. She felt that we had lost our spiritual foundation. I
					 know that many Canadians deeply care about that. We Canadians are not
					 necessarily a demonstrative people about our faith. However I do think that in
					 times of great national tragedy those feelings come very close to the surface.
					 It is appropriate for us as leaders to not only allow the free discussion of
					 those questions that arise out of these national tragedies, but to somehow
					 exercise some kind of moral and spiritual leadership that would give our people
					 hope. If a nation does not have hope for its future, it will soon lose its
					 direction very clearly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sometimes concerned that we as a country have lost
					 some of the direction for the future.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I know that one of the inhibitions to

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member said, most Canadians do have a faith
					 background. Could the member suggest some practical means of addressing this
					 concern in a way that would be appropriate without losing the value of a

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, there is always a danger for us in some
					 sense to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Spiritually we probably have
					 done that in this country when we try to be all things to all people. From a
					 faith perspective we get to the lowest common denominator and we do not do
					 anything.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is very dangerous for us as a nation. I was very
					 taken by the service in Washington, D.C., which had a multi-faith component to
					 it. They were very sensitive to the various religious expressions. There is no
					 reason we in this country who claim to have a cultural and ethnic mosaic could
					 not have demonstrated that very visibly at the service in Ottawa where we could
					 have had shared expressions by representatives from the various
					 faiths.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the local level I know that happened. It happened in
					 my riding as well as across the country as people of various faith backgrounds
					 got together. Again it is a question of us in leadership being bold enough to
					 exercise leadership in this area. We should not be afraid to exercise spiritual
					 leadership if we believe strongly in it. We should not be relegating it to the
					 back rooms of our lives.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I wish to notify you that I will be
					 splitting my time with my colleague from Pickering--Ajax--Uxbridge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedies in New York City and Washington this past
					 September 11 have affected us to our very core. We have all been thunderstruck
					 by the acts of fanaticism and violence that annihilated in the blink of an eye
					 so many human beings, changing for ever the lives of the families and loved
					 ones of thousands of innocent victims. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, foremost in our thoughts during this debate must
					 be all the innocent victims who lost their lives so needlessly. There are
					 thousands of families whose future will forever be marked by the loss of a
					 father or mother, a sister or brother, a husband or wife, or some other loved
					 one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May these families who are experiencing such great
					 sorrow, a sorrow that will remain forever in their lives, find the strength and
					 courage to continue their lives with acceptance and peace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a broad consensus, both here in this Chamber
					 and among all democratic peoples, that the fanaticism and violence of terrorism
					 have no place whatsoever in any society with a claim to being civilized.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our political parties and political leaders in all
					 countries of the democratic and free world join together, as we do, in
					 extending deepest condolences and the solidarity of their support in the
					 collective battle against international terrorism.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now more than ever we must resolve to express through
					 our future decisions and actions the values which we share of a deep and
					 abiding belief in human rights, in the integrity and immeasurable worth of
					 human life and the dignity of the individual. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a response to the fanatical act of
					 September 11, 2001, but it must be a response of the broadest possible
					 coalition of freedom loving peoples and governments all over the world. This
					 response will call for immense wisdom, patience and perseverance, both by the
					 leaders of the United States and those of their friends and allies including
					 Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not let the immediate repulsion and emotions of
					 September 11 provoke us into any hasty and fast conceived military actions
					 which could plunge the world into a massive and prolonged conflict with impacts
					 and consequences far beyond the international terrorist network and system we
					 are determined to eradicate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we owe it to ourselves and to the
					 respective peoples of the international coalition, of which we form part, to
					 reflect not separately but in unison, joining the most judicious of our
					 collective thoughts in decisions that will be firm yet wise and so carefully
					 studied, planned and executed that their consequences will be confined to the
					 goals we seek, namely the crippling and eradication of world
					 terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not allow our immediate repulsion and
					 emotions to lead us into decisions and actions which may in their process cause
					 the loss of more innocent lives and destabilize the already delicate
					 equilibrium of world peace, frail and inconsistent as it may be. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In joining democratic governments in making much needed
					 decisions for the eradication of world terrorism, we must also renew our
					 resolve and efforts in the promotion of social justice in a world where the
					 disparities between rich and poor, north and south, are still a blot on the
					 international conscience and indeed represent much of the root causes of
					 conflict and violence throughout the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is not the occasion for strident calls for
					 increased budgets or sudden drastic policy changes, not that these should not
					 be considered in due time, but we should avoid the temptation of quick fixes
					 and instant solutions without regard for the most thoughtful and judicious
					 reflection and planning of a measured and careful collective response with its
					 aftermath and consequences. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should reflect as well that for Canada there
					 is a lesson in humility to be drawn in the aftermath of September 11. Even if
					 our military budget and forces were to be enhanced we would still constitute a
					 very small military player in a multi-national operation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one more reason we must seek a more appropriate
					 role for ourselves than a strictly military one. Even if we are a minor
					 military actor we can play a major role on the moral front in influencing our
					 allies toward a reasoned and judicious course of action backed by a large
					 multi-national consensus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although senseless, the fanatical acts of violence we
					 have experienced have one basic aim: to provoke and unleash a reaction so rapid
					 and vengeful that it would show our technologically advanced and well organized
					 democratic societies as being capable of the same power of destruction that was
					 visited upon us last Tuesday. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, let this be the moment in history when we
					 reaffirm the strength in our bedrock values of peace, human dignity for every
					 individual and reason. It is in times of major trials and upheavals that the
					 intrinsic values of the human spirit reveal themselves. The present challenge
					 will test the human spirit as decisively as at any previous crisis or crossroad
					 in world history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who elected us in our respective countries will
					 expect from us decisiveness borne of deep reflection and wisdom, taking into
					 account all consequences of our actions relating to innocent populations.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If increased planning, prudence and patience can mean a
					 more confined operation centred on the prime objective of eradicating the nerve
					 centres of the terrorist menace, this is a course we must favour over a new
					 large scale military campaign with all the dangers it would pose to human lives
					 and international stability. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my strong hope that the redress which must be
					 sought be carried out under the sanction of the United Nations and the
					 international consensus that it expresses and represents. We will be judged in
					 this hour of trial by the manner in which we rise to the challenge. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us rise to the challenge with firmness but in a way
					 which honours and respects the human condition and innocent populations, for
					 what we decide today will mark our world perhaps for years to come.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list goes on and on. We must remember that the
					 attack on September 11 is not the work of Muslims or Arabs but of
					 terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that we must have in Canada is inclusion,
					 acceptance and not just tolerance. I have heard people say that we should
					 tolerate them because they are different. I have heard people say that we

					 not to use the tragedy that has occurred as an excuse for highlighting or
					 pinpointing any racial or religious groups in particular.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the time when we should resolve more than ever
					 that we have a multi-racial society in Canada, as well as around the world,
					 where respect for individuals, human rights and tolerance of everyone
					 regardless of race, colour or creed is the paramount driving force in our
					 societies and civilizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore endorse my colleague's comments very
					 decisively.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in every community across the country,
					 wherever we may have been at around nine o'clock eastern standard time on
					 September 11, none of us will ever forget that day of infamy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of all the residents of my community I wish
					 to express to the House of Commons our deep regret and sorrow regarding the
					 victimization and death of so many and the act which brought it about. It is
					 something we as a community collectively repudiate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evil knows no bounds. The modernity of evil has
					 taken a new course but I think we all recognize that from evil also comes the
					 power of good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Nanaimo--Cowichan talked a while ago
					 about the spiritual dimension of this. I too could find no words, acts or
					 gestures to compensate for our deep feelings of anger and sadness and our
					 belief that Canadians share with the Americans in their tremendous sorrow. We
					 have sought among ourselves that which is our only resolve: our
					 faith.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within minutes of hearing about the tragedy I called my
					 wife. I wanted to make sure it was not really happening yet I knew we were
					 blessed that it had not happened here in Canada. The call I made to my wife was
					 one of love. I immediately followed it by saying the Holy Rosary, something I
					 have rarely talked about but which I felt was important. At the same time I
					 called my friends whom I have invited to the Hill to create a new impression of
					 Islam and to talk about their feelings regarding the outrage that
					 occurred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday I spent an interesting time with my colleague
					 and friend, Councillor Dave Ryan of Pickering, speaking to Muslims about their
					 faith. They told us they are about peace and that they do not tolerate or
					 condone killing as it is against the Koran. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people, whether they wear a kaffiyeh, a yamulka, a
					 pagri or simply wear their faith in their heart, know that the unspeakable acts
					 of a week ago were the result of a very narrow but determined group of
					 individuals bent on making themselves martyrs. To such people human life is of
					 no consequence, whether their own or that of the innocents tragically murdered
					 in one fell swoop last week.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure we can fully comprehend the dimension of
					 the changes that will be required in our lives as a result of what transpired
					 last week. In my comments earlier to one of the members I mentioned what had
					 transpired some 19 years ago. Yesterday was the 19th anniversary of the
					 massacre at Sabra and Shatila. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many occasions around the world when
					 this parliament has been gripped with issues of humanitarian concern. However
					 we do not see the face that breeds the kind of indifference, despair and abject
					 poverty that serves as a hotbed and a catalyst for people who see no option but
					 to attack the west.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whom many in the
					 House know as a longtime CIA critic, put it very well recently. His response to
					 the tragedies was quoted in the <i>New York Times</i> on September 16. He
					 observed:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find ourselves here today debating a motion
					 presented by the Canadian Alliance. We would all like to find the perfect

					 prospective on human rights with respect to the United Kingdom's anti-terrorism
					 legislation. Today's motion is not just an explanation of the U.K. legislation.
					 More important, the Alliance motion calls for:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small> the
						  prompt extradition of foreign nationals charged with acts of terrorism, even if
						  the charges are capital offences; and </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>the detention and deportation to
						  their country of origin of any people illegally in Canada or failed refugee
						  claimants who have been linked to terrorist organizations. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that two wrongs do not make a right. What
					 the bill is proposing may be far too draconian. It may be the basis for a
					 police state in which individuals can be arrested at will on a mere suspicion.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Canadians expect us to do the
					 right thing. However they also expect us not to act rashly. They expect us to
					 provide legislation that is effective and meaningful but which distinguishes,
					 to the extent that it is possible, between terrorists and those who simply hold
					 a point of view which may not conform with the majority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must draw on the collective wisdom of the Moslem,
					 Christian and other communities that have talked at great length about ensuring
					 we do not make victims of those who are innocent, not just here in Canada but
					 around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons it is important for parliament not to
					 act in a way that is precipitous and serves the short term needs of those who
					 want revenge. Goodness knows, even President Bush has not acted that
					 immediately.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised this morning to read in the paper that
					 Canada had been a conduit for the government of Iran to send a message to the
					 United States. Canada has a unique perspective in the world to have been able
					 to bring together two countries that traditionally, in my lifetime at least,
					 since 1978-79, have been hostile enemies. Canada served as a go between not for
					 terrorism but for a rapprochement, to brings these countries together. That is
					 significant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of last week will not be resolved by quick
					 knee-jerk reactions. I have heard the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice
					 and many colleagues on both sides of the House search for solutions. The
					 solutions are there but they must be considered in the proper context.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new type of evil. It has been modernized. Its
					 presence has been felt here in North America for the first time. We are waking
					 up to a reality of the world in a devastating and tragic way. Once the
					 perpetrators are brought to justice we will still be left with the
					 fundamentals: the seeds of oppression and the kinds of things Canadians would
					 not want to see in their own backyards. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to ensure that people with differences of
					 opinion have the opportunity to express and articulate their concerns in
					 peaceful ways. We cannot emphasize enough the need to ensure that in the
					 pursuit of justice we do not in any way, shape or form invite an injustice on
					 people who are unsuspecting. I know that our Alliance colleagues on the other
					 side of the House understand this principle as well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must act. The Prime Minister has said that will
					 happen. However we must act internationally and not create our own form of
					 continental barrier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically the Immigration Act that is before the House
					 and Senate may be an opportunity to ensure we are more careful. If it only
					 takes two or three individuals to disrupt the world, as we have seen, we have a
					 lot of work to do. God willing, this parliament will get its act together and
					 co-operate to ensure we address the root causes of this outrage and bring the
					 perpetrators to justice. However at the end of the whole process we must honour
					 and respect due process and the rule of law. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May God bless us all in the House.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a few things clear
					 for the hon. member across the way. The motion calls for:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to understand on this side of the
					 House, after talking with people in Canada since the act took place in the
					 United States, why we would hesitate to deport known terrorists from the
					 country after they have inflicted this type of damage on the citizens of other
					 nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear cries for the protection of human rights. What
					 about the protection of our citizens and the citizens of other nations? When it
					 comes down to the crunch, will we choose human rights or human lives? I would
					 much rather see police in Canada rounding up and deporting known terrorists
					 than rounding up the families of the victims they have killed and taking them
					 to the morgue. Could the hon. member comment on that?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that those who committed
					 these acts have no regard for human rights or human life. If that were the case
					 last week's events would not have happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member talks about the ability to round people
					 up. Those who committed these acts must be dealt with. I have emphasized that.
					 However the people rounded up must be known terrorists who present a real and
					 present danger to our country or to the world. They must not be individuals
					 whom we merely suspect, as is the case with the United Kingdom's
					 resolution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will point out for the hon. member's edification that
					 the United Nations in its resolve said that the government should repeal the
					 very measures the hon. member will support today. The United Nations human
					 rights commission said the British government should repeal all provisions that
					 are not in conformity with international treaties and standards, in particular
					 emergency laws like the prevention of terrorism act which have a chilling
					 effect on freedom of opinion and expression.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said here enough: two wrongs do not make a
					 right. <i>Insh'allah</i>, we will be guided by that which is right. We should
					 be guided by principles of justice which ensure that, rather than trying to
					 find quick and expedient fixes, we do something to combat this new
					 reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the Americans were caught flat-footed last
					 week. There is wide recognition among military and other observers that since
					 the cold war ended we have been dealing with an entirely new threat that we
					 have not wanted to acknowledge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a small plane crashed in front of the White House
					 six or seven years ago an hon. member pointed out that very little was done to
					 respond to the new potential threat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking at the world from a very different
					 perspective this week. It will take us a long time to break out of the mould.
					 However I can assure the hon. member that we will do it in a way that is just.
					 We will do it in a way that is not rash and that serves the ultimate interest
					 of protecting innocent citizens. That is the responsibility of the government
					 and we will act.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise today with an extremely heavy heart
					 after listening to the debate over the last two days following the terrible
					 tragedy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many members know, I am a 65 year old grandfather
					 who spent the first half of his life being raised and educated in the United
					 States. I took part in military service with pride. When I chose to move into
					 another field of work, into education, it led me to come to Canada. When I left
					 the United States it was with mixed feelings. However, a short time after I had
					 arrived in Canada I knew I had made the right decision. I never dreamed for a
					 moment that about 30 years later I would have the honour of standing in this
					 House representing the people of my riding who chose me to come
					 here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also never thought that I would be rising in this
					 place to talk about the country from where I came, a country that I love, a
					 country where my relatives, both in-laws and outlaws so to speak, live and
					 where I have two grandchildren who reside two and a half hours from New York.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I had phoned many of my relatives last week, I
					 could not believe the hurt, the sadness and the deep rooted feelings in their
					 hearts with regard to this particular incident. It is because of that I hurt
					 pretty badly today for them, knowing they are going through a tragic thing.
					 However, I want them to be comforted, at least from my perspective and that of
					 others, that the 140,000 people who live in my riding are coming together
					 collectively and praying for the victims and the rescue workers of this
					 tragedy. They are asking all of us to come together in brotherhood to stamp out
					 those who would do such an atrocious thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received a document from my brother who was a
					 veteran of World War II. He became disabled recently because of the frozen feet
					 he sustained during that war. He was caught in a trench for hours and hours
					 along with most of his unit, pinned down under enemy fire. They did not know
					 what their future would be but it was looking very grim. After about 14 or 15
					 hours, over the hill came relief. It was Canadian, American and allied troops
					 in brotherhood who literally brought new life to him which enabled him to
					 contact me this week.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That kind of brotherhood does not exist today. There
					 was a call from my brother and others that the brotherhood of the two countries
					 needs to be revitalized. He sent a document to me. He did not realize that the
					 document he sent was two decades old. However, it was being distributed in the
					 United States. He said that if I knew the fellow who made this speech, because
					 he was from Canada, would I please contact him to thank him for his strong
					 support for the kind of unity and brotherhood that is so essential. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fellow of course was Gordon Sinclair. My brother
					 did not realize he was deceased and had made the speech two decades ago. Is it
					 not a shame that a document from Gordon Sinclair that is giving hope to so many
					 Americans is 12 years old. However they are not hearing a whole lot today,
					 which is sad. I do not know if I have the heart to tell them that the great
					 speech about the need for the solid unity of brotherhood is 20 years
					 old.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was talking to him he asked me if I would, when
					 I go back to parliament, do what they have done in his land where the Democrats
					 and Republicans have come together, linked in arms, with determination that
					 this will come to an end, that it will be defeated and that we on this land
					 will never have to fear it again. He asked me if we would work together
					 co-operatively and join arms with everyone in the House of Commons with the
					 determination that it takes to destroy the enemy who has done this vicious
					 thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then said another very strange thing. He asked me
					 not to forget to pray for those individuals in other lands who are so full of
					 hate that they are training and brainwashing their youth into thinking that the
					 only solution is to destroy western civilization. They are holding up these
					 young people who are being led into these things beyond their will. He
					 illustrated that to me with the number of contacts he had regarding the Nazis
					 who were brought up in that same fashion with murder and destruction, which is
					 what he faced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard a lot of people in the House of Commons
					 say that we should restrain our emotions and that we should not allow our
					 emotions guide us. Well I am filled with emotion. I have a lot of sadness after
					 hearing what I have heard over the last two days. The idea of coming together
					 collectively and treating this episode in the manner of what it actually is, is
					 being taken far too lightly. We need to think about that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My anger is still alive. May God never turn my anger to
					 hate. In 65 years that has never happened but the anger that swells up in me at
					 times has produced some adrenalin that has created some action, and a lot of
					 times for the good. There is nothing wrong with being angry but we must not let
					 it turn to hate. We must remember the 15 year old who was attacked. We must
					 encourage all the people we know to not go after the innocent people in this
					 great land. They are not responsible. We cannot start making assumptions. We
					 must come together believing that this evil thing that has happened can be
					 stamped out and overpowered with good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My emotions have been comforted but, unfortunately, it
					 has been through some knee-jerk reactions from the south. When President Bush
					 called up 50,000 reservists that gave me some relief. The man is serious. He
					 will put people and things into place to start immediate protection. I bless
					 him for going to the site in New York City and reading from the scripture
					 trying to bring comfort to those who put their faith in God. He tried to
					 strengthen their faith by recognizing our differences and being willing to
					 bring some comfort. Many of the 100,000 people assembled on the Hill looking
					 for some kind of spiritual comfort, felt they came away empty. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we are told not to let fear guide us. However I
					 have too many grandchildren not to be a little fearful. I want to have some
					 security in my life when I leave this land knowing that their lives will not be
					 filled with terror and evil. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were willing to come together collectively to say,
					 yes, we need to take some action. For Pete's sake, our border guards are crying
					 out today, with the situation the way it is, for equipment.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are calling me as we speak. I am getting e-mails
					 from border guards all up and down the border asking for help. They are saying
					 that they are underequipped and undermanned. Yet we see members rise in the
					 House with rhetoric that everything is rosy. It is not rosy and we should start
					 facing reality. We should start listening to the people who are on the
					 frontlines and be thankful for them. We should listen to what they are
					 saying.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If members want to comfort this grampa then they should
					 adopt the motion and indicate to all Canadians and Americans that we are no
					 longer prepared to support terrorism in any fashion. There are some excellent
					 ideas here. It is not a matter of trampling on human rights. It is a matter of
					 saying that terrorism will not get ground in this land. It will be snuffed out.
					 I want to receive some confidence that it will happen. One should take away my
					 emotions and give me some faith in not only God but in my country. We must be
					 strong but united.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I find it hard to comment on these kinds
					 of questions. We are talking about the big picture of terrorism. We are talking
					 about those who are directly linked to terrorists. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Canadians are compassionate enough to understand
					 that any time a small child is involved we have the common sense to take the
					 right steps to look after his or her welfare. We will let all the love we have
					 in us relate to the small child who has no say in his or her destiny.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The what if questions are difficult to answer. The
					 legislation simply says in a very strong way that terrorism will not be
					 tolerated in this land. It presents some of the things that we can do to make
					 sure it does not get a foothold and ensures the safety of the innocent at every
					 turn of the way. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However what I do not want is some kind of document put
					 to a committee, sent away for study and research that we may or may not hear
					 about two years down the road, and in the meantime we have another half a dozen
					 terrorist events. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular event in the United States is not a
					 criminal act. It is an act of war. Once we get that straight in our minds we
					 will not treat this as a criminal case where some day those perpetrators will
					 be brought into a courtroom where a judge will make some kind of a decision. It
					 is beyond that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an act of war and we must be prepared to do the
					 necessary things to defend this country and its sovereignty as well as the
					 North American continent. We must keep the compassion that is so necessary to
					 defend the innocent, such as children who may get caught up in the idiotic
					 world of adults. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see that as difficult to do. It takes
					 determination, unity and solid thinking but we cannot mush around with this as
					 we have mushed around with so many other issues. We have not had any changes in
					 the Young Offenders Act or the Immigration Act since we came here in 1993.
					 Canadians will ask when we will make things change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not let this one go. This is bigger than we
					 are making it. That is not trying to instill fear but instilling encouragement
					 in Canadians that we have leaders in the land who are determined that the
					 safety and sovereignty of Canadians is a greater priority than some of the
					 things we see going on today.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned on the TV and sat there stunned at what I was
					 seeing, columns of thick black smoke billowing from those two monoliths. Then
					 came the video replays of the second aircraft smashing into the south tower.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who commute from the west coast do so on
					 Boeing 767s more often than not. When I boarded flight 1138 on Sunday morning I
					 realized that I would never look at a 767 in quite the same way
					 again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the live coverage continued the north tower
					 collapsed. I thought about the people trapped in that terrifying death plunge.
					 My stomach knotted and I went numb. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one time in my life that I can recall
					 feeling what I was feeling during that brief moment which seemed like an
					 eternity. That was nine years ago one month from today in a hospital emergency
					 room when we were told that they were unable to resuscitate our son who had
					 been stabbed. I never thought I could feel like that again, but that moment
					 last Tuesday brought me as close as I ever want to get.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point during the following few minutes I came
					 to another frightening realization. I had been so caught up in watching events
					 unfold on television that I completely lost sight of the fact that my sister
					 worked in Manhattan. About a very anxious hour later, just as I was leaving
					 home for my office, the phone rang again. Thankfully it was my niece in Toronto
					 calling to say that her mother, my sister, had managed to get a call out to let
					 everybody know that she was all right.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke with my sister on Tuesday evening. Her office
					 is about a half hour's walk from ground zero. I spoke with her again the night
					 before last and she told me that a relative of one of her co-workers was
					 missing in the rubble. I went to the office and I suspect like most Canadians I
					 was glued to the television for the rest of the day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their
					 families. The loss felt is very deep and personal to each and every one of us.
					 Included among the casualties are several Canadians. As an elected member of
					 parliament I offer my sincere condolences to those Canadian families directly
					 affected by this senseless act of war.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I express my gratitude and pay tribute to the thousands
					 of Canadians who have offered their help in the wake of the tragedy, from those
					 who have given blood, to the rescue workers, doctors, nurses and emergency
					 personnel that have aided in the rescue effort. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to mention members of the Vancouver urban search
					 and rescue team. They finally received authorization to deploy to New York and
					 were ready to go. My understanding is that there were two Canadian Forces
					 C-130s in the air on the way to pick them up when for whatever reason U.S.
					 authorities changed their minds and told them that they were not required. When
					 I spoke with one of the team members I could sense the frustration and
					 disappointment of not being able to go and help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most troubling to me is that these were not
					 simply acts of terrorism carried out against an individual nation. The attacks
					 on the United States last week were an open declaration of war on all
					 democracies worldwide. I would like to take a moment in the House, a symbol of
					 Canadian freedom and democracy, to add my support to the government in taking
					 resolute action against terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take this opportunity to call on the Government of
					 Canada and all Canadians to take action and lend whatever support and resources
					 are necessary to eradicate terrorism and those who would threaten our free and
					 democratic way of life. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canada's elected representatives we must ask many
					 painful questions, not for political purposes but to ensure that everything is
					 done to prevent such horrific tragedies as we have seen recently in the United
					 States.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must do this to send a signal around the world that
					 Canadians are protectors of peace, freedom and democracy and that we will join
					 the free world to help in relentlessly hunting down those who so viciously and
					 in a cowardly way attack those foundations of the free world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the questions we need to ask are these. What
					 will we need to do provide greater security at our borders and airports? How
					 can we change our laws to prevent foreign terrorists from entering and living
					 in Canada or using it as a fundraising centre? How much capacity do we have to
					 offer Canadian military assistance to the United States and our NATO allies in
					 forming an international coalition against terrorism and its
					 sponsors?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a very minimum I would urge the government to bring
					 in long delayed anti-terrorism legislation in a manner that reflects the
					 seriousness of the current situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, a constituent of mine, Mr. Tara Singh
					 Hayer, a respected Sikh newspaper publisher, was murdered in his driveway. A
					 few years before that he had been shot at and was paralyzed. The most recent
					 crime, his murder, remains unsolved, but extremists are implicated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughter Rupinder spearheaded a 12,000 name
					 petition in the Indo-Canadian community, calling on the government to tighten
					 immigration laws and hunt down and deport terrorists hiding in Canada. To date
					 nothing has been done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year members of the Sri Lankan community in my
					 constituency visited me. They were extremely critical of Bill C-16 in that it
					 does not go anywhere near far enough to curb terrorism. They want support of
					 terrorism to be made a crime. I have also had individuals from the
					 Indo-Canadian community in my office who were extremely critical of Canada's
					 immigration and refugee policies. These are members of the immigrant community
					 themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also compelled to speak of the need to stay united
					 and focused against the enemy, those people who threaten our way of life
					 through acts of terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
					 states:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel it is necessary to remind all Canadians of the
					 charter because at times like this some, and I repeat, some find it easy to
					 feel anger against certain elements of our population. Let us not forget the
					 lessons of the past when Japanese Canadians were detained and denied the
					 freedoms outlined in the charter even though thousands of Canadians died during
					 World War II to ensure that freedom and democracy could exist and that the
					 charter could indeed be written and exercised in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I am encouraging all Canadians to come
					 together as a nation no matter what faith or religion they come from. We are
					 Canadians first.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reports of Muslim Canadians being harassed and made
					 the targets of hate makes me sick. It is hard to believe that anyone could
					 attribute the acts of barbarism carried out in the United States to any one
					 particular faith. The perpetrators of these crimes are simply evil people who
					 hide behind their religion as an excuse to perpetuate their evil.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say the Muslim faith is responsible would be like
					 saying that because Timothy McVeigh was a Christian all Christians were
					 responsible for the bombing in Oklahoma City. I hope that all Canadians and
					 people of the free world can appreciate this point and find tolerance in their
					 hearts to work together. We must work together in order to eradicate our true
					 enemy, those people who use terrorist tactics to take away our fundamental
					 rights and freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion I can only reiterate the sentiment that
					 has been expressed over and over: that speaking as one who understands the
					 violent loss of a loved one, my thoughts and prayers are first and foremost
					 with the victims and the families of these horrendous acts; that our resolve to
					 wipe out terrorism has never been stronger; and finally, that as a strong
					 nation united with our allies that uphold the cherished principles of freedom,
					 democracy and justice, we can and will prevail against any evil that may try to
					 take away from us our way of life.</p>

	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The sixth paragraph reads “the
					 detention and deportation to their country of origin of any people illegally in
					 Canada or failed refugee claimants”. My riding of Scarborough--Agincourt has
					 seen wave after wave of immigrants. A lot of the people are here illegally or
					 are in Canada seeking refuge. I have worked with the people as a member of
					 parliament for the last 18 years and have seen them come into Canada as
					 refugees. Today they are prominent Canadians. They are people with businesses.
					 They are people who have what it takes to be Canadian and are taxpaying
					 citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we must give calm and reasoned thought
					 to what Canada's action should be and even greater thought as to the long term
					 outcome of our actions. The phrase act in haste and repent at leisure is one
					 that we must heed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil perpetrators of the horror represent no
					 community or religion. They stand for evil, nothing less. My colleague made
					 comments about his family and sister in the United States. I too have friends
					 in the United States and share his views. However, in regard to some of the
					 things that are put forward in the motion, I have to ask my colleague through
					 you, Mr. Speaker, how can he stand and support it in view of what his other
					 colleagues are saying?</p>

					 talking about people who have committed acts of terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too have a large immigrant community in my

					 this kind of legislation. We have to listen to them because they know what is
					 going on in their own community. They know the people who are in their
					 community and who they do not want. They know that the people they do not want
					 in the community are causing them to all be tarred with the same brush, which
					 they do not appreciate.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 11, 2001, we as Canadians expressed a
					 multitude of unpleasant emotions: sorrow, fear, outrage and grief to name a
					 few.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I would like to speak about how we as Canadians
					 grieved with and for our neighbours and I would like to highlight some of the
					 actions taken by constituents of Tobique--Mactaquac.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, on behalf of the residents of
					 Tobique--Mactaquac I want to offer my condolences to those people whose lives
					 have been devastated by this tragedy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1783, when the Webster-Ashburton treaty drew a
					 demarcation line between the state of the Main and the province of New
					 Brunswick, a relationship that transcends any geographical barrier was already
					 formed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1783, the border that separates Maine and New
					 Brunswick has in most respects remained invisible. We are bound by strong
					 historical, social, cultural, economic and family ties with our neighbours to
					 the south.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of constituents in my riding can claim
					 Americans among their kin. They can also count Americans among their most
					 important business patrons and partners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest industries in my riding have plants on both
					 sides of the border: McCain Foods, with plants in Easton and Ashland, Maine,
					 and Grand Falls and Florenceville, New Brunswick; Norbord and Nexfor, with
					 sawmills in Ashland, Maine, Juniper and Plaster Rock, New Brunswick, to name a
					 few.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For centuries the Maine-New Brunswick border has united
					 rather than divided us. This was never more evident than on Friday, September
					 14, when over 400 people filled the Woodstock Community College gymnasium for a
					 sermon to remember the victims of last Tuesday's terrorist attacks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response was remarkable, given that my offices,
					 together with the Woodstock Ministerial Association, had only begun promoting
					 the national day of mourning event four hours earlier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some $2,000 was collected for the Canadian Red Cross at
					 this multi-faith service and sympathies to the American people were expressed
					 in books of condolences. The books are now being circulated throughout the
					 riding. Once filled, they will be delivered to Maine congressman John Baldacci,
					 with whom I formed a friendship during a spring softwood lumber lobby in
					 Washington, D.C.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, Congressman Baldacci and I were to co-host
					 a cross-border summit last Saturday to exchange information and develop ways to
					 increase trade between our two countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the service's closing prayer, Canon Walter Williams
					 recognized the humanitarian efforts of one young individual, Candace Salmon,
					 who was at that moment in neighbouring Houlton, Maine, for a similar
					 service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved by the horrific images she watched on television,
					 the grade 12 student decided she would do her part to help heal the wounds. On
					 her own initiative Candace collected over $300 on her lunch hours, purchased
					 flowers from her donations and presented the plants and donations to border
					 guards at Houlton, Maine. She then took the remaining proceeds to Houlton High
					 School where the school's civil liberties class accepted her donation on behalf
					 of the American Red Cross.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So touched were the students by Candace's act of
					 selfless generosity that some openly wept. Before Candace and her friend left
					 the Houlton school that day, her Maine peers presented her with multicoloured
					 ribbons, symbols of sympathy and solidarity, to give to her classmates back in
					 Woodstock. It was agreed that their two schools would develop an exchange
					 program to build on cross border relations between the regions'
					 youth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask my fellow MPs to let Candace be an inspiration to
					 us all, for in one gesture of kindness and compassion she lifted the hearts of
					 those who grieved, aided rescue and relief efforts with money for the American
					 Red Cross and initiated a new partnership for youth in two border
					 communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May we follow Candace's example in the days and weeks
					 ahead of us as we aid our greatest friend and ally. Let us show compassion and
					 support and let us share resources with the United States in its hour of
					 need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Candace's actions embody the spirit of co-operation and
					 friendship my riding has enjoyed for centuries with our neighbours to the
					 south. I ask all Canadians to let this spirit be the guide to our actions as we
					 struggle to come to grips with this unspeakable act of evil.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague, the member
					 for Tobique--Mactaquac. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all share in the shock, the horror, the revulsion
					 and the sadness as a result of the events that took place in the United States
					 on September 11. This was indeed a senseless and cowardly act committed by a
					 very few fanatics willing to give up their lives for a cause that is difficult
					 to piece together and comprehend. They have really turned the whole world
					 upside down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some heroic efforts need to be acknowledged and
					 heralded: the passengers who probably charged the cockpit crew, probably saving
					 countless lives in Pennsylvania; the work of the fire men and women, the police
					 officers and other rescue workers who lost their lives trying to save the
					 victims, and this work continues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians and people around the world have responded in
					 a remarkable way with messages of condolence, support and sadness; with the
					 giving of blood; with the donations of many kinds and different descriptions;
					 and in many other ways.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some who jumped at the alleged Canadian
					 connection and now it appears that 17 of the terrorists spent many years in the
					 United States. However the message is that all nations need to look at their
					 security, look at their approach and look at their responses. We all need to
					 tighten up. We need to be resolute. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have measured action in the short term but,
					 more important, in the medium and long term. New approaches to intelligence
					 gathering and infiltration will be part of the longer term solution in my view.
					 The fact that these terrorists were able to stay underneath the radar of the
					 intelligence community is a cause for concern. We need many more rapid
					 responses to aircraft that deviate from approved flight paths and more airport
					 and aircraft security. I was delighted that the Minister of Transport said that
					 the cockpit doors must be sealed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Canadians need to remember that this is a fight
					 against terrorists, not against any community or single group. In my riding of
					 Etobicoke North, I have a Muslim community which met last week to show their
					 support for action. They abhor the terrorist action that resulted in the loss
					 of so many lives in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member for Tobique--Mactaquac have such
					 communities in his riding and, if so, how are they responding? I am sure they
					 are responding in a similar way in that this is something that needs to be
					 dealt with but that we cannot target individual groups. We must all realize
					 that this terrorist action was as a result of a very small number of people who
					 were committed and were fanatics. I hope that message is coming through in his
					 riding as well, although he may not have the diversity that is present in some
					 of the urban ridings in Canada.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to address my remarks to one
					 narrow aspect of the motion before us and that is the part of the motion that
					 calls on anti-terrorism legislation that should specifically ban fundraising
					 for the purposes of supporting terrorism anywhere in the world. It is all very
					 well to pass legislation like that but if there is not the ability to actually
					 implement a ban like that then it falls far short of what is
					 desired.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, you of all people will remember that for
					 many years now I have been an active campaigner for the reform of Canada's
					 charity legislation and regulations. You will know and remember, Mr. Speaker,
					 that I did two reports in which I examined some 500 charities. I examined their
					 financial information returns, compared them to the published financial
					 statements that they put out and kept track of them in a general fashion.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, you will also remember that what I found
					 was that Canada's $90 billion charity industry runs essentially without any
					 kind of legislative oversight whatsoever. In other words, the money is being
					 raised by big charities and small charities across the land and is being spent
					 and no one knows how it is being raised or where it is being spent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the first to say that there are many very good
					 charities but the reality is Canada has become notorious worldwide for the ease
					 with which a terrorist organizations and groups engaged in ethnic conflicts in
					 various parts of the world use Canada's absence of meaningful not for profit
					 legislation in order to raise money here in Canada and transfer those funds to
					 support these conflicts abroad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I know you will find this hard to believe
					 and many of the members in the House will probably be surprised to hear this,
					 but the reality is that there are only guidelines for charities in Canadian
					 federal legislation. There are no actual standards of financial reporting.
					 There are no standards of corporate governance and we have a situation where a
					 charity can raise a million dollars or so. A small charity with some ethnic
					 ties abroad can raise this money and there is no mechanism at all for the
					 federal government to determine how that money was raised because there is no
					 requirement to keep receipts. The money can then be disbursed by third parties.
					 It literally can be transferred out of the country and spent by a third party
					 in ways that we will never know. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously an invitation to all kinds of abuse.
					 This is not the time, in this particular sensitive time, to actually name the
					 type of organizations or name the specific organizations that I have
					 encountered that are engaged in very unusual activities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me give the House an example of what I
					 discovered. I discovered, for example, a very large and well known charity that
					 engages in overseas community project development which was receiving millions
					 of dollars a year from the Canadian government to further these developments in
					 third world countries abroad. When I attempted to get from the charity the
					 names of these organizations, I could get brochures and beautiful pictures and
					 all those kinds of thing, but the charity was never able to supply me with the
					 names of the organizations, the addresses or the telephone numbers. In this
					 particular case it was in India where it was actually operating. The irony was
					 that in this particular instance the Canadian International Development Agency
					 actually sent a team abroad to look at this particular development. They looked
					 at it and made a report but two years later, even though it was still receiving
					 money, there was no trace of it. We have to ask ourselves what this charity was
					 doing with the money that it was actually receiving from the Government of
					 Canada? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another instance I found a charity that was not an
					 ethnic charity at all. It was engaged in a certain activity abroad that was
					 regarded in the public interest. I will not say what that activity was but it
					 involved officials from the charity leaving Canada and going to various
					 countries, generally in the Middle East. An audit was done on that charity by
					 CIDA and it was found that the charity officials were carrying tens of
					 thousands of dollars in cash by airplane to the Middle East. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I just leave it to your imagination what
					 an organization, what individuals would possibly be doing bringing cash into
					 the Middle East when I would point out to you that the Middle East is not the
					 end of the world. It is possible to have proper electronic transfers of money
					 to this part of the world so you have to ask yourself what is going
					 on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers of instances of this kind of thing are, I
					 am sorry to say, legion. I do not like to suggest even for a moment that all
					 charities are engaged in this kind of thing but the reality is that we as a
					 country, indeed we as a federal government, have failed absolutely in our
					 responsibility to Canadians and our responsibility to ethnic Canadians, those
					 people who have settled in Canada and taken out Canadian citizenship or just
					 settled in Canada. Our responsibility to them is to guarantee that they are not
					 subject to pressure from their homelands to finance conflicts that still exist
					 in their homelands. This is not just a question about whether money is being
					 raised in this country to finance terrorism abroad, it is a question of whether
					 money is being raised in this country to finance the ethnic conflicts in the
					 various homelands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made many representations to government on this.
					 About two years ago it did appear that cabinet was prepared to look at the not
					 for profit sector and bring in some legislation and some rules that
					 particularly pertain to the transparency in their financial dealings. I regret
					 to say that because of, I think, a very strong lobby from the very large
					 charitable organizations and the charity leadership in this country, the
					 government backed off. I think the argument was that the charity industry, even
					 though it is a very large industry, was not willing to accept the red tape that
					 comes from keeping good financial books.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say in passing that under Canadian legislation
					 a charity, no matter how large or how small, does not require a proper auditor
					 to do its books. Basically anyone can do the books of a charity. The only
					 reporting a charity is required to do is a financial information return to
					 Revenue Canada. There is no law on the books that even requires the charity to
					 fill out the lines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition raised the point that the
					 legislation that was introduced, Bill C-16, was designed to lift the charitable
					 registration status of organizations that are suspected by the security
					 services of raising money for illegal activities abroad. What I must point out
					 is that this falls completely short of actually solving the problem or even
					 coming close to answering the problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that because of the Access to
					 Information Act we cannot see even the non-profit organizations' financial
					 statements to government. In other words, the world police organizations have
					 recognized that because of Canada's open or lack of legislation with respect to
					 charities, we are the most backward of all nations with respect to legislation
					 on charities. Because of that, we are a favoured nation for raising funds, not
					 only for terrorism but for ethnic conflicts and, I fear, even for organized
					 crime.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member's comments and he

					 Canada, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty as to how a government agency
					 could dissuade or shut down any such operation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well known fact that there is a myriad of
					 information accumulated by the RCMP, CSIS and other agencies in Canada. In the
					 particular document I hold in my hand there is a summary of known terrorist
					 organizations in Canada that have been watched and examined thoroughly. The
					 evidence is insurmountable when it comes to their ties outside our country and
					 what those mother organizations are involved in internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no problem in monitoring such groups in Canada. I
					 know that even in the House there have been members of parliament, some
					 knowingly, some unknowingly, participating in fundraising activities put on by
					 these organizations. The information is here and elsewhere to be able to curb
					 such activity that would shut them down once and for all.</p>

					 regarding the rules and laws which his government refuses to implement. For
					 that I commend him. He has done a great job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin by extending on behalf of my
					 family, my colleagues and myself our deepest condolences to the families of the
					 victims of Tuesday's unprecedented terrorist attack in the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we witnessed a week ago today will forever be
					 ingrained in our minds as a new menace facing all peace loving communities of
					 the world. This act was perpetrated by spiritually bankrupt individuals without
					 conscience and devoid of love who think nothing of the rights of others. I say
					 that they were spiritually bankrupt because these individuals have no love and
					 compassion for others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious leaders of all faiths have condemned this act
					 and reaffirmed their religions' most important tenet, which is that the taking
					 of innocent lives is never justified.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned with and condemn with the same
					 breath the intolerant acts taking place in North America against minority
					 groups. This is also a crime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of two individuals in the U.S.A., the beating
					 of a youth in Ottawa, the burning of a Hindu temple in Hamilton and the
					 harassment of Muslims around our nation are all crimes. The full wrath of our
					 law should be brought against those responsible for these acts. Our society is
					 built on tolerance and freedom. These we will protect both domestically and
					 internationally. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 5,000 people died last Tuesday. Those who died
					 came from over 40 countries. This is a crime against humanity and as such we
					 must stand together to fight these crimes. Those who join us are united in
					 brotherhood to fight this menace. Those who refuse to join us will be
					 apologetic forever as we move forward without them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has to join this battle or we will become future
					 victims of this menace. Unfortunately we are already victims having also lost
					 citizens in this tragedy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is international terrorism our focus has fallen
					 on our immigration laws. Let me be clear that this is not about immigration or
					 refugee policy but rather immigration and refugee law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate concerns the adequacy of our laws to protect
					 us from those who intend to break our laws and use our laws to promote these
					 hideous crimes. We are talking of a small minority but nevertheless a minority
					 that has no conscience. We must guard against them. For that purpose it is
					 important that we have the right laws that allow us to tackle this menace.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigrants and refugees themselves run this course of
					 action because in the end they become the victims of those who break the laws
					 and commit these hideous crimes. Unfortunately we are witnessing these
					 acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a land of immigrants where diversity is our
					 strength. Let us not allow these criminals to break our strength. Therefore I
					 urge the government to act to ensure that the weak links in our immigration
					 laws are tightened. We must listen to the suggestions of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling people who are pointing to the flaws in our
					 immigration laws racists and bigots has the effect of strengthening racists and
					 bigots because terrorists are racists and bigots. I hope the minister of
					 immigration will take note of this.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that requires attention is giving law
					 enforcement agencies the tools to fight terrorism. Today's motion is an
					 important step in that direction. Law enforcement officers are our new soldiers
					 in this battle. Let us give them the tools they need and our full support.
					 However I need to say a word of caution to our law enforcement agencies. They
					 should ensure that these tools do not become the tools of harassment of the
					 innocent or they will lose this battle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism is born from poverty. Canada should fight
					 this new war, but Canada should also assist those developing states that are
					 also joining the fight against terrorism. We cannot allow the seeds of terror
					 to be sown in those states that wish to help us in our hour of need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget that most societies are built on
					 respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. We cannot allow those
					 few to shake the foundation of what we have built. People have come from around

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly hope that the debate today leads to

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canadians we will pay a high price for that. We
					 already have in the sense that at least 100 Canadians and maybe more have lost

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for giving me this
					 opportunity to talk about international development. There are two connections
					 here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about poverty around the world. The causes of
					 poverty are many. Causes can be attributed to a lack of governance, opportunity
					 and corruption and other issues for which unfortunately the poor have to pay
					 the price. I just returned from Africa where I witnessed the unfortunate
					 tragedy of AIDS and bad governments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what I was trying to say in my speech against
					 terrorism and what I was trying to say about the support which we need to give
					 to countries that will stand with us to fight this new menace, is that many
					 countries lack the resources to help us in fight these terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those countries, which need assistance, have pledged to
					 stand with us against terrorism. While we have military and naval intelligence
					 and other kinds of solutions, these countries will require assistance to
					 sustain themselves. At the end of the day we do not want these countries,
					 through internal turmoil, to break down creating a new state as we witnessed in
					 Somalia. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stop the growth of terrorism and the recruitment of
					 terrorists, it is important for us to assist those countries.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a very sad and rare opportunity that
					 we have to face at this time in Canada, the United States and in the civilized
					 world a tragedy such as what we had last Tuesday.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that our condolences and
					 sympathies go out to the parents, friends, associates and all those people who
					 have suffered the loss of loved ones.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first thoughts I had was how terrible that
					 this happened and I felt immediately the pain of the parents, brothers and
					 sisters who were lost. However, there was a second thought that came to mind,
					 which was what kind of minds would make the kinds of choices or decisions to do
					 what they did. This was something that was done in some kind of vacuum.
					 Somebody thought and planned very carefully what to do, when to do it, where to
					 do it and what the effect would be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are these terrorists? I have to conclude very
					 carefully that the terrorist is a fanatic who has a disposition for unlimited
					 violence. If that is what a terrorist is, then what we have perpetrated in the
					 world today, as Mr. Schroeder said in Germany, is a war declared against
					 civilization and democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All democracies will have to get together to fight it,
					 as Tony Blair said. However, probably the best statement was by Mr. Steyn, as
					 reported in the <i>National Post</i>. He said:</p>

						  is freedom's fight--not an argument about “foreign policy” or “tensions and
						  hostilities,” but a war on values.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is about joining the fight for democracy and
					 defending civilization. If it is a matter of values, we should look at why we
					 are in this situation. We stand here in some ways almost sanctimoniously saying
					 thank God we are not like that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just heard how we are harbouring certain terrorists
					 in our country, and we say we are not like. How is this possible? I believe
					 this is possible because we have a certain phenomenon developing in our
					 universities and high schools, among our parents and even among the members of
					 parliament. It is called political correctness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Roche, of Hillsdale College, which is a very
					 reputable private college in the United States, reached the conclusion that
					 political correctness was to a large extent to blame. He said that the doctrine
					 of political correctness held that all differences and ideas, values and
					 lifestyles were equally valid</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had demonstrated to us as never before that
					 values and lifestyles do differ and that there are some that are more important
					 than others. We certainly do not tolerate or want to value dictatorship in the
					 same way we do democracy, as one example.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to recognize that it is time to make a
					 difference in the values that we hold dear and those that we want to support. I
					 will list what some of the values are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is truth. If we do not protect the truth we
					 are in serious trouble. A colleague in the House criticized the government for
					 a lack of certain fortitude with regard to certain laws.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has penetrated into our high schools and our
					 universities. There is not a person here who has not read about the difficulty
					 in one of our law schools. Kids were saying that it was okay to lie and cheat
					 on exams because everybody did it. We need to establish the truth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have lost a large part of our moral literacy as
					 well. Honour and virtue are very scarce commodities in our society today. It is
					 time that we recognized that honour and virtue are good things to
					 have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a large degree, we have lost trust in one another to
					 a large degree.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand we distrust politicians, film makers
					 and television, then we turn around and look to our politicians, film makers
					 and television to tell us the truth, give us the facts and interpret the world
					 around us. It is a contradiction.</p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have lost trust in our fellow citizens. There
					 are many members in the House from different parties. Somehow we are supposed
					 to be fundamentally different from one another. On these things we must not be
					 different.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to trust one another. We need to be able to
					 depend on one another, but it is more than that. We have lost empathy. We pass
					 people who are suffering and think that it cannot be that bad. That changed
					 last week. We have demonstrated empathy like never before. In a heartfelt
					 manner, people wanted to help. However, many of us will go back callously into
					 our communities and ignore the problems and the suffering that exists there? We
					 need to re-establish our empathy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also lost the feeling of independence and
					 confidence to solve our own problems. It is almost as if our problems are so
					 big and so complicated that only the government can solve them. The government
					 did not decide upon this terrorist act. This act was decided upon by an
					 individual or a group of individuals. They were confident they could do it and
					 they did it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can solve our problems but they will be solved one
					 person at a time. Where will we start? In the family. We need to recognize the
					 family as the solid, most powerful and effective building block of a society in
					 building a civilization. What has happened? In many instances our children are
					 not in families. They are with single parents. They need the love of a mother
					 and a father. They need the stability of people who have committed their
					 lifetime to each other and their children. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also lost faith to a large degree. I was
					 terribly saddened when I saw 100,000 people assembled on Parliament Hill last
					 Friday in remembrance of what had happened. The Prime Minister talked about
					 prayer but there was no prayer. There was no reference to the spirituality of
					 man.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have lost sight of the fact that God is the most
					 important guiding factor in our daily lives. We do not speak about Him in our
					 social gatherings. We have a difficult time speaking about Him in the House.
					 God is real. Whether one likes it or not is another issue. Whether one believes
					 it or not is another issue. The truth stands whether one believes it or not. We
					 can ignore gravity but it does not make it go away.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we protect ourselves? We can do a number of
					 things. I would like to read into the record the words Pope Paul II when he
					 addressed the United Nations in 1995.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I commend this side of the House for

					 Unfortunately, our friends across the way are using a knee-jerk reaction and
					 bringing forth six points in their motion that need to be studied
					 further.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came to this country 30 years ago fleeing tyranny. At
					 that time what was happening in my country of origin was seen to be right. It
					 was unfortunate that later on the prime minister of that country, who was in
					 this country as an educator at York University, was also labelled a terrorist.
					 He later became the prime minister of the country. I say to my friends across
					 the way that we should act in caution. We should not try to brand everyone that
					 way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a large Tamil community in my riding. If anyone
					 were to read these points they could say that the whole Tamil community could
					 be linked to terrorism in some form. I say that we must act with due
					 caution.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I have two comments. First, no terrorist
					 group is mentioned in the motion. That is a matter of fact and we should tell
					 the truth. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the assumption that if this motion were
					 presented in the form of a bill and it were passed it would prevent terrorism
					 is false. Laws do not make people good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have laws in Canada that say to murder is bad, and
					 we have punishment for that. Does that do away with murder? No. There are still
					 people who choose to defy the law. That could happen here too.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we need to have a law like this? Yes, I think we do.
					 We need to demonstrate to the world that we will not tolerate terrorism. Should
					 we proceed with caution? Absolutely, we must proceed with caution. But
					 terrorism? No.</p>

					 people in that tragedy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move forward and we hear the response of what
					 will happen, I want to state that it is critically important for us as
					 parliamentarians and for all Canadians to stand shoulder to shoulder with our
					 government and with our American friends to the south in this time of
					 crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope there will be a measured response that has as

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said: Mr. Speaker, it is very hard to initiate this
					 debate following two days of very critical discussion in the House around a
					 most extraordinary turn of events in our society. It is very hard to clear our
					 heads and focus on another issue. It is certainly hard to set aside our
					 thoughts and emotions surrounding the terrorist attacks in Washington and New
					 York City one week ago today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have set aside the ordinary business of the House to
					 deal with extraordinary events and so we should have. All of our thoughts today
					 are with the families, friends and co-workers of those who died, who are lost
					 or who perished in those destructive acts of horror perpetrated against the
					 people in the United States, but which also affected many Canadians and people
					 around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our thoughts today are with the people affected by this
					 tragedy. All of us in the House share the sentiments of sympathy expressed by
					 our constituents. Certainly the people of Winnipeg North Centre are no
					 exception. They would want me to extend their condolences to everyone affected
					 by that tragedy and to share their feelings of grief, sorrow, anger and
					 uncertainty around those terrorist activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would also want us to return to normal business,
					 to carry out the priorities of Canadians while still being vigilant in pursuing
					 the eradication of terrorism. We attempt to do that now, to make the transition
					 to regular ordinary business of the House on other issues of significance for
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter before the House today pales in comparison
					 to the events we have had to deal with over the last week. However, the motion
					 is a matter of significant public policy that ought to be addressed very
					 seriously by members in the House today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion addresses the question of the health and
					 well-being of Canadians. It seeks to find a way to end preventable deaths in
					 our society. It seeks to ensure that the medications people are required to
					 take because of illness are safe beyond a reasonable doubt. The motion is quite
					 simple. It calls upon the government in co-operation with provincial and
					 territorial governments to put in place a system of mandatory reporting of
					 adverse drug reactions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that approximately 10,000 people a year
					 die of adverse drug reactions in Canada. It is difficult to ascertain the
					 precise number of deaths that occur because of adverse drug reactions, but it
					 is fair to say that the numbers are very high and many could be
					 prevented.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not so naive as to believe that 10,000 deaths a
					 year could be prevented by simply putting in place a system of mandatory
					 reporting of adverse drug reactions. However, I am convinced, as are many
					 others, that if we take steps to require a systematic way of sharing
					 information on adverse reactions, if we require our physicians and our
					 hospitals to report any problems associated with drugs and their interaction
					 with other drugs or with foods, then we will have made a big difference. We
					 probably would help prevent unnecessary deaths, unnecessary illness and
					 difficult circumstances caused by this situation.</p>


	<A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1810)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue crystallized for many of us when we learned
					 about the death of Vanessa Young in March 2000. Vanessa Young was a 15 year old
					 teenager from Oakville, Ontario who died because of the drug she was
					 prescribed, called Prepulsid. That drug was prescribed for the wrong
					 circumstances. By all accounts it was a preventable death. Her father, Terence
					 Young, has carried on with a mission since his daughter's passing to ensure
					 that we as a society learn the lessons of Vanessa's death. It compels us to
					 take action today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly became much more aware of the problems
					 associated with adverse drug reactions and the absence of policy in this area
					 as a result of Vanessa's death. We owe it to her to ensure that her death is
					 not in vain, that we learn lessons from this tragedy and ensure that people in
					 similar circumstances are not affected by something that is so preventable and
					 so easy to grasp in terms of solutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past year I have raised in the House on a
					 couple of occasions the issue of Vanessa Young in particular and the question
					 of adverse drug reactions in general. Our concern really emerged from the
					 knowledge that prior to Vanessa Young's death in March 2000 there were reports
					 of adverse reactions to that drug. Certainly deaths were already associated
					 with the taking of Prepulsid, yet we failed as a government and as a country to
					 convey that information, to share that knowledge and to ensure that all
					 physicians and all pharmacists were aware of the dangers of that drug when
					 prescribed under certain conditions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raised with the House at that time that Health Canada
					 had information it could have shared and acted upon many months before the
					 death of Vanessa Young but it failed to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of today's debate is not to lay blame but to
					 find solutions. As a result of Vanessa's death there was a coroner's inquest
					 and the jury made a number of recommendations. One is the mandatory reporting
					 of adverse drug reactions within 48 hours of the incident taking place. That
					 seems to be a very responsible and reasonable solution to a serious problem and
					 one on which there is no reason to delay and to avoid action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the coroner's inquest, Health Canada officials
					 were reported as saying that they thought it was a good idea but it was beyond
					 the jurisdiction of the federal government. It is quite apparent today that the
					 establishment of a system to require mandatory reporting of adverse drug
					 reactions is well within federal jurisdiction. Certainly it is part of the
					 responsibility that is handed to government through the Food and Drugs Act and
					 requires action and implementation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a great disservice to Canadians for anyone
					 to argue that this matter is beyond the jurisdiction of the federal government
					 and on which there can be no immediate action. Not only is there the authority
					 under the Food and Drugs Act for the government to act immediately, but there
					 are also models from other jurisdictions on how a system could work. In
					 countries like Britain and France there are models of mandatory reporting that
					 work and which could be employed here in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously there have been pilot projects in Canada
					 that show the idea can work and ought to be developed here. The Ontario Medical
					 Association conducted a pilot project for the Canadian Medical Association
					 about 10 years ago with great success.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we propose that precise idea. We hope that the
					 government will see it as a valuable contribution to a very important area and
					 that it will act upon it as soon as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many concerns have been expressed over the last number
					 of years about changes in drug safety policies in Health Canada, about reduced
					 resources, about an inability on the part of officials to track adverse drug
					 reactions and to get that information out to the appropriate professionals in
					 our society.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem was identified clearly in the coroner's
					 inquest. Not only was the question of voluntary reporting outlined as a serious
					 problem but so too was a lack of resources and communication on the part of
					 Health Canada officials. These problems are manageable. They can be corrected
					 without a lot of effort or cost, and this would save lives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing my material for today's debate we spoke
					 with Vanessa Young's father, Terence Young, who is continuing his battle to
					 ensure that justice is done and changes are made in light of the lessons
					 learned from Vanessa's death. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the comments he made about mandatory reporting
					 was that it is “the only way to break the conspiracy of silence which the drug
					 companies have created and nurtured, Health Canada has condoned and to which
					 doctors have acquiesced”. That is a strong statement based on the reality he
					 had to face with the death of his daughter. They are words we should listen to
					 carefully and take seriously.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that over the last 10 years the use of drug
					 therapy as an important part of our medical system has increased dramatically.
					 However we know at the same time that our systems, resources and policies for
					 dealing with the dramatic increase in the use of drug therapies has not changed
					 or increased. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asking the government to recognize that
					 pharmaceuticals play an important part in our medical system, in treating
					 illness and in protecting health and well-being. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However for goodness' sake let us recognize the hazards
					 that come with drug therapies. Governments must employ vigilance to ensure
					 safety is preserved and protected at all costs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by citing again the information we have
					 regarding deaths associated with adverse reactions. I mentioned at the outset
					 that there are estimates of approximately 10,000 people a year dying from
					 adverse drug reactions. That is a tremendous toll on our society that should be
					 addressed. We know from other studies that the problem is real and that the
					 estimates are in line with experience and knowledge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study in the United States has shown that in a sample
					 of 10 drugs pulled off U.S. markets for safety reasons between 1997 to 2000,
					 10% of the adult population in the U.S. had at one time taken the medications.
					 We also know that the number of adverse reactions reported to the FDA almost
					 doubled between 1993 and 1999. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know from studies in Canada, in particular a 1999
					 study by Joel Lexchin, an expert in the field of drugs and pharmaceuticals,
					 that in that year there were 2,900 deaths from adverse reactions in Ontario
					 alone. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toll is great. The costs to our health care system
					 are large and could be prevented. This is a matter that falls within federal
					 jurisdiction. The federal government has the ability under the Food and Drug
					 Act to take action. It is responsible for ensuring the safety of drugs for all
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we ask the government to exert that authority,
					 take responsibility for this serious issue and move as quickly as possible to
					 address the concerns we have enunciated today. These concerns became apparent
					 during the coroner's inquest into the death of Vanessa Young and are very much
					 a part of public policy debate in Canada today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask the government to move seriously on this
					 recommendation and implement, as expeditiously as possible, a system of
					 mandatory reporting of adverse drug reactions.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for Winnipeg
					 North Centre on her initiative in bringing forward this motion. All Canadians
					 want to know that the prescribed medications they take are safe. They place
					 tremendous confidence in the ability of Health Canada to provide health care
					 professionals with up to date drug safety information. Health Canada is open to
					 suggestions or new activities that could increase its capacity to detect drug
					 safety problems and thereby avoid serious adverse reactions to drugs taken by
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government welcomes the motion by the NDP health
					 critic that it should immediately, in consultation with provincial and
					 territorial governments, establish a system for mandatory reporting of adverse
					 drug reactions. Such a system should address not only the quantity but the
					 quality of reports received. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This follows up on one of the 59 recommendations that
					 came out of the coroner's inquest into the death of Vanessa Young who died at
					 the age of 15 while taking the prescribed drug prepulsid. Her death was a sad
					 event in my home riding of Oakville. I was fortunate enough to have known
					 Vanessa Young and her parents. I saw the community grieving at her death. It
					 was a tragedy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence presented at the inquest showed that the
					 current system for reporting adverse drug reaction in Canada is not organized
					 to its full potential. The inquest identified the need to implement
					 improvements that would enable Health Canada to compile information on drug
					 safety more quickly and thereby act faster on potentially dangerous situations
					 once they are identified. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jury recommended that it be mandatory for health
					 care professionals to forward information to Health Canada on all serious
					 adverse drug reactions within 48 hours. The inquest used the same definition of
					 serious adverse reaction that is currently found in our food and drug
					 regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before discussing the many issues pertaining to
					 mandatory reporting I will give a bit of background on the approval and
					 post-market surveillance programs of Health Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, no drug is authorized for sale in our country
					 before it has gone through a rigorous review process. Once a drug is on the
					 market Health Canada continues to monitor it for adverse reactions, investigate
					 complaints or reported problems and update conditions of its use via changes to
					 the product monograph. If necessary it can remove a drug from the
					 market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, the product licensing framework that will soon
					 be implemented has defined mandatory reporting requirements regarding emerging
					 safety issues in other countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another current initiative is the collaboration between
					 Canada and the U.S. in a shared adverse events reporting system. Once
					 implemented such a database would enable earlier detection of drug safety
					 problems than is currently possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mandatory system for adverse drug reaction reporting
					 has great potential as an improvement to the current system. However all
					 aspects of such reporting must be carefully weighed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if mandatory reporting generated a higher
					 number of quality reports of drug safety problems it would increase the ability
					 of Health Canada to determine such problems. However at present Health Canada
					 has no clear evidence that mandatory reporting would result in the submission
					 of quality information and thereby substantially increase its capacity to
					 detect drug safety issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries have reported success with mandatory
					 reporting. France has mandatory reporting yet does not seem to have a
					 significantly higher number of reports than countries without it. Nor does it
					 detect drug safety signals at a higher rate than countries that do not have
					 mandatory reporting. France has also found it problematic to enforce mandatory
					 reporting. Because of issues of patient confidentiality it is difficult to gain
					 access to physicians' offices where much of the reporting is done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion as a means of strengthening Health
					 Canada's ability to generate drug safety signals. However there are aspects of
					 it that require further clarification and discussion.</p>


	<A NAME="T1825"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1825)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, who is expected to report? Should it only be
					 doctors or should pharmacists, nurses or other health care professionals
					 report? What about the time frame for reporting? In addition, what about issues
					 of patient confidentiality? The implications of mandatory reporting need to be
					 thought out and its scope and expectations clearly defined so that informed
					 decisions can be made in moving this motion forward into action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the other initiatives aimed at strengthening
					 the post-market surveillance capacity of Health Canada are the adverse event
					 reporting system currently used by the United States and the plans of Health
					 Canada to partner with the U.S. in this system. It is among one the largest
					 databases of its kind in the world and is specifically designated to assess the
					 risks associated with drugs that are approved for sale. The U.S. has several
					 years of experience using it. It contains close to three million adverse drug
					 reaction reports. Each year about 300,000 new adverse reactions are entered. We
					 think that partnering with the FDA and the use of this database will provide a
					 powerful tool to enable Health Canada to detect potential drug safety issues in
					 a more timely manner than is currently possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another initiative is the creation of a joint committee
					 between Health Canada and provincial and territorial health professional groups
					 to examine the effectiveness of the risk information delivery system among all
					 concerned parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to their input to the issue of mandatory
					 adverse drug reaction reporting, this joint committee will be asked to evaluate
					 risk communication tools and techniques used to inform health care
					 professionals and the general public with a view to improving their
					 effectiveness. Ultimately this committee will report its findings, including
					 any recommendations for improvement, to the coroner within one year of the date
					 of the Vanessa Young verdict, which will be April 24, 2002.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Canada has also had discussions with the Royal
					 College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Canadian College of Family Medicine
					 as to their interest in incorporating new drug risk information into their
					 maintenance of competency programs for physicians. This initiative will help
					 ensure that physicians keep current on drug risk information disseminated by
					 Health Canada or other reputable information sources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure members of the House and all Canadians
					 that Health Canada is actively seeking more effective ways to identify drug
					 safety problems and to manage them in a timely manner. Health Canada values the
					 health and well-being of Canadians above everything else. Our country has a
					 good safety record with respect to drugs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion to establish a mandatory reporting system is
					 one potential step toward improving the availability of drug safety information
					 and in identifying risks that could pose life threatening situations.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying risks posed by drugs and communicating such
					 risks in a timely manner is what Canadians want. I know I can call on the
					 members of the House to support our future initiatives to improve the
					 post-market surveillance activities of Health Canada among which mandatory
					 reporting is one.</p>

					 Fuca, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I too congratulate the member for Winnipeg
					 North Centre for the intent of her motion. She is dealing with an issue that I
					 struggle with as a physician. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our patients have adverse reactions from time
					 to time through no fault of their own and through no fault of ours. It is an
					 unfortunate side effect of practising medicine. All that we can do to prevent
					 other tragedies like Vanessa's from happening needs to be
					 implemented.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion put forward today would initiate an
					 immediate consultation with provincial and territorial governments to establish
					 a system for the mandatory reporting of adverse drug reactions. While the
					 intent is worth while, practically speaking it is impossible to do. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member would be wise to separate out and focus the
					 motion on the particularly tragic situation of Vanessa Young as being the worst
					 possible case in that someone dies as a result of taking medications.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we focus the motion on having mandatory reporting
					 for fatal or near fatal drug reactions, the motion has a lot of merit and is
					 doable. However to merely say that the motion would deal with adverse drug
					 reactions would be impossible. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a patient is having a reaction we do not know
					 whether that reaction is in fact due to a drug, a disease, or whether it is due
					 to something else entirely, so we are unsure. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are trying to prevent fatal reactions then
					 mandatory reporting and transmitting the distribution of the information on
					 drugs that may be causing fatal or near fatal problems is absolutely important,
					 and historically we have been able to do that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that this happened with prepulsid is important
					 because all practitioners knew that it had taken place very quickly. I would
					 like to draw to member's attention to a number of other issues. The question is
					 how much of a problem is it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people quote that 10,000 people die from adverse
					 drug reactions. If we look at the statistics it shows something very different.
					 For example, in Ontario between 1992 and 1997 there were 16,300 admissions per
					 year for adverse drug reactions. How many people died? About .05% of the people
					 actually died from adverse drug reactions. If we look at the country that
					 amounts to about 1,824 deaths per year. That is a lot of people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, given the number of people taking drugs and
					 medications, it demonstrates that a lot of people are taking medications and
					 the numbers are a lot smaller than has been actually described at times.
					 Approximately 1,824 people per year died unnecessary deaths. If we can do other
					 things to lessen our mortality figures then we ought to do it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that we can do is to publish where there have
					 been fatal drug reactions in something like <i>The Canada Gazette</i>. This is
					 a public document to which all Canadians can have access. A good modified
					 motion would include that information about fatal or near fatal drug reactions
					 be published in <i>The Canada Gazette</i>. It would give everyone a red light.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing we need to look at is how drugs are
					 assessed to determine when they are a danger to society or to the patient. As
					 the government has removed a lot of money from the health protection branch of
					 Health Canada, we need to look at the manner in which the safety of drugs is
					 determined. We have some serious questions on whether that has been eroded over
					 the last few years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should make a transparent investigation
					 into the health protection branch to determine the method by which drugs are
					 assessed as to their effectiveness and whether they pose a danger to patients.
					 This examination must be made public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also look at drug costs and how they are
					 passed. We know that the cost of drugs to the public coffers is actually quite
					 large and we need to determine ways in which we can lessen that. </p>


	<A NAME="T1830"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1830"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1830)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we age there will be a greater need for medications.
					 With the cost of medications rising, we need to look at ways in which we can
					 decrease costs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patent protection that exists now has roughly
					 existed for 20 years throughout the west. However there are a number of
					 loopholes where patents on medications can actually be lengthened. Just before
					 a patent expires, an infringement lawsuit can be brought by a non-generic
					 patent company that would extend a patent for up to 30 months. They can also
					 extend it for periods of six months by changing the patent slightly, such as
					 changing the colour of the pill or some other superficial change to the
					 medication which would actually extend the patent protection over and beyond
					 the expiry of the patent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those loopholes need to be closed off because that is
					 not what patents were intended to do. When we allow loopholes, the public pay a
					 much higher cost because they do not have access to the generic medications in
					 a timely fashion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious issues took place when certain companies in the
					 U.S., and I am sure they were in the minority, paid generic companies not to
					 manufacture generic drugs, which extended the control of patent drug companies
					 over a drug. This is also collusion, which is illegal under the laws of the
					 land. We have also seen applications by brand name companies that have actually
					 pushed their control over and beyond what was its intent. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of adverse drug reactions is something that
					 is very much of concern to all health care practitioners as well as the public.
					 As the member for Winnipeg North Centre has put it, the intent is to ensure
					 that the drug reactions that occur and put people in danger are known, not only
					 to the public, but also to health care practitioners and that it is stopped at
					 source. Again, a motion should be put forth that deals with fatal and nearly
					 fatal drug reactions. This information should be displayed to physicians and to
					 the public in a central location. We also need to look at the relationships
					 between drug companies and Health Canada and how drugs are approved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just returned from a trip to West Africa where I
					 had the opportunity to distribute a number of medications to people in dire
					 need in one of the poorest countries of the world. I would like to take this
					 opportunity to thank the research based drug pharmaceutical companies that
					 donated more than $5,000 worth of medication. I publicly thank them for this
					 generous gesture. It is a program that enables physicians travelling abroad to
					 distribute drugs to some of the most impoverished people in the world who
					 essentially have nothing.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I too would like to thank and congratulate
					 our colleague who sat with us on the Standing Committee on Health, for her
					 excellent initiative, in principle. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it would have been advisable for our
					 colleague to have had more to say on how all this would operate. I think we
					 have no great difficulty in subscribing to the principle of providing the
					 maximum information on the effects of drugs, particularly prescription drugs,
					 but this could also apply to over-the-counter medicines. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for knowing how this is going to be put into
					 practice, we must admit that our colleague was not too forthcoming with
					 details.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Canada has a system of mandatory reporting
					 of certain diseases. Taking AIDS as my example, when someone dies in hospital
					 of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the health professionals, the
					 physicians, are required to report it. There is a national registry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives the Canadian centre for epidemioliogy an
					 idea of the number of deaths from AIDS, obviously so that they may have some
					 understanding of the face of the epidemic. When they do, they will have a
					 better grasp of the situation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of concern to us here, we are told that
					 every year, people, apparently some 10,000, die from a drug reaction.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This immediately raises two questions. Does this mean
					 that, by authorizing use of the drug, starting as a new experimental drug that
					 has been approved under the regulations within a known process requiring
					 clinical tests and the provision of monographs, a process that seems to be
					 pretty rigorous, Health Canada has failed in its statutory obligations and
					 allowed a drug to be sold that has harmful effects?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that, in prescribing a medication, a
					 health professional, a physician, has improperly assessed the bio-availability
					 and bio-reactivity of the various individuals taking that drug?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where it is not easy to draw the line. Would a
					 better information system make it possible to avoid situations like the one
					 described to us by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre? Perhaps. But I
					 believe questions need to be asked about the share of the responsibility that
					 lies with Health Canada, the health professionals, and the
					 physicians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I believe that if we are to analyze or study a
					 motion such as the one before us, we need to situate it in a much broader
					 context. Of course we must investigate the drug certification system, to model
					 it after the system of reportable diseases, but we must also look into the
					 whole issue of drug costs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I agree completely with the previous
					 speaker's comments, and I would like to share some figures on this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In researching this speech, I reread what was written
					 by the National Forum on Health. Members will remember that the Prime Minister
					 set up the National Forum on Health in 1995. The forum's report was tabled in
					 1997.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report reminds us that between 1975 and 1995, drug
					 costs in Canada climbed from $1.1 billion to $9.2 billion. These are the
					 figures available from 1994, so we can expect that the numbers have grown even
					 more since then.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of witnesses told us that among the most
					 expensive costs in health care, it is drug-related costs that have gone up the
					 quickest.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unusual to observe that for many governments,
					 whether it be the governments of Quebec, Ontario and likely Manitoba as well,
					 health care spending represents 12, 13, 14 or 15% of their budgets, and in some
					 cases more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, you seem very informed on these issues.
					 According to figures published by the National Forum on Health, we spent on
					 average 12.7% in 1994; that figure is probably much higher today. Would it not
					 be wise to refer to the Standing Committee on Health measures that would enable
					 us to see how we could better control drug costs?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time ago, the government of Quebec held a
					 parliamentary commission. The commission, known as the Good Samaritan was made
					 up of a group of doctors. They proposed a certain number of solutions that I
					 would like to share with my colleagues, and study in parliamentary
					 committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance between brand name drug and generic drug
					 industries is not easily called into question. Before the summer adjournment,
					 we passed a bill from the other place, Bill S-15, a decision by the World Trade
					 Organization whereby Canada has to provide all Canadian patents the same
					 protection, be they on intellectual property, copyright or drugs. That means
					 that Canada has little manoeuvring room to review the Patents Act, since the
					 WTO rendered a decision. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, could we not approach things in a way that
					 would allow us to make broader use of our generic drugs industry while not
					 losing sight of the fact that each time a new drug comes onto the market,
					 hundreds of millions of dollars are required for research?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first solution proposed by the Good Samaritan
					 Commission was to recommend to the government of Quebec that it permit, as
					 other provinces do, the expanded sale of generic drugs. The commission
					 considered the abolition of this rule would mean an immediate savings of
					 $45 million annually.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and this ties in with our NDP colleague's
					 concerns, it is public knowledge that physicians prescribe drugs much too
					 generously.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The example was given of antibiotics prescribed for the
					 flu. The commission said that if doctors received better training, we are
					 talking about training in connection with the writing of prescriptions, there
					 could be savings of 10%. The Good Samaritan commission, composed of doctors,
					 estimated that if health professionals, particularly doctors, were given better
					 training, 10% of the $1 billion in drug costs could be saved. This would save
					 the public treasury, in this case the government of Quebec,
					 $100 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commission also talked about prescribing less
					 expensive drugs. One extremely interesting example was given. The commission
					 said that doctors prescribe drugs that are far too expensive because they
					 themselves, as health care professionals, are often unaware of the cost of
					 drugs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The example of ulcers was given. I hope that I myself
					 will not be too responsible for giving you ulcers, Mr. Speaker, but should
					 anyone in the House have them, three drugs were mentioned: Losec, Acinétidine,
					 and Raniditine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Losec costs $2.20 a tablet, Raniditine 40 cents a
					 tablet, and Acinétidine nine cents a tablet. These drugs are used for similar
					 therapeutic purposes. If all doctors whose patients had ulcers were to
					 prescribe the least expensive drug, $50 million annually could be
					 saved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that my allotted time is up, but I will conclude
					 by saying that these are issues the Standing Committee on Health should take a
					 serious look at.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to enter into the discussion
					 on the motion made by the member for Winnipeg North Centre. It proposes to put
					 into place a system of mandatory reporting for adverse drug
					 reactions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first reaction is surprise that it is not already in
					 place, but one thing about our job is that we often get surprises and this is a
					 surprise to me that there is no mandatory requirement for that. I noticed in
					 reading the minutes of the subcommittee on private members' business that I am
					 not the only one who is surprised.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal member for Hull--Aylmer was also very
					 surprised. He asked if there is not anything through Health Canada that is
					 compulsory. The member for Winnipeg North Centre replied, no, stating that is
					 why it was raised.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Hull--Aylmer again asked if there was no
					 system whatsoever. There is no system whatsoever to require reporting of an
					 adverse drug reaction and that is why this is a very appropriate matter to
					 bring before the House and is something that we should be considering in the
					 way we are, and perhaps even as a motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important matter. I thank the member for
					 Winnipeg North Centre for bringing it to our attention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her appearance before the subcommittee on private
					 members' business shortly before the summer recess, the hon. member spoke of
					 the tragic and unfortunate death of Vanessa Young, who passed away after taking
					 Prepulsid. She said that was one of the reasons that pushed her to bring the
					 motion forward. Indeed, seemingly preventable incidents such as this one
					 clearly reveal the need to review departmental regulations regarding the
					 reporting of adverse drug reactions. It only makes sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the preventability of harm caused by these
					 adverse affects, and in light of the increasing reliance on drugs in our health
					 care system, this is clearly a matter worthy of the attention of the Department
					 of Health and, indeed, the health minister. Measures such as the one proposed
					 by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre are important because they go to
					 the very heart of the issue of informed choice. This is about giving consumers
					 and patients the information they need to make wise decisions about their
					 health and the health of their families.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My party has long recognized the contribution of
					 Canada's pharmaceutical industry to economic growth and innovation. The proof,
					 as I have pointed out, is in the growing importance of drugs and the delivery
					 of health services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important now is for the government to provide
					 the necessary regulatory framework to ensure that Canadians are best able to
					 benefit from the advancement in pharmaceuticals but at the same time are
					 protected from some of the potential dangers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this initiative moves the debate in the right
					 direction. I encourage the member to pursue her efforts in bringing this issue
					 to the attention of the government again and again. If a private member's bill
					 is ever brought to the House, it is my hope that it will be chosen as votable.
					 To be sure there are important questions that need answers, such as how much a
					 system like this would cost, who would implement it and what the
					 federal-provincial ramifications are of any such regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the hon. member to toughen the language of
					 any future motion or bill when it comes to federal-provincial co-operation.
					 Simply put, when it comes to the government, consultation is just not enough.
					 The government has shown itself perfectly capable of talking the talk of
					 collaborative federalism while developing policies as it, and only it, sees
					 fit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this comes back as a private member's bill I can
					 assure the member for Winnipeg North Centre that I will be supporting the
					 initiative and I thank her for bringing it forth.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, first let me say how much I have
					 appreciated the seriousness with which members of parliament have taken this
					 issue. I have appreciated the input from the members of all parties who have
					 spoken in the House today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that there is a general consensus in this
					 place for action with regard to adverse reactions caused by pharmaceuticals in
					 our society today. There are obviously differences in approach. Various
					 suggestions have been made about how we can pursue this matter. I have listened
					 seriously and will come back with further suggestions and recommendations based
					 on that advice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certainly encouraged by the words from the member
					 from Oakville, the chairperson of the health committee, who I understand has
					 spoken on behalf of the government and has given us a very clear indication
					 that the present government is taking this recommendation very
					 seriously.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of my remarks I was going to move the usual
					 motion to seek unanimous consent to make this motion votable. I will not do
					 that today given the words from the government side and the clear indication of
					 support from the member from Oakville who has said the government will be
					 taking this under advisement, looking at it very seriously, and making
					 recommendations before the year since the inquest into Vanessa Young's death
					 has passed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means we can expect action on this matter no later
					 than April 2002. Mr. Speaker, you can be sure we will be holding the government
					 to account for those intentions and pursuing every avenue we can to make that a
					 reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of other suggestions were made that deserve
					 quick comment. The member for Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca has indicated that
					 perhaps we should look at a system that separates out fatal or near fatal
					 reactions from this broad request for mandatory reporting. I will pursue that
					 carefully, but I want to stress that I think the purpose of this motion is to
					 take every precaution we can to ensure that people do not experience death or
					 near death experiences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a broader mandate is required in this instance
					 and I have yet to hear any substantive arguments for why this would be so
					 difficult to implement. In fact the suggestions made from others in the House
					 indicate that it is a feasible idea that could be implemented fairly
					 quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to also say to my colleague from the Bloc, the
					 member for Hochelaga--Maisonneuve, that he raises a very important issue about
					 the House looking at the whole issue of drug costs, which is indeed the fastest
					 rising element of our health care system. We know in fact that drug costs have
					 risen over 87% in the last decade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a parliament and as a health committee we need to
					 look at the reasons for those cost increases. We need to look at patent
					 protection. We need to look at over prescribing. We need to look at people not
					 filling prescriptions because of a lack of resources to buy expensive drugs. We
					 need to look at the whole range of issues that are driving up the costs of our
					 health care system and in fact putting our whole medicare system on a very weak
					 footing. It is a very important issue that we have to pursue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, today we look to addressing one part
					 of the problem facing our health care system and that is the serious costs in
					 terms of human health and sustainability of our system because of adverse drug
					 reactions. We can do something about that. It takes not only reporting of those
					 incidents, it requires good quality reporting, sharing of the information and
					 action on the part of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that with regard to the death of
					 Vanessa Young mandatory reporting was part of the problem, but more critical
					 was the inaction of the government when it knew that there were adverse drug
					 reactions, that there were serious illnesses associated with the use of this
					 drug Prepulsid and that there were deaths occurring because of Prepulsid being
					 available on the market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to call for vigilance on all fronts. Again I
					 thank all members for sharing in this very important debate and for their
					 valuable advice.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to raise
					 again the question on the softwood lumber industry in Canada. I raised it
					 several months ago. It is now even more urgent since the September 4 decision
					 by the U.S. department of commerce to impose a 19.3% countervail charge against
					 the softwood lumber industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry is hurting very dramatically right now
					 because of this incredible countervail charge. Many jobs are being lost and
					 businesses are closing. Today I met with members of the Canadian Lumber
					 Remanufacturers Alliance. Because of the nature of their business they are
					 hurting more than others. They are a value added industry, which means that the
					 countervail is charged not only on the price of raw material, not only on the
					 mill gate price, but on the border ready price, after the value added, after
					 the labour and after the Canadian content has been put on. It results in a
					 doubling of duty for the Canadian Lumber Remanufacturers Alliance
					 members.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is extremely serious for them. The impact will mean
					 closures and failures in the industry. They are seeking an exemption in the
					 short term. They are seeking a long term resolution to resolve this ongoing
					 issue which pops up every five years. The industry has to go through tremendous
					 turmoil and aggravation. They want it resolved, as does the entire
					 industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks ago I had the honour of accompanying the
					 right hon. member for Calgary Centre to a meeting. We met with the
					 vice-president of the United States about this very issue. We informed him of
					 our concerns and also of the intention of new British Columbia premier Gordon
					 Campbell to reconsider their marketing approach, which has been part of the
					 excuse used by the U.S. industry to cause the government to impose these
					 countervail charges and anti-dumping charges that are still pending.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provided the vice-president with material given to
					 us by Premier Campbell which indicated that they have the intention of moving
					 toward a more market driven pricing initiative or regime. He welcomed this
					 initiative and he was very encouraged by it. He and his officials acknowledged
					 that this would help remove the excuses and the tools that the U.S. industry
					 uses to pry the government into imposing these taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to applaud the premier of British Columbia for
					 these efforts. We encourage him to move ahead toward a more market driven price
					 as he has proposed. We think that after these consultations with the Americans,
					 by moving to a more market driven pricing schedule many of the excuses used by
					 the Americans would disappear. The administration would then move to resolve
					 the issue and move to a free trade regime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this very important time, Canadian officials from
					 the department and also from industry are meeting with American officials. I
					 ask the hon. parliamentary secretary, in these discussions with the U.S.
					 department, is the government also working with the government of British
					 Columbia to help move them toward a more market driven price regime for their
					 raw materials?</p>

					 to the Minister of International Trade, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, at this time Canadians are very much
					 united in grief with the United States and are determined to help bring the
					 criminals of the recent terrible atrocity to justice. In the midst of that kind
					 of outpouring of unity with our American friends, neighbours and relatives, we
					 do realistically find ourselves with some bilateral problems that have to be
					 addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague, the member for
					 Cumberland--Colchester, has been very determined in highlighting these
					 questions and raising these concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is acting on several fronts to try and resolve
					 this unfortunate dispute. As he noted, it rears its ugly head every five years
					 and Canada has to reprove its case. As you know, Mr. Speaker, since you
					 represent a riding with tremendous lumber interests, we reprove the fact that
					 we do not subsidize our softwood lumber, that in fact everything on our side is
					 being done above board.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We call upon our American friends and neighbours to
					 respect the desire for free trade in softwood lumber.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are acting on several fronts, at the WTO, at NAFTA.
					 As my colleague has mentioned, discussions are going on in Toronto today and
					 over the next couple of days between Canadian and American officials to try and
					 find the root causes of this problem, to find a solution outside litigation. We
					 hope that will be the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague knows, the Prime Minister has
					 personally raised this issue with President Bush. Just before the atrocity in
					 Washington, the Minister for International Trade was there to speak personally
					 with Mr. Zoellick and Mr. Evans. We will continue to move in every possible way
					 to try and resolve this issue as amicably and as quickly as we can.</p>
