</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in the House 
to bring forward the motion for debate because it is a very 
topical issue and something that I think is of great interest to 
Canadians.  The motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans should decree an immediate moratorium on the live capture 
and trade of cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my remarks by explaining why I have brought the 
motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that Canada lacks any regulation.  In fact Canada 
has chosen not to regulate the import, export and interprovincial 
trade in marine mammals or to regulate their breeding in 
captivity.  This is in very sharp contrast to other countries, 
especially the U.K., which has very tough legislation regulating 
marine mammals in captivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of my motion is to engage in a very important public 
discussion among Canadians about the ethics, the problems and the 
issues with the trade and captivity of marine mammals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Canadians care deeply about marine mammals and 
what happens to them.  We need as public legislators to start 
making decisions about how to protect the species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current situation in Canada is actually something that is 
quite sad.  Going back to 1992, we have a good initiative in that 
the then minister of DFO, Mr. Crosbie, announced that he would no 
longer consider any application for the live capture of beluga 
whales from Canada to other countries.  However this only covered 
belugas.  It did not deal with interprovincial trade within 
Canada.  Unfortunately it has occurred in practice only, that is, 
it has not been followed up in any policy sense or in any 
legislative sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to ask the question:  Why has the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans deemed it inappropriate to export belugas to 
other countries but has left it quite open that other marine 
mammals are unprotected within our borders? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the motion before us today were taken up by the government, 
which I hope it will be, who would be affected by this 
moratorium?  Currently in Canada, we have three aquariums which 
feature captive whales and dolphins:  the Vancouver Aquarium; the 
West Edmonton Mall; and Marineland of Canada in Niagara Falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The West Edmonton Mall personnel have indicated that they will 
phase out the dolphin show and not replace the dolphins upon 
their deaths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Vancouver Aquarium, as a result of many years of public 
lobbying and very strong public concern, has stated that it will 
no longer acquire whales and dolphins from the wild and will no 
longer keep killer whales.  In fact, the last remaining orca 
whale, the Bjossa, is slated to go to Sea World in San Diego very 
shortly.  However, the situation at the Vancouver Aquarium is 
that it still left open the possibility of securing marine 
mammals already captive at other facilities.  The reason I 
brought forward this motion is that it would put a stop to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aquarium in Canada, Marineland, currently has 10 
beluga whales, 7 bottlenose dolphins and 7 killer whales. It has 
a history of breeding animals and may be poised, unfortunately, 
to become an international source for the captive whale and 
dolphin industry unless it is regulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious subject.  There is a lot of ambiguity and 
confusion about what Canada's position is on the issue due to the 
lack of regulation and legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Vancouver parks board, which I visited last Monday night, 
March 26, was considering its own bylaw that would theoretically 
prohibit the importation of live captive whales and dolphins. 
Unfortunately, the bylaw was so ambiguous that a lot of concerned 
groups and individuals in Vancouver lobbied the parks board for a 
clear bylaw that would prohibit the live capture and importation 
or trading of whales through the Vancouver Aquarium.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke at the Vancouver park board it seemed to me that it 
would make much better sense to have a national policy and/or 
legislation that would clearly outline Canada's position and 
protect these magnificent animals from live capture and captivity 
in aquariums and trading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing research on this issue, one of the things I found to be 
most disturbing was that not only does Canada have a lack of 
regulation and a lack of policy on this issue but we also have 
become a haven for what is called whale laundering.  This is 
something that is very serious and is not known by many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries, such as the United States, have much tougher 
legislation governing the capture of marine mammals for 
captivity.  To avoid these rules, some U.S. facilities can 
capture animals in a third country, Russia for example, and then 
house those animals in facilities here in Canada.  The practice 
has been that after a short period of time, maybe a year or so, 
they are then brought into the United States.  This process has 
allowed U.S. marine facilities to bypass their own tough 
legislation and to avoid public scrutiny.  They are using Canada 
and our facilities to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that Marineland and the Vancouver Aquarium 
have served in this capacity in the past.  In doing so, I believe 
that our Canadian facilities undermine marine mammal regulations 
in other countries and indeed internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now spend a few minutes on the cost of government 
inaction.  Canada's Marineland has been very active in the 
international whale and dolphin trade.  Since May 1999, it has 
imported 12 beluga whales and six bottlenose dolphins from 
Russia.  Two of the belugas have since died in captivity.  The 
capturing of these animals happens in the most inhumane fashion 
imaginable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday, when I held a press conference on my motion, we 
showed a video that was taken in Russia on the capture of beluga 
whales. It showed the absolute inhumane conditions that are in 
complete violation of international rules for aviation, travel 
and transport as well as for the capture of whales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The video was most graphic and disturbing. It showed the cruelty 
and abuse these animals suffer only to end up captive in a marine 
facility where they are put on public display.  My fear is that 
if the minister does not act soon Canada will become known as a 
warehousing facility for marine mammals to other facilities 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government inaction is not only lamentable but it defies both 
logic and compassion.  I know the minister has received thousands 
of letters asking him to act.  I also know that during this past 
week about 100 e-mails, letters and faxes in support of the 
motion came through to the minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Tuesday I attended the Pacific headquarters of the DFO in 
Vancouver and delivered to the minister's office copies of all of 
the e-mails that I have received as well as a presentation from 
Zoocheck Canada of a very serious graphic representation of a 
whale inside a sardine can.  We know what we see when we peel 
back a sardine can.  We see sardines squished together, lined up 
one by one in those tiny cans.  Imagine a poster of a sardine can 
and when it is rolled back from the corner what we see is a 
whale.  That representation really symbolizes what this issue is 
about in terms of captivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to the governments inaction, one of the things that is 
really of very grave concern is that in 1998 the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans commissioned Dr. Jon Lien, a respected 
marine mammal scientist from Memorial University in Newfoundland, 
to examine the practice of live capture and captive maintenance 
of marine mammals in Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1115
<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that report from 1998, not only did Dr. Lien call for a ban 
on new live capture and imports, but he also called for a 
moratorium on the captive maintenance of marine mammals. The 
department and the minister have now had this report sitting on 
their desks for two years and have chosen not to act on the 
recommendation from Dr. Lien. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask the question today:  why has this report not been 
acted on?  Why has this issue been left not even on the back 
burner but just gathering dust on a shelf while we still have 
live capture, trading and captivity of whales and dolphins in our 
country and are now warehousing them for other groups around the 
world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Animal protection groups such as Zoocheck Canada have made 
numerous attempts to meet with the minister and/or DFO staff in 
the past year, but those requests have been denied.  Yet I was 
astounded to learn just a few days ago that the department is 
currently meeting with industry officials in secret and looking 
at developing supposed educational standards in regard to the 
captivity of whales and dolphins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I have to ask why there is a double standard here.  Why do 
we have a report that has not been acted upon when there is 
intense public interest in the issue?  Why is it that the 
department is meeting behind closed doors when there should be 
open public disclosure and debate about the very important 
ethical, educational and scientific issues involved in the 
captivity of these marine mammals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that the motion today is not asking that 
Canada take a leadership role on the issue, because a number of 
countries around the world have already imposed bans on the 
import of whales and dolphins, including Argentina, Cyprus, 
Hungary, India, Israel and Chile.  What we are asking in the 
motion is that Canada play its role, that it display progressive 
and positive decision making to protect these magnificent animals 
from further abuse and from further live capture and captivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the quality of life for marine mammals in 
captivity is inhumane.  There is very strong evidence for this. 
Far from being a far ranging, deep diving, constantly moving 
creature, a captive whale becomes essentially a sedentary animal, 
spending most of its time at the surface swimming in circles in a 
small concrete tank.  In some cases, such as Marineland of 
Canada, this means keeping an adult orca in a 25 foot diameter 
tank for long periods of time so that it has nothing to do but 
float motionless at the surface.  Is this educational?  Is this 
what we consider humane treatment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Orcas, dolphins and beluga whales use echolocation or sonar 
ability to navigate at night and to find food.  In a concrete 
tank which never changes and has no textural variety to it, they 
almost never use this critical behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whales and dolphins are among the most socially complex 
creatures on earth.  They live in close knit groups that often 
consist of multiple generations of the same family.  The life 
expectancy of marine mammals in captivity is greatly reduced.  In 
the wild, orcas can live into their 80s, while in captivity few 
have lived into their 30s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly there is an ethical issue about whether or not these 
animals are being kept in captivity for so-called education or 
simply for entertainment.  It is clear that we need to do 
something.  It is clear that we need to act upon the 
recommendations in Dr. Lien's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank many people and organizations such as Brian 
McHattie from Zoocheck Canada, Shelagh Macdonald from the 
Canadian Federation of Human Societies, Annelise Sorg from the 
Coalition for No Whales in Captivity in Vancouver, and John Mate 
from Whale Friends.  They have taken up this issue with 
passion, have not let it go and have demanded that the government 
determine why this report from two years ago has not been acted 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the responses from other parties today in the 
House.  I hope there will be a positive response.  If we 
genuinely believe there should be protection for these 
magnificent animals, then that report must be acted on by the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, the member for Labrador, to rise in the 
House today to respond to the motion put forward by the member 
for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to thank the member for Vancouver East for 
her continuing concern and interest in the live capture and trade 
of whales and dolphins.  I think it is very important that we 
outline the facts as they exist and the work the government and 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans have been doing in this 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fisheries and Oceans Canada takes the well-being of aquatic 
animals, including those in aquariums, very seriously.  For 
decades all applications for live capture have been carefully 
scrutinized to ensure that the well-being of these creatures is 
always the first priority.  Applications are examined to 
determine the adequacy of each aquarium's facilities, the quality 
of its staff and veterinary support and a range of other 
considerations.  If there is any doubt in these areas, the 
application is turned down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While keeping whales and dolphins in aquariums is generally seen 
as both safe for these creatures and a useful educational tool, 
DFO is well aware of the concerns expressed by Canadians about 
keeping whales in captivity.  It is true that the long term 
effects of captivity on whales and dolphins are largely unknown. 
For these reasons, in 1992 Canada placed a moratorium on the live 
capture of whales and dolphins for export.  The moratorium is 
still in effect.  There has not been a live capture in Canadian 
waters since that time.  I want to emphasize that:  there has not 
been a live capture in Canadian waters since that time.  In fact, 
since 1992 there has been only one application for the live 
capture of a whale for a Canadian aquarium.  That application was 
rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To develop long term policies for live capture, however, DFO is 
working to improve its knowledge on the effects of captivity on 
whales and dolphins and to clarify the various jurisdictions 
involved.   Allow me to present the details of the review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An independent scientist commissioned by the department 
conducted a comprehensive review to provide recommendations about 
the relevance of live captures to DFO's role in marine mammal 
management.  To do this, he travelled across Canada and consulted 
a wide range of interested groups.  While the review acknowledged 
the benefits of live capture and gave qualified support for 
whales in aquariums, it also pointed out specific deficiencies 
and provided a series of recommendations on how to improve marine 
mammal management in three key areas:  one, whales in captivity; 
two, care and maintenance standards; and three, international 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first group of recommendations, however, whales in 
captivity, is one where the federal government can do little. 
Under the constitution, the holding of animals in captivity falls 
under the responsibility of the provinces.  DFO has legal 
authority only over the live capture of whales from wild stocks 
in Canadian waters and their release back into the wild. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, however, in keeping with the spirit of the 
review the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is looking at other 
ways to address the recommendations outlined in areas where the 
department can in fact make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second group of recommendations, care and maintenance 
standards, is one in which the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
is looking to make progress.  Once again, while care and 
maintenance of these creatures is a provincial responsibility, 
DFO is examining opportunities within the federal jurisdiction to 
work closely with organizations such as the Canadian Council on 
Animal Care to establish voluntary standards for aquariums as 
well as a process for their independent verification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, preliminary discussions are confirming that Canadian 
aquariums and their association, the Canadian Association of Zoos 
and Aquariums, are generally supportive of a set of formalized 
care and maintenance standards as well as an independent 
verification process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the third area of interest, international trade, Canadian 
legislation is already in place to deal with the protection and 
trade of species, particularly endangered stocks.  The 1996 Wild 
Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and 
Interprovincial Trade Act addresses any threats to wildlife that 
may result from trade.  In effect, the act implements the United 
Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species 
of Wild Flora and Fauna, or CITES as it is generally known.  This 
is an international treaty designed to protect various species, 
including a number of whales and dolphins.  Canada is a party to 
this convention, along with 151 other nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the convention any trade in rare or endangered species is 
not permitted for commercial purposes.  Species that are not rare 
or endangered but that could become so if trade is not regulated, 
such as beluga whales, which the member mentioned, are also 
covered by this convention.  Under the regulations, trade in 
these species is subject to an export permit from the country of 
export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I should reiterate that there is presently a 
moratorium in Canada on live capture of whales and dolphins for 
export.  At this time, banning imports of dolphins and 
non-endangered whales such as the beluga whale, as put forward in 
the member's motion, would be inconsistent with the convention 
and perhaps also with obligations to which Canada is subject 
under other international trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, let me point out that DFO is currently 
reviewing the question of live capture and is considering 
appropriate alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada takes the well-being of all aquatic creatures very 
seriously.  The stringent application process that has long 
governed the live capture of whales and dolphins and the 
moratorium that has been in place since 1992 provide effective 
protection for wild animals in Canada.  These measures, along 
with the comprehensive review currently being examined by DFO, 
demonstrate the importance the department places on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until concrete recommendations are developed there is no 
pressing reason to change the mechanisms in place with regard to 
live capture.  As I mentioned a moment ago, Canada fully supports 
CITES and has domestic regulations that fully implement our trade 
obligations under this convention.  Clearly it would not be 
appropriate to adopt a proposal that is inconsistent with our 
international obligations.  For this reason, we are unable to 
accept the member's motion to decree an immediate moratorium on 
the live capture and trade of whales and dolphins at this time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker.  It is indeed a pleasure for me to rise in the House 
today to speak to Motion No. 75.  I thank our hon. colleague from 
the New Democratic Party for bringing this to the attention of 
the House and giving us an opportunity to debate the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans should decree an immediate moratorium on the live-capture 
and trade of cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I freely confess that I am not an expert in zoology, biology or 
any other animal husbandry field, but like many others in this 
country I do have an opinion on this issue and I think it is 
reflective of how many Canadians feel.  Let us not forget that an 
issue like this has many aspects to it.  These aspects contain 
safety, humanitarian, educational research and emotional

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion is not votable but I believe that we have the 
opportunity to further the debate in a very calm and rational 
manner.  Issues such as these often become strictly an emotional 
one rather than looking at a situation from several different 
points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over my years I was privileged to visit many of the fine zoos, 
wildlife preserves and the like which we have in Canada.  Coming 
from a west coast riding, perhaps I am more aware of whales, 
dolphins and porpoises and their natural environment than many of 
my colleagues from inland provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last year my family and I had an opportunity to go on a 
whale watching excursion off the Victoria harbour.  My friend 
runs a company that does this.  He is very respectful of the 
natural habitat of whales.  It was an incredible experience to 
see these animals in their environment.  A small minority of 
people are able to do that.  Most of the people who were on the 
tour that day were tourists from Japan and Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we consider this motion calling for an immediate moratorium 
on the live capture and trade of cetaceans, the term moratorium 
can mean several different things.  My understanding of the term 
could be threefold.  First, it could be a legally authorized 
period of delay in the performance of a legal obligation. Second, 
could mean a waiting period set by an authority.  Third, it could 
be a suspension of activity altogether.  While I believe I 
understand the member's motion to mean the third of these 
possible definitions, perhaps we should more closely frame the 
debate in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the many different ways to view this debate, I 
would like to briefly comment on several different aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to safety concerns, I believe most people would 
agree that any animals held outside their regular environment 
should be held in a very safe and humane manner.  By this I am 
specifically referring to the safety of the animal.  The safety 
of the animal also runs in tandem with humanitarian concerns.  I 
recognize that there will be a broad range of thought 
specifically on this issue.  There will be those who feel that 
the only humanitarian place for an animal is in its natural 
environment.  There are others who feel that it is humanitarian 
to have captured animals in an environment that closely resembles 
their natural habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen some of the video clips that the hon. member 
mentioned depicting the live capture of cetaceans.  What I saw 
did raise some personal concerns.  I was concerned over the 
humanitarian treatment of these animals during capture.  I fully 
realize these clips may not accurately depict everything that 
goes on at the time in other places, however the treatment I saw 
was certainly not humanitarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If whales are going to be captured for research, observation and 
the like, then I would personally rather see stricter guidelines 
that clearly state how animals must be treated.  If Canadian 
aquariums are found purchasing from these organizations that 
practise inhumane capture and flaunt the international laws 
governing such, then these aquariums and societies ought to be 
punished by law and prohibited from doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the factors that is often overlooked is the one of 
education.  It is one thing to read a book, watch a video or 
listen to an expert.  I believe it is also important to have a 
tactile experience wherever possible.  If we want to learn more 
and teach our younger generation about these amazing creatures, 
we still need to have the ability to show our children what they 
look like and how they behave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, yes, there are boat tours available. 
However quite frankly most of those activities are outside of 
many family budgets.  Often the only means available for 
thousands of Canadians across this country to see these amazing 
creatures is through an aquarium setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned much about cetaceans.  We learned that they are 
very intelligent creatures.  It was not that many years ago that 
killer whales or orcas were thought to be extremely dangerous and 
hated creatures.  We have since learned much about the true 
nature of these animals.  However we still have much to learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly true that research can and must be done in the 
wild.  However there are times when that research cannot be 
achieved and learned without a controlled environment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The emotional side of this debate is often the most publicized. 
Yes, we can and we should have feelings.  However all too often 
we have allowed our emotions to overrule all other parts of the 
debate.  We need to keep all the parts in balance.  We cannot 
rely solely on emotions and ignore other factors when we are 
debating issues such as this.  We must make decisions based on as 
much of the information as possible that is available to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must confess that I would have been much more supportive of 
the member's motion if it had called for a ban on commercial 
whale harvesting for food and other purposes.  I am particularly 
concerned about reports of Russian and Japanese fishers not 
adhering to the accepted international whaling rules.  In today's 
world I do not believe there is any need to harvest whales for 
food or process them for other products.  Yes, they were used for 
food, oil and many other products historically.  I believe we 
have moved well beyond the need to harvest whales for this 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that the historical use of these animals is 
not a reason to continue their harvesting.  Just because we did 
something in the past does not mean we should continue to do it 
now or in the future.  We can probably think of many examples of 
the past where this would be true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I step back and consider all of these issues together, I 
believe that at the end of the day there would probably more to 
be lost through this motion than gained in its present form. What 
I would be more supportive of is a set of guidelines or 
legislation that states how these animals may be captured, 
studied, housed and viewed in a humane way.  I believe we have a 
responsibility to ensure that unscrupulous people cannot take 
advantage of or abuse these creatures.  However thousands of 
Canadians who have never had a chance to view these magnificent 
animals up close should not be denied the opportunity to do so. 
The much needed research on these animals close up should be 
permitted, albeit in a limited fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has already been pointed out by the hon. member across the 
floor that the care and maintenance of these animals in aquariums 
is really a provincial responsibility.  It seems to me that the 
hon. member from the NDP ought to take her cause up with the 
provinces in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, I believe that more can be gained through 
bona fide research, public, environmental and conservation 
education.  I thank the member for her motion and the opportunity 
to participate in this debate today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased 
to rise in support of Motion No. 75 by the hon. member for 
Vancouver East.  The Bloc Quebecois supports this motion and 
also calls upon Canada to take positive steps and adopt positive 
guidelines concerning cetaceans, their conditions, protection of 
their lives and trade in these species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main objective of having a zoo or aquarium is to enable 
people to observe the animals in a cage or pool.  According to 
an organization called Zoocheck, each visitor spends an average 
of 60 seconds observing each exhibited animal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem in this situation is the cruelty inflicted on marine 
mammals when they are captured. 
The capture is often extremely violent.  It is not a rare 
occurrence for females to abort their young, or for animals to 
beach themselves or drown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specimens may be pursued for hours.  Once caught, they are 
hauled out of the water.  A number of unscrupulous hunters will 
haul them out by the tail.  They are then transported on a sort 
of stretcher.  Because they are out of the water for a number of 
hours, their skin rapidly dehydrates, they have difficulty 
breathing and they develop sores wherever their skin rubs 
against their restraints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A long flight may follow.  Shipping one killer whale to the 
aquarium that had purchased it took 68 hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took 18 hours to fly two dolphins from California to Florida. 
By the time they arrived, their blow holes had become so 
obstructed that one died within days.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, Lufthansa Airlines decided that it would no longer 
transport captive dolphins because doing so caused the animals 
suffering and was too risky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem is the environmental imbalance and threat to the 
survival of certain species.  According to <I>Cetacean Societies</I>, 
which was written last year by an American collective, 66% of 
all mammals captured worldwide are adult females. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the essential role played by females, this has a 
serious effect on the group's reproductive rates and social 
cohesion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 14, 1990, the U.S. government decided to suspend any 
captures of bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico because 
the species was seriously in danger of disappearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, the dolphin population in the Black Sea is endangered 
because of the combined effect of population depletion and 
captures by zoos and aquatic parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arriving in a pool is a triple shock for a newly captured 
dolphin: first, its living space is suddenly and spectacularly 
reduced; second, it is put into close and unconstrained contact 
with human beings and other dolphins not members of its own 
family; third, it is forced to consume dead fish rather than the 
live prey to which it is accustomed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of these traumas, aquariums must confine dolphins to an 
isolated pool for periods that can sometimes last as long as one 
month in order to help them adapt to their new life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are then force-fed dead fish, which must be an absolutely 
dreadful experience for the dolphin.  Fifty percent of captured 
dolphins die within days of arrival at an aquarium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount of activity and space is very important for 
cetaceans.  In the wild, a normal grouping of dolphins totals 
about thirty.  They range throughout a territory some 125 
kilometres 
long and frequently travel beyond it toward other groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pacific dolphins like to dive down to 535 metres in depth while 
the Atlantic dolphins frequently stay at a depth of 390 metres. 
They spend a scant 20% of their time on the surface.  Their time 
is mainly spent searching for bottom-dwelling invertebrates, 
exploring long distances, and hunting as a group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dolphins culturally transmit many things to their young in a 
variety of ways: socialization, games, vocalizations and how to 
raise and protect offspring.  Young dolphins are protected for 
five to fifteen years and intergenerational contacts remain 
frequent once they have reached adulthood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how large an aquarium pool, it forces cetaceans into 
inactivity.  They have no control whatsoever over their 
activities and mating behaviour.  This limited and artificial 
environment and the social interaction with only a few 
individuals is the reason captive animals suffer and die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The restriction of movement leads to muscular sclerosis, or to 
some muscles developing more than others.  The mammals are 
constantly stressed and nervous, as well as more aggressive. 
They also lack appetite because of their lack of exercise. 
Their health is also affected by the fact that the water in the 
pool is chlorinated and lacks nutrients and sunlight, and that 
they are constantly on antibiotics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wild, even violent conflict rarely leads to serious 
injury, because the male who is losing can always admit defeat 
and flee.  The females are the ones most dominant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In captivity, the largest male dominates all the rest.  During 
breeding season, the fights between males are extremely violent. 
To avoid fights between the males, some aquariums keep only one 
male per pool.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In captivity, the make-up of these groups is seriously disrupted. 
When they are in their natural habitat, several generations of 
females live with their offspring in a specific territory, while 
males are gathered on the outskirts, based on complex alliances. 
During their adult life, they only make brief visits to their 
parents. Families are usually made up of two males and one 
female. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When in captivity, this ratio is reversed and females outnumber 
males, thus triggering abnormal conflicts between females that 
are pregnant or about to give birth. Sometimes, jealous females 
will even kill babies. A kind of forced polygamy is organized, 
but it does not reflect the natural model at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they live freely, males do not usually socialize for very 
long with the female social group. Therefore, living in 
captivity deeply affects this type of organization. Adult males 
are forced to interact closely, both night and day, with 
females. This forced interaction exacerbates male dominance. 
Based on what has been observed in basins, it is clear that this 
dominance by a single male is the source of many behavioural 
problems, particularly among the group's young marine mammals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they live freely, female dolphins usually have a baby every 
two or three years. The young dolphin receives a real education 
to ensure its future survival and allow it to fully develop as a 
member of the group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty per cent of dolphins living in captivity die before the 
age of one. Of that number, 23% die during the first month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, there are no cetaceans in captivity. Because of our 
geographical location, the industry prefers to promote 
observation of cetaceans in their natural environment. Such a 
practice, provided it is conducted at a minimal distance, has 
much less of an impact on cetaceans then keeping them captive in 
basins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourists come from all over the world to have an opportunity to 
watch whales and belugas from the Saguenay. Observing cetaceans 
like this tells us a lot more about their lifestyle and habits 
than watching them for a few minutes while they are in captivity 
or performing tricks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stop here and reiterate my support. The Bloc Quebecois 
supports Motion No. 75. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to address Motion No. 75 put 
forward by the member for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion would see stronger protection put in place for 
cetaceans, especially a moratorium on the live capture and trade 
of whales, dolphins and porpoises.  The member for Malpeque said 
that a moratorium on the live capture of cetaceans, whales, 
dolphins and porpoises has been in place since 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in hearing the member's response to my 
questions, but unfortunately we do not get the opportunity for 
questions and answers.  I am sure the member for Vancouver East 
was dying to ask some questions.  There needs to be a broader 
debate on the entire issue.  Through that type of debate we can 
get down to the fact of whether we should or should not be 
supporting the live capture of whales, dolphins and porpoises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two sides to the issue.  First, the live capture of 
whales for display in aquariums allows scientists and researchers 
to discover significant amounts of information about the 
lifestyle, reproduction and communication of these mammals and 
preserves what can be an endangered species for future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, whales are very intelligent animals.  When caged in 
aquariums it is believed they can lead bored, lonely and 
stressful lives.  The last orca whale in the Vancouver Aquarium 
is being sent to San Diego SeaWorld so that it can interact with 
other whales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public opinion has played a significant role in Canada's 
attitude toward the live capture of whales.  After much public 
outcry, the Vancouver Aquarium decided that it would not capture 
or bring any whales captured after September 1996 into the 
aquarium. However the aquarium can still exchange whales with other 
facilities.  Currently there are 30 whales in aquariums within 
North America and 21 outside the continent.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time information about cetaceans may improve by 
studying these mammals in captivity.  As a result of studying 
whales in a controlled environment researchers realized that the 
gestation period for whales was longer than previously thought. 
This information resulted in the International Whaling Commission 
reducing Norway's whale quota to reflect this longer timeframe. 
The long term survival of the species may be facilitated by 
research that is conducted in a controlled environment and that 
would be difficult to conduct on a species in the wild. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Orcas off Canada's west coast are low in numbers and have 
recently been declining.  The orca herd on the east coast, from 
Iceland through to Newfoundland and off the coast of Greenland, 
seems to be in much better condition than the ones on the west 
coast.  Environmentalists and biologists are not sure of the 
cause of the decline, but one factor may be the high level of 
contamination in the food chain.  Orcas consume vast quantities 
of food and are at the higher end of the food chain, causing high 
levels of PCBs to build up from the number of seal and salmon 
consumed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that would be a factor in their decline is a lack 
of sufficient food.  Salmon numbers are also declining and this 
may be preventing orcas from finding enough food to meet their 
daily intake requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case numbers are declining.  We need to question once 
again whether it is important to support the live capture of 
whales so that more scientific research can be conducted into 
this decline, or whether we are simply appeasing our desire to 
have the opportunity to see these creatures in accessible 
settings and increase tourist numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little question that whales in particular attract human 
attention.  The rising number of whale watching operations and 
the increased number of visitors to aquariums when whales, 
dolphins and porpoises are part of the exhibit attest to their 
popularity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While orca numbers are declining other whale populations are 
increasing.  The grey whale count is estimated at 26,000 off the 
coast of British Columbia.  It is suggested that overpopulation 
is the reason there are increasing numbers of grey whales washing 
up along the coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the east coast there has been good news lately regarding 
whale populations, particularly the northern right whale which is 
considered the rarest of the large whales.  Researchers with east 
coast ecosystems in Nova Scotia recently announced that the 
number of newborn whales reached 25, the largest count since 1980 
when births were first recorded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is widely believed by a number of scientists on the east 
coast that there is a rogue pod of right whales that are deep 
ocean whales. We do not see them in the inner Bay of Fundy and 
other areas, but they are actually interbreeding with the right 
whales that are there now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whale is certainly not anything close to emulating the 
escalating population that is occurring for grey whales, but the 
small number of existing northern right whales is encouraging, 
particularly after disappointing birth rates over the past couple 
of years.  These numbers are especially encouraging when we 
consider that the entire population of right whales along the 
eastern seaboard is optimistically estimated at around 350, a 
very low number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are significant hurdles that young whales have to overcome 
if they are to reach maturity.  Many die within the first six 
months possibly from chemical contamination, while others become 
entangled in fishing gear or are struck by ships.  A biologist 
with the University of Oregon has been quoted as saying that 
about one-third of all animals found dead are from ship 
collisions.  Over two-thirds of the population is scarred from 
entanglements in fishing gear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That makes this especially troubling since recent cutbacks by 
the current federal government have forced the coast guard to 
terminate its effort in freeing whales trapped by fishing gear. 
With two-thirds of right whales scarred from having been caught 
in fishing gear this is not a service that should be eliminated, 
not if the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is serious about 
whale conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Efforts need to be made to try to reduce the number of whales 
caught in fishing gear.  By eliminating this service by DFO, the 
government is once again signalling that its commitment to whale 
conservation is in words only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Collisions with ships are one of the major hazards facing right 
whales, with 16 of the known 45 right whale deaths since 1970 
resulting from such collisions.  Half the remaining whales 
congregate in the Bay of Fundy between Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick from June to December.  This makes whale watching a 
profitable enterprise in the area, but unfortunately the shipping 
traffic and fishing vessels in the area make it dangerous waters 
for the right whale.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>East Coast Ecosystems Research has worked hard to promote whale 
conservation and has set up a whale sighting protocol.  This 
program monitors right whale sightings and provides information 
to boats in the Bay of Fundy and along the Scotian shelf of Nova 
Scotia so that vessel operators are aware of whales in the area. 
Marine Communications and Traffic Services officers advise 
vessels traversing these waters that they are passing through an 
area where whales may be found.  They provide co-ordinates of 
sightings and possible actions to divert a collision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we need a moratorium on the live capture of cetaceans 
but I am not entirely sure that we do.  There are a number of 
things that we can do to help not only whales and dolphins but 
other marine species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's responsibility to bring forth such 
legislation and to debate these issues in the House.  We need to 
ensure that all sides of the issue are represented so that we can 
make decisions to the benefit of all Canadians and to the benefit 
of the mammals we are discussing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
recognizes the need to help protect right whales, but its actions 
do not support its stated commitment to whale protection.  It is 
time for the department to re-evaluate its plans in relation to 
right whale protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we have taken steps toward conserving whale population 
there is still a long way to go.  Scientists and biologists, not 
parliamentarians, need to debate whether the live capture of 
whales helps to increase public perception and knowledge of the 
plight of whales and other cetaceans, or whether there is more 
harm than good by keeping such mammals in aquariums so that they 
can be studied and examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one good example of scientific knowledge in the live 
capture of animals.  It is taking place on Sable Island off the 
coast of Nova Scotia.  I first went to Sable Island in 1980. 
That year we counted 60 or 70 dead horses on Sable Island because 
the government did not allow the live capture horses to be 
brought ashore when populations reached too high a point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was nothing wrong with those horses.  They could have been 
brought ashore and homes could have been found for them.  That 
did not occur because they were protected and the government did 
not allow their live capture.  Sometimes there is a reason for 
live capture of animals. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this 
issue.  I compliment the hon. member from the NDP for bringing 
the motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to raise an extremely important issue. This is the 
proverbial canary in a mine shaft and it has to do with whales. 
Beluga whales are dying in the St. Lawrence Seaway. The amount of 
carcinogens and teratogens in their flesh is actually 
extraordinary.  It is a direct result of the pollution that is 
taking place there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to present some of findings.  Autopsies were done 
on 179 belugas over a 15 year period.  The beluga whale 
population in the St. Lawrence has not improved at all and 
scientists are asking why.  Scientists found extraordinarily high 
rates of malignant tumours, perforated ulcers in their bellies 
and diseases that compromise their immune system.  They also 
found a whole range of illnesses never before seen in whale 
populations.  The member from the NDP described the problems that 
these intelligent creatures have in captivity.  They are no less 
threatened out in the wild sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to look into these mammals because they 
are a harbinger of the toxins and pesticides that are in the St. 
Lawrence Seaway right now.  The same content of DDTs, mirex and 
other cancer causing agents that we are exposed to are found in 
these mammals.  In fact, the blubber in belugas would be 
considered to be toxic waste if it were lying on the ground 
because the levels are that high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also draw attention to the fact that the numbers in whale 
species that exist right now are not increasing.  We have heard 
about the northern right whale in our waters but we have not 
heard about the blue whale, the largest creature ever to live on 
this planet. 
There are only 3,000 of these whales left.  Many of them 
congregate in the Gulf of St. Lawrence every year along with 
other protected species such as the northern right whale.

slaughtering whales under the guise of scientific research.  They 
simply cannot get around the moratorium that was put on whaling 
in 1971. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country has an enormous opportunity to bring the issue to 
the forefront.  I strongly urge the government to work with our 
partners to stop international whaling and to look into the 
deaths of beluga whales.  They are the canary in the mine shaft. 
They have high rates of cancer causing agents.  It is what we are 
exposed to as human beings.  I urge the government to look at it 
and clean the area up for everyone's sake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  While the Chair takes note that other 
members indicated their desire to speak, we have only four 
minutes left under right of reply to the member for Vancouver 
East. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank members who participated in the debate today.  I especially 
thank my friend from the Bloc Quebecois who spoke in support of 
the motion.  I certainly appreciate the support of that party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the support of other parties as well.  In listening 
carefully to the debate it seems that all members who spoke from 
the Liberal, the Alliance and the Conservative Party outlined the 
fact that they had concerns with Canada's lack of policy for the 
protection of whales and dolphins in captivity.  I certainly 
agree that there are huge issues regarding the ecosystem and the 
environment in the wild and that they are being undermined and 
violated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today deals with trade and captivity.  I will set the 
record straight.  The hon. member from the government side seemed 
to suggest that somehow we already had a moratorium in place and 
that what Canada was doing today was adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say very strongly that is not case.  What we are doing 
today is clearly inadequate.  The 1992 moratorium of which the 
member spoke was for belugas only.  It was not for all whales and 
dolphins. When Marineland's request to capture belugas from 
Churchill was denied, what did it do?  It went offshore.  It went 
to Russia.  That is where it found belugas and whales for capture 
and import into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It begs the question.  Clearly our existing practice is not 
adequate.  It does not even come close to dealing with the 
concerns expressed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also very surprised to hear the government suggest that 
somehow the issue of captivity and maintenance is a provincial 
responsibility.  It seems the government is very strong on its 
intent in terms of trade areas.  Clearly this is a trade issue in 
terms of the import, export and trade of whales and dolphins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very interested to hear the comments of members of the 
Canadian Alliance about how whale watching was something many 
people enjoyed. They argued that because we did not all have the 
opportunity to whale watch we needed captivity and aquariums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important ethical issue.  Do we have the right to 
take animals out of their natural environment, place them in 
small tanks in captivity, separate them from their natural family 
group and somehow say that it is natural and educational?  I 
would argue that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to adopt the recommendations in Dr. Lien's 
report.  He outlines that we need a moratorium to further analyze 
and debate the issues raised today in the House regarding ethics, 
education, and the long term impact of captivity and the ongoing 
trade.  I urge the government to follow that report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I thank the organizations that helped bring the 
motion forward.  It continues to do outstanding work in putting 
pressure on the government to accept its responsibility, to make 
sure we have humane policies and rules, and to see that we get a 
moratorium on the capture and trade of whales and dolphins.  I 
seek unanimous consent of the House to make the motion a votable 
motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 29 consideration of Bill C-2, an act

Insurance (Fishing) Regulations, as reported (with amendment)

debating Bill C-2, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act, 
at report stage. Some of the proposed amendment are good, of 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a major item we strongly dislike and that is the 
fact that the government wants to get its hands on the 
employment insurance fund surplus. The government clearly did 
not take this opportunity to make much more substantial changes 
to the situation related to the whole employment insurance fund, 
and to adopt measures that could have benefited many people who 
have been penalized for several years, in fact since 1993 when 
the Liberals came to power, because of the way they restructured 
the employment insurance system in order to shamelessly grab the 
surpluses year after year.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unfortunate that after having created very high 
expectations, after having made campaign commitments and after 
having the Prime Minister admit he had probably made some 
mistakes, the government is now coming up with the same 
legislation it had introduced before the election. In many 
regions, in Quebec as well as in other provinces, this has 
provoked much discontent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to draw a small picture of the coverage rate 
of the employment insurance system. 
In 1993, 65% of those losing their jobs were covered by the 
system. The cutting trend had started in the early 1990s, as in 
1990, 83% of workers losing their jobs were still covered. In 
1993 it was down to 65%. I am not blaming the present 
government, as a major restructuring was started by its 
predecessor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last six years, this percentage has fallen to 43%. 
This is unbelievable. Cuts were more drastic than when there was 
an economic crisis, with a dreadful deficit. When the economic 
situation improved, the government started to generate a surplus 
but reduced the level of coverage. This means that now only four 
out of ten Canadians who lose their jobs are eligible for 
benefits. 
I am not even talking about the level of benefits, but only 
about the number of unemployed eligible for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those most affected by this are women and young people. For 
those between 20 and 24 years of age, one out of four persons 
who lose their jobs will be covered by the EI system. As for 
women, the percentage is approximately 38%. So this is below 
average. They are the ones who have been most affected by the 
successive EI reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said many times by many people, but does not appear 
to move the government.  Once again, what it wants is to shove 
some amendments through, rapidly and expeditiously, to send a 
message to the public, saying “Look, see the changes we have 
made”.  A word of warning to all those with high expectations: 
better lower them, for in another year or year and a half they 
will see that the reform did not amount to much after all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people may still believe that the government contributes to 
employment insurance.  The fund has no government contribution. 
The only contributors are the employees and employers; the 
government does not contribute one red cent.  It is the one that 
makes the decisions, the one that directs it, and now it is 
going to give itself more powers than ever, by limiting the 
commission's ability to set contribution rates, to define the 
size of the surplus to be generated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without having to contribute one cent, it is going to direct and 
define and also to pocket the surplus funds.  This means, 
clearly, that every year—I am referring here just to the amount 
of the surplus in the fund—the government is going to get 
$6 billion from it to add to the general public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who pay their contributions into the fund, the 
workers and the employers, are funding all manner of things 
other than an employment insurance plan.  I repeat, this is 
supposed to be an insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, imagine if you or other members of this House were 
paying house or car insurance premiums and the company announced 
to you “Well, we collected the premiums for that but we have 
decided to apply them to something else.  Instead of 
compensating people making claims, we are going to invest the 
money right and left, spend it on other things”.  That would 
make no sense. 
An insurance plan should serve those who pay into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what is happening with the $6 billion; the government 
may well say that it is putting it into health and other noble 
causes, but let them have the courage to call it a payroll tax 
or an employment tax.  That is what employment insurance has 
turned into.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the figures.  For the year 2000, the 
contributions, and therefore the revenues, collected by the 
government from the employment insurance fund reached 
$17.2 billion. The plan itself cost $12.3 billion; therefore, 
there was a surplus of $5.6 billion for the year. This means that 
$5,600 million was taken from the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the situation be today if the fund had really been 
independent, with a separate bank account?  There would now be 
$31.4 billion in that bank account.  This shows the extent of the 
surplus accumulated, mainly over the last six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true the plan experienced deficits at times, for example 
in the early 1990s, during the recession, but the surpluses have 
largely covered those past deficits and have grown to an 
accumulated surplus of $31.4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no point going looking for that money, it will not be 
found.  It was added to the consolidated fund and spent on all 
sorts of programs.  Good or bad, those were not what that money 
was meant for.  Such a practice is totally unacceptable and 
inadmissible.   To collect taxes and use them for something else 
but their intended purpose is a bad management principle, which 
borders on immorality, if not outright illegality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation will not improve because, with the measures being 
proposed now, next year's surplus will be similar.  Some might 
say that we were keeping a reserve in case of another recession. 
Let us not kid ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were a recession tomorrow, the fund would be pretty 
much balanced.  It is structured in such a way that it will not 
take a beating, because eligibility has been restricted, the 
number of hours needed to qualify increased and the duration of 
benefits decreased.  The spending that is going to skyrocket if 
there is a recession is the spending on social assistance, which 
is funded by the provinces.  This spending will go up 
dramatically and there will be no safety net, while the EI fund 
will pretty much balance or show a slight deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the government could keep a cushion, a reserve, but not on 
the order of $30 billion.  Thirty billion dollars could cover 
benefits for the next three years without a single additional 
cent in premiums being received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were a separate account, everyone could be told “For 
the next three years they would not have to pay premiums because 
they would be drawn 
from the accumulated reserve”.  Does this not give an 
idea of the size of the obscene surplus which has built up but 
disappeared because was been misappropriated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there are a number of things we could do. 
The Bloc Quebecois has proposed a series of amendments and we 
would like to see the bill improved.  For instance, the 
government could have abolished the waiting period, created a 
separate fund, increased the coverage rate from 55% to 60%, 
reduced to 300 the number of hours required to qualify for 
special benefits and increased the duration of benefits and indexed 
the annual ceiling.  All sorts of measures could have been 
passed.  I have a series of proposals which we have discussed in 
committee and have been discussing for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of this is irresponsible because it can all be done 
without any threat to the fund.  Even if all these suggestions 
and others were implemented, the fund would still have a surplus 
and a slight cushion for contingencies.  The government is 
turning a deaf ear.  The Minister of Finance prefers to rake in 
a surplus and do all sorts of things with it. 
That is why we will be voting against the bill at report stage 
and at third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when all is said and done, Bill C-2 should be viewed 
with some pride and a great deal of satisfaction by all parties 
in the House.  The bill is evidence of an effective governance 
and effective law-making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the government set out to put in place a much improved 
plan to assist Canada's unemployed, to help get them back to work 
and keep them working.  That plan had goals that are as vital 
today just as they were then: a fairer system that treats all 
workers more equitably; a system that encourages work and reduces 
dependence on benefits; a system that provides assistance to 
those most in need, namely people from low income families with 
children during periods of unemployment; and a system designed to 
help people get back to work and help keep them at work.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very important part of that system included a provision to 
continuously monitor and assess the system to see if it was in 
fact living up to its design goals.  As a result, the EI system 
has been adjusted to ensure it continues to serve the purposes 
for which it was introduced.  Bill C-2 is another step in this 
evolutionary process and warrants the support of all members of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how effective programs are designed and implemented.  No 
regime should be fixed in amber, unresponsive to changing 
economic and social conditions.  I sense that, in general, 
members opposite also welcome the changes proposed in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it seems that much of the discussion on Bill C-2 has 
focused on the rate setting process for EI premiums.  The 
government has been charged by members across that premiums are 
too high and benefits are inadequate.  Surely we must acknowledge 
that rates have been consistently reduced in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employee premium rate for 2001 has already been set at 
$2.25, down from $2.40 in 2000.  This is the seventh straight 
year premiums have been reduced.  At $2.25, employers and 
employees will save approximately $6.4 billion in 2001 compared 
to where the premiums were at when we took over as the government 
in 1994, which was $3.07.  That is a total reduction in premiums 
of 82 cents.  If that is taken as a percentage of the present 
rate of $2.25, that is a 32% reduction in rates.  That is a very 
fundamental reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument that a surplus in the EI account is evidence and 
that the premium rates are too high does not hold water.  The EI 
account must be allowed to accumulate a surplus during periods of 
improving economic conditions to ensure that premiums do not have 
to be raised if the economy is in a downturn which would 
inevitably be accompanied by higher unemployment and higher 
demands on the EI account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we do not want to raise premium rates in an already 
depressed economy which would put a further damper on economic 
growth and job creation.  We should bear in mind that during the 
last recession a $2 billion surplus in the EI account at the end 
of 1990 became a $6 billion deficit by the end of 1993, in spite 
of the rise in premiums.  As to the adequacy of benefits, that is 
precisely what Bill C-2 would propose to improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intensity rule would be removed.  The so-called clawback 
provision would be adjusted to ensure that first time users and 
those on special benefits would be exempt from paying back the 
benefits.  The re-entrant rules would be adjusted so that 
re-entrant parents would qualify for EI regular benefits with the 
same number of hours as other claimants when they returned to the 
labour force following an extended absence to care for young 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has also criticized the provisions in Bill C-2 
concerning rate setting, claiming that the process should be 
placed at arm's length from the government.  However these 
criticisms are clearly beside the point.  Even the auditor 
general questioned whether an arm's length treatment would 
improve the process.  Arm's length or not, the question is what 
is the rate setting method that would best serve Canadian 
workers, employers and taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Finance recommended the EI premium 
rate setting procedure be reviewed.  The government is addressing 
this question and prior to Bill C-2 made a commitment to review 
the rate setting process over a two year period.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general stated that the review could result in a 
better methodology and that he welcome anything that would 
clarify the rate setting procedure.  However, until such a review 
can be completed, the government has provided a means to ensure 
predictability and stability in the EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governor in council will set the premium rates for the year 
2002-03 allowing time for review and allowing the government to 
adjust the changing economic conditions.  Researching and 
deciding on a sound rate setting mechanism will require taking 
into consideration interests of workers, employers and taxpayers. 
This is not something we could hope to achieve through Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance, along with Human Resources 
Development Canada, will carry out a review during which all 
stakeholders will be consulted, including the EI commissioners 
representing workers and employers.  Surely that is a better 
method.  I would say that it is the only rational method for 
devising a rate setting structure that best meets the interests 
of all parties in the longer term.  I believe that the hon. 
members should reserve their views and feelings on the rate 
setting method and permit the review to take its rational course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The passage of Bill C-2 will present no obstacle to the 
successful completion of that review.  That is why the House 
should give speedy passage to the bill and permit Canadians to 
begin benefiting from its improvements to the EI program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, may I 
say that you look very comfortable and proper in that chair. You 
are doing a good job in recognizing those of us in the opposition 
parties who would like to add to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my remarks by registering a grievance of sorts.  In 
the short period of time that I have been a member of parliament 
more often than not when I get up to speak it is during a time 
allocation situation.  I am not saying that all bills which go 
through the House of Commons end up with some form of closure or 
time allocation but, by some bizarre freak of nature, every time 
I want to speak it is under the circumstances that there has been 
time allocation imposed.  Frankly, it is starting to jade my 
world view of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to register as a grievance to the federal government that 
my experience in the House is being warped by its abuse of the 
system and by its stamping all over the democratic process by 
once again implementing time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking, with what time I have, to Bill C-2, let me point out 
that I and the NDP caucus believe that Bill C-2 is fundamentally 
flawed, not because of what is in the bill, because there are 
elements we support within the bill, but because of what the bill 
fails to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 fails to recognize the real problem with the EI system, 
which is that nobody qualifies any more.  It is not an employment 
insurance program if unemployed people do not get any insurance 
benefits out of it.  The very name has become a misnomer.  Those 
who need the benefits that the EI system is supposed to provide 
do not get them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are starting from a very dangerous premise here.  We have 
this revenue generating cash cow for the federal government that 
is failing to meet the needs of unemployed workers.  We then have 
the government ramming this through before substantial changes 
can be made to address the real flaws and errors within the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really bothers me is that even the amendments do not find 
their origins in any real desire on the part of the federal 
government to meet the needs of unemployed workers.  Most of what 
we see in Bill C-2 and in any EI reform in the past 10 years 
seems to find its origins in this underlying position that there 
are lazy people who would rather sit on EI than take part in the 
workforce.  The government has decided therefore to use some kind 
of a tough love policy against these people to kickstart them 
into the workforce no matter what their circumstances. 
The whole thing finds its origins in the attitude that people 
would rather be unemployed and on EI than taking part in the 
workforce.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the hysteria and fear in the mid-seventies, when UIC 
was available, about the UIC ski team of teenagers in Banff 
cheating UIC.  During that period of time the government made a 
nationwide survey on the issue of UIC fraud and abuse.  It found 
that there were actually more federal government Tory cabinet 
ministers guilty of fraud on a ratio and proportion basis than 
there were UIC recipients guilty of fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year approximately 200 EI recipients are called to task 
for some kind of abuse of the system.  During the Mulroney years 
approximately 30% of federal Tory cabinet ministers were guilty 
of fraud compared to an infinitesimal, an amount almost too small 
to count, of EI recipients who were called to task on fraud.  The 
attitude that there is widespread abuse of the system bothers me 
when I know, because I deal with people who use the EI system 
frequently, that simply is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began my speech today by saying that Bill C-2 is flawed 
because of what it fails to do.  It fails to deal with the 
eligibility issue.  The fact that less than 40% of unemployed 
people qualify for unemployment insurance should strike people as 
somehow being wrong?  It actually gets worse when we deal with 
unemployed women.  There is a real gender issue here.  Less than 
25% of unemployed women qualify for any benefit whatsoever.  Less 
than 15% of unemployed youth under the age of 25 qualify for any 
benefit whatsoever.  How can we even call this an insurance 
system when virtually nobody qualifies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eligibility is the first issue.  The rules should state that 
when we are unemployed and need income maintenance, the benefits 
will be there.  When we are forced to pay premiums it is only 
fair that we have a reasonable expectation of collecting the 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second fundamental flaw is the way the government arrives at 
what our benefits will be.  Even if we are lucky enough to be one 
of those 40% of unemployed Canadians who qualify for benefits, 
the way that the government calculates the benefit is so wrong 
that we end up collecting far less per week than we used to under 
the old rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get any benefits whatsoever is a Herculean task.  Once we do 
qualify for benefits, the way that the government calculates our 
benefits we end up getting far less money.  There are fewer 
people collecting and those who are collecting, collect less 
money.  It is no wonder there is a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surplus is the third thing I would like to address.  I have 
said this in the House before and I need to keep saying it over 
and over again until it sinks in with the Canadian people just 
how badly the program is being abused and milked by the Liberal 
government and being used as some kind of cash cow.  The surplus 
is $750 million per month.  There is more money going into the program 
than is being paid out in benefits.  That is $7 billion to $8 
billion per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we find ourselves in a budgetary surplus situation. Let us 
look at the sources of the revenue that the government now calls 
its surplus: $35 billion to $43 billion surplus accumulated out 
of the EI system alone; $35 billion cut out of programs through 
the health and social transfer; and a further $30 billion surplus 
that everybody seems to have forgotten about, the public service 
pension plan by legislation, by act of parliament, was taken away 
from those workers last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no coincidence that when we add those three up, $35 
billion, $35 billion and $30 billion, all on the backs of the 
unemployed, working people and those who need social programs, it 
adds up to $100 billion, which is exactly what the Minister of 
Finance gave in tax cuts to the wealthy and to corporations.  I 
do not think it is any coincidence that those figures are 
identical. I just wanted to point that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last few minutes that I have, I want to point out another 
shortcoming in Bill C-2 that is very close to my own personal 
experience.  The apprenticeship system has suffered terribly 
under the changes to EI and, in Bill C-2, the government has 
chosen not to correct it. 
This is something for which there is almost unanimous support. 
Virtually every industry, academic and economist we have spoken 
to has agreed that this is wrong, yet it has not been addressed 
in Bill C-2.  The two week waiting period that unemployed workers 
must wait before getting their first benefits is applied to 
apprentices when they are going through the trade school 
component of the apprenticeship.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, they are being treated as if they are unemployed 
when they are not.  They are apprentices.  They are employed and 
have an attachment to the workforce.  They are simply going 
through the annually scheduled eight week training period in 
community college and yet are being penalized with the two week 
waiting period at the front end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a new change that was made in 1995-96.  It has had the 
effect of driving people away from apprenticeship programs.  A 
lot of young people simply cannot afford to be without income for 
that period of time and are choosing not to attend the eight week 
scheduled apprenticeship training in community college. 
Gradually a four year apprenticeship turns into a seven year 
apprenticeship and many simply are dropping out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is having a dilatory effect on the apprenticeship system and 
on industry because of what I believe is a miserly point of view 
on behalf of the Liberal government, using the EI system as a 
revenue generating cash cow instead of providing income 
maintenance to unemployed workers, and in this case, providing 
trade school apprenticeship training to people in the skilled 
trades.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with all due respect, I know I must address the Chair, 
but I also want to address unemployed Canadians, particularly 
those from Quebec who are listening and especially the 60% of 
them who could not benefit from the EI plan. They were excluded 
for many reasons. That is why many amendments to the bill were 
requested by the opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government amends an act as important as the Employment 
Insurance Act, there are always questions to be asked. 
First, why is it amending it? Because there are pressing 
demands, which often come from the opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that in 1996 the Liberal government made major 
changes to the Employment Insurance Act, which included the 
infamous intensity rule. With that rule, seasonal workers were 
virtually excluded from the plan, to the point where today only 
42% of workers who could use benefits are eligible for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a change made in 1996 by the Liberal government. It 
directly contributed to the increase in the EI fund surplus. 
Since the 1996 changes, a surplus of $5 billion was added to the 
fund each and every year. 
At the present time, this surplus is close to $32 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once more, in 2001, the Liberal government is proposing a 
legislative amendment. We should always ask ourselves why the 
government would change this legislation. The answer should be 
that it is for the good of the unemployed in Canada, and 
particularly in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, of course, that the intensity rule, the purpose of 
which was to make sure that almost no seasonal unemployed worker 
could get employment benefits, will be abolished. In ridings such 
as Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, where 65% of the economy is based 
on agriculture, forestry and tourism, more workers will be made 
eligible for employment benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be said that this is something the opposition parties 
have been requesting since 1996. The opposition parties 
have been asking the government for this for five years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is not the workers of Quebec and Canada who are 
seasonal, it the jobs that are seasonal. It is not the workers' 
fault they do not have access to an EI plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be understood that I am talking about an EI 
plan. On many occasions I have heard members of the government 
describe the employment insurance plan as a social safety net. 
The employment insurance plan has never been a social safety 
net. It is an insurance paid for entirely, half and half, by the 
workers and their employers. 
Since this plan belongs to the employers and the employees in 
Quebec and Canada, the $31.4 billion surplus belongs to them 
also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have expected that the amendments to Bill C-2 would 
include, on top of the elimination of the intensity rule for 
seasonal workers we wanted, important changes to the plan 
because it belongs to the employers and the employees in Quebec 
and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat, for the sake of workers and especially the 
unemployed in Quebec and in Canada who are watching this debate, 
that the bill does not improve the plan and does nothing to 
correct the decades old inequities under the Employment 
Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have a waiting period, the infamous two week penalty 
for workers. 
They do not get any benefits for these two weeks. They just have 
to wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this most unfortunate because it does a lot of damage, 
in view of the fact that an increasing number of businesses in 
Quebec, among others, are hit with damage or fires, as a result 
of which there are temporary closures for many reasons other 
than the going out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, workers who find themselves without a job overnight 
because of a fire or other disaster are subject to the 
qualifying period, the famous two week penalty. They lose the 
first two weeks and do not receive any compensation in spite of 
the fact that they bought insurance that they have been paying 
50:50 with their employer, an insurance policy called the EI 
fund. There is still a waiting period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the terminology the Liberal government found to try to 
convince them to accept this two week penalty. Notwithstanding 
the fact that they have an insurance, they still have a two week 
penalty. These two weeks inevitably contribute to increase the 
fund. This surplus, this revenue from the EI fund, now totals 
more than $31 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the bill tabled did not contain any of the 
amendments put forward by the Bloc Quebecois. This particular 
amendment was rejected. We still find in the bill the two week 
waiting period, the penalty the workers are facing for losing 
their job. Even if the business does not shut down, even after a 
disaster, they are still subjected to this two week loss, which 
is used, among other things, to increase the EI surplus. So, 
there are no major changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the $31.4 billion surplus. Why has the 
government introduced this bill? As members may have guessed, it 
is because the Liberal Party, the government, covets the $31.4 
billion that belongs to workers of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 9 of the bill would allow the government to get its hands 
on the surplus of the employment insurance fund. The government 
wants to do that for its own ends, that is to spend the money in 
any other program it deems appropriate but which will not 
necessarily serve the interests of workers in Quebec and Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the bill not provide for an independent fund, which 
would belong, since half of it is paid for by workers in Quebec, 
to workers as well as employers and which would be administered 
by workers and employers, who could then choose the appropriate 
way to use the fund? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I only have a minute left, I will use my time to try to 
promote awareness among members on the other side, who too often 
take the employment insurance fund, which actually is an 
insurance fund, for a social security fund. This is where the 
problem lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to turn employment insurance into a social security 
fund, which the government wants to get its hands on and use in 
a totally different area, which government members call social 
security, while in fact employment insurance is an insurance 
fund that belongs to workers and should only be used for them. 
We should have an independent fund administered by workers, in 
their own interests.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, needless to 
say, I am very pleased to resume today on Bill C-2, an act to 
amend the Employment Insurance Act and Regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to congratulate the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, whose great 
determination resulted in the passage of a motion on the 
employment insurance bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my last speech on February 13, the bill is a 
disgrace.  This debate began in January 1997 as part of EI 
reform.  The reform was supposed to meet the needs of the public 
and the realities of the workplace.  The opposite effect was 
felt and observed, and this could have been predicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this reform, the unemployment insurance plan, which 
actually needed to be reviewed but not transformed nor 
diminished, has in fact become a plan whereby the government gets 
richer but the poor get poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the 
Status of Persons with Disabilities has concluded its hearings. 
The proposed amendments were almost all rejected, with one 
exception, because it was not directly related to Bill C-2. 
This is why the Bloc Quebecois felt it better not to move any 
amendments at committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as I said earlier, a motion moved by the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques was passed, which 
will commit the government to consider other amendments to the 
Employment Insurance Act as a whole. The motion reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and 
the Status of Persons with Disabilities report to the House of 
Commons all other amendments to the Employment Insurance Act and 
that this report be tabled to the House no later than June 1, 
2001. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the passage of this motion, the Bloc Quebecois, as the 
party responsible, intends to put all its long sought amendments 
back on the table in June 2001 when the committee tables its 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After long refusing to abolish the intensity rule, the 
government has conceded that we were right.  I hope that it will 
take the time to reflect on the other amendments which the Bloc 
Quebecois will be submitting with the report and admit that we 
are right about them as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to deleting clause 9, on the setting of the premium 
rates, we are going to propose the following amendments: 
eliminating the qualifying period; establishing an independent 
employment insurance fund; increasing coverage from 55% to 60%—we 
have long been asking that benefits be increased to 60% of a 
person's income, as was the case before the reform—; extending 
the base period from 26 weeks to 52 weeks; allowing self-employed 
workers to be insured through voluntary contributions; bringing 
back to 300 hours the eligibility criterion for special 
benefits; increasing the period of benefits; setting income 
increases at 25% for all claimants before employment benefits 
are cut; indexing the insurable annual income at $41,500; 
changing the process under which the premium rate is set, so as 
to give all the powers to the commission; setting the threshold 
for the refund of premiums at $5,000, instead of $2,000; 
increasing from three to five years eligibility for active 
employment measures; eliminating the arm's length relationship 
clause—this applies primarily to seasonal workers—eliminating 
the divisor rule; providing special benefits for older workers; 
investing 0.8% of the total payroll in active employment 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, our position on Bill C-2 at report stage is 
that we are opposed to it if clause 9 is not deleted. The 
federal government must listen to the message that was sent to 
it time and again by the Auditor General of Canada, the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business, the Conseil du patronat du 
Québec and the central labour bodies, and it must delete this 
clause, which takes from the commission the right to set the 
premium rate under the employment insurance plan and gives it to 
the federal government. Removing the commission from the rate 
setting process means that these rates could be adjusted on the 
basis of the government's needs and deficit, instead of being 
based on the needs of the unemployed, and on the premiums 
received, as recommended by the chief actuary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If clause 9 is passed, it will legalize the theft of the 
employment insurance fund by the government, which will have 
full ownership of it. 
The auditor general has criticized the government for its lack 
of transparency when it comes to rate setting, saying that 
despite the shortcomings and the lack of clarity of section 66 
to some extent, in his opinion, it is nevertheless clearer than 
the system we would have under the new clause 9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who gave evidence during the committee hearings were 
unanimous: clause 9 of Bill C-2 must be rejected. The Canadian 
public is expecting more than mere campaign promises. It is 
looking for important and concrete corrective measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not interested in the plight of the 
unemployed, who will be negatively affected by this employment 
insurance reform. 
The measures proposed in this bill are not enough to correct the 
problems caused by the system, notably to seasonal workers, and 
particularly those in the regions, to young people, to women and 
to workers, particularly older workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to remind this House that during the 
last six years, employment insurance has been the most important 
factor of poverty in Canada. If the government wants to protect 
children against poverty, it will first have to protect parents 
who are poor. If the government had not made such drastic cuts 
to employment insurance, there would be fewer children starving.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
connection with Bill C-2, the bill to amend the Employment 
Insurance Act, we know that coalitions of the unemployed in 
Abitibi, Témiscamingue, Val-d'Or and all over Quebec have raised 
the awareness of the political parties, both the Bloc Quebecois 
and the opposition.  Thanks to these groups, the government has 
backed down, and that is what is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard what my colleagues have been saying about 
eliminating the rule of intensity and certain other changes 
relating to the reimbursement of benefits and parental return to 
the work force.  Several Bloc Quebecois members have said that 
the government had a fund of $35 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we need to look at what the Department of Human 
Resources Development is doing with that money.  I have a 
listing here of some of the programs we need to take into 
consideration, including the millions that go to the province of 
Quebec in transfer payments each year.  This department has been 
administering our programs for some years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we need to look at what is being done in the 
communities, whether in the resource regions or in the major 
centres.  There are partnerships in social development, 
community action partnerships, a fund to support the official 
language minority communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Quebec is currently doing with the money from the fund 
also needs to be considered.  It is providing targeted wage 
subsidies, help to self-employed workers, contributing to skills 
development, providing assistance to employment, research and 
innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also look at programs that are provided to assist 
persons with disabilities, the fund for integrating persons with 
disabilities. Programs such as youth international, youth 
service Canada and student summer job action are also provided 
to help young people and young trainees in Canada. Thus, several 
billions of dollars from the fund are invested in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also federal transfers. We know that several 
federal transfers were established recently. 
I heard Mrs. Marois speech last Thursday. 
Mr. Landry said there was a $35 million surplus, but we realize 
that it is ultimately a $2.5 billion surplus, thanks to the nice 
cheque of about $2.3 billion he just received from our 
finance minister, a cheque that was transferred to Quebec and 
whose money came from the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Bloc Quebecois members' speeches concerning the 
fund. They said “There is $35 billion, and they are spending 
it”. If we spend this $35 billion, it will be for reducing 
taxes, for investing it in health and education. One thing 
Bloc members often talk about is the $35 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say this money must be transferred but strangely 
enough they do not talk about Loto-Québec, which makes $10 
million a day, not a month. 
Loto-Québec is now raking in $10 million a day from 15,138 video 
poker machines in Quebec.  Loto-Québec does not have an 
agreement because it is not asking the government of Quebec to 
leave the money there and then distribute it to Quebecers.  What 
is Loto-Quebec doing?  We are talking about $10 million a day. 
This is $3 billion a year that Quebec taxpayers do not see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also mention Hydro-Quebec, which has just made a profit 
of $1.3 billion.  This money should go back to those who pay for 
electricity in order to help with monthly heating bills 
but no, into the fund it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The SAQ is raking in billions right now and Bloc Quebecois 
members are talking about creating an independent fund.  There 
is no independent fund in Quebec. 
The only independent funds that are allowed to exist are those 
for non-profit corporations.  The Landry government's non-profit 
corporations, of which there were seven, made $730 million just 
two weeks before Quebec's finance minister, Bernard Landry, 
tabled his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This money was made during the night because the national 
assembly was closed.  They made it during the night and said “We 
are going to hand out $730 million”.  This went to their friends, 
to presidents and vice-presidents and all the directors of these 
seven non-profit organizations.  It is even better this year. 
They have done better and taken $950 million and handed it over 
to the Caisse de dépôt et placement but nothing is spelled out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The odd thing is that the $950 million has not been invested.  It 
is not known what they are going to do with it. 
I hope they will invest it in resource regions because certain 
points raised by Bloc Quebecois members with reference to the 
independent fund—

The hon. member must realize that he switched parties but he 
did not change parliaments. We are not in Quebec City, we are in 
Ottawa. I want to know if he is still talking about Bill C-2 or 
if his remarks are in response to Mrs. Marois' budget speech?

to the main topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize why the hon. member is 
speaking today. There was no room for him in the national 
assembly. They shipped him to Ottawa. This is why we are talking 
about federal transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal transfers are sent to the province in an effort to 
improve the situation of Quebecers. When they ask for an 
independent fund, we think about the $840 million that the 
Quebec government has left untouched in a building on the main 
street of Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something truly deplorable about this independent fund. 
Perhaps the money will be used for tax reductions, health and 
education. The one really important thing is the retroactive 
nature of the bill, which will help the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get back to Loto-Quebec. 
They are talking about an independent fund. Let us compare 
Loto-Quebec and Canada's employment insurance fund. Loto-Quebec is 
a $3.5 billion business. Indeed, if we take its annual profits 
of $3.5 billion and multiply them by 10, we get $35 billion. 
This is what they get in Quebec over a 10 year period with a 
phantom account. To be sure, the example comes from somewhere. 
They claim that it is not the same thing. It is the taxpayers' 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the federal government does not contribute to 
the employment insurance fund. It is our workers who do so. The 
decisions are made by a commission and they involve employers 
and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things that need to be improved. We will improve them 
together, along with the opposition members who are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I come back to the comparison between Loto-Québec and the 
$35 billion fund that is self-sustaining and at arm's length. 
They say that is where the surplus should be put. Multiplying 
the $10 million a day that Loto-Quebec makes by the number of 
days in a year gives $3.5 billion a year. Over 10 years, it 
gives $35 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, the people opposite have been criticizing me for a 
while already. The Bloc members in front of me seem to be having 
fun. They are smiling. The five of them are shouting like ten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really important is trying to find solutions together 
for the unemployed. It is not easy. Looking at people who are 
dealing with the unemployed in my area, such as Laurier Gilbert 
from Val-d'Or, or Vital Gilbert from Rouyn-Noranda, they too are 
trying to find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They settle cases at the unemployment arbitration board. They 
came to Ottawa. They criticized the government. 
They were right on many points. It is thanks to them 
that we changed the rules last year. It is because the 
unemployed were able to shake up the government. They will vote 
on that. However, it is together that we will try to improve the 
lot of the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want them to be unemployed. What is important is that 
these people keep their job. That is what is important. Looking 
at all the programs that we have here available for the 
unemployed, I feel it is thanks to the money flowing from 
legislation like Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a pleasure to speak during this debate. I would like 
Loto-Québec to give its $10 million a day to Quebec taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe some colleagues may well think 
that the rule of relevancy has got it in the neck but whatever 
the case may be that debate will be for another day.

the proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to 
dispose of the report stage of the bill now before the House.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FINANCIAL CONSUMER AGENCY OF CANADA ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK30">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 30 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-8, an act to establish the Financial Consumer Agency of 
Canada and to amend certain acts in relation to financial 
institutions, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to speak to the bill particularly surrounding the manner 
in which it affects credit unions.  As my colleague from 
Regina—Qu'Appelle has already indicated when he addressed the 
House, we have serious reservations about the bill generally but 
do support it to the degree that it deals with credit unions. 
Some recommendations for additions to the bill have not been 
accepted by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really important to set in context the role the credit 
union movement from our viewpoint and that of the government's 
needs to play in the country.  That role is one of the only 
alternate systems of financial services we have.  Those services 
unfortunately are spotty across the country because of the 
history of the development of the credit union movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the bill is designed to provide some strengthening of 
the movement to allow and permit for some expansion of the credit 
union movement, it simply does not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would allow for the development of what is being called a 
national services entity, or potentially even more than one.  It 
would allow credit unions from various provinces to come together 
in a strengthened position.  It is still fairly late in the game. 
They are at a distinct disadvantage with the banking system as it 
exists because of all the privileges and rights the banking 
system has been given historically in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to draw to the attention of the country the role 
credit unions can play.  Last week I asked one of my colleagues 
in the Bloc Quebecois about the role the Desjardins movement has 
played in Quebec in solidifying a financial service sector that 
is broadly based in response to the needs of its communities.  In 
Quebec, and to a somewhat lesser degree in British Columbia, it 
has been very successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also draw attention to something that I do not think is fully 
appreciated: the small and medium enterprise area which it has 
been of great of assistance to these communities. 
There have been a number of surveys which have shown that small 
or medium size businesses get much better services from the 
credit union movement.  Unfortunately, with probably the 
exception of Quebec and maybe British Columbia, in the rest of 
the country's small and medium sized enterprises simply do not 
have sufficient services available from the credit union movement 
and institutions to meet their needs.  These amendments in the 
form of Bill C-8 will go some distance in strengthening the 
movement across the country.  However, as I indicated, it is not 
enough.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other area where I think it is really important to note the 
strength that the credit unions have provided is direct services 
to individuals.  In that regard, it brings to mind the movement 
by the big banks to close local branches.  Of course, we have 
heard protests and opposition to the banks when they do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An area where the credit union movement helped was in one of the 
western provinces when one of the big banks was closing a large 
number of local branches.  I think it was 13 or 14 branches.  The 
credit union movement moved in and in effect bought the services, 
took over those branches and kept them alive and open for a 
number of small communities in western Canada. That, in smaller 
scales, has occurred right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the recent credit unions in my home province of Ontario 
got started specifically because the big banks were pulling out 
of a small community in southwestern Ontario.  Nobody was going 
to be there to provide services, either to individuals or the 
small local businesses.  As a result of a movement on the part of 
that local community, a new credit union was formed and is 
flourishing after several years of operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to acknowledge those types of endeavours by the 
credit union movement at the same time this bill is passing 
through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it does not go far enough.  I will not take up my full 20 
minutes, but I want to make a few more points with regard to 
perhaps encouraging the government to look a little into the 
future at other programs and policies it might implement to 
facilitate the further development of the credit union movement, 
in particular, outside of the provinces of Quebec and British 
Columbia where they are already quite strong.  However, in the 
rest of Canada, the maritimes and Ontario in particular, if 
endeavours were made and policies implemented, they might very 
well be able to duplicate the success and provide alternate 
services we so badly need in the financial services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, I draw the attention of hon. members to one 
of the things the province of Quebec did to assist in expanding 
the caisse populaires and the Desjardins movement.  It 
recognized the need for additional funds to be available to the 
movement and to be used in the community to foster local business 
and allow the development of smaller communities.  It turned the 
pension funds traditionally controlled by the government over to 
the Desjardins movement.  That put at its disposal a huge amount 
of additional liquidity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although one can argue that no system is perfect, it certainly 
had the effect of making that movement in that province very 
competitive with the big banks. 
Small and medium sized enterprises had alternatives.  A financial 
service was available to get better services than they 
traditionally received from big banks.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware of another area that could be considered in terms of 
enhancing the strength of the credit union movement. That has 
been to allow them to provide to their members insurance services 
such as home insurance, auto insurance and others.  This has been 
done to some degree in the province of British Columbia.  From my 
personal knowledge of the experience in British Columbia 
involving some very large institutions, they have been able to 
use the insurance financial service sector as a profit making 
centre, one that in the smaller credit unions and smaller 
branches has made them financially viable in small communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This allowed a small branch of a credit union to continue to 
function by providing all the other financial services such as 
mortgages, personal loans et cetera, as well as house and auto 
insurance.  By combining the two, they were quite viable as an 
economic institution.  They could service the community by 
providing all those financial services.  This is something the 
government should look at as a way of providing some incentive, 
initiative and strengthening of the credit union movement across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the resistance the government has in allowing 
banking institutions to deliver insurance services.  The same 
need not be true for the credit union movement.  The credit union 
movement is dedicated to its members and its communities, not 
just to the bottom line.  The authority for credit unions to move 
into that area would be a boom for them and a very large plus for 
their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is obvious that the bill is going to pass with 
the form being proposed at this time.  Some of the suggestions I 
made with regard to credit unions need to be pursued by the 
government.  It is very important to Canada that an alternative 
source of funding for the financial sector be available to both 
small and large communities.  Some of the proposals we made as a 
party and that I recounted today would take us somewhere down 
that route. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was interested in my hon. colleague's remarks regarding the 
service that the credit union movement provides to our 
neighbourhoods and communities, specifically in my riding and the 
inner city core area of a major city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main charter banks have shown the opposite.  They have shown 
a lack of commitment.  They have shown a flight from inner 
cities. In my riding alone, 12 branches of chartered banks have 
closed in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member comment on the community reinvestment act 
which is a popular theme in the American financial sector?  It 
mandates that any financial institution operating within a 
community show a certain commitment to reinvest in that 
community, whether it is with venture capital or keeping its 
branches open. Is the hon. member aware of the community 
reinvestment act movement?  Does he think that charter banks 
could do a better job in meeting the needs of inner cities?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the 
legislation, being less than a half a mile from the state of 
Michigan.  It has that type of legislation because of some of the 
problems it had in its inner cities and its need to force large 
financial institutions to meet their responsibilities by 
providing funds to the local communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit I have a mixed response in terms of whether that 
would be of much assistance.  My general comment would be to 
strengthen the credit union movement because it does not need the 
legislation.  The credit unions are already there and doing that. 
They fund all sorts of endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of some endeavours in my local area.  We badly 
needed an arena because there was not one in the local 
geographical area.  The credit union movement, in this case the 
caisse populaire, was instrumental in arranging the financing for 
the arena.  The county could not get it from the big banks.  We 
already do that.  I am not sure that we need legislation as far 
as the credit unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need it as far as the banks begs the question.  It is 
obvious that we do.  The difficulty I have with that legislation 
is the lack of interest on the part of the banks to carry it 
through.  Even though we could pass the law that would require 
and mandate them to spend a certain percentage of their funds, 
make them available for lending purposes and provide service in 
the local community, it would be done without any enthusiasm on 
their part.  It is important that a financial institution be 
committed to the local community in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we pass the legislation, I am doubtful about any kind of a 
positive reaction from the banking institutions.  From my talks 
with some of them in regard to that kind of legislation, they 
have responded with less than great enthusiasm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the other things that 
Canadians find galling about the major chartered banks is the 
financial compensation of the chief executive officers, when they 
are closing down bank branches in an era of record profits.  I 
once went to a shareholders' meeting of the Bank of Montreal and 
the Royal Bank.  I moved a motion to limit the salary of the CEO 
to 20 times that of the average bank teller.  From a morale point 
of view Canadians would really appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member comment on the unbelievable salaries of 
CEOs with the five chartered banks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer is obvious. 
What bothers me about those huge recompenses we give to CEOs and 
several other layers of bank executives is the competitive 
position it puts us in internationally.  We always hear from the 
private sector about the need to be competitive internationally. 
If we compare those incomes with others around the world, the 
reality is they are almost unheard.  About the only other place 
we see them is in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senior bankers, CEOs of banks in Europe make nowhere near the 
same types of incomes or benefits that our CEOs and senior 
executive people get.  They try to keep some kind of a ratio 
between their employees and their senior people.  That is 
important for morale.  It is also important for the financial 
well-being of the institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many times we have seen reports, not just in 
the banking system but elsewhere where CEOs will derive these 
huge incomes or benefits in stock options, et cetera, when in 
fact the institution is not doing very well.  That is a shame, 
but it is also something that from a competitive standpoint 
should not be followed as a policy.

them in public services according to their priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has always supported transfer payments and equalization 
payments as a way of cementing the country and its provinces 
together.  Many years ago we had the EPF, the established 
programs financing program.  It was equal, with 50:50 funding for 
established programs within the various provinces.  The NDP 
believes it was of far greater benefit to the provinces when we 
had the federal government in control of implementing national 
standards with the funding formula of 50% and 50%.  It was 
simple.  If one of the provinces chose not to comply with the 
national standards that were in place, it was jeopardized in that 
the 50:50 funding formula was pulled back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The established programs financing worked very well.  We then 
saw CAP, the Canada assistance plan, come in, followed by the cap 
on CAP.  Then came the CHST.  Now we are seeing a removal of the 
cap of the new ceiling imposed in a temporary way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In earlier debates, New Democratic Party members pointed out the 
devastating impact of the CHST on social programs in the country. 
It should be stated clearly and abundantly, so the public hears 
it over and over again, that the government stripped 33% of the 
funding out of federal social transfers with the CHST.  I believe 
the total figure since 1995 is $23 billion.   The government went 
from $19.1 billion to $11 billion in social transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the equalization program was renewed in 1999, the ceiling 
was reduced by roughly $1 billion per year to an arbitrary level 
of $10 billion in 1999-2000, in spite of the broad objections 
from virtually every finance minister in the various provinces. 
It was then indexed by GDP growth in subsequent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adequate levels of equalization and social transfers are 
critical to provinces like Nova Scotia.  Otherwise Nova Scotians 
would not get what they are entitled to under the constitution, 
namely, reasonably comparable services at reasonably comparable 
levels of taxation.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we need federal transfers to ensure that services in Nova 
Scotia are reasonably comparable to those elsewhere?  We need 
them because our economy is smaller and weaker and does not 
produce as much wealth as the economies of most other provinces. 
Because there is less wealth, tax rates in Nova Scotia need to be 
higher to raise the minimum revenue needed to maintain public 
services.  However, even though we pay a higher rate of taxation 
than most other Canadians, when it comes to public services Nova 
Scotians pay more and get less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotians value education and the role that good education 
plays in making possible a better and more prosperous future, and 
we in Nova Scotia invest our scarce resources in education.  In 
1995 Nova Scotians invested 8.4% of their gross domestic product 
in education.  That was the highest rate of investment in 
education of any province, higher than Alberta, Ontario, B.C. or 
Quebec.  Only Newfoundland put a bigger share of its collective 
wealth into education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we get as a result?  Did we get well funded schools, 
low pupil-teacher ratios and gilt-edged support services?  Not a 
chance.  Because our economy is small relative to other 
provinces, putting more of our economy into education still left 
us at the bottom of the class in terms of educational 
expenditures per student.  I have spoken with many people in my 
riding who do not believe for a minute that Nova Scotia students 
are enjoying reasonably comparable services when it comes to 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health spending is another case in point.  Last year Nova 
Scotians spent 11.3% of their provincial gross domestic product 
on health.  The national average was just 9.3%, but because we 
are taking a larger piece of a considerably smaller pie the slice 
was not big enough to adequately serve our population.  Once 
again we paid more and got less.  The health care we can afford 
left our per capita spending the second lowest in the country. It 
was a full 9% below the national average.  With that, we are 
expected to serve a population that needs more health care, 10% 
or 15% more than the national average.  With those kinds of 
numbers, we have to wonder whether Nova Scotians are getting 
health services that are reasonably comparable to those enjoyed 
by many other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than improving, it is a sad fact that financial support 
has been declining since the promises of comparable service 
levels were put into the constitution.  In 1980 federal transfers 
amounted to almost 48% of the revenues available to the province 
of Nova Scotia.  By 1993 when the Liberal government took office, 
the percentage had dropped to 38.6%.  Last year it was down to 
37.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By lowering the level of equalization payments, which is indeed 
where Bill C-18 will take us, the government will be moving us 
even further away from the goal of providing reasonably 
comparable services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party oppose Bill C-18.  We oppose 
further cuts to the baseline equalization payments.  In fact, in 
a time of galloping surplus we see the need to augment our 
equalization payments to allow for equal standards of education 
and health care across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the time to correct the crippling impact of inadequate 
funding on our education and on our health care, on our schools 
and on our hospitals.  Now is the time to revisit the 
equalization formula to ensure that all provinces are afforded an 
equal level of services and all Canadians an equal level of 
citizenship.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my hon. colleague from Dartmouth for those remarks, many of 
which I can relate to as I also come from a province that relies 
heavily on the whole concept of the redistribution of wealth 
through federal transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise something that has come up recently with regard 
to the ministers of finance and the first ministers of the 
various provinces who recently agreed on the arrangement to lift 
the cap for a one year period and to then reinstate it.  The 
sentiment we are hearing now is that some premiers and some 
provincial finance ministers feel this is not quite what they 
agreed to, that what we are dealing with in Bill C-18 is in fact 
less than what they thought they were agreeing to on, I believe, 
September 11, 2000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the province of Manitoba this is certainly the case.  Is it 
true for the province of Nova Scotia?  Is there disappointment 
that what is being proposed is less than what Nova Scotia thought 
it was agreeing to at that meeting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is indeed the case. For 
many reasons, the province of Nova Scotia is clearly very 
concerned about what it feels is the unfair equalization formula 
that now exists.  Certainly we in Nova Scotia do not feel we are 
getting enough to run our education and health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that is very important right now is Nova Scotia's 
concern that there be a recognition and a commitment from the 
government to allow Nova Scotians to maintain more of our 
offshore development resources.  If we did not have the excessive 
federal government clawback, we would be able to use more of the 
resources coming in from our new offshore development to pay down 
our debt.  Certainly that would go a long way in helping us to 
get on an even footing with the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is one other issue I 
would like the hon. member to comment on.  It is of a more 
general and philosophical nature.  Now that we are re-introducing 
the cap, albeit at a lower level than we thought, at a level that 
we frankly believe is lower than will meet the actual need, could 
the hon. member provide her comments on the whole concept of 
putting a cap on human need?  How do we pick an arbitrary number 
and say it is the maximum amount of money that will be spent on 
social development in the coming year when we do not even know 
what the urgent need will be 18 months from now?  Is it morally 
right to be putting a cap on need or should we be funding things 
based on what is actually necessary and on the urgent need out 
there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in a time of enormous 
surplus I think it is immoral for us to be putting a cap on the 
amount of money we will be spending for health care, for 
education and for the very services that allow our people to be 
strong.  I would say that the best investment this government can 
make now is an investment in a healthy, well educated population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a country where we have one in five children living in 
poverty it is very hard to feel too pompous or too cheerful about 
the economic prospects we are facing, because clearly that is not 
being shared across the board.  As the income gap between poor 
and wealthy people in the country continues to increase, we are 
sowing the seeds of some very deep misery for an enormous number 
of children and vulnerable people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read a newspaper article published in <I>L'Acadie 
Nouvelle</I>, which summarizes what has happened in New Brunswick. 
This article, published on March 1, 2000, reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decapping of equalization payments for 1999-2000 will allow 
New Brunswick to receive $50 million more from Ottawa than what 
was initially anticipated for the fiscal period 1999-2001. New 
Brunswick's finance minister, Norman Betts, is far from carried 
away by the bonus resulting from the decapping of transfer 
payments and prefers to put things into perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Fifty million dollars represent 10 days in health care 
spending. 
It represents 1% of our $5 billion budget” said Mr. Betts, 
adding that the province could also receive less money because 
of the country's economic performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, according to official new estimates by the federal 
Department of Finance, New Brunswick will receive an extra $5 
million for the 1999-2001 period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For fiscal 2000-2001, New Brunswick will receive $1.207 billion 
from the federal under the equalization program. This amount 
represents more than one quarter of the province's budget, which 
was $4.472 billion in 2000-2001. Before Minister Betts can cash 
the $50 million cheque from his federal counterpart, the Commons 
will have to pass the bill reviewing the equalization program 
formula tabled on Tuesday. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was for the month of March 2001. The article goes on, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization program was created to close the gap between 
the have and the have-not provinces, so that these provinces can 
provide to the public services comparable to those provided by 
the wealthy provinces. Three provinces, British Columbia, 
Ontario and Alberta, get nothing under the equalization program. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, living in a country is something like the unions, 
which I will use as an example. Within a union, there are big 
locals and small locals but every member is part of the same 
union. It is true there are smaller locals with only five, six, 
seven or eight persons.  It is more expensive to give them 
services because they cannot afford to pay for all those 
services.  I like this example because I think it is a good 
illustration of what happens in the case of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is called a union because all the workers of the country, big 
groups and small groups alike, are united in one union.  That is 
how I imagine the country.  The country is a group of all 10 
provinces and the territories, including the Yukon and Nunavut. 
All those provinces and territories form the union which is our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever we are no longer able to take care of the have nots, why 
remain a part of it?  Why stay in a country if we cannot take 
care of each other? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason a country takes money from the rich, yes I dare to 
say it and I am not ashamed of it, is to redistribute it. This 
sharing can be compared to what happens in a family. Sometimes 
in families those who have more help those who have less.  This 
is what a country is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have a problem today because we are too selfish. It 
is everybody for himself. This attitude runs from the top down: 
the country, the leaders and the governments down to the 
provinces and the families. We have to show that we can take 
care of each other. This is why a cap is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can help a province to survive and if we are able to 
invest to create jobs, I think people will be able to manage on 
their own. However, if we deprive them every day of these tools 
and if we are unable to make the transfers needed to help those 
provinces, I think it will go from bad to worse. This is 
contrary to common sense and to national unity, utterly 
contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a responsibility, which is convincing 
people, be they from Ontario, Alberta or British Columbia, that 
this is the way Canada works; all the provinces are together, 
and we must have a formula to help Canadians all over the 
country. We have to recognize this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if Alberta were to say “We are now rich; we have 
oil and we don't need anybody anymore”, I hope they will not run 
out of oil, because they might need this formula also. This is 
what a country is all about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In New Brunswick, we never asked that the fisheries go the way 
they went, and we never asked for the elimination of groundfish 
quotas. We never asked for this. People in fishplants were 
working 30 to 32 weeks before the moratorium on groundfish. We 
never asked for this closure of the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can get tough for any province when revenues do not come in. 
Let me take Alberta as an example. I am very glad for Alberta, 
because it is a rich province, but when one is rich, one should 
share with the poor. I do not mean that our own region is very 
poor 
but it does have certain needs, just as Manitoba does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole country is glad that we have an agricultural industry 
in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Thanks to them, we can have three 
meals a day. We need provinces where agriculture can prosper. It 
is the same thing in Quebec. Between Montreal and Rivière-du-Loup, 
farms line the road on both sides. It is nice that we have 
farmers but it is also nice to have fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People like to visit New Brunswick and other Atlantic provinces. 
We have people working in the tourist industry. As I said very 
often in other speeches, people in Toronto are fond of our two 
by fours but to have two by fours, we need lumberjacks. 
These people work hard yet they have seasonal jobs. It goes 
without saying that seasonal workers cannot pay as much income 
tax as if they worked 12 months per year. Our provinces are 
losing out on benefits because these are seasonal jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the federal government to show some 
leadership in this regard, and to say “This is the rule, this is 
the formula that will help our poorer provinces and keep our 
country united”. Again, if there is no advantage in being part 
of a country, why stay in it? What is the country in the end 
when the federal government makes such cuts in health, 
education and all the rest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by asking the federal government, the Liberals, 
those in power, to show some leadership. This is why we have to 
oppose the capping of the equalization program. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member from Acadie—Bathurst for very forcefully 
putting into words what many in the room are thinking: that the 
redistribution of wealth through federal transfer payments may be 
the single greatest achievement of Canadian federalism and the 
most important instrument for fostering Canadian unity.  That 
point has not been made often enough in this room.  I thank him 
for making it very poignantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have is more specifically about the methodology 
and formula for the Canada health and social transfer.  The hon. 
member pointed out, and other speakers have mentioned, that when 
the government introduced the CHST the federal transfer was about 
$19.1 billion.  When the CHST kicked in it was $11 billion.  It 
is only now inching forward.  In other words, the total aggregate 
amount of cutback the government has ripped out of the federal 
social transfer is $30 billion to $35 billion, arguably even 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would that not constitute a breach of the whole concept of 
Canadian unity?  Are we not jeopardizing the fragile thing we 
call the federation of Canada when we rip the heart out of the 
very programs that make it worth belonging to?  Would the hon. 
member care to comment on the impact felt in ridings like his 
when the Canada health and social transfer ripped the heart out 
of so many social programs?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Winnipeg Centre for his question.  My colleague talked about 
health care.  Looking at the history of health care, in 1969 the 
federal government used to pay 50% of the cost of health care. 
Now it is down to 13%.  If the federal government cannot make the 
transfers that need to be made to be able to have the programs I 
have used many times, then what is the purpose of having a 
federal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go to the vet and not find a dog or a cat in the 
hallway.  If we go to the hospital where human beings are, we 
find them in the hallway or they cannot even get into the 
hospital.  That is an example of how health care stinks in our 
country.  It is the fault of the Liberals and the federal 
government.  In 1969 the government paid 50% of the cost of 
health care.  Today it is down to 13%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we could say we are losing the unity of our country. 
It is the fault of a federal government that does not know how to 
create programs that would keep all our provinces and territories 
united.  That is what happens with the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst puts into words exactly what I was thinking.  He 
does so better than I could.  We will feed him another question 
and let him try it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the CHST was first introduced, the National Council on 
Welfare called it the most devastating social policy initiative 
since the great depression.  Let us imagine going forward with a 
policy that experts in the field cited as devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that we hearken back to a time when we had established 
program funding, when social programs were funded at 50:50.  Did 
the federal government not have a better opportunity to maintain 
national standards when the funding level was 50:50?  Under that 
system, if a province failed to meet national standards it could 
be punished by having its funding reduced.  Was there not more 
capability to have true national standards under that funding 
mechanism than under the CHST? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is easy to answer.  When 
one does not pay into it one has no say in it.  That is what 
happens with the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at my province, New Brunswick, for example.  Could 
anyone imagine that one person who goes on welfare receives $269 
a month?  Two hundred and sixty nine dollars a month is probably 
not what a member of parliament gets in one day here, and the 
Liberals want a person to live on $269 a month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a responsibility across the country 
to make transfers which make sense and with which people can 
live.  I agree with my colleague from Winnipeg Centre that 
government cuts have created a separation between poor and rich 
people and poor and rich provinces.  We are going backward.  We 
are going the wrong way.  I hope the federal government changes 
its mind about the way it is running our country.

it is with pride and enthusiasm that, on Thursday, in

attended the closing ceremony of a Youth Service Canada project 
that was a resounding success in the community. “Les bons

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the objectives of that program was to allow young people 
to gain the basic knowledge and experience that they needed to 
enter today's labour market. 
For 32 weeks, ten young people from L'Annonciation had the 
opportunity to take part in the organization and planning of 
activities geared to eliminating, through prevention, awareness 
promotional activities, the problems relating to violence and 
discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These young people also helped create a community garden, while 
supporting other regional organizations, to bring generations 
closer together and create connections between young people and 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the project, public mischief went down from 16 cases in 
1998 to only one in 2001. These figures show that federal

prove disastrous for the Atlantic industry.  I call on the 
international trade minister to ensure that free trade in 
softwood lumber continues in our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I object to Liberal statements that the government will force 
Atlantic sawmills to comply with Canada's export monitoring

sold the shares in November, Mr. Prince obviously believed that 
he did not buy them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
another statement by the Prime Minister in the golf club and 
Auberge Grand-Mère affair has been contradicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Prime Minister's letter to the leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party dated March 26, the Prime Minister said that 
the Auberge Grand-Mère was in competition with the adjacent golf 
club but the auberge's owner, Yvon Duhaime, said quite the 
opposite in a statement made under oath on November 2, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Deputy Prime Minister deny the financial link 
between the two entities, when Yvon Duhaime swore under oath that 
most of the auberge's income came from golfers at the adjoining 
club? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
simple truth is that, long before the Prime Minister became Prime 
Minister, the legal financial links of ownership had been 
completely severed and, during the period in question, Mr. Prince 
owed the Prime Minister money, but had no interest himself in the 
golf club.  That is the truth.  Those are the facts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the facts are that in the September 29, 1999 agreement, the 
Prime Minister said that he had relinquished his right of ownership 
six years earlier. The same Prime Minister also said that he was 
going to protect Mr. Michaud and pay his lawyers if there was a 
problem  In addition, the auberge's owner, Mr. Duhaime, said 
that there is a financial link between the two entities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not proof that there was a very clear conflict of 
interest when the Prime Minister approached the Business 
Development Bank of Canada to ensure the auberge's survival so 
that the golf club could find another buyer? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the important thing is that the Prime Minister was owed money by 
Mr. Prince after November 1, 1993, and this debt was paid by Mr. 
Prince. Mr. Prince sold all the shares he bought from the Prime 
Minister to Mr. Michaud on September 29, 1999.  So there is no 
conflict of interest and the hon. member should withdraw his 
allegations—

Auberge Grand-Mère. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The connection between the two was demonstrated by the 
owner of the auberge, under oath.  He is the one who has said 
so, and in so doing has contradicted the Prime Minister.

“Table the bill of sale and we will stop asking questions”, that 
was because we had his assurance that the bill of sale was 
exactly that, and proved that the Prime Minister had sold his 
shares in 1993.

the area and that the auberge welcomes golfers from all the 
golf courses in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, at the time the Prime Minister made representations 
for a loan from the Business Development Bank to the auberge, the 
Prime Minister had no ownership interest whatsoever in the golf 
course.  Yes, he had a debt owing to him but he was not connected 
in any way, shape or form with the golf course.  The value of the 
debt did not change no matter what happened with the golf course.

six golf courses and the only one with which he claims they had

</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1996, Claude Gauthier, a friend of the Prime 
Minister, a contributor to his campaign and a serial recipient of 
government grants, purchased land from the Grand-Mère Golf Club 
at a price well above market value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Deputy Prime Minister tell the House if the Prime

<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

all the shares that it owned on November 1, 1993 to the company 
of Mr. Prince.  Therefore the Prime Minister had no interest 
whatsoever in the golf course from and after that point. He had a 
debt owing to him by Mr. Prince's company and it was eventually 
settled.  Mr. Prince's company resold the shares that he had 
purchased from the Prime Minister to Mr. Michaud.  I say to the

never influence the Business Development Bank.  Later, when the 
bank was trying to collect on the loan to the Auberge Grand-Mère, 
the Prime Minister's pressure on the bank was revealed in sworn 
testimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister also said that there were no ties between the 
golf course, for which he had not been paid, and the inn, which 
he forced the Business Development Bank to prop up against the 
bank's better judgment.  Now it turns out again in sworn 
testimony that the financial survival of the inn was tied to the 
golf course.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister exerted no

without Canada's energy, they had better learn to speak Arabic

starting the very next working day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had five years' warning that this was coming.  Why

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade,

data in order to defend ourselves against American charges.  This 
data will help producers in every province and region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lumber brokers are already available to issue permits.  The

</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally Atlantic Canada has been treated as a region, not 
province by province, in negotiations with the U.S. and other 
parts of Canada when it comes to softwood lumber.  Will the

province by province or, again, is this a prelude to an export

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade,

Mr. Speaker, last week we learned that Canadian productivity

growth was 1.4% compared to 2.8% in the United States, half as 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years ago the minister's seatmate said to Don Mazankowski:

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals finally got their wish.  Since they have been in

losing value against the Mexican currency becoming the new North 
American peso.

<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
under Standing Order 52 I have filed for an emergency debate 
regarding a very serious issue facing Canadians.  This would be a 
non-partisan debate, Mr. Speaker, if you should be as forthcoming 
as to allow it.  It has to do with the potential problems the 
country may face with respect to foot and mouth disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an $11 billion livestock industry in Canada.  We do not 
want this to be fearmongering.  Nor do I wish it to be a partisan 
issue.  I simply want a venue in which members of parliament can 
put forward precautionary measures that could and should be taken 
by all Canadians, not only by those in the industry.  The 
measures could also be taken by tourists who come and go 
throughout the country and by people who import and export on a 
continuous basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you, Mr. Speaker, and your office to please allow members

in the good graces of your office, to allow us to do so.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK201">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-18, an 
act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to discuss Bill C-18 regarding equalization from the 
federal government to the provinces.  The bill, if passed, and I 
expect the government will be able to get its members into the 
House for an important vote like this one, would lift the cap off 
equalization payments for the year 2000-01. Quite simply, that is 
what the bill is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a complicated piece of legislation.  It deals 
specifically with an issue and certainly would be a help and a 
boon to the provinces that need increased equalization payments, 
especially in this fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are debating this bill today we know that the four 
Atlantic premiers, including one of the only two Liberal premiers 
in the country, are meeting in Charlottetown to discuss 
equalization payments.  Certainly what they are asking the 
government to do and what we are expecting they will ask the 
government to do is permanently lift the cap on equalization. 
There are a number of reasons the government should seriously 
consider measures such as lifting the cap on a permanent basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of providing effectively level taxation or similar 
levels of taxation and services across the country is perhaps the 
very cornerstone of Canadian social policy.  That was said in the 
House not long ago by our finance critic, the member for 
Kings—Hants.  I would like to state— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  The vice-chair of the finance committee 
is the member for Kings—Hants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  He is the vice-chair of the finance 
committee.  He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a reflection of this importance, equalization is the only 
transfer program that is actually enshrined in the Constitution 
act.  The goal of equalization, of providing equality of 
opportunity across Canada, is extraordinarily important.  We 
should also recognize that a goal of equalization should be to 
provide a ladder for provinces and individuals in those 
provinces, those recipient provinces, to rise from their status 
as recipient to the point that they can participate in the free 
market economy fully. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the nuts and bolts of the legislation.  The equalization 
system should under no circumstance provide barriers or 
roadblocks to success for individuals and provinces as they try 
to bootstrap themselves into a more prosperous economy.  The 
equalization system, as it is formulated, can create and 
encourage a continued roadblock to success for these provinces. 
That is perhaps the most fundamentally important issue in 
equalization which has not been addressed and which needs to be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party is concerned that the government, instead 
of debating the issue, discussing it over the past five years and 
trying to come up with an equalization plan that provides all 
regions of the countries with opportunities to succeed, continues 
with the same old tired policies that we need to revisit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are ingenious about giving opportunities to recipient 
provinces and about eliminating barriers to success, it will take 
more than a few hours of debate in the House of Commons and some 
witnesses appearing before the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a new visionary approach to equalization.  We need a new 
equalization program that provides a ladder to success and not 
barriers to success as this one does.  Our party believes that an 
equalization program is necessary and that we should continue to 
protect and encourage equalization as a tenet of Canadian social 
policy.  We can make it better as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of concerns from our provincial counterparts, 
especially those in Atlantic Canada.  Many of these concerns are 
relative to natural gas revenues.  Offshore natural gas and oil 
revenues for some of the provinces affected, be it Nova Scotia or 
Newfoundland, and the opportunities for Nova Scotians, 
Newfoundlanders or Atlantic Canadians to bootstrap themselves 
into some level of prosperity in the 21st century are largely 
contingent on these revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be very careful not to create a clawback through 
changes in equalization.  That is exactly what we have now, a 
clawback that effectively eliminates and reduces significantly 
the benefits being made by these provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past governments made the mistake of trying to protect 
regions of the country from risks of the future.  In so doing 
with social programming and reinvestment in times when the 
government is not able to do that, we can create a very dangerous 
precedent and a very dangerous set of political dynamics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At no other time in the history of Canada has Nova Scotia been 
positioned as well on the doorstep to the future as it is now. In 
no other time since Newfoundland joined Confederation has it been 
positioned as well as it is now to enter the country as a 
full-fledged partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vision of the federal government must do what it chose to do 
from 1957 to 1965 in the province of Alberta when it allowed that 
province to keep its equalization payments as well as its 
revenues.  If we had a similar program in Atlantic Canada for 
five years, and if we allowed those provinces to keep their oil 
and gas revenues as well as their equalization payments, in a 
very short period of time they would be able to be contributors 
to Canadian equalization instead of drawing on Canadian 
equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one instance.  There are also other opportunities in 
these areas: the gas fields on Sable Island, the stepout wells 
that are being drilled this year, the deep water drilling that 
will be taking place on the east coast, the potential of the 
Laurentian sub-basin, the potential off Labrador, and the 
additional wells being drilled off Hibernia.  Newfoundlanders, 
Nova Scotians, Prince Edward Islanders and New Brunswickers have 
their foot in the door of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to show the vision to open that door wider. 
We have had Premier John Hamm campaigning in Ottawa.  He was in 
Alberta a few weeks ago on his so-called campaign for fairness.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not rocket science.  This is simply saying that the 
province, taking Nova Scotia as an example, manages to keep only 
19 cents of every dollar of offshore oil and gas revenues in Nova 
Scotia.  The rest of the money, the other 81 cents, goes to the 
coffers and fattens the revenues of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something absolutely and incredibly wrong with that. We 
should not have to discuss the fact that 81 cents go to the feds 
and that 19 cents go to Nova Scotia.  This is not the scale of 
justice.  It is not imbalance at all; it is completely out of 
whack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Nova Scotia and Newfoundland signed the offshore accords, 
the intent of those accords was to give undersea revenues to the 
provinces that brought those revenues into Confederation.  In 
1867 when Nova Scotia joined Confederation, it brought with it 
those offshore revenues because it controlled those revenues. 
That became a net contributor to the economy and in the last 10 
years it has been a huge contributor to the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find a way to ensure or enshrine, because the 
legislation is protected in the constitution, that some of that 
money goes back to the provinces from whence it came, whether 
from Alberta with revenues that come from underground, whether 
from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland with revenues that come from 
offshore, or from any other province in the country.  There has 
to be some flexibility in the equalization system to accept 
varying and differing circumstances at different periods in our 
history.  What we have now does not do that.  We need some 
positive change and soon. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for South Shore 
talked about the fact that equalization or what Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland are asking for is not rocket science.  It is not 
rocket science when they are asking for something that no one 
else gets, that is preferential treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should go back to the original principles of equalization. 
The way equalization is supposed to work is that when a 
provincial government gets better off by a dollar its 
equalization goes down by a dollar.  When its revenues decline 
its equalization increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In rare circumstances the federal government has reached some 
accommodations with certain provinces that departs from this.  It 
happened with Quebec for asbestos, Saskatchewan for potash, and 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland through special accords.  Nova 
Scotia and Newfoundland are allowed to keep 30 cents on the 
dollar or more from revenues raised from offshore oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in the 1980s that the governments of Nova Scotia and 
Canada discussed the ownership of offshore resources.  Both 
governments agreed that Nova Scotia should be allowed to tax 
offshore resources as if it owns them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for South Shore talks about the offshore accord.  Has 
he skimmed through it and does he realize that once triggered 
Nova Scotia is able to shelter about 90% of offshore revenues 
against equalization?  That comes down over 10 years or until it 
is clawed back.  However the equalization was never meant to 
provide an ongoing benefit.  It is meant to be a transfer from 
the so-called have provinces to the have not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If oil and gas revenues from Alberta were also excluded, we 
might be paying equalization to Alberta.  How would the member 
for South Shore feel about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have read the 
Canada-Nova Scotia offshore accord and it is obvious to me that 
the member has not.  He should pick it up and take a real good 
hard look at it because the accord states that the bulk of the 
revenues coming from the offshore should go to the province 
involved, either Nova Scotia or Newfoundland. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The separate side deal was for the Hibernia project. 
Newfoundland got to keep 25% of its revenues because of the cost 
of bringing the project on stream.  It was a huge cost and some 
of the technology developed for Hibernia was the first time that 
it had ever been used anywhere on the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's other question is really ludicrous.  The principle 
of equalization is that when a province makes a dollar the 
federal government will claw it back.  That is why we are 
standing on our feet today discussing the issue.  That is what is 
not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we read the history books and take a look at what happened 
between 1957 and 1965 we find that Alberta kept its equalization 
payments.  Why not?  It allowed the province the opportunity to 
build its infrastructure, to dig itself out of the hole that it 
was in and to climb up the ladder of opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying all the provinces should be allowed to do that. It 
would not be forever.  We cannot expect to implement it forever. 
The provinces should be given an opportunity to climb out of the 
hole and to get on top of their debts instead of looking up at 
them.  They should be able to bring in the revenues they richly 
deserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, with reference to the comments made by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, I note that 
it was his own Minister of Industry who as premier of 
Newfoundland said that the government should seriously consider 
allowing provinces for a period of time not to be penalized 
through the welfare trap by withholding equalization payments 
pursuant to growth through non-renewable resource revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to follow up the remarks made by member for South 
Shore.  At the outset they confused me.  He said that he was in 
favour of lifting the ceiling on equalization altogether.  That 
was not a position taken by his finance critic during his opening 
remarks on the bill.  Lifting the ceiling on equalization is a 
matter entirely different from the substance of his remarks 
related to non-renewable resource revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants to lift the ceiling on equalization, the 
federal government will ask that the floor be dropped, which 
protects the provinces on the other side.  He is treading into 
very dangerous waters.  I encourage him to focus on allowing 
provinces more flexibility with respect to resource revenues than 
completely changing the system.  We might as well throw the 
formula out if he lifts the ceiling, as the floor will go and the 
provinces will suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I recognize the member's 
very good comment.  We need a ceiling and a floor.  The four 
Atlantic premiers are meeting in Charlottetown as we debate the 
bill.  They are looking at the caps on equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A press release is expected from them by 3 p.m. Atlantic time. I 
will let them speak for themselves because it is always dangerous 
to speak for someone else.  However it is expected that they will 
be asking for the caps to be removed in some fashion.

concerning the fact that copies of the report were not available 
for distribution, contrary to the usual practice for tabled 
documents. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a commitment to review the situation and report back to 
the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that copies of the report were in fact available 
for distribution.  However the copies of the CHRC report were 
packed in boxes under a second report from the commission, a 
report on employment equity.  Employees looking for the annual 
reports could not immediately find them.  Only after checking 
back with the commission did we learn about the packaging of the 
two reports and find the errant copies of the annual report. 
These were then immediately made available to members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize to hon. members for any inconvenience caused by the 
confusion that resulted from the simultaneous delivery of the two 
reports.  Members will be pleased to learn that steps have been 
taken to avoid such a situation in the future.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK209">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-18, an 
act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is good to have an opportunity to participate in this 
debate on Bill C-18, which really goes to the heart of what we as 
New Democrats have been trying to do in the House and what so 
many Canadians are concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to hear the comments of the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance.  I want to register concern 
about his suggestion that opposition attempts to lift the ceiling 
on equalization and to eliminate the cap are in any way, shape or 
form preferential treatment for one province over another.  His 
comments do a great disservice to a fundamental concept, a 
philosophical instrument, that has been very much a part of the 
history of this country in shaping it into what it is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure what the parliamentary secretary's main point was 
in raising his question on the Conservative member's comments 
around lifting the ceiling, but it strikes me that what we are 
hearing from both the Liberals and the Alliance in this debate is 
a fundamental questioning of a principle grounded in the notion 
of equality.  Surely that is what the debate should focus on. 
That is why it is so important for the government to hear and to 
act upon the recommendation, which is not just to lift the cap 
for the fiscal year 1999-2000 but to in fact lift it permanently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my colleagues in the New Democratic Party have said very 
eloquently how important equalization is as a principle in the 
country.  It has been said to hon. members in the House that 
equalization is not only a moral principle but a constitutional 
principle.  In this debate, we are asking the question:  if 
something is a moral principle, is it not in fact morally 
reprehensible to disband the concept entirely?  Is it not morally 
wrong to remove or to erode a program that has been fundamental 
to the notion of equality in this country?  If it is, as my 
colleagues have said, a constitutional principle, is the 
government not wrong not to address the error of its ways when it 
so arbitrarily put a cap on equalization in the past, and is the 
government now not wrong not to act to remove it forever? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point of our submission throughout this debate.  We 
very much believe that equalization is there for a reason.  It 
has been part of our history for a long time in order to ensure 
some measure of equality among all regions in the country.  It is 
in the constitution for a reason.  It has been part of our 
tradition as a nation in terms of building links from one end of 
the country to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our view that it was wrong on the part of the Liberals to 
implement this cap on equalization in the first place and that it 
is wrong of the government at this moment not to lift it 
permanently.  Obviously it is a small step in the right direction 
to lift the ceiling on equalization for one fiscal year.  That is 
a tiny step.  It is an improvement.  It deals with some of the 
concerns that have been raised.  However, today is an opportune 
time and this parliament is an opportune moment for the 
government to put back in its entirety the full equalization 
program, without its limitations, without its ceilings, without 
its caps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to hear such clear support from the 
Conservative member, the hon. member for South Shore, for lifting 
the ceiling on equalization on a permanent basis.  We appreciate 
that support and that position.  However, it is important to 
point out that in many ways today we are in this dilemma of 
trying to address and correct a major assault on social policy in 
the country because of Conservative policies then and Liberal 
policies now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we should let this moment pass without 
remembering just what kind of damage has been caused to the 
social fabric of the nation as a result of the Mulroney 
Conservatives and now the Liberal government which has followed 
so steadfastly not only in implementing but in adhering to and 
accelerating the Mulroney Conservative agenda.  It is worthwhile 
to point out that we are really talking about a decade or more of 
Conservative and Liberal cuts to social programs, a very 
deliberate assault on our social policies, which is causing such 
serious ramifications today and around which we are trying to 
regroup to redress the errors of the past caused by these 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be fair of us who have been working so hard on these 
issues for more than a decade in terms of the right wing agenda 
of both the Conservatives and the Liberals, at least from the New 
Democratic Party's point of view, to draw the attention of the 
House to the consecutive cuts and the slashing of programs over 
the last while, starting with Brian Mulroney and the 
Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that it was under the Conservatives that a cap 
on the Canada assistance plan was first introduced.  Let us not 
forget that the Mulroney Conservatives used three consecutive 
acts to amend fiscal legislation in the country, putting funding 
for education and health on very shaky ground.  It was under 
those steps taken by the Mulroney Conservatives that the country 
faced the threat of seeing cash for health care and education 
entirely dry up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Conservatives, the changes to the established programs 
financing formula restricted growth in the formula and made it 
such that given the combination between cash and tax points, cash 
for health care and education would dry up in at least one 
province by this year, right at this very moment as we are 
speaking in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incredible damage was done to our social policies, which had to 
be corrected.  Unfortunately, the Liberals came into office in 
1993 and by and large continued with that kind of slashing and 
hacking at our social policies and at our important health, 
education and social assistance programs.  Let us not forget, in 
fact, that the Liberals promised in the 1993 election campaign to 
redress those egregious errors and those horrific cuts of the 
Conservative government.  Instead, they very much perpetuated 
that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had hoped that the Liberals, once back in power, would lift 
the cap on CAP and would put back into the formula for health and 
education arrangements in order to allow for growth in the 
transfers to provinces, so that our provincial jurisdictions 
could keep up with the growing threats to the preservation of 
health care because of demands, needs and changes in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, as my colleague from Winnipeg Centre pointed out 
earlier, the Liberal government proceeded to make the most 
regressive social policy change in the history of the country. It 
took the single biggest bite out of financing and cash transfers 
for health and education that we had ever seen in the history of 
medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enormous damage was done by the Conservatives and it was 
perpetuated by the Liberals.  Today we are trying to catch up. We 
are trying to address the fact our medicare system, our public 
post-secondary education system and our equalization program, the 
programs that are pride of our country, were dealt enormous 
damage and are on very shaky ground in terms of meeting the needs 
of Canadians.  In fact, they are failing to do precisely what 
they were intended to do, which was to ensure that all people in 
the country, regardless of where they live or what community they 
are from, regardless of their income, their cultural background 
or their ethnocultural heritage, are able to access those 
programs that are considered to be fundamental rights and 
fundamentally part of what it means to be a citizen in the 
country today.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal approach has been very much a band-aid one in the 
last number of years.  We hear a lot of rhetoric about trying to 
patch up the system, trying to move forward based on the 
resources available and trying to do things in a balanced and 
responsible way.  However, the band-aids are so small and the 
approach is so ad hoc that we are not able to put a stop to the 
bleeding and actually start to build again for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I think of all the rhetoric and the great fanfare 
from the government around money that it claims to have put back 
into transfer payments.  In the February 1999 budget the 
government made a great deal of the millions of dollars being put 
back.  In fact, it turned out to be two cents for health care for 
every dollar in tax cuts.  Then of course last fall as we tried 
to convince the government to take its responsibility seriously, 
the answer was an supposed additional massive influx of money 
through the federal-provincial agreement in the September accord. 
That turned out to be enough money to get us back to 1994 levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is hardly the kind of strategy and leadership that one 
would expect if medicare was so central to who we are as a 
country and if our social programs were so fundamental to the 
very definition of what it means to be Canadian.  The 
parliamentary secretary does a disservice to the definition of 
equalization when he talks in terms of preferential treatment. 
Probably the accurate definition of equalization is as my 
colleague, the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona put it:  to 
ensure a comparable level of public services in the country. 
Regardless of the fiscal capacities of the province, regardless 
of the wealth each province is able to generate based on natural 
resources and other economic advantages, no one region should be 
able to have greater benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be fair to define equalization as something that was 
instituted in order to allow provinces with lower fiscal 
capacities to fund health, education and other provincial 
programs at tax rates comparable to those in more affluent 
provinces.  That is certainly the understanding of provincial 
governments.  That is certainly the understanding of the 
government in the province I come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I just quoted from a letter from the minister of 
finance from the province of Manitoba.  The parliamentary 
secretary may very well be aware of a very detailed letter from 
that province.  I am sure he has received similar presentations 
from other provincial finance ministers, who are all concerned 
about the way in which this government has failed to address the 
concerns that provinces brought to the table and also concerned 
about the failure of the government to live up to the Prime 
Minister's words and the commitment he made in September 2000. In 
fact, the finance ministers in all of our provincial and 
territorial governments are very mindful of those words and 
hopeful because of the wording that was agreed to in the 
communiqué around the September accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote a sentence from that communiqué because it 
shows just how much people and the provinces feel they have been 
let down by the bill before us today, Bill C-18, and by the 
failure of the government to restore the equalization program on 
an ongoing basis and to lift the ceiling on equalization on a 
permanent basis.  That communiqué states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First Ministers raised the issue of Equalization.  The Minister 
of Finance will examine this issue further after consultation 
with provincial Ministers of Finance.  While final revisions for 
Equalization purposes for the fiscal year 1999/2000 likely will 
not be known until October 2002, the Prime Minister agreed to 
take the necessary steps to ensure that no ceiling will apply to 
the 1999/2000 fiscal year.  Thereafter, the established 
Equalization formula will apply, which allows the program to grow 
up to the rate of growth of GDP. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces believed from that communiqué that the ceiling on 
equalization payments would be lifted for the year 1999-2000, as 
specified in the bill, but they also expected the Prime Minister 
to actively pursue an extension to that lifting of the freeze for 
at least another fiscal year.  They also expected to see the 
Prime Minister and the government address their concerns for a 
growth factor in the formula so that there would be some way for 
less affluent provinces to keep pace with the needs and demands 
on their systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, I will outline the kind of impact this would have 
for a province like Manitoba.  Manitoba is a wonderful province 
with great potential but it is not one of the most affluent 
provinces.  It depends very much on the federal government's 
fairness and commitment to ensuring that cash transfers meet the 
growing needs in the fields of health and education.  It is a 
province that depends heavily on the federal government to be 
firmly committed to the notion of equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter to the government, the province of Manitoba pointed 
out that its potential cost for 2000-01, given the government's 
failure to lift the cap for that year, was about $100 million. 
Application of the ceiling to 2000-01 equalization entitlements 
may actually result in lower payments than for 1999-2000, despite 
a significant increase in entitlement as generated by the 
formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of finance for the province of Manitoba, Mr. Greg 
Selinger, goes on to make a very important case to the federal 
government for lifting the ceiling on equalization for at least 
another year and for the government to look seriously at the need 
to fully restore the program as it was originally intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important message we can bring to the House today, in 
hopes of shaking up the government and persuading it to amend the 
legislation while it has a chance, is to appeal again to the 
sense of what it means to be Canadian, what is a part of our 
identity and what is very much central to any notion of national 
unity in the country today.  I do not think I need to repeat this 
as many members have said it so eloquently.  It is our notion of 
equality between regions and between all people in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we bring to the debate is the notion based on an old cliché 
“from each according to his ability to each according to his 
need”.  That is the essence of the debate.  We are looking at 
ways to ensure that the wealth of regions can be shared equally 
across the country and that everyone has access to decent public 
service, universal health care, education, decent housing, clean 
water and clean air to breathe. Those are basics.  That is the 
role of the federal government.  That is why we have the 
equalization program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the parliamentary secretary, who I know has been 
listening intently throughout the debate, to find a way to amend 
the bill or to accept our amendment before pushing it through. 
The government has the fiscal flexibility today to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the rhetoric time and time again.  It is now time for the 
government to show what it means to put its money where its mouth 
is and lift the ceiling on the equalization program for not only 
this fiscal year, which is referenced in the bill, but for the 
next fiscal year, and to look at it as a permanent feature of our 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been noted so many times in the debate, it is a moral 
principle, is it not?  If it is, how can we in any sense of the 
word dismantle a concept that is about equality and about 
achieving that kind of adherence to that kind of moral principle? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is a constitutional principle, how in any way can we 
justify that there should be a cap on a constitutional principle? 
How can we justify a cap on morality?  How can we justify a 
ceiling on equality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the government to amend the bill and to act in the 
best interests of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed the speech from the member for Winnipeg North Centre.  I 
thank her for raising many very important and very relevant 
themes as they affect the province that we share, the province of 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank her for reminding the House of Commons of the many 
shortcomings of the Mulroney Tory government.  Sometimes I think 
people forget that a lot of the negative trends that we are 
seeing lately and that we are actively fighting against found 
their origins in the philosophy of the Mulroney Tories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is hard to imagine today is that even though the Mulroney 
years were cruel, heartless, callous and meanspirited, many of us 
look back fondly at those times because compared to the Liberal 
government today, those times seem benevolent by comparison.  The 
Liberals have taken those trends farther than Mulroney ever had 
the guts to do.  Even though he warned us that we would not 
recognize the country when he was through with it, frankly, after 
seven years of Liberal government, we are starting to realize 
that we do not recognize the very country that we are so proud of 
building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member elaborate a little bit more on the 
equalization formula in the year following?   We all understand 
that relieving the cap for the year 1999-2000 is based on the 
demands of the various first ministers and ministers of finance 
as they met over the years.  However, the reinstatement of the 
cap in the year following, which, as I understand from the hon. 
member's speech, could be at a rate lower than it was before and 
would give us a one year holiday on the cap, may in fact end up 
being a lower cap than it was originally.  In other words, we are 
going backward on this idea of greater equalization.  That is the 
first thing I would like her to comment on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, would the member speak about the clawback ideas?  Is it 
not true that if we allowed some of the have not provinces to 
keep the increased revenue that they might have instead of losing 
dollar for dollar, they may climb out of the trap that they are 
in now, relying on equalization solely? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments from the MP whose riding is next to mine in Winnipeg and 
where we share many of the same concerns.  These are two 
constituencies where poverty is at a very high rate and where 
people have felt the impact in real, human, hurtful terms of a 
decade of Liberal and Conservative cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to remember, not just what the Liberals 
have done in the last seven years but what the Conservatives did 
leading up to that.  Probably the best description of that came 
from an article by Daniel Drache and Meric Gertler who, in 
describing and summarizing the Conservative's policies, which fit 
with those of the Liberals, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No area of government policy has been spared.  Across a broad 
front that includes not only trade but regional development, tax 
and fiscal policies, old age pensions, family allowance, labour 
market policy, social income programs, and collective bargaining, 
the government has moved persistently and systematically to 
reshape the institutional and legislative character of Canada. 
Its strategy is to water down Canadian redistributional programs 
so as to make them equivalent to the lowest common denominator, 
and to cut the direct and indirect labour costs to business. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that sums up both the Mulroney Conservative agenda and 
the Liberals today.  We have been dealt one blow after another by 
this government and I think the assault on our social programs 
has to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question pertaining to the impact of the failure to lift the 
ceiling for the next fiscal year on a province like Manitoba is a 
very good one and it is a serious problem.  I have indicated the 
impact it will have based on a letter from the Manitoba minister 
of finance.  He clearly indicated that with this kind of approach 
by the government, Manitoba would be worse off than if the 
government had just left well enough alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his letter, the minister of finance for Manitoba said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would respectfully suggest that the removal of the 
ceiling—especially for 2000/01—does not appear to be an issue 
of affordability for your government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, your Department issued a press release, which stated 
that the federal government would have a surplus in 2000/01 of at 
least $10 billion.  The revenue revisions that would result in 
the ceiling being triggered would almost certainly imply that 
federal revenue is substantially higher than your current 
official projections.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case has been made by provincial governments for fiscal 
affordability in terms of lifting the ceiling on equalization. 
The case has been made by provinces like Manitoba about the very 
serious impact that would occur if the government does not act. 
The fact that the government of Manitoba, like other have not 
provinces, would see a tremendous hardship in meeting its needs 
without a lift on the equalization ceiling should be enough for 
the government to act.  That is the only reasonable approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that if the parliamentary secretary has not 
thoroughly read this correspondence from Manitoba he will do so 
and give us his comments and his feedback. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the 
comments by the member for Winnipeg North Centre.  In looking at 
the federal transfers to Manitoba, a one year removal of the 
ceiling on equalization payments was agreed to at the first 
ministers' conference.  Because of the pressures on equalization 
payments, the Prime Minister agreed to lift the ceiling for the 
year 2000.  After that, it would be based on growth in GDP year 
by year.  It will go back to the original year so we will not 
know what the equalization will be for another year or two once 
all the numbers are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By lifting the ceiling on equalization payments, Manitoba would 
receive a further $76 million, which would be the second highest 
increase in equalization payments to Manitoba.  In fact, if we 
look at total federal transfers to Manitoba for the year 2000-01 
it would be $2.3 billion.  That would account for approximately 
35% of Manitoba's estimated revenues.  Canadians are doing a 
pretty good job in terms of recognizing Manitoba's needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is quite right when she says that equalization is 
meant to ensure that there is equality in services and programs 
across Canada notwithstanding where one lives in Canada.  It is 
not an exact science but that is the intent.  When provinces have 
offshore revenues, the idea is to allow them to take advantage of 
some of those revenues but over time to bring them back to the 
intent of the equalization program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member knows about the impact on Manitoba as a 
result of lifting the ceiling and about how that is good news for 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we again see the 
failure of members of the Liberal government to recognize the 
kind of damage their policies have done to provinces like 
Manitoba over the last seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that there has been some reinjection of funds through 
cash transfers and equalization by lifting the ceiling for one 
year, but the amount that flows to a province like Manitoba and 
the benefit to less affluent provinces still falls short and 
hardly makes up for what was taken out of the system.  We are 
still dealing with an enormous shortfall and without the 
resources to counter the growing demand on the system and changes 
in the health and education fields that require a much more 
balanced and involved approach by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that finance officials from all provinces thought 
that lifting the freeze for one year would provide ample room to 
accommodate entitlements over the present renewal period. 
However, further work and recent estimates have proven these 
projections to be incorrect.  The current estimate of 
equalization entitlements for the 1999-2000 fiscal year, the very 
first year of the new arrangement, exceeds the ceiling by close 
to $800 million.

<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
Bill C-17, an act to amend the Budget Implementation Act, 1997 
and the Financial Administration Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have the 
opportunity to speak today at second reading of Bill C-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill amends the Budget Implementation Act, 1997, by 
providing funding increases for the Canada foundation for 
innovation.  It also contains amendments to the Financial 
Administration Act relating to the Canada Pension Plan Investment 
Board and the borrowing power of federal departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my remarks by discussing the additional funding for 
the Canada foundation for innovation.  I had planned to talk 
about the history of the Canada foundation for innovation but I 
think members in the House are familiar with the story.  With the 
bill, funding for the foundation will rise to $3.15 billion. 
That demonstrates the government's commitment to fostering a 
knowledge based economy and a climate of innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move to the specific measures of the bill which pertain 
to the CFI and I will explain the funding provisions in detail.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $500 million announced last October will be invested in two 
ways.  First, $400 million will allow the foundation to 
contribute to the operating costs of new awards.  Second, $100 
million will help support the participation of Canadian 
researchers in leading edge international research projects and 
facilities that offer significant research benefits to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent announcement of an additional $750 million for the 
CFI will build on that funding by providing additional stability 
to universities as they plan their future research priorities. At 
the time of the announcement the finance minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Giving the knowledge economy of the 21st century a preferred home 
in Canada will lead to higher incomes, better jobs and increased 
opportunities for all Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to establishing the Canada foundation for innovation 
with a series of funding initiatives that now total $3.15 billion 
the government has implemented other funding initiatives for 
research over the past four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiatives include: one of the most generous R and D tax 
regimes in the world; increased funding to the granting councils, 
including the creation of the Canadian institutes for health 
research, to maximize the advantage Canada enjoys in medical 
research; funding of $900 million over five years for the Canada 
research chairs program which would establish 2,000 research 
chairs at Canadian universities; increased funding for the 
network of centres of excellence; funding of $300 million for 
Genome Canada; the sustainable development technology fund; and a 
Canadian foundation for climate and atmospheric sciences. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As announced in the Speech from the Throne in January, the 
government is committed to at least doubling its current federal 
investment in R and D by 2010. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne also specified that during its 
mandate the government intends to increase investment in granting 
councils, accelerate Canada's ability to commercialize research 
discoveries and turn them into new products and services, and 
pursue a global strategy for Canadian science and technology so 
that Canada can be at the forefront of collaborative 
international research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased funding for the Canada foundation for innovation, CFI, 
is not the only component of the bill.  Bill C-17 also contains 
amendments to the Financial Administration Act which I will now 
discuss briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should first explain that the financial administration of the 
Government of Canada, the establishment and maintenance of its 
accounts and the control of crown corporations all fall under the 
purview of the Financial Administration Act, the FAA. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Financial Administration Act sets out the 
statutory framework under which the government can borrow money. 
The Minister of Finance needs authorization from parliament 
through borrowing authority acts before the government can borrow 
new money.  Authority to refinance maturing debt is contained in 
the Financial Administration Act.  The finance minister is also 
responsible for debt management under the Financial 
Administration Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first FAA amendment in the bill concerns the Canada Pension 
Plan Investment Board.  When the Canadian Wheat Board Act was 
amended in 1998, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board was 
inadvertently deleted from subsection 85(1) of the Financial 
Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The error meant that legally the Canada Pension Plan Investment 
Board was subject to various crown corporation control provisions 
under the FAA which put it in conflict with its own mandate. 
Clearly that was not intended.  Bill C-17 rectifies the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will again be included 
in the list of crown corporations exempt from part X of the 
Financial Administration Act.  The change will be retroactive to 
December 1998 to ensure that the Canada Pension Plan Investment 
Board has always operated within the laws of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment reinforces the authority of parliament over 
any borrowing by or on behalf of the crown. 
It also strengthens the role of the Minister of Finance in 
ensuring the appropriate management of government indebtedness.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment provides for greater certainty that it is 
parliament that specifically authorizes borrowings made on behalf 
of Canada.  Bill C-17 ensures that all borrowings, not just money 
but instruments like capital leases, are covered under section 43 
of the Financial Administration Act and are subject to 
supervision by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I will summarize.  The amendments to the Financial 
Administration Act are designed to improve the operation of the 
act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to the Budget Implementation Act, 1997, to provide 
additional funding to the Canada Foundation for Innovation and 
extend its activities are consistent with the government's 
commitment to at least doubling its current investment in R and D 
by 2010. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada foundation for innovation is about looking forward. 
It is about education and investing in the future.  In other 
words, it is making a down payment today for a much greater 
reward tomorrow.  Let me quote the Minister of Finance when he 
spoke on October 18.  He stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—success in the new economy will not be determined by technology 
alone, but by creating an environment of excellence in which 
Canadians can take advantage of their talents, their skills and 
their ideas. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada foundation for innovation and its successes reflect 
the minister's sentiments.  The CFI deserves this increased 
funding so that it can continue to promote research in Canada and 
inspire young Canadian researchers, thus contributing to the 
environment of excellence. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that hon. members from all sides of this House 
will agree that investing in education, research and innovation 
is the most significant investment Canadians can make to foster 
future success. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the government is on the right track.  I encourage hon. 
members to give this legislation their full support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the official 
opposition in the debate on Bill C-17.  I thank the parliamentary 
secretary for mercifully abbreviating his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say at the outset that the bill, as the parliamentary 
secretary has indicated, deals with amendments to two statutes. 
One deals with funding for the Canada foundation for innovation 
and the other deals with amendments to the Financial 
Administration Act, the FAA.  Neither are related, but the 
government has decided to parcel them together in the one bill. 
Both elements of the bill are evidence of how the government 
approaches legislation in an inappropriate fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address the bill as it concerns the Canada foundation for 
innovation.  It proposes to give statutory authority to an 
announcement already made by the Minister of Industry to increase 
funding to the CFI by some $750 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think many of my colleagues will share this sentiment: I find 
it troublesome, to say the least, that parliament is constantly 
putting forth legislation to authorize spending that has already 
been announced as a fait accompli by the government, in this case 
by the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than coming before the House of Commons to seek the 
authority of parliament before making public and political 
commitments, the government ignores the ancient prerogatives of 
parliament and abuses its executive authority.  It makes 
announcements outside this place and then later comes along to 
say it needs parliament's approval.  After 900 years of 
parliamentary struggle to give representatives of the House of 
Commons the power to scrutinize, reject or authorize the spending 
plans of the crown, this is what we are facing. 
This is just part of an endless pattern of the centralization of 
power, the abuse of power and the contempt of parliament, not 
just by this Liberal government, but its predecessor governments, 
that increasingly diminishes the prerogatives of this place to 
authorize spending.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government might say that it knows for sure that it will get 
these things passed anyway.  How does it know that?  The last 
vote which I was at in this place the government lost.  We cannot 
be certain that announcements made by the Minister of Industry 
will end up as authorized appropriations by this parliament. 
There is no certainty in that.  To assume otherwise is to 
exercise a great degree of arrogance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also I found it troublesome that the Minister of Industry, that 
very thoughtful, reflective gentleman and that great contributor 
to public policy debate in this country, announced this.  The 
Minister of Industry, that great friend of industry, through the 
Voisey's Bay debacle acted like the dictator of a banana republic 
by telling a private company that it could not, after having 
received all regulatory authorization, benefit from its private 
investment in a major capital investment in his own province.  It 
is an embarrassment that he is the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister stood up about a month ago and made this 
announcement of $750 million for the Canada foundation for 
innovation, he did so in a context that was completely without 
any reference in the federal so-called mini budget, the finance 
minister's political statement of last October and in lieu of a 
conventional spring budget.  He announced nearly $1 billion in 
new public spending without any broader fiscal context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find this troublesome.  The fact that he did so at the very 
end of the fiscal year, which ended this past week, is part of 
the pattern of spend it or lose budgeting, or March madness, of 
which this government is a brilliant practitioner.  Departments 
know if they do not fully exhaust money which is on the table or 
which is available in a given fiscal year, it will be returned 
and will not be available to them to spend in future years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government tells us that this $750 million, and I look 
forward to questioning representatives of the ministry at 
committee on this point, will be spent over the duration of 
something like 10 years.  I asked officials in a briefing whether 
the $750 million would be spent in 10 years.  They said “No, 
something like 10 years”.  What does that mean?  It is nearly a 
billion dollars of tax money and the government is not even sure 
over what duration this will be rolled out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is for sure.  The government wants to book it all in 
this current fiscal year as part of the well established 
practice, which has been much criticized by the auditor general, 
of trying to diminish the size of the surplus in any given fiscal 
year for political reasons.  Then the government can turn around 
and tell taxpayers that it is sorry it cannot afford to give more 
real, meaningful tax relief because the surpluses are just not 
big enough.  Year after year we hear this sad story, precisely 
because the surpluses have been overwhelmingly consumed by huge 
spending projects and the March madness represented by the 
announcement which found its way into the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major spending commitments ought to come before this place in a 
budget speech in parliament before they are announced by a 
hyperpolitical minister, like the minister responsible for 
industry.  They ought to be authorized by this place in the 
context of an overall, long term fiscal plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many private sector economists are agreeing with the official 
opposition in its assessment that the government's spending 
program is out of control. 
Its spending this year will be $35 billion higher than it was 
projected to be the year before last.  That is discretionary 
spending.  That does not include things like the increases for 
CHST.  Spending is out of control.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that Canada is headed into choppy economic waters. Growth 
projections for the current calendar year have been on average 
cut in half from where they were when the minister's political 
statement came out in October.  At that time he projected a 3.5% 
growth.  We are now looking at an estimated growth of something 
like 1.5% to 2% this year.  That will clearly have an impact on 
government revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many economists suggest that in the second quarter of the year, 
which we are now entering, there will actually be a flat, if not 
negative growth in Canada.  We have a dollar which is teetering 
on the brink of a near record historic low, having lost 25% of 
its value under the tenure of the government.  Our dollar is now 
declining against that famed currency, the Mexican peso.  The 
government's reaction is “don't worry, be happy” and that it 
does not need to bring forward a budget, as is the convention in 
the House, this spring or even next fall.  When the Prime 
Minister decides by fiat that he is going to deign to come before 
parliament with a budget he will do so and not before then, 
notwithstanding that the entire economic landscape has changed 
dramatically since this government's political statement in 
October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of coming before us with a framework to control spending 
in light of these new realities what does the government do?  It 
presents piecemeal major new spending programs which have not 
been accounted for in the overall fiscal framework and which have 
no recognition of the new economic circumstances in which we find 
ourselves, through the nearly $750 million proposed in the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we have great consternation about the manner in which this 
is handled, the amount of spending and the lack of a budgetary 
authority for it, the official opposition does in principle 
support the policy objectives of the Canada foundation for 
innovation. We believe that Canada needs to greater investment in 
both the public and private sectors in research and development, 
particularly with respect to hard applied sciences. We have long 
been an advocate of this kind of policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been widely remarked that Canada's expenditures and 
investments in research and development are significantly lower 
than the average in the OECD and the G-7.  This is something we 
need to correct.  Toward that end the Canadian Alliance policy 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will appoint a Senior Advisor on Technology with private 
sector technology experience to report directly to the Prime 
Minister.  We will bring the best ideas in business, government, 
and universities together to facilitate the transition to the new 
economy and position Canada as a global leader.  We will increase 
support to Canada's research granting councils and appoint a 
chief scientist of Canada to co-ordinate science activities in 
all government departments and ensure that science, not politics, 
prevails. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also committed further to that in our election platform an 
increase in funding for research and development to the various 
granting councils of some $500 million, an amount far exceeded by 
the bill before us today.  While we believe it is important that 
both the public and private sectors invest more in R and D, we 
think that must happen within the context of fiscal 
responsibility.  That means every dollar must be watched with 
great care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern that my colleague, the member for Calgary 
Southwest and critic for science and technology for the Alliance, 
raised was the manner in which these public moneys were allocated 
through granting councils, such as the CFI.  He interrogated the 
Minister of Industry on this point at the industry committee, 
that the government had no clear and impartial framework for 
granting moneys out of foundations such as the CFI.  Also, there 
was no clear certainty that grants would be done in a completely 
non-political way and strictly on their merits, as pointed out by 
the auditor general. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no proper reporting on the administration of the grants 
at research institutes and universities, nor does parliament get 
proper feed back on the results so we can see what bang taxpayers 
are getting for their buck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all things that need to be changed.  The government 
constantly comes before parliament or its committees with new 
ideas about spending on science, technology, research or 
development.  There is a proposal now for major new funding for 
astronomy.  There are various other projects on the table, all 
which have been dealt with in a piecemeal fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the official opposition, and I think my colleague from 
Calgary Southwest will later speak to in this bill, believe there 
is a need for a broader framework for funding of science, 
technology, research and development rather than the kind of 
political piecemeal approach which we have before us in this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn my attention to the second section of the bill with 
respect to the legislation affecting the Canada pension plan 
investment board and its adherence to the Financial 
Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it quite humorous because there are two things that 
happen in the bill.  First, clauses 4 and 5 of the bill clarify 
the borrowing authority that departments, crown corporations and 
agencies have.  They clarify what we all know ought to be the 
case, and thought was the case, that parliament delegates to the 
Minister of Finance the authority to borrow certain sums and he 
has the delegated authority to authorize or reject borrowing 
requests from various departments, agencies, boards and 
commissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It turns out that due to typical legislative errors on the part 
of the government, there are a couple of departments that are not 
covered by this convention, or legal tradition, of delegated 
borrowing authority.  The Department of National Defence, 
apparently, had obtained a legal opinion indicating that it had 
the power to borrow money on its own without any authorization 
from the Minister of Finance or authorization by parliament.  The 
legal officials in the defence department and the justice and 
finance departments had a great brouhaha over the past year about 
whether or not defence department bureaucrats could borrow money 
without proper legal authorization by this parliament and the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could we have let that situation get out of control?  It is 
quite conceivable that they could have gone out, done so and 
contravened a long standing convention of parliament, which is a 
restriction on the borrowing authority.  Because of the 
government's incompetence and oversights it has taken years to 
finally come forward with this amendment to tighten up and 
clarify the delegation of the borrowing authority saying that 
bureaucrats cannot charge money on the public credit card and 
tell taxpayers to “pick up the bill, see you later”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it could happen.  After this bill it will not be able to 
but this has stood for far too long without correction on the 
part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we get to my favourite section of the bill, clause 6.  It 
is really quite marvellous.  The government House leader is so 
proud of his legislative prowess.  The problem is that he so 
often brings bills before this place that are riddled with 
drafting errors.  I spoke about this in debate on Bill C-22.  We 
were making all sorts of corrections to legislation to correct 
mistakes made in drafting errors in bills brought before 
parliament by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  They're legislative improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  The House leader calls them legislative 
improvements.  Sometimes they are euphemistically referred to as 
housekeeping amendments.  It just sounds so pleasant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real ugly face of it is legislative incompetence on the part 
of the government.  The House leader is the first, whenever the 
opposition drags out debate on a bill as we occasionally do, to 
raise the alarm about the cost to parliament and the value of 
debating time in this place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We spend hours, days and weeks in every session debating bills 
such as this one, which are, in substance, corrections to 
legislative errors that the government made in the first place. 
If the government got these things right in the first place, we 
would not be spending scarce parliamentary time debating 
legislative errors such as those contained in Bill C-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes these errors are not just of a minor, technical or 
dilatory nature.  Sometimes they are very serious and grave 
mistakes.  The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is a good 
example.  In the immediate past parliament, the government 
introduced Bill C-2 in order to make some major changes to the 
Canada pension plan and to authorize and introduce the single 
largest tax increase in Canadian history.  My colleagues will 
recall that massive tax grab that will cost tens of billions of 
dollars.  They brought— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I did not want to interrupt my colleague on the other side, but I 
was just wondering about the relevance of what he is speaking 
about.  I have been listening very carefully and I thought we 
were debating Bill C-17, which has to do with the Canada 
foundation for innovation and the Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sure the hon. 
member for Calgary Southeast has listened to the comment and that 
he will tie his remarks to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am doing precisely that. 
This is an indication that the parliamentary secretary does not 
even know what is in his own bill.  I am talking about the Canada 
Pension Plan Investment Board, which is precisely what clause 6 
of the bill refers to.  No wonder the government makes 
legislative mistakes when the parliamentary secretary responsible 
for managing the debate on the bill does not even know what is in 
it.  We see this time and again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary wants to know what the relevance is. 
If he would listen maybe he would learn something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Bill C-2, members of the official opposition 
raised grievous concerns about the $120 billion in equity, which 
belonged to Canadian taxpayers, that was taken from them through 
the CPP payroll tax.  The amount will reach $120 billion in about 
the year 2015. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We raised grievous concerns about the potential for this or 
future governments to reach their politically motivated hands 
into that $120 billion pot of taxpayer money and to abuse the 
fund either by appointing patronage appointees to the Canada 
Pension Plan Investment Board or by directing its investment 
strategy by stripping cash out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government at the time said that we should not worry, that 
we should not be alarmist because there will be safeguards in 
place, that the bill will be exempted from the Financial 
Administration Act, and that the finance minister will not be 
able to muddy himself in the business of the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, lo and behold, what happens?  The parliamentary secretary 
tries to just skate over the issue very briefly hoping that no 
one would notice.  When it comes to complex and technical 
legislation we often do not have the time or expertise to 
understand it, but the parliamentary secretary said that clause 6 
in the bill would exempt the CPP Investment Board from part 10 of 
the Financial Administration Act, “to ensure retroactively that it 
always operates as it was intended.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  It means that there was a drafting error 
or a legislative mistake.  I do not know if it was a mistake or 
if it was deliberate, but today the CPP Investment Board is 
covered under of part 10, subclause 85(1) of the Financial 
Administration Act, which means that the finance minister could 
today, through a ministerial order, strip cash out of the Canada 
pension plan fund.  He could hire or fire officers who are 
employees of the CPP Investment Board.  He could change their 
compensation.  He could reject their business plan. 
The minister has all sorts of financial powers to intervene in 
the operation of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.  This 
is precisely what we were concerned about when we debated Bill 
C-2.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the state of things today.  The Liberals now say that it 
was a mistake.  It has taken them four years to figure it out and 
finally correct it.  That is four years too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition will support the amendments.  However we will 
bring forward one of our own that is similar to an amendment that 
we introduced at report stage of Bill C-2.  The amendment would 
ensure that the operations of the Canada Pension Plan Investment 
Board are subject to scrutiny by the auditor general.  My 
colleague, the chair of the public accounts committee and our 
treasury board critic, will be bringing an amendment forward to 
that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of the government committing to spend 
money without proper parliamentary authorization.  It is doing 
this without a budget at a time when spending is growing far too 
quickly and when we are headed into choppy economic waters.  That 
is grounds enough upon which to oppose the bill.  The government 
is also seizing the parliamentary agenda to correct serious 
mistakes which it has made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be refreshing if the parliamentary secretary or his 
minister would stand in this place and take some responsibility 
for the mistakes which they and the department have made in 
allowing the minister to monkey around with the business of the 
CPP investment board, and in allowing bureaucrats and the defence 
department to borrow money without proper parliamentary 
authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is undermining the long and important tradition 
of ministerial accountability and responsibility.  It feels that 
it can make these kinds of serious mistakes with impunity.  The 
Canadian Alliance feels that it should be held accountable for 
these kinds of errors.  There should be some sort of 
accountability when time after time it seizes the parliamentary 
calendar to correct serious mistakes of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make one additional very amusing point regarding clause 6 
of the bill.  The parliamentary secretary said that the clause 
would retroactively ensure that the bill always operates as 
intended.  Is that not kind of Orwellian?  The government made a 
retroactive amendment in the bill.  George Orwell's <I>1984</I> 
talks about the ability of totalitarian governments to change 
history and facts that have already occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Kind of like a retroactive bill of sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Yes, it reminds me of that marvellous 
bill of sale in the Shawinigate affair.  The government says it 
would never have made the mistake that it is now seeking to 
address because the change is retroactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What complete and utter nonsense.  It is an insult to the 
legislative process to suggest that.  If the finance minister 
wanted, he could interfere inappropriately in the activities of 
the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board because of its 
non-exemption from the Financial Administration Act.  That would 
be completely within his legal purview.  Changing this 
retroactively will not remove the mistake the government made. 
Again we see retroactive changes in legislation that in principle 
are somewhat offensive. The notion that the government can 
retroactively change history is contrary to logic and common 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons the official opposition will oppose Bill 
C-17.  I look forward to the debate and hearing from my 
colleagues as they outline ways by which we could increase 
financial accountability on the part of the government and invest 
more in research and development, but do so in a context that is 
fiscally responsible and mindful of the choppy economic waters 
into which we are headed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, just to put 
everyone in context, today we are debating Bill C-17, an act to 
amend the Budget Implementation Act, 1997, and the Financial 
Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the result of several announcements made by the 
government regarding, among others, the reinvestment of a further 
$750 million in the Canada foundation for innovation, in addition 
to the $500 million announced last October in the economic 
update. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their eagerness to go to the polls, the Liberals brought down 
a minibudget, which turned out to be the real budget. Since there 
is no budget this year, this is how they are putting money into 
the Canada foundation for innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk mostly about this part of the bill and support for 
research in general, and less about the other measures contained 
in this bill, which amends several other acts to correct 
mistakes, as mentioned earlier, or add things that were missing 
or corrections that had to be made to the Financial 
Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, after going through an era of major 
cutbacks—mainly in 1995, 1996 and 1997—has now started to 
reinvest in support for research. Granting councils and many 
other bodies were hit hard, and they had urgent needs. However, 
they had to wait and this had a negative impact on their ability 
to support research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, cash transfers were drastically cut. As we know, 
transfer payments to the provinces were used to fund three 
different programs for health, education and social assistance. 
They were cost shared programs. However, the money was earmarked 
and we knew how much of the transfer payments went to social 
assistance, health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not wanting to be blamed for making $1 billion cuts in health 
care, $1.5 billion cuts in education and $800 cuts in welfare, 
the federal government decided to roll these three programs into 
one, which it called the Canada health and social transfer. Then 
it reduced the funding under this new transfer, letting the 
provinces decide exactly where to cut in those three areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts were drastic. Transfer payments fell from about $17.5 
billion to $18 billion to a low of $11.5 billion, which meant the 
provinces had to make cuts in health care and post-secondary 
education. Of course the latter includes a research component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the government has the financial means to do something, 
its first tendency is not to increase transfer payments. 
It did increase them slightly but mainly for health care. 
Everybody agrees that health care is important but the 
government invested very little money in post-secondary 
education. This is due to the fact that it chose a more visible 
way of investing in that area, a way which could be effective to 
a certain extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not disputing this but the government made this choice 
not for the sake of effectiveness but rather because it wanted 
more visibility than it would have had by simply putting more 
money in transfer payments so the provinces, including Quebec, could 
support research initiatives based on their own 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about petty cash. We are talking about 
substantial amounts. Of course the granting councils have seen 
their budgets increase. I could name each of them individually 
but this is not what we want to do today. However, these 
councils' regular core budgets are being increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that the government wants to double the 
research effort by 2010. A timetable has been established and the 
reinvestments are major. There is therefore a reinvestment aspect 
in the granting councils.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>University research chairs have also been established. We are 
talking about several university chairs, with a lot of money. 
Funding for this program will be in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars over the next few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third component is the Canada foundation for innovation also 
mentioned in the bill. The foundation will receive $750 million 
more than originally planned. It has already received more than 
$3 billion or has assets of over $3 billion. This is a lot of 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on I will talk about some difficulties, some problems 
that are still unsolved. I will first talk about the first 
problem that we have with an organization such as the Canada 
foundation for innovation, without criticizing the people who 
work for the foundation. It is something governments tend to do, 
particularly the current government. The same thing happened with 
the millennium scholarship fund. The same is happening with the 
Canada foundation for innovation. The government is funding an 
external organization that does not have the same accountability 
toward parliament as the department itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members of the opposition, and it should be the same for 
the government members, it is a bit frustrating to see such huge 
amounts of money being given to people who are not directly 
accountable. Of course they are accountable to parliamentary 
committees but they do not have to justify their decisions here 
every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a minister is questioned on some contentious issue or a 
decision that is not in sync with the priorities of the 
government or of parliament, it is something that has to be dealt 
with outside the chamber. The minister says that it is an 
independent agency that carries out its duties as best it can and 
that the minister cannot always interfere in the operations of such 
agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things happen. Take, for instance, the Canada foundation for 
innovation. More so outside Quebec but even in several regions in 
Quebec, smaller universities are complaining because they do not 
have the same capacity as the bigger universities to get the 
funding and the projects they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a moral influence over the foundation. We can raise this 
problem and, in fact, we will do so tomorrow. The chair will be 
at the committee hearing and we will be able to consider the 
issue. Parliament put money into this foundation but not without 
adding some requirements as specific as the ones I just 
mentioned. That left us with no influence over these decisions 
and no influence over a minister who would have some say because 
the money would be spent by his department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corrective measures are way too slow and too complex and 
there is still the problem of accountability. We are talking 
about public funds. Taxpayer money is handed out to outsiders 
who have to abide by some rules, but are not subject to the same 
process as a minister who has to manage a department and account 
daily for his actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this principle is that good, we will end up—and the process 
is well underway—handing over all government operations to 
outside agencies. 
What role will be left for parliament to play? We cannot support 
this, whether it is a lofty cause or not. We cannot let the 
government send money to an outside agency saying “Now you can 
manage this money as you see fit. We trust you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have left unsaid is that appointing board members is a 
way for the government to keep some degree of control. However, 
this process involves a very small group of people. Very often it 
involves the Prime Minister, since appointments are made by his 
office, or the minister himself in the best case scenario. 
Whatever the case may be, it still creates a situation where the 
minister and the Prime Minister can influence the board of 
directors or the senior officers of an organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the foundation is sort of a more noble organization. 
The heads of the granting council are there to ensure a certain 
cohesion but the fact remains that it should not be 
independently managed. We have no problem with the department 
being accountable here. At any rate, when the time comes to make 
decisions of a more delicate nature, nobody can be sure that 
these people will have enough neutrality to resist pressure from 
those who appointed them. It is pressure at a very high level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pressure at another level, more appropriate pressure, namely 
pressure from the people and their elected representatives, is 
much more indirect and much more difficult to exert. That is the 
first problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the second problem, taking the case of Quebec, which is in 
the process of developing a science policy, it is hard to set 
oneself targets, objectives and a work plan when one has control 
over only part of the tools.  Obviously, there is also health 
research, but I will focus more on the education sector because 
this is generally where there is more investment in funding 
councils and the foundation.  The same logic could apply to 
health, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are matters that are essentially provincial but there is 
a significant portion still administered by Ottawa, or subject to 
made in Ottawa decisions or priorities, even if only on the 
amounts allocated.  After that, the areas of focus need to be 
defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the money is there, the complications of jurisdiction are 
not something that anyone needs.  The government has stupendous 
financial means and uses that financial clout to become the 
government that plans future priorities. For many 
Canadians, this is fine with them. 
As for us in Quebec, the principal government of the people is 
the government of Quebec.  While it does administer 
post-secondary education, it does not have all 
of the means to properly plan the development of its science 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adjustments do need to be made.  There is always some 
way of doing contortions in order to make ends meet.  Our system 
of universities is highly efficient and so is our research.  We 
have no complaints about the amount of funding our universities 
can manage to get together, for they are successful at getting 
the job done.  They are very good. 
However, it becomes difficult to be consistent in this kind of 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the two main problems: accountability and the 
increasing inability of the provinces to influence the framing of 
a real scientific policy because Ottawa is using its accumulated 
surpluses—which came from cuts in transfers, from the EI fund, 
and so on—to play a planning role and to impose its own vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt about that, as evidenced by the fact that the 
federal government is not reinvesting any significant amount of 
money in transfer payments for post-secondary education. It has 
reinvested some money in health care but very little in 
post-secondary education. New funding in this area is 
administered by the federal government or by an agency appointed 
by it, that is closer to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot ignore one area of criticism that is beginning to 
emerge but it is constructive criticism. Now that we have said 
that we would prefer this not be an independent organization, the 
ideal situation would be to put the money back into transfer 
payments to the provinces so they can do that themselves, we know 
it will be very difficult to convince Liberal members to support 
us in that regard. The day will come when people will be able to 
settle this debate or to put more pressure so we can at least be 
more consistent in our actions, instead of having two governments 
acting separately. This will not always lead to bad results but 
very often it makes things more difficult. A lot of time is 
wasted in co-ordination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the government must realize is that with all 
these investments in research chairs, the Canada foundation for 
innovation and granting councils, two very serious problems are 
emerging. Clearer directions will have to be given in the short 
term to correct a problem which, if we wait too long, will become 
even more serious and create a lot of difficulties, especially 
for small universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear. There are not many big universities in Canada. 
The vast majorities of our universities are small. In Quebec, for 
example, the Université du Québec network is considered to be a 
small university by Canadian standards. We have the Université 
de Montréal, McGill University and maybe the Université Laval 
that might be called big universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite often smaller universities cannot rely on private 
foundations, unlike McGill University in Quebec, or on bequests 
left to them by some rich donors. Without such financial 
assistance, they have a hard time covering the indirect cost of 
the projects. The bigger universities have the same problem but 
at least they have more leeway than the smaller ones. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT72"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT72"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1655

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since smaller universities do not have their own source revenues 
and cannot cut their education budget, because they do have 
classes to give and not only research to carry out—when they ask 
granting councils for a subsidy, indirect costs are incurred. 
From what people in the know tell me, on average, for every 
project, we have to add 40% for indirect costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial programs in Quebec, for instance, pay for about a 
third of these indirect costs and the rest of the money has to 
come from elsewhere, by cutting something or making hard choices. 
Trying to get the money needed to do research can often 
penalize universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This applies to both the bigger universities and the smaller ones. I 
believe things are tougher for smaller universities because they 
have fewer tools and fewer choices when cuts have to be made and 
priorities need to be set. If we do not react quickly, the gap 
between the bigger universities and the smaller ones will only 
widen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other problem faced by smaller universities is that project 
approval is based on peer review, which is carried out by a 
network of peers, and they do not feel like they are really a 
part of the network. 
When these tools were brought in, they were not as ready as the 
big universities, which already had their waiting lists, their 
contact networks and so on, as well as a much stronger lobbying 
capacity. They feel they are at a disadvantage because of the 
initial commitments that were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is even more true in other provinces where small 
universities have their own specialized areas. Some of them were 
successful in the first phases. We will have to remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the chairs and all those tools, if we do not pay special 
attention to our small universities, they will have difficulty 
retaining their good researchers when the big universities or 
foreign universities from the States or elsewhere come to 
raid our researchers. This is an emerging problem that could 
become very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody recognizes that we have to make efforts to keep our 
researchers in the country and to make sure that our best minds 
are not exported but if this is true for Canada as a whole, it 
is also true for the small communities and for the small 
universities. I certainly hope the government will soon find 
ways to solve the problems of small universities as compared to 
bigger universities and of indirect research costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the best solution be to tell the provincial governments 
“Listen, we know that you already have formulas to compute 
payments. We will put money back into transfer payments so that 
you can better support indirect costs”? It would be one 
solution. There could also be automatic amounts. 
When the granting councils provide funding, they could 
immediately include with it an envelope to help with indirect 
costs, as do American granting councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one problem.  There is a link missing in the whole 
research incentive operation.  Considerable efforts are being 
made, admittedly, to increase research capacity. There is also a 
message that needs to be sent to the private sector. 
As elected officials, we have a duty and a responsibility to get 
that message across.  Research efforts in any country must not 
be the sole responsibility of the government.  The government 
must do its part but there is something a little disturbing in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the case of Quebec.  We have very good tax credits 
and many tools. The private sector has also come up with some of 
its own, although not as many as comparable countries. 
A way must be found to stimulate the spending culture, or 
investment in research, within private enterprises, because 
their ability to be competitive depends on it.  It is not always 
solely the government's responsibility.  Yes, the government 
must do its part. It must increase its contribution but private 
enterprise must not shirk its duty to conduct research and 
always look to the government for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will always have much of a monopoly on 
certain very specialized fields, even if there are economic 
spinoffs.  This is clear because there are fewer private 
enterprises, or because their size does not allow them to 
conduct certain more fundamental research activities.  Here 
again there must be a more direct dialogue with the private 
sector to ask it why it is not doing more research than it is at 
the present time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private enterprise is doing more, or trying to do more, but 
there is room for more to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My other colleagues would perhaps like to address certain other 
aspects of the bill with which I am less familiar.  I am more 
familiar with the Canadian foundation for innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not be voting in favour of the bill for the reasons I 
have given.  First, because allocating money to outside 
organizations puts them somewhat beyond the control of 
parliament, if not considerably beyond its control.  Second, it 
is odious and has potential for considerable inconsistency for 
governments to be competing in the area of public support of 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot speak for all the provinces but I can speak of Quebec, 
with which I am familiar.  Quebec has a science policy.  Ottawa 
has and spends a lot of money.  One does not get the impression 
that all this spending is necessarily aimed at efficiency alone. 
There is always a kind of war of visibility being waged by Ottawa 
and no one finds this healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can fault reinvestment in research.  That is something on 
which we will all agree.  However, the primary motivation must be 
efficiency and nothing else.  I have some doubts on the 
government's motivations in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced 
that within these organizations, even within the government 
itself, there are some people whose main concern is efficiency, I 
am convinced that when the powers that be allocate money, the 
notion of visibility is foremost in their mind. 
It has been the case with every decision since 1995, by this government, 
which is slightly paranoid, 
thinking that people supported the yes side for this 
reason, because they had not noticed how effective the government 
was or because they had seen it as less effective than it really 
was. This is something we will debate again when the time comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the bill before us today, we will be voting 
against it for the reasons I mentioned earlier. I urge the 
government to pay attention to the problems emerging between 
small and big universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small universities want to expand. They want to retain their 
scientists but indirect costs and possible raiding from other 
universities are a problem. And of course there is raiding from 
foreign universities, but we have no control over that. I am 
thinking about raiding on the part of our major universities if 
they are able to raise money faster than our smaller 
universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very real problem for smaller universities. The 
university in Rouyn-Noranda is very effective, one of the most 
effective in Quebec in terms of getting funding for research. I 
know other universities are effective as well; also partnerships 
are formed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something positive in all this funding issue, namely 
networks are being created more than ever before. Universities 
are forming partnerships and I am convinced they are possible in 
many areas, to find a niche. Universities are faced with similar 
situations. They can establish partnerships but they need the 
resources to do it and right now they do not have enough to pay 
indirect costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the message I wanted to send. Tomorrow, we will have the 
opportunity to repeat our message to the chair of the Canada 
foundation for innovation, who will be appearing before the 
committee, but for the time being we are saying to all the 
members of the House and to the government that we want more 
consistency. We also want smaller universities to have the same 
ability to grow as the bigger ones.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say a few words in the debate on the 
bill before the House today.  In a way it is an omnibus bill and 
it deals with a couple of radically different items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is the appropriation of considerable sums of money 
to the Canada foundation for innovation.  In fact we would 
appropriate, if this bill passes in the House of Commons, $1.25 
billion to that particular foundation.  The other item deals with 
a small but important change to the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice a greater propensity now on the part of the government 
to introduce omnibus bills and I think it is wrong in principle. 
We are dealing with two fundamentally different items here, and 
it would be easier to vote intelligently on a bill like this if 
these items were separate.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just come through that with Bill C-8, the changes to the 
financial institutions legislation.  There were massive changes 
in the bill, which was 900 pages thick and amended 1,400 pages of 
statutes.  That makes it difficult for members of parliament to 
properly scrutinize bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, in terms of the Canada pension legislation 
change here I would like to say a few words about the Canada 
Pension Plan Investment Board.  They are important to put on the 
record.  The investment board is an innovation of the Government 
of Canada, whereby a small portion of CPP deductions from 
employers and employees will be or are invested privately in the 
stock market.  Overseeing that investment in the stock market and 
advising where to invest is of course the new investment board of 
the Canada pension plan.  The board has 12 directors.  If my 
memory serves me correctly there is one director per province, 
which makes nine, because the Quebec pension plan is a totally 
separate organization and institution, and three from the federal 
government.  The chair of the board is named from among those 12 
people.  The Minister of Finance will seek advice from each of 
the provincial ministers of finance and then appoint the 12 
members of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is missing here is a small move to democratize the board. 
The Canada pension plan is a plan which has ordinary Canadian 
workers' money in it, so I think that on the board there should 
be representatives of the working people themselves, from trade 
unions, from retirees, who can provide valuable advice regarding 
the investments of the board.  When we are looking at the 
investment of workers' money this should be one of the amendments 
the government should accept, that is, to have on the board 
people who represent the workers and the trade unions themselves. 
That is only fair in terms of dealing with the workers' money. 
There should be representatives of the workers on the board. That 
is a fundamental principle of democracy and it is important in 
order to democratize that particular institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the Canada foundation for innovation, I think all 
parties in the House are in support of the concept or the 
principle that we need more money for research and development. 
If we look at the history of our country, we will see that we are 
one of the few industrialized countries in the world that does 
not put much of our GDP into research and development.  We have a 
very small proportion of our GDP in research and development 
compared to the United States, Germany, France or many countries 
in western Europe.  We have to move more in that direction in 
terms of money going into R and D.  This is a bill that is going 
in the right direction in those terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada foundation for innovation became law in the 35th 
parliament, which is two parliaments ago.  If memory serves me 
correctly it became law in April 1997.  I had a chance today to 
take a look at some of the expenditures of the foundation.  I 
must add that this is not a foundation that utilizes only public 
money.  There is also money from the private sector.  I assume 
the universities and provinces all participate in the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to read into the record the 
kinds of projects the foundation is supporting.  Up to March 31 
of this year, 1,175 projects had been funded, for a total of $873 
million.  That is a considerable amount of money going into 
research and development, technology, research centres and so on, 
which I believe is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will round off these figures to the nearest million.  In 
British Columbia, 134 projects were approved for $110 million. 
That represents about 14.2% of the total amount spent by the 
foundation.  In Alberta, there have been 112 projects for $58.7 
million, representing about 7.6% of the funding from the Canada 
foundation for innovation.  In my province of Saskatchewan, there 
were 28 different projects for $20.4 million, which is around 
2.6% of the total.  In Manitoba, there were 57 projects for $16.3 
million or 2.1% of the total. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, western Canada has received about 26.5% of the total 
amount being funded by the Canada innovation centre.  That is 
roughly in accordance with our population, which I guess should 
be one of the criteria. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario had 434 projects and $311.7 million for some 40.2% of 
the funding.  The province of Quebec has had 315 projects and 
$230.7 million for 29.7% of the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Brunswick has had 26 projects and $5.2 million or 0.6% of 
the funding.  Nova Scotia has had 47 projects for $15.8 million 
or 2% of the funding.  Prince Edward Island has had two projects 
for $730,000, which is .09% or one one-hundredth, roughly, of the 
funding.  Newfoundland has had 17 projects for $6 million, which 
is 0.7% of the funding.  The total in Atlantic Canada is about 
3.7% of the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a bit of an update as to where the money has gone.  It 
is fairly evenly distributed across the country with the 
exception of Atlantic Canada, which seems to be receiving less 
than its fair share if we divide on a population basis the funds 
from this particular program.  The program of course is ongoing 
and I assume that these figures and balances would change over 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a worthwhile project.  A lot of money has gone 
into it.  I think members of the House would support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would want, of course, to have time to scrutinize some of 
these projects to see what their value is and whether the 
taxpayers are getting the bang for the buck, so to speak, from 
the hundreds of millions of dollars we are investing.  That 
should be looked at by a parliamentary committee.  It might be 
one of the projects the committee could undertake in the months 
and years that lie ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the Canada pension board, we should look at 
democratizing the board and bringing in some representatives who 
are working people to contribute to the agency.  There should be 
representatives from the trade unions of the country.  Perhaps 
there should be a representative of retirees on the board, who 
can offer advice from a retiree's point of view.  In other words, 
the board must be democratized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the composition of the board now and at the 12 
members on that board, we see that almost all of them come from 
business backgrounds and would be acceptable to the business 
community or to the business half of that equation of who pays 
into the CPP legislation in the country.  However, there are 
really very few who have a background that might be more relevant 
to the ordinary working people or trade unions or retirees across 
Canada.  Let us make that change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the foundation, I think this is a step in the right 
direction.  It should improve our country's investment in 
research and development.  The relevant committee of the House of 
Commons should look at some of these projects to make sure due 
diligence is done.  After due diligence is done, the committee 
should determine whether or not we are getting the impact in 
terms of R and D, learning and innovation, jobs and skills, and 
added value to the Canadian economy that is the vision behind the 
bill before the House today and that was the vision of the bill 
in April 1997. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest, but to only part of the hon. 
member's speech, I regret to say, because I was called away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member discussed the Canada foundation for innovation 
and its allocations and also, perhaps, the research chairs and 
the research funding now tied to them.  It is very interesting 
that not only is the federal government providing, as it were, 
the salaries and that kind of thing for 2,000 researchers and 
professors across the whole country, but it is also providing 
research money to get them started, which I think is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have the same concern as my colleague from the NDP who 
was just speaking.  I am concerned about the way in which a 
program like this—and I will come to the CFI in a moment—is 
impacting some regions and also some of the smaller institutions. 
I was very pleased when research moneys were attached to the 
chairs themselves, because very often a small institution 
receiving one or two or three of these chairs would find itself 
faced with additional expenditures simply to take on an extra 
employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with regard to the Canada foundation for innovation, I 
would like to ask my colleague a question.  He is interested in 
the equity of the allocations.  So am I. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Canada foundation for innovation is to 
provide research infrastructure moneys not only to large research 
institutions but to many others.  There is one component of it 
which is quite different from the research chairs or the money 
coming from the research granting councils, that 10% which is 
available to community colleges across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something which is quite new.  Normally we think of a 
distinction between the colleges which are extremely important in 
rural areas and in smaller communities and the universities with 
respect to research.  I was pleased this time that particularly 
the applied research role, work which ranges from looking after 
senior citizens properly through to robotics, is being conducted 
in colleges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my colleague.  What are his thoughts about 
the fact that the Canada foundation for innovation for the first 
time reaches our community colleges and is encouraging the sort 
of applied research they do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer to that very 
difficult question is that I am certainly pleased part of the 
funding from the CFI is for community colleges.  I believe he 
said 10%.  I think that is the figure involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very important.  Many community colleges are in the 
smaller cities, the rural parts of the country.  My province of 
Saskatchewan has several community colleges.  Many are located in 
the smaller towns and smaller cities in particular that would not 
have access to this kind of funding unless it were built into the 
act itself.  I certainly agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems in our modern society is that there has been 
too much of a shift into bigger centres.  I am not talking about 
our country only, but in terms of the modern world where bigger 
is better.  The big institutions are there and one has to always 
go to the bigger cities to get better jobs and to have better 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the new technology today it does not really matter where 
many of the plants and industries are established.  With the 
Internet and technology, it can be done in a small town, in a 
rural area, in a big city or in a medium size city.  They have 
access to the same technology.  This reflects the reality that we 
have perhaps gone too far the other way in terms of all the money 
going into larger centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason I put those figures on the record in terms of the 
province by province breakdown was not to criticize the CFI by 
saying that there has been too much into certain regions and 
areas, but to put on the record that we as parliamentarians 
should be watching where the grants go.  I should also like to 
see a rural-urban breakdown, not just a province by province 
breakdown.  I should like to see how much of it goes into 
communities that have fewer than 50,000 people or fewer than 
10,000 people, compared to the 8 or 10 big cities in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a legitimate role for parliament to make sure we watch 
where the funds go and to make sure there is some kind of a 
balance in terms of the overall vision of the country, which is 
to provide equal access to opportunity.  Whether someone lives in 
a place like Peterborough, Montreal, Vancouver, Kamsack, 
Saskatchewan, Pembroke or wherever, everyone needs to have equal 
opportunities within reason.  I think that is one thing we should 
be watching as a parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again perhaps the relevant committee of the House should 
take a look at these projects and do a study to see whether or 
not the money is going where the drafters of the legislation two 
parliaments ago intended it to go. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Thibault (Minister of State (Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite 
pertinent that the hon. member points out the distribution of the 
funds and the number of programs that were given in parts of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize, as he does, that the Atlantic participation has 
been underrepresented.  It has been a little bit less than its 
population base would indicate.  I let the member know that it is 
not lost on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Prime Minister announced last year the Atlantic 
investment partnership.  Part of that is a $300 million program 
for innovation to help with some capacity building in Atlantic 
Canada so that our research institutes and our private sector are 
able to benefit or participate equally in the country or within 
programs like CFI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments the hon. member made about Canada's role in the 
past and in the future on research and development are quite 
pertinent.  If we want to fully participate in the new economy, I 
believe it is incumbent upon all of us to do our very best to 
make sure that our institutions and our country in general is 
taking full advantage of the opportunities out there, and 
research and development is how we will get there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe one of the reasons 
our standard of living in general has fallen in the last decade 
or so is that we have spent far too little in terms of research 
and scientific development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have fallen behind in many different areas.  There are things 
we could have done better, things we would be natural at doing 
better.  I am thinking of the whole agricultural sector because 
we are a great food producing nation.  I am thinking of 
transportation and communications because of our geography.  I am 
thinking of the mining resource industries because of all our 
resources.  Maybe if we had spent more in the last 30 or 40 years 
in terms of R and D, it would have been of benefit to the country 
in terms of a better standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of direction we should be going.  Again, let us 
keep an eye on it so that we have a balance between rural and 
urban Canada in different regions of the country.  Then everyone 
would be a part of the new and innovative society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak to Bill C-17 amendments 
to the Budget Implementation Act, 1997.  The absurd nature of 
being in this place in the year 2001 debating retroactive changes 
to the budget of 1997 is self-evident.  In any case, I will focus 
most of my comments on the Canadian foundation for innovation 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has consistently, particularly beginning in 
1994-95, slashed transfers to the provinces to such an extent 
that it created a tremendous vacuum in funding for universities 
throughout the country.  The provinces were simply not able to 
maintain adequate funding to our post-secondary universities and 
community colleges across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the deficit that existed in the funding of 
post-secondary education we saw, for instance, the doubling of 
the average amount of student debt after a four year program in 
Canada.  We saw tuition doubling not just in one province but 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian foundation for innovation was introduced in 1977. 
The government has tried to make up with its federal granting 
programs some of the ground it eroded from beneath the provinces 
in the disabling effect of federal cuts to the transfers to the 
provinces, which created in many ways havoc across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is still my belief that in terms of education and health care 
spending the best decisions are typically made by the government 
closest to the people affected by those decisions.  As such, 
provinces are in many ways much better suited to make long term 
and visionary decisions on behalf of the people they represent 
than the federal government, particularly in the areas of 
education and health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government has cut and slashed transfers to the 
provinces, which are in many ways the most appropriate vehicle 
for delivery of funding to our post-secondary education 
infrastructure, it has now tried through the foundation for 
innovation to make up for lost ground and to try to directly fund 
infrastructure investment focused on the areas of research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of government helping in investing in the research 
infrastructure that is so important for Canada's competitiveness 
in the new economy is not a bad one.  I would argue that the 
investment being made by federal or provincial governments, 
preferably by provincial governments, is extremely important. 
There are some flaws, however, in the Canadian foundation for 
innovation model as applied over the last three years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One benefit in a perverse way of debating amendments to the 
Budget Implementation Act, 1997, in the year 2000 is that we 
actually have the opportunity to be talking about some of the 
devils in the detail or the flaws in the implementation that are 
now more self-evident than they would have been in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a realistic and applied sense, and not simply as a perceived 
issue, there is an anti-small university bias in the Canada 
foundation for innovation granting scheme.  As a result smaller 
universities do not have the same level of access to these grants 
as some of the larger universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unfortunate because one of the cornerstones of Canadian 
post-secondary education infrastructure is the network of 
undergraduate program universities which perform a very important 
service to the future of Canada by providing a steady stream of 
enthusiastic graduates in science programs that may perhaps have 
graduated with a decision to pursue graduate or post-graduate 
studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that way the undergraduate programs are performing a very 
important service to post-graduate institutions by providing an 
ongoing stream of students and young people with the enthusiasm 
to pursue post-graduate studies in many of those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representing a riding in Nova Scotia, and Nova Scotia being the 
cradle of higher education in Canada, there is a strong tradition 
in our province of providing some of the best post-secondary 
university experiences in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some challenges.  In my riding of Kings—Hants I am 
very proud to have Acadia University.  Acadia University, like 
many of Canada's smaller universities, simply does not have the 
same access to the Canada foundation for innovation funding as 
some of the larger universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the arguments about a need to create levels of 
critical mass when it comes to research.  Some of them are 
anachronistic.  Critical mass can exist through a less parochial 
approach to research.  Universities can co-operate to a greater 
extent and we should be working to encourage that.  Certainly 
with the death of distance as a determinant in the cost of 
telecommunications, researchers can be connected via technology 
and do not necessarily have to be in the same classroom or the 
same lab, discussing and sharing their ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be ensuring that the parochial approach to research 
which has existed in the past in the university environment is 
reduced somehow by working with the provinces to ensure and 
encourage a greater level of sharing of intellectual property 
between universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a country we need to develop a better approach to 
commercialization of intellectual property at the university 
level and to technology transfer.  In many ways American 
universities are much more successful at commercialization and 
tech transfer than we are in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we try to achieve those two goals in that environment we 
should ensure that granting programs like the Canada foundation 
for innovation reflect the realities of the diversity of Canada's 
post-secondary university infrastructure and do not focus purely 
on some of the larger universities.  It should try to address and 
invest in some of the smaller universities which are providing 
such an important contribution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue deals with matching funds.  I believe 60% of the 
funds need to be matching funds.  In provinces like Alberta or 
Ontario where there is a stronger fiscal position than there is 
in a province like Nova Scotia or Newfoundland, there is an 
inability on the part of the provinces to participate to the 
extent of the requirements of post-secondary institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matching fund issue is very serious and needs to be 
addressed more thoroughly.  We would create a ghettoized 
post-secondary education granting system if we only contributed 
through matching fund schemes to universities in those provinces 
where the fiscal conditions permit an equal or greater investment 
by provinces and other entities within those provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a problem in the past where not enough foundation 
for innovation grants were making their way to Atlantic Canada. 
The government tried to address it last summer with the Atlantic 
innovation fund.  That program was announced in the summer in a 
pre-election Hollywood-style announcement to try to enrapture 
Atlantic Canadians with the generosity and general kindness of 
the Liberal government.  It did not work because most Atlantic 
Canadians saw through this shallow and feeble attempt to make up 
for past wrongs by a Liberal government that only found Atlantic 
Canada a few weeks before an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic innovation fund has not even congealed to an extent 
that it can deliver any funding.  Months later that fund, with 
its pot of money, is still sitting somewhere in Atlantic Canada 
with no notion as to how to deliver the money to the 
universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really bizarre is that while the government 
dilly-dallies and dithers with that fund to come up with a 
delivery mechanism with which to deliver the funding, the 
Canadian foundation for innovation is still in a position where 
it is providing money.  Over the last several months it has 
provided an even more disproportionate level of funding to other 
parts of the country.  Atlantic Canada is actually getting less 
because the notion is that the problem is solved, the Atlantic 
innovation fund is in place and the Canadian foundation for 
innovation does not have to be as vigilant now in Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is simply not the case at all.  There are also some 
concerns with ACOA acting in a role of a delivery vehicle for 
that funding.  Concerns have been raised by people in the 
post-secondary environment and in the technology and high tech 
sectors.  People in the economic development areas of Atlantic 
Canada have approached me directly to talk about this.  They fear 
there is not enough understanding of technology in ACOA.  They 
feel that ACOA can be an effective vehicle through which to 
develop a delivery mechanism for the Atlantic innovation fund but 
that it may not have the level of technical expertise necessary 
to develop a delivery mechanism for the Atlantic innovation fund. 
It therefore may not be able to achieve the ends that the 
government would like to see.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that if we are to be successful investment needs to 
take place in our post-secondary infrastructure.  The devil is in 
the details.  How are we to find the most appropriate way to 
ensure that the needs are met and that our competitiveness in 
this regard has improved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a $3 billion deficit not just in research 
infrastructure but in general university infrastructure.  It is a 
result of deferred maintenance among other issues and the 
government's callous disregard for education and health care 
funding.  It let health care and education atrophy as it took its 
slash and burn approach to fiscal management and offloaded 
responsibilities to the provinces without considering what the 
end result would be.  We will see a significant price paid over 
the long term for the loss in future competitiveness in these 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the fundamental flaws that needs to be addressed by the 
Canadian foundation for innovation would be the anti-small 
university bias which denies some of Canada's greatest 
educational facilities like Acadia University full and unfettered 
access to important funding opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matching fund provision also needs to be addressed.  It too 
discriminates against universities which happen to be in 
provinces that are less fiscally sound on a current basis.  As a 
representative from Nova Scotia, the cradle of higher education 
in Canada, it is incumbent on me to defend the interests of my 
province in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the macro issues are not addressed in Bill C-17.  They 
deserve some level of debate and discussion when we are talking 
about amendments to the Budget Implementation Act, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at Canada over the last 30 years and some of the changes 
that have taken place in terms of its competitiveness relative to 
other countries, our investment in post-secondary education can 
play a role in reversing what has been a very negative trend, 
particularly in terms of our competitiveness with the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are other issues too.  In 1990 Canada had the 
fourth highest standard of living within the OECD.  By 1999 we 
sank to seventh place with countries like Japan, Norway and 
Denmark overtaking us.  In the last 15 years our real income per 
capita plummeted from 86% to 78% of the U.S. real income per 
capita.  Ireland soared from 47% to 76%.  Over a 10 year period 
Ireland increased its GDP per capita by 95%.  In that same period 
Canada increased its GDP per capita by 5%.  Our performance has 
been anemic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a cyclical decline in the Canadian dollar over the 
last 30 years.  This decline has become precipitous under the 
government.  Over nine years of the Mulroney government the 
dollar lost one penny relative to the U.S.  Since the Liberal 
government took power the dollar has declined by 12 cents.  In 
1990 as a Liberal leadership candidate the current finance 
minister said that if he were given the opportunity he would 
manage the dollar downward to about 78 cents.  He did really 
well.  He overshot his wildest expectations.  The dollar is down 
to 63 cents.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister says that is just fine, that low dollars are 
good for tourism.  The logical corollary of his argument is that 
if we reduce the dollar to zero we could be the greatest export 
nation in the world and be really successful.  We all know how 
absurd and perverse is that logic or lack thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things we have to do.  In terms of government spending 
Canada's GDP represents about 40%.  In the U.S it is 30%.  Thirty 
years ago it was about the same, 30%.  Our government's program 
spending has ballooned in Canada, but it has remained about the 
same in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to reduce taxes.  As a percentage of GDP, taxes in 
Canada are 10% higher than those in the U.S.  We have to reduce 
our debt.  I will propose one idea that over the next 30 years 
the government could address reversing some of these negative 
trends.  If we were to reduce our debt in real terms over the 
next 25 years and apply the interest saved to reducing taxes, our 
economy would grow significantly both in real terms and as a 
percentage of GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the types of forward thinking and visionary policy 
measures we do not expect from the members opposite but will see 
in the future under a different government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the higher education part of the member's remarks 
with great interest, but I lost interest toward the end when he 
moved away from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great sympathy with his comment about his province being 
the cradle of higher education, and conceivably even of education 
in Canada.  I understand exactly what he means.  The role of the 
tiny yet high quality universities in the maritimes has been 
extraordinary.  I am a great believer in cradle to grave 
education.  I would ask the member, although it is not my main 
question:  If he knows where the cradle of education is in 
Canada, in what region is the grave of education in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I understood what he meant I became less sympathetic when 
he was talking about the role of the government in higher 
education.  He did not mention the extraordinary increases in 
funding to granting councils, which provide money for research. 
For example, the old medical research council which funded most 
of the medical research has been changed.  Its name has changed 
but, more significant, its budget having been increased for a 
number of years was doubled last year.  The increases in the 
other councils were not that large but they were very large.  He 
also did not mention the millennium scholarships or the Canada 
foundation for innovation, which has helped Acadia and other 
institutions with brand new money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member opposite about a couple of things 
which help small universities.  One is the network of centres of 
excellence which has funded and refunded and is still being 
funded by the government for research across the country.  What 
would his comments be on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to hear his comments on the point I made to 
the previous speaker that the Canada foundation for innovation 
extended some research moneys to community colleges,  I know 
there are many of those in the maritime provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has an earned 
credibility on issues of higher education in this place.  He has 
defended the interests of higher education quite consistently, if 
sometimes wearing partisan rose coloured glasses.  He speaks from 
behind those specs today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to hear his empathy relative to the situation of 
smaller universities and those in Nova Scotia, specifically 
Acadia.  There is a real and not just perceived anti-smaller 
university bias with CFI.  I hope the hon. member's words of 
encouragement would indicate a pressure on that side of the House 
for changes in this regard with the CFI.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He and I differ on the effectiveness of the millennium 
scholarship programs.  Only 5% of students seeking higher 
education have benefited from those programs.  A more effective 
way to adequately fund higher education would be a full 
restoration of transfers to the provinces, transfers his 
government played a significant role in slashing and cutting in 
the mid-1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transfers will not reach 1995 levels until April 2002.  A full 
and immediate restoration of transfers to 1995 levels would make 
a big difference in terms of allowing provinces to fund 
universities and post-secondary education.  We often debate 
post-secondary education in this place but we do not talk about 
other areas of education.  In general we need to invest more in 
education.  The best way to do that is to restore transfers to 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest casualties of the health care crisis has been 
education.  The immediate focus has been on ameliorating the 
problems of the health care system because of the crisis mode it 
is in.  However there has been a neglect of education issues in a 
general sense which will cost us dearly in the future.  I am 
talking about primary and secondary education, not just 
post-secondary.  The greatest societal return on investment would 
be in preschool, head start, early intervention and some of those 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a general sense we agree that some of the issues relative to 
CFI as a delivery vehicle must be addressed.  However we may 
disagree as to the degree of culpability his government has had 
in creating a crisis in education through its Draconian cuts to 
transfers in the mid-1990s.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member spoke about our dollar being low. 
However I am sure he knows our dollar is doing very well, thank 
you very much, compared to all currencies for the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I was following the debate in the U.S. on softwood 
lumber.  A spokesman from the U.S. government complained that the 
Canadian dollar was very low and that exporters and manufacturers 
on the Canadian side were taking advantage of the low dollar and 
shipping goods to the U.S. at a cheaper price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member recognizes that.  I hope he would 
not ask the government to artificially increase the value of our 
dollar to compete with the American dollar.  I think he would 
agree that there is a benefit for our manufacturers and exporters 
when our currency is lower than that of the countries with which 
we compete, especially the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite 
right.  Our dollar is doing well compared to the ruble.  However 
there are other currencies that are probably equally important. 
Given that about 80% of our trade is with the U.S. and that we 
depend on American consumption and imports for our standard of 
living, the member would be better off to focus on how our dollar 
is doing relative to the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, under his government, the Liberal government, there 
has been a 12 cent drop in the dollar.  That precipitous drop has 
represented a significant drop in the standard of living of 
Canadians.  He was asking what we could do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he said that I probably would agree with him that a low 
dollar is good for exports.  I do not agree.  That is a very 
short term approach.  One cannot, in the long term, devalue one's 
wage and prosperity.  That is a very flawed economic argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian companies can do fairly well in exports in the short 
term.  They can do so, not by investing in productivity or taking 
steps to be more productive in the long term but by simply 
enjoying the benefits of a lower dollar in the short term.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In two ways the low dollar has a perverse and negative impact on 
Canadian productivity over the long term.  First, some of the 
productivity enhancement equipment, software or technology, comes 
from other countries, particularly the U.S.  Canadian companies 
will not invest in productivity enhancement if they do not need 
to, and certainly not if the cost is elevated by a sinking 
Canadian dollar and a commensurately valuable U.S. dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, because of the dollar Canadian companies do not need to 
make those kinds of investments.  In the short term it makes it a 
little easier but in the long term it can have a very negative 
impact, which is what we are seeing.  It becomes a 
self-fulfilling prophecy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the member to revisit that notion.  Upon further 
study he would see that we would be better off lowering debt and 
taxes, strengthening the dollar over the long term and not just 
blaming it on monetary policy.  There is a fiscal responsibility 
that we in this place should address over the long term.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
participate in the second reading debate on this bill.  I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for St. Albert, and I am 
sure the House will look forward to his comments as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17, an act to amend the Budget Implementation Act, 1997 
and the Financial Administration Act, has two components.  The 
first is to add additional funding of $750 million for the Canada 
foundation for innovation to the economic statement and budget 
update of October 18, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second component involves amending the Financial 
Administration Act to clarify that parliament must provide 
explicit authority for any voting by or on behalf of the crown. I 
will deal with that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn to the first part of the bill, the Budget 
Implementation Act.  The bill seeks to extend funding for the 
Canada foundation for innovation by $750 million to include 
operation and maintenance costs for research infrastructure. The 
bill also proposes to extend funding for the foundation to 
include the purchase access to international research facilities 
and research projects.  The new funding will be spent over an 
undefined period of 10 years or more but will be booked in the 
current fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation's purpose is to combine government and private 
sector funding to enhance education and research infrastructure 
at post-secondary education institutions and research hospitals. 
The government stated that the foundation would be funded by an 
upfront investment of $800 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 funding of the Canada foundation for innovation was 
included in the deficit as if it were a liability at that time, 
even though the foundation did not exist by the end of the year. 
The foundation did not exist but the $800 million funding was 
included as a liability.  This made the government depart from 
its own accounting policies, practices and principles for the 
third year in a row in contrast to the Public Sector Accounting 
and Auditing Board, PSAAB, guidelines.  The auditor general 
called it inappropriate accounting and a parliamentary oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation is not obliged to report the results it achieves 
with $800 million, and parliament may consequently have 
difficulty obtaining the information it needs on expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from the Canadian Alliance policy.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will bring the best ideas in business, government and 
universities together to facilitate the transition to the new 
economy and position Canada as a global leader. 
We will also increase support to Canada's research granting 
councils, and appoint a Chief Scientist of Canada to coordinate 
science activities in all government departments and ensure that 
science, not politics, prevails.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it very clear that the Canadian Alliance supports 
research and development.  We regret that the government has 
overseen and caused our economy to perform so poorly that it is 
now necessary for the federal government to step in and apply 
massive doses, hundreds of millions of dollars, to R and D. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector is not encouraged to do R and D by the 
government because taxes are high.  The government is not only 
arrogant but weak as well.  It lacks vision and we cannot trust 
it.  It is unclear what criteria the Liberals would use in 
granting decisions made by the foundation, which is to be 
administered by the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign, the Canadian Alliance proposed an 
additional $500 million in R and D funding.  We support increased 
funding for research and development.  While we support the 
objectives of the Canada foundation for innovation, technical 
innovation would be more likely to happen in an environment of 
lower taxes and less regulation rather than increased 
bureaucratic spending with ill-defined funding criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second component involves amending the Financial 
Administration Act to clarify that parliament must provide 
explicit authority for any borrowing on behalf of the crown.  The 
bill would also define regulations surrounding what is considered 
to be borrowing of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would require the Minister of Finance to authorize 
money borrowing transactions.  It would give the finance minister 
the power to authorize money borrowing transactions under any 
terms and conditions he considers appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill would amend an oversight in which the Canada 
Pension Plan Investment Board was removed from the list of crown 
corporations that are exempt from aspects of the Income Tax Act, 
reducing the possibility of ministerial intervention in the 
pension board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance policy on financial administration states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure transparency, accuracy, and confidence in the 
government's finances, we will authorize the Auditor General to 
examine all federal government documents, including those from 
government agencies and crown corporations.  The government will 
be required to report to the House within one year on how it has 
dealt with issues raised by the Auditor General.  We will apply 
generally accepted accounting principles to government finances. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will apply them not in the way that suits the government, but 
will use generally accepted accounting principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would correct a legislative error made two years ago 
which opened the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to 
interference by the finance minister in various areas such as 
cash stripping, appointments, and corporate business plan debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is again wasting parliamentary time with 
amendments to correct legislative mistakes it has made.  The 
other day I was debating Bill C-4 and was surprised that the 
government had to amend its own bill six times.  That is how 
poorly designed it was.  The government has to recognize that it 
must draft bills carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and again the official opposition finds that we are holding 
the flashlight for a weak Liberal government that lacks vision. 
The problem is that when the government passed the Canadian Wheat 
Board legislation, it took the CPP investment board out of the 
Financial Administration Act along with the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that rather than having excuses from the 
government, the minister responsible for legislation should be 
responsible for errors.  There should be no mistakes because the 
minister should be carefully scrutinizing the work the government 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we support the part of the legislation that 
corrects the government's mistake of two years ago.  We support 
putting a stop to the finance minister's ability to intervene in 
the affairs of the pension board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the government engage in cash stripping when it 
comes to the EI account.  It stripped $30 billion from that 
account.  We are pleased to put a stop to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to my colleague's remarks.  I was 
intrigued by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First we have to remember that the Canada foundation for 
innovation was not set up this year.  We are discussing 
additional funding for it.  It was set up three or more years 
ago.  It was conceived at a time when the economy was nothing 
like as robust as it is now, when there was an even more serious 
problem about research and development in Canada.  There was a 
serious brain drain.  We were losing some of our best 
researchers.  At the same time, Canadians who had gone overseas 
to be trained were simply not coming home and certainly foreign 
researchers were not considering coming to Canada to conduct 
their research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A survey showed that it had nothing to do with salaries, which 
people often quote.  It had to do with the fact the people here 
who were engaged in research projects either had old-fashioned 
laboratories or old-fashioned equipment or, in their relatively 
short productive research years, they simply did not have the 
research support they needed.  It was the same thing with people 
overseas.  People newly graduated from a foreign university could 
not come here and conduct their experiments because the 
infrastructure was simply not here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So with regard to the hon. member's remarks, the purpose was to 
provide research infrastructure very quickly to attract these 
people back here and, by the way, to keep our best people here. 
Since then that has happened, but there is one other thing he 
mentioned.  We have also changed the R and D tax environment 
because it was one of the factors the private sector kept telling 
us about.  We now have one of the best, if not the best, research 
and development tax structures.  The effects will be seen this 
year and in coming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We started the CFI and a whole raft of other investments, and we 
now have the best tax structure.  I wonder if the member could 
comment on those things in light of my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Peterborough for asking the question.  The hon. member says 
this foundation was set up a few years ago.  That is right.  It 
was set up in 1997, and even when it did not practically exist 
yet, the government had $800 million shown as a liability and 
charged to its accounts.  The auditor general was very critical 
about it, but that is another story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the serious brain drain problems then, 
but the brain drain problem still continues.  Most of the 
engineering graduates and doctors and nurses leave the country. 
Last year alone 6,000 doctors and 14,000 nurses left Canada.  The 
figures are very intriguing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the hon. member appreciates investing in 
research and development.  We support that intent as well.  It is 
a noble idea.  However, the hon. member's party came into power 
in 1993.  It took four years for it to realize this investment. 
It set up the foundation in 1997.  If his party was so 
interested, where was it for four years?  This is too little, too 
late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the hon. member to put pressure on the 
government to revisit its priorities.  It should set the right 
priorities and then allocate the money.  Rather than distributing 
some hypothetical or other grants and contributions or favouring 
its friends, it should invest the money where it would be more 
productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point the hon. member mentioned is tax structure.  He 
said the tax structure with respect to research and development 
in Canada is the best.  I doubt that.  Our taxes are so high with 
respect to G-7 and OPEC countries that we are lagging behind in 
using our taxation structure as a motivation for investors and as 
a motivation for R and D.  I think the hon. member should look 
into that again.  We are really lagging behind.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to recognize that the member for 
Peterborough on the government side acknowledged that there is a 
brain drain.  I am glad to see that the government side is 
finally recognizing there is a problem in the country called a 
brain drain and that we should do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government's answer is to throw more money at 
the problem.  I believe it will put in another $750 million for 
research and development.  It has already put in $500 million.  I 
am not sure if my figures are exactly correct, but the allocation 
is along those lines.  However, that is not for this year.  This 
is a “when it gets around to spending the money” type of 
allocation.  It may take the government 10 years to spend this 
money on research and development.  We are not going to see any 
great cash infusion into research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes back to 1997, which the member for Peterborough 
alluded to earlier.  The government set up the centre for 
innovation, put in $800 million cash and said “This is good 
stuff”.  It still has not spent that $800 million.  The taxpayer 
had to come up with a cheque, it went into a bank account, and 
there it sat.  I hope it was getting some interest along the way. 
It still has not been spent and we will now see the same thing 
all over again.  We will have to write a cheque for the better 
part of $1 billion.  It will sit in a bank earning interest 
rather than being put toward the research and development we so 
desperately need to maintain our competitiveness in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to the millennium scholarship fund that was created 
around the same time, with $2.5 billion to educate our young 
people in order to make sure we would be competitive in the 
world.  The money sat in a bank for over two years and just 
before the election the government got fed up and started 
spending it so that every student in the country was getting 
grants and student loans so he or she could go to university in 
the election year courtesy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an election ploy.  This is not good management.  This is 
not sound public policy.  This is an election ploy whereby the 
taxpayer will have to write the cheque now and the money will sit 
in a bank while we wait for the next election to come along.  The 
next thing the government will do is announce all kinds of 
research and development projects courtesy of money that has 
already been paid by taxpayers and the government will say how 
wonderful it is.  That is no way to run a country, no way at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing is that we do not even get to vote on this in 
parliament.  We get to vote on the bill, but this is statutory 
spending and we do not even get to vote that on an annual basis. 
If we could, we would say that we would vote for it in the year 
the government spends it, but as for this idea of putting it in 
the bank and keeping it there for 10 years or more, I do not 
agree with it at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part of the bill is the CPP investment board.  This 
just shows how sloppy the government is.  When it changed the 
Financial Administration Act recently, it dropped the fact that 
it had previously made the CPP investment board exempt from large 
chunks of the Financial Administration Act.  The Financial 
Administration Act is the organizational piece of legislation 
that details specifically what each department has to do, what 
each organization has to do, the hoops that have to be jumped 
through, the management of the money, the reporting to parliament 
and so on.  The government had a blanket exemption that the CPP 
investment board, which has $40 billion of Canadians' cash in it, 
does not report to parliament, and the government wants to keep 
it that way.  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the government not want the investment board to 
report to parliament, but it does not want the auditor general 
taking a look at it to see how things are.  That does not sound 
like good public policy to me, yet that is what the government 
wants to do. There is $40 billion of Canadians' money set aside 
for their pensions to ensure that they will have some kind of 
income when they retire and we have given it to a dozen or twenty 
people to play the stock market with, without review by 
parliament, without review by the auditor general, and we think 
this is good public policy?  I think not.  It cannot be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we want to exempt the largest fund in Canada from 
public reporting and public scrutiny, especially by our auditor 
general?  I just cannot understand why the government wants to be 
so secretive with Canadians' money.  I just cannot believe it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board says she will overhaul the 
human resources management of the public service, and we will get 
into all these kinds of things, but when it comes to managing 
Canadian taxpayers' money it is all done behind closed doors. The 
Minister of Finance wants to sit down and make all of these 
decisions on behalf of Canadians without telling them what is 
being done, without telling them how the fund is doing.  “We do 
not want to report to parliament”, the government says, which is 
getting to be a bit of a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, as you know, Mr. Speaker, I was up on a point of 
privilege, where the Chair of the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, who is an officer of parliament and reports to this 
House, had a report all over the media the day before it was 
tabled in the House of Commons.  That shows the disrespect that 
the government and the different organizations that report to the 
government have for this institution of parliament.  I say it is 
time that we brought back that respect and got their attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mind you, we got the government's attention last Thursday 
afternoon on the vote, Mr. Speaker.  Unfortunately it was not a 
big enough motion to really jerk the government's chain so that 
its members would realize that parliament does have powers and 
that we are the guardian on behalf of the Canadian taxpayer and 
the Canadian people to ensure that the government does things and 
does them right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case, why would the CPP investment board be 
exempted from reporting to us?  Why would it be exempted from the 
auditor general taking a look in to see how well the board is 
doing?  The expertise that exists in the office of the auditor 
general to perform management audits, value for money audits, is 
the best in the country.  Our auditor general, who just retired 
last Friday night, was recognized around the world as being a man 
of integrity and stature and one of the most competent people 
around in doing these types of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not want to hear about it.  The government 
does not want to hear about Shawinigan.  The government does not 
want to hear about the Grand-Mère golf course and hotel and the 
Auberge hotel.  The government does not want to hear about these 
things.  It says “don't worry, we're doing fine”.  Appearances 
would suggest otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we allow the government to build this wall around the 
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board so it can just say “don't 
worry, everything is fine” without a real third party analysis 
to say “yes, it is fine”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the previous speaker, talked about the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  For almost 50 years now it has been exempt from 
reporting to parliament and exempt from scrutiny by the auditor 
general.  We know how sorry a state the Canadian Wheat Board is 
in, how it has lost the confidence of the Canadian wheat 
producers, how it has seen its mandate as selling wheat to 
wherever it could find a market, to sell it on credit with the 
government picking up the tab, so if it was a bad loan we would 
end up giving it away.  We cannot get that information because it 
is protected and we do not need to know that.  We do not need to 
know how much wheat the Canadian Wheat Board has sold on credit 
for which it has never collected the debt.  We do not need to 
know how much these commissioners are making.  They make maybe a 
quarter of a million dollars a year or more, and what are they 
producing?  The government thinks Canadians should not ask these 
complex questions.  I say they should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board's mandate was basically to sell wheat. 
We now take wheat from the Canadian prairies, ship it to the 
states where they make pasta and ship it back to Canada where we 
buy it, because it was not in the board's mandate to create jobs 
on the prairies.  We allow the jobs to be created in the United 
States because it is easier to sell 100,000 tonnes or a million 
tonnes with one contract than have value added pasta 
manufacturers across the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see the same situation with the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board.  We already see it with the centre for 
innovation, where the stated facts from the government are quite 
different from the real facts when we get behind them.  That is 
why we oppose this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, while listening to the comments 
of the member just now, I noticed an inconsistency in the debate 
that emerged from the Alliance Party across the floor.  I was not 
totally surprised or shocked by that because it is quite 
commonplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I recall, earlier on in the debate the member's colleague, 
the finance critic, attacked the amendment that dealt with the 
amendments made to the Canadian Wheat Board Act in 1998, and 
the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board was deleted in error. 
The member for Calgary Southeast commented that because of that 
the government, through the finance minister, could have been 
involved in some decision making with respect to the investment 
board.  He went on in quite a diatribe about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument of the member for St. Albert went along quite a 
different track.  He asked why we would exempt the pension plan 
investment board from the Financial Administration Act.  It seems 
to me that the party is really inconsistent. Could the member for 
St. Albert would comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Absolutely, Mr. Speaker.  The 
Financial Administration Act is about an inch thick and has an 
awful lot of stuff in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill says that it wants to exempt itself from 
divisions I to IV of the Financial Administration Act, which is 
the bulk of the Financial Administration Act.  We are saying we 
have no problem with that, except we should leave in the 
small sections that say the auditor general can audit it and that 
it should report to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment says that sections 89 to 119, 127 to 130.2 and 153 
to 154 will not apply to the Canada Pension Plan Investment 
Board.  It is simple to say let us keep the good stuff and exempt 
it from the stuff that should not be there.  This is not rocket 
science. It is called good public policy.  Yet the government 
just wants to make a blanket policy and exempt it from 
everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Financial Administration Act is about an inch thick.  We are 
saying do not exempt it from everything.  Exempt it from the 
things that are appropriate and leave it responsible and 
accountable for the rest.  We thought that was simple stuff. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the 
member for St. Albert intently.  Does he mean to suggest or tell 
the general public that somehow this board will not be audited? 
He is leaving in everybody's mind that somehow it will not be 
audited.  I think what he is trying to say is that he wants the 
auditor general to audit the fund as opposed to an outside party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have been concerned about their investment funds for a 
long time and think that the Canadian pension plan has not been 
an appropriate vehicle to see their moneys grow.  The government 
put this legislation in place to segregate this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may well be a good number of people who can see why maybe 
they do not want politicians involved in the decision making that 
affects their retirement pension because they have had such a bad 
track record.  Is the member suggesting that the members of 
parliament should have some kind of judgmental authority over 
people's investment funds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is a chartered 
accountant.  He knows full well that when an auditor audits the 
financial statements he or she certifies that the financial 
statements are correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the auditor general has a far greater latitude value 
for money management auditing to ensure that Canadians are being 
well served.  It is not just the fact that somebody did not run 
off with the cash, it is the audit of the management of the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He raised another point.  We are not asking for politicians to 
get involved in the decision making.  We are asking for the fund 
to report to the House so that all Canadians know exactly what is 
going on with their pension plan.  Is that too much to ask?  I do 
not think so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know I only have a few minutes, but 
I will get right down to business.  Bill C-17 is about 
innovation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT89"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT89"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1820

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the government to allow innovation to start at home 
in this House.  I have been here for seven years and never have I 
been in an environment where we have seen the death of innovation 
like this.  Every member of parliament has had their rights to 
speak out freely destroyed and innovation has been choked off.  If 
MPs try to be innovative, they are forced to put their ideas 
through an interminable series of committees where their ideas 
are chewed up and destroyed.  At the end there is nothing more 
than pablum, gruel and useless stuff that does not challenge the 
status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The press cannot speak to MPs.  It is directed by parties as to 
who it can or cannot speak to.  The individual MP cannot be 
innovative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the public wants to know why their MPs are having a very 
difficult time being innovative and challenging the status 
quo, it is because they are not allowed to.  They are ostracized 
if they do.  We should be dealing with issues like reforming 
health care and saving pensions.  We should be putting forward 
new ideas to improve our environment.  We should be putting 
forward new ways to deal with federal-provincial issues, defence 
issues, our role in the world, innovation that prevents conflict, 
innovation that enables people to get jobs and innovative ways to 
reform our tax structure.  We should be dealing with large issues 
in the House.  That is a pox on all of us if we do not do these 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is about creating a Canada fund for 
innovation and spending $1.25 billion.  As my colleague from St. 
Albert mentioned very eloquently, why not allow the fund to be 
audited?  Why not allow the auditor general to look at it?  Why 
leave it up to the government?  We know that if governments were 
allowed to dispense funds through such a mechanism, those funds 
would not be spent wisely. This has to be done in a different 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a model to do that.  The government wisely created the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research which works well.  It is a 
public-private partnership.  It is at arm's length from the 
government.  It has and will be audited.  The institute provides 
public scrutiny for the disbursement of funds.  It is innovative. 
It allows dynamism and flexibility.  That is what this fund 
needs to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It not that we do not support the notion of being able to fund 
and give our Canadian researchers the ability to innovate, it is 
the manner in which this fund will be disbursed.  That is the 
problem.  It is a matter of accountability and transparency.  The 
government is sorely lacking in foresight if it thinks the public 
will watch $1.25 billion of its money be given away without 
having an opportunity to scrutinize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things we need to do to allow innovation. First, 
we must decrease the tax structure.  Second, why not put into the 
tax structure our ability to create foundations like the United 
States has done?  This will enable us to tap into a huge pool of 
funds that could be used and dispersed according to what the 
foundations wanted.  It will provide researchers and 
non-governmental and charitable organizations an enormous pool 
for innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should allow individuals to donate to non-governmental 
organizations and innovative groups that do research like the 
Canadian Juvenile Diabetes Association or the Heart and Stroke 
Foundation.  We should allow individuals the same tax write-off 
that another individual would receive if they donated to a 
political party.  What is the difference?  Why not allow a person 
who feels compelled to donate to the Canadian Cancer Society the 
ability to have the same tax write-off as somebody who donates to 
the Liberal Party or the Canadian Alliance?  This is simply an 
issue of fairness and equitableness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government has been removing funds from these 
organizations, why not allow the organizations to have the 
ability to provide for themselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not see any relevance in the member's remarks to the bill 
which is at hand.  I think  you should rule accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I would ask the hon. 
member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca to tie his comments to the 
bill that we are debating. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1825"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will spell it out for 
the hon. member.  It is called innovation.  How do we 
innovate? I am talking about new innovative ways the government should look 
at in terms of enabling this particular fund to be used wisely. I 
am tying my comments to those of my colleague for St. Albert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member has a strong desire to make sure that 
this fund will to be used wisely, not improperly.  What we are 
doing is saving the government's backside.  We are providing it a 
way to make sure that this money is spent wisely, with 
temperance, and usefully.  At the end of the day the money is not 
ours, it is that of the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to have innovation and spend the money wisely, 
it must be spent by those who will be innovating.  If we look 
into a crystal ball, we will have a enormous lack of individuals 
who have the ability to do the innovation.  There is a crisis and 
it will only worsen because of lack of professors and teachers in 
our research institutions.  Not only is there the brain drain but 
there is not enough money in the system right now to provide for 
these people.  Many of them are moving to other parts of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we rectify the problem?  The following can be done.  Let 
us get back to basics.  Let us make sure our children are taught 
properly and that they are taught the basics of arithmetic, 
reading, writing and other skills, such as computer skills.  We 
need national standards.  They are important if we are to measure 
our functioning and ability against those in other parts of the 
world.  We need to ensure that we invest in education so that 
professors can engage in the research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a serious crisis in our education system today.  We need 
to address this by working with the provincial ministers of 
education.  If we do not have the teachers for our youth, they 
will not be able to utilize this fund.  They will not be able to 
interact or be at the centre of excellence.  They will not be the 
producers of the cutting edge research, which is required if 
Canada is to be on the leading edge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of education has gone up so much.  For example in the 
field of medicine, I could not go to medical school today because 
the tuition fees are about $14,000 a year.  The professional 
faculties are becoming the purview of the rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my alma mater, the University of Toronto, the average family 
income is over $65,000 for those who are in medicine.  How can 
someone who makes $35,000 a year send their child to medical 
school?  They cannot do it.  As time passes our professional 
faculties and the students who attend will merely be children of 
the rich and privileged.  That is not what we want in Canada.  We 
want to make sure that everyone, regardless of socio-economic 
status, has an equal ability and opportunity to engage in his or 
her chosen profession based on the merit of that individual. That 
is not happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a clarion call.  It is a call for the government to wake 
up and listen, to work with its provincial counterparts to make 
sure that we have an education system that is affordable to all 
students.  We have produced the income contingent loan 
replacement plan which would have been very useful in enabling 
that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we have to innovate in the House,  We have to give 
MPs the ability and freedom to innovate.  We have to revamp this 
bill and fund so that it is accountable to members of the public 
from coast to coast.

<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise on the question that I raised in the House 
some time ago.  It turns out that the timing is excellent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time I was asking the government to recognize that the 
four Atlantic premiers had sent a letter requesting that the 
maritime accord be renewed.  Day after day the parliamentary 
secretary and the minister would rise in the House and say that 
nobody wants the agreements renewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I submitted a letter from the four premiers saying that 
they did want it renewed.  On Thursday those four Atlantic 
premiers signed another letter asking that the maritime accord be 
renewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The softwood lumber issue is a very serious issue for Atlantic 
Canada.  On Thursday the mills in Atlantic Canada received a 
seven page fax in the middle of the night stating that the rules 
were all changed, that they were part of a monitoring system for 
national exports and that they must comply with this system. 
When the mill owners came to work on Friday morning there was 
this whole new regime for them.  They had to follow all these new 
rules and they had to start following them on Monday. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1910"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT95"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT95"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1910
<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime the mill owners had to make arrangements with 
brokers and other organizations to make sure their softwood 
lumber shipments could continue to the U.S. because it blindsided 
the whole industry in Atlantic Canada.  There was no preparation 
and there was no warning.  Even though the government had five 
years to get ready for the termination of the softwood lumber 
accord, it left it to the last day to tell the industry that it 
had to change the way it operated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has implemented a monitoring system so that every stick of 
lumber from Atlantic Canada to the U.S. has to be registered, 
certified and kept track of.  This is an extension of the system 
that is already in place in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario 
and Quebec which now operate under the softwood lumber agreement. 
Many people believe, including myself, that by extending those 
regulations an export tax will be established in Canada.  We hope 
this is not the case.  The minister says it is not the case, but 
everything points to an export tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked questions about the issue in question period, the 
minister stood and said that this was done to record the wall of 
lumber going from Canada to the U.S. upon the expiration of the 
softwood lumber agreement.  That is not a valid argument because 
Atlantic Canada always had free trade.  If there was to be a wall 
of lumber it would have been last week, last month or last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not accept his argument or his reasoning for the monitoring 
system being applied to Atlantic Canada and being extended from 
the four SLA provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister or the parliamentary secretary to rise 
and confirm that they know that the four Atlantic premiers have 
sent two signed letters demanding that the accord be renewed.  I 
would like them to acknowledge that and to commit that they will 
renew the maritime accord as requested by the four premiers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with all due respect 
to my colleague, he represents one riding in the Atlantic 
provinces.  The government has to govern for the entire country. 
Softwood lumber is of great interest to every region of Canada, 
not just to the Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem in acknowledging the fact that the premiers 
recently sent a letter.  That is a matter of record.  With the 
expiry of the softwood lumber agreement our trade is now under 
NAFTA rules.  The exchange of letters in 1996 confirmed the U.S. 
recognition that should a countervailing duty investigation be 
initiated during the five year period of the agreement, the 
maritimes would be considered not to have subsidized.  That will 
be of some comfort to the hon. member who represents an Atlantic 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States accepted that the maritimes would be 
considered not to have subsidized.  Our job as a government is to 
continue to advocate for free trade in softwood lumber, for free 
access to the U.S. market for every region of Canada, not just 
the riding and the Atlantic region the member hails from but for 
every region of Canada where this is vitally important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an east-west issue.  The member and anyone else who 
plays that game does a disservice to what we are trying to do 
nationally on this file.  This is a north-south dispute; it is 
not an east-west dispute.  Any MP that falls into that trap is 
making a very big mistake and is not helping the national cause 
on this file.  I would ask my colleague to reconsider that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about market share.  Our lumber people have done very 
well in the United States.  It means that we must have achieved 
too much of the market share for the American appetite as we are 
up to 34%.  This dispute is about protectionism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade has made very clear, we 
will continue to vigorously defend the Canadian lumber industry. 
We do not unfairly subsidize and that will be proven once again.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to start out by saying that I have honestly seen the 
minister from Vancouver Centre in other forums in Halifax and in 
my own riding.  I have seen her do some very good work on the 
promotion of multiculturalism.  I have always respected her for 
her efforts in bringing that issue to the forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the good work she has done in the past, she made a 
very serious error in judgment.  Although she has apologized in 
the House, an apology is not accepted until the people to whom 
the slanderous remarks were made against accept the apology.  So 
far the people of Prince George have not yet accepted that 
apology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke today to his worship, Mayor Kinsley of Prince George, 
and asked him what we could do in the House or what could the 
minister do to remedy the situation.  I suggested and he agreed 
that it would be a good idea if she got out of Ottawa or out of 
Vancouver and personally flew to Prince George, met with the 
mayor and the council, sat down and resolved the issue once and 
for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people think of Prince George now in a negative light. 
The fact is that last Monday the British Columbia government gave 
an award to the city of Prince George for its work in fighting 
against racism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a riding where we have Cole Harbour High School.  A 
few years ago it was involved in a very serious issue.  Those 
people got together with the efforts of Department of 
Multiculturalism and some dollars from the federal government and 
worked to resolve the issue.  I know the good work that the 
minister's department can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is still left hanging out there.  Many people in British 
Columbia are still very angry with the minister.  Many editorials 
and newspaper accounts have said that she should resign to 
restore some dignity to that department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is not willing to resign or the Prime Minister 
is not willing for her to resign, what she must do to resolve 
this issue once and for all is to go to Prince George, sit down 
and talk with the mayor and resolve this issue.  If she did that 
I believe we would find a conclusion to this resolve.  Then maybe 
the minister would learn by her mistake and move forward in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the people of Prince George, I thank the House for 
the opportunity to speak.  I hope the minister takes that advice 
and goes very quickly to Prince George to resolve this important 
issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with 
specific reference to the hon. member's original question, I am 
informed that the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism did not 
personally call or instruct her staff or department to call the 
RCMP on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Thursday, March 22, the Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism rose in the House and stated her regret and gave 
an apology to the people of Prince George.  She further stated 
that it had never been her intent to disparage communities 
anywhere in Canada and that she deeply regretted the distress 
caused by the statement she made.  In the tradition of 
parliament, her apology has been accepted here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for Multiculturalism also paid tribute to 
the people of Prince George and the good work they had done in 
setting up a task force against hate activities.  She has further 
stated that she wished to continue to work with them in their 
fight against racism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out for the benefit of the hon. member and 
the House that the minister has written to Mayor Kinsley of 
Prince George.  She has conveyed personally her own regret.  She 
said that she wanted to convey personally how sorry she was for 
the distress which her comments may have caused on March 21.
