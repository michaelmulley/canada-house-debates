<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ) </B>moved: 
<A NAME="LINK19">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to demonstrate 
openness with regard to genetically modified organisms, starting 
by making it mandatory to label genetically modified foods or 
foods containing genetically modified ingredients, in order to 
enable Canadians to make informed choices about the foods they 
eat. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I feel it is important to speak today on 
the issue of genetically modified organisms. 
Before I begin my speech, I would like to indicate that I will 
be sharing my time with my colleague from Jonquière, and 
throughout the day, all speakers from my party will be splitting 
time with colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important day for me because I am constantly 
concerned about genetically modified organisms and felt it was 
important for us all to have a day to reflect on GMOs in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before proceeding, it would be wise to remind hon. members of 
the definition of GMOs.  Genetically modified organisms are 
living organisms to which a gene that is foreign to them has 
been added, one from their species or another species.  This 
gene confers upon them new properties they did not initially 
possess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally these properties serve to improve the role they play, 
such as reducing the need for herbicides, insecticides, lowering 
cholesterol content, or raising something else, but it is 
important to realize that their properties are changed by the 
addition of this new gene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is need for this matter to be examined more thoroughly. 
The GMOs came on the scene rapidly.  Five years ago there were 
none on the market, while today they are found in a variety of 
processed foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency acknowledges that about  70% 
of the foods we eat at the present time contain traces, or far 
greater amounts, of GMOs.  They have become just part of our 
landscape, part of the things we eat, but most of the time we 
are not aware of their presence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all these modified foods, there is never a label to help us 
identify what we are eating.  In North America there are all 
sorts of information on the food we eat:  cholesterol free, 
contains cholesterol, sugar free, contains additives, and so on, 
whereas with genetically modified food, no label is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, while the government talks of transparency, 
all this landed on our shelves unbeknownst to consumers, without 
their being informed.  I would say that it is only in the past 
year that consumers have begun to take a serious interest in 
this issue. 
Public concern is justified because it is understandable to be 
worried about something we are unfamiliar with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a lack of knowledge on the effects of GMOs.  In 
its speeches, the government is trying to be reassuring.  It 
tells us that there is no effect, no one has died yet.  It tells us 
not to worry.  We should trust biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to, but people the world over are asking questions, 
be it the members of the American Academy of Sciences, the 200 
scientists with Health Canada or the entire European community. 
They are saying “Careful, we should prove that there is no 
effect on human health, the environment or agriculture before we 
allow these products to circulate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently 42 have already been accepted in Canada. According to 
the deputy minister, 500 are on a waiting list ready to be 
accepted in Canada. This whole situation creates a reasonable 
doubt about the government's approval and inspection process for 
genetically modified organisms and about the middle and long 
term effects of these products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is kind of an anniversary for me. It has been one year 
since I began fighting in the House and in committee to have a 
debate on this issue. After being initially fruitless and 
misunderstood, these representations are beginning to give 
results. The support received from consumers and the public, that 
is the people whom we represent, is a great source of motivation 
for me. Now, this issue is being discussed more openly, and we 
must continue to talk about it until we achieve a level of 
transparency and until there is mandatory labelling for 
transgenic foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been trends and movements about this issue. Nowadays, 
if we do not directly support this technological advance, as it 
is called, we are said to be emotional. That has been the case 
from the outset. Now, we are labelled as people who do not 
understand anything about the American new deal, about 
globalization. We are told that we should be at the forefront 
regarding this issue, that we should not ask questions relating 
to ethics, health or regulations, but get on side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an article published in today's edition of <I>Le Devoir</I>, I read 
the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who do not agree with that view feel crushed and 
overwhelmed by the progress made and they simply do not know 
what is at stake. Save for a few exceptions, those who are 
opposed to GMOs are labelled activists and their legitimate 
concern is perceived as “fear”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is someone in this House who is not afraid, it is me. 
However, when I think of my children and grandchildren, I would 
never forgive myself if some day it was discovered that, 
because of a lack of knowledge, a lack of experimentation—if we 
have a scientific approach on one side, we must take the same 
approach on the other side, if we are critics—we missed something 
and created a monster instead of improving the plight of human 
beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a case of being emotional, of being afraid, or of not 
understanding globalization. This is a very serious issue that 
has not, and this is unfortunate, been taken seriously enough by 
the scientific community and by parliamentarians in this House 
so far.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I am trying to achieve—I asked myself who stood to 
gain in the end.  When one asks oneself this question, the 
answer is obvious:  multinationals first and foremost.  There is 
no doubt about it.  I have nothing against multinationals making 
money but I would also like to see consumers derive some 
benefit.  So far, unfortunately, there is no evidence that 
consumers benefit in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because more care is now being taken in responding to criticism, 
proponents are now talking about starvation in the world.  So 
far not even 1% of budgets has been devoted to research into 
GMOs in order to improve the lot of the starving in the world. 
Nothing has been done for developing countries.  So much for 
good intentions.  Scientifically speaking, it is probably true, 
but in real life so-called developing countries have not 
benefited yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there any benefit to producers?  This is an interesting 
question and the answers are as diverse as the people providing 
them.  Studies have been done in the United States—in Iowa to be 
more precise—and there is no useful indication of improvement for 
producers because the results fluctuate with the particular 
situation.  So far I am not aware of any provincial 
or federal government statistics that tell us exactly whether 
productivity has increased, whether there has been a significant 
decrease in herbicides and pesticides or whether microbial 
activity in soils has been affected. 
Plants grow in soils, a living substratum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this evidence is not available, I wonder who is benefiting. 
I know right off who is being harmed, biological producers. I 
would not want to see consumers, who are our fellow citizens, 
and who are those most affected, harmed in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all day to debate the motion and I will be pleased to 
answer members' questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Bloc Quebecois for bringing this 
motion forward.  It is an important motion that not only 
parliament but all Canadians should address as we discuss this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are loads of material on this issue.  All we have to do is 
look on the Internet to see there are all kinds of information. 
Some of it is quite good and some of it we just do not know 
about.  It is good to have a debate to become more informed about 
GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my hon. colleague a question about GMOs and 
perhaps in her research she has found the answer. Could the hon. 
member tell the House whether or not in her research she has 
found any evidence of real harm to humans who have ingested foods 
containing GMOs?  Has the hon. member ever heard that eating a 
GMO has been fatal to a human? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Mr. Speaker, nowhere have I read of people 
dying from eating GMOs.  The issue is a bit different.  I think 
that while, in the short term, we have no problems, we may have 
them over the long term.  Allergies are a growing problem around 
the world.  Genetic recombination can create substances and 
protein allergens.

Ms. Clark, a researcher at Guelph University, no serious 
confirmation study has been done on allergens, even on products 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is partly for this reason that we are warning that we should 
not wait until we are sick or have an incident, we should  try 
to see and prove that nothing happens, that we are sure nothing 
will happen, because we are dealing with consumers and with 
human beings.  So far, fortunately, there has been no major 
incident that we are aware of.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am a 
member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food as 
is the member for Louis-Hébert.  There was some discussion 
earlier this year about the possibility of there being a joint 
committee or subcommittee of health and agriculture to look at 
the whole issue of genetically modified foods.  I would be 
interested in asking my learned colleague, and she is indeed very 
learned on this topic, if she has been able to figure out why in 
fact that subcommittee of health and agriculture has not come 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food is going to be looking at this later this month with a 
series of meetings. What intrigues me is why the two committees 
were not able to work out an arrangement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Mr. Speaker, being in the opposition, I am, 
like my colleague, unaware of certain secrets, which are almost 
state secrets.  I do not know why there were no sittings of the 
health and agriculture committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to think that it was because of our tenacity on the 
agriculture committee, in insisting that we speak of the matter 
there, that the question of GMOs is on the agenda of the 
agriculture committee at least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the rest, it remains a total mystery.  Some mysteries I 
cannot solve, even if my dear colleague says I have some 
knowledge; I would say to him that it is just marginal, and in 
this I have no inherent knowledge.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will make it very brief for my hon. 
friend from Louis-Hébert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the importance of the debate today and the fact that 
it is going to take place only during today's parliamentary 
session and that will be it for the debate, would she and her 
party be in favour of arranging a special debate on this issue to 
enable all members of parliament who have a view or an interest 
in this issue to participate? As she will be well aware, because 
of the time constraints today, very few MPs will have a chance to 
participate in this important debate.  Would she support setting 
up a special session so that all MPs could have a chance to 
participate? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Mr. Speaker, any time there is a proposal to 
discuss GMOs, transparency about them, and their effects, I 
believe my party and I will be in agreement with such a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must offer my colleague only partial reassurance.  I have 
another motion before the House on the same subject and the 
first hour of debate on it will take place on Friday, with two 
more hours to follow.  This is very little for now, but I 
believe we will be willing to discuss this in the House until 
the end of the session.

is a matter of great concern to me personally, as well as to a 
large number of the constituents of Jonquière, whom I have the 
honour to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank my colleague, the member for Louis-Hébert,

having proposed this motion, which is aimed at making it 
mandatory to label genetically modified foods or foods 
containing genetically modified ingredients in order to enable 
Canadians to make informed choices about the foods they eat.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to congratulate her on her courage and 
determination.  She has kept the heat on this issue for a number 
of weeks.  She has met with hundreds of individuals and 
organizations and has appeared in many forums to bring this 
matter to our attention.  I congratulate my colleague on her 
persistence and success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, I am greatly interested in environmental issues 
and this will be the thrust of most of my speech.  Let us bear a 
few facts in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, negotiations for the adoption of an international 
protocol on biosafety were launched. 
Among other things, the purpose of this protocol was to regulate 
the export and import of GMOs, and to protect the environment 
from the dissemination of these new organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the first multilateral meeting on the Cartagena protocol in 
February 1999, negotiations centred on the initial project, the 
purpose of which was to establish a procedure for assessing the 
risks of GMOs and rules for their labelling, and to make 
companies responsible for the damage caused by their genetically 
modified products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hundreds of countries believed in this vision.  Unfortunately, 
Canada joined forces with five other GMO-exporting countries, 
including the United States, in opposing the signing of such a 
protocol.  At the time, the Canadian government felt that no 
trade restrictions should be placed on GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>European countries felt that caution should prevail on this 
issue.  In the absence of scientific certainty as to the 
potential risks of GMOs, they felt that all necessary measures 
should be taken in order to avoid the devastating effects of 
these products on human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, Canada turned a deaf ear to this example of 
responsibly managing a product that could prove dangerous to 
human health.  The final round of negotiations for this 
biosafety protocol, which I attended, took place in Montreal on 
January 24 and 25, 2000 and led to numerous confrontations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and the five other countries concentrated on defending 
their commercial interests and, once again, in the name of a 
free market, opposed the adoption of international standards 
that would limit genetically modified organisms. 
Yet, these standards merely seek to put in place effective 
mechanisms to ensure the protection of the public and of the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but draw a parallel with the importation of 
plutonium based MOX fuel. In December, Canada imported samples 
of that product by air from the United States, even though such 
a way of doing it is prohibited in the United States, because of 
the very high risk to health. Now, Canada is about to do the 
same thing again with samples from Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as it is concerned, the risk no longer exists north of 
the 49th parallel. The Liberal way of managing is unbelievably 
irresponsible. 
Canada is doing the same thing again by wilfully ignoring the 
laws of a foreign country. A number of countries use a rational 
approach regarding transgenic foods and Canada should take its 
cues from them. Incidentally, the labelling of GMOs is now 
mandatory in the countries that are members of the European 
Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, the situation is different, since these foods are not 
subjected to any scientific experiments other than those used 
for other foods. What is truly worrisome is that, in order to 
approve a transgenic product, the federal government relies on 
studies made by companies and merely reviews them. It does not 
conduct a systematic second assessment of all the plants and 
foods that are to be put on the market. While approval of new 
drugs may take years of in-depth studies, approval of transgenic 
foods takes only a few weeks. 
It is ridiculous for the federal government to be telling us 
that there is no risk with GMOs, when the studies have just been 
thrown together, and many are too superficial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, these preliminary studies must not lead to our 
rejecting GMOs.  Perhaps transgenic foods do indeed represent no 
health risk but, as I have already said, given the lack of 
scientific certainty because of the paucity of information and 
scientific expertise on the scope of the potential harmful 
effects of GMOs, we must err on the side of caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, moreover, another risk, a potentially serious risk to 
the environment.  This is the transmission of genes in nature, 
what is termed gene flow. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not merely a theoretical possibility, but indeed a 
certainty that has been proven on a number of occasions.  When a 
plant has escaped into nature, it is extremely difficult to 
recover it, and it can spread before we become aware of the 
undesirable effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of concern, therefore, to see companies doing 
outdoor testing.  This might have disastrous effects. Some of 
the developing countries have raised this very important point. 
As hon. members are aware, some of these countries are heavily 
dependent on an economic development strategy that relies on 
exports, particularly in the field of agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Genetically modified seeds could quite conceivably harm their 
agriculture, with the change in genes, the transmission of the 
resistance to herbicides of some GMOs in nature could give rise 
to almost invincible weeds that could invade the genes and 
replace the natural species, including the rare or more 
vulnerable species.  The development of this resistance could 
lead to the use of herbicides even more poisonous to the 
environment, benefiting the companies manufacturing these 
products, which are often the companies that developed the GMOs 
in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We become aware of the vicious circle we find ourselves in and 
we know full well the disastrous effects of pesticides.  At the 
moment, the Standing Committee on the Environment is examining 
the effect of these pesticides and will soon table a report on 
their effects on human health. We will be forced to use them more 
often and in greater quantity in order to eliminate invisible 
weeds whose existence is directly dependant on GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Developing countries are very familiar with this problem and do 
not want their fertile land to serve as a testing ground in order 
to satisfy the scientific advances of more favoured nations such 
as Canada and the United States.  It may be that a handful of 
companies will exercise unprecedented control over the world seed 
and pesticide supply market with all that this entails for prices 
and the safety of food supply and on farmers' lifestyle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something called the terminator technology, which gives 
rise to plants producing sterile seed. 
Producers, especially those in developing countries, are 
challenging this technology, which makes it impossible to sow 
seed from the preceding crop. It is therefore not surprising that 
some European producers are challenging this monopoly.  For all 
these reasons, it is important to take appropriate measures in 
order to regulate the use of transgenic foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois's motion is a step in the right direction 
because, by supporting the international protocol on biosafety, 
Canada could better protect the environment, particularly with 
respect to the export and import of GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is increasing pressure in Canada to follow the European 
approach. The Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors, which 
represents food wholesalers and a number of other retailers, 
feels that there should be a Canadian labelling standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is known that 30% to 50% of Canadian canola plants are 
GMOs—twice the number in 1997—consumers are entitled to wonder 
about the potentially devastating effects of these products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a moral responsibility to ensure public 
safety, whatever the cost.  It is clear that the federal 
government is completely ignoring this responsibility.  On the 
contrary, it is shutting its eyes and is in no hurry to provide 
Canadians and Quebecers with protection against the potentially 
harmful effects of GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health of consumers and the environment must come first. 
There is no question of sacrificing our health and standing by 
while fertile land disappears.  That is why, on behalf of the 
inhabitants of the riding of Jonquière, I am asking all members 
of parliament to support the motion introduced by the member for 
Louis-Hébert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to make an amendment to my colleague's motion. I move: 
<A NAME="LINK24">&nbsp;</A>

<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to my colleague's remarks.  There 
has been a good deal of interest on this matter in Peterborough 
riding, the matter of the terminator gene, for example.  I have 
received petitions about that technology and grave concern about 
it.  I think it is a concern we share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also had concerns expressed about the approvals process, 
how one approves foods of this type.  In particular, I have had 
petitions from farmers and others about choice, choice at the 
level of seed, not just the matter of the terminator seed but 
being able to have choice between seed which is genetically 
modified and seed which is not, as well as choice at the food 
level.  By the way, in both those cases it would involve some 
sort of labelling or designation of whether or not it has been 
modified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a great interest in the international protocol 
which the member mentioned.  There is a good deal of pleasure in 
the fact that the Royal Society has now set up a panel, which at 
the behest of the federal government will study these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member has to do with the nature of 
labelling.  Could she give us some advice on how she thinks the 
labelling should proceed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, should the labelling indicate where there has been 
a significant change in the nutritional content of the food? 
Would that be the sort of criterion?  Would it be based on some 
sort of impression of the extent of the genetic modification 
involved?  Would any sort of genetic modification be labelled or 
would it not?  Would all products produced using genetic 
modification be labelled or only those resulting from recombinant 
DNA technology, which is where there is substantial change in the 
genetic makeup of the crop concerned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These matters are very important.  If there is to be labelling 
it has to express something which is real in the crop concerned. 
It has to articulate to the consumer, be it a farmer buying seed 
or one of us buying food, some real indication of what the 
genetic change involves.  Does the member have any comments on 
how she sees a labelling regime being developed and applied? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his interesting question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently several committees reviewing this issue. 
They are looking at voluntary labelling. Something good may come 
out of their work, and the Bloc Quebecois is confident it will, 
but we must respect the public's wishes. Labelling must be 
mandatory.

must respect the consumer's freedom of choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Louis-Hébert pointed out, we do not want 
to cause a panic. We want to respect the consumers' choice and 
the farmers' choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, people are informed. They are very concerned about 
their health and the environment. The mandatory labelling of 
genetically modified foods is part of the changes concerning 
people's health and the environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand in the House 
today to respond to the hon. member's motion concerning the 
labelling of foods derived from biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has an enviable reputation around the world for the 
safety of our food and the rigour of our food inspection system. 
We have not had the same situations of food contamination and 
poisoning that have occurred both in Europe and in other less 
developed countries.  Canadians rightly trust the regulatory 
system, which has been vigilant in ensuring that our high 
standards are maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the safety assessments of 
conventional products and of products derived from biotechnology 
are both subject to stringent health and safety requirements 
under Canada's food safety system.  Health Canada maintains 
responsibility for establishing policy and standards related to 
the safety of food sold in Canada.  Health Canada sets the data 
requirements for the safety assessments of all foods and 
undertakes comprehensive pre-market reviews of new foods, 
including those derived through biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency carries out inspection and 
enforcement activities related to food safety standards set by 
Health Canada.  The Canadian Food Inspection Agency also has the 
responsibility for the environmental safety assessment of a 
number of agricultural products derived through biotechnology, 
including plants and animal feeds.  In fact, every new food goes 
through a rigorous and thorough review process before being 
allowed on the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency require 
that new foods go through both laboratory and field testing. They 
must then be further tested in controlled, small scale field 
tests to generate additional data for health and environmental 
safety assessments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of labelling, Canadian federal legislation calls for 
Health Canada to set the requirements for mandatory labelling. 
Current labelling regulations in Canada require that all food 
products, including those developed through biotechnology, be 
labelled where a potential human health or safety issue has been 
identified or foods have been changed in composition or 
nutrition.  Therefore, based on its safety evaluations of food, 
Health Canada determines if and when labelling is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an example.  Any food product that has 
undergone a compositional or nutritional change or that presents 
a possible safety concern as identified by Health Canada, such as 
the presence of an allergen like nuts, requires mandatory 
labelling in Canada under the provisions of the Food and Drugs 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitment of the Government of Canada is always to safety 
first; safety for the protection of Canadians, safety for animals 
and safety for our environment.  In Canada we believe in 
labelling that is credible, labelling that is meaningful and 
labelling that is enforceable.  Canadians expect that their 
government will consult with them on how they want their foods to 
be labelled and the government is doing just that.  The 
government is committed to exploring how labelling can best serve 
the public. 
As such, we are responding to the public's interest in this area. 
We have announced and strongly encouraged the establishment of a 
Canadian standard for the labelling of foods derived through 
biotechnology.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This standard is now being developed by the Canadian General 
Standards Board under the sponsorship of the Canadian Council of 
Grocery Distributors.  The standards board is an accredited 
standards development organization within Public Works and 
Government Services Canada.  Its expertise is recognized 
throughout Canada and internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A committee composed of representatives and individuals from a 
broad range of Canadian interests has been established.  Under 
the chair of Dr. Lee Anne Murphy from the Consumers' Association 
of Canada, the committee has already met for three intensive 
working sessions since the inception of the committee in November 
of last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has established four working groups to look at 
areas such as definitions, labels, claims in advertising, and 
compliance measures.  Representatives from consumer groups, 
producers, distributors, health care professionals and 
representatives from other levels of government, as well as from 
the federal level, sit on the committee.  These are regular 
Canadians on this committee, Mr. Speaker, people like you and I 
and members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee has already fed information back to other 
Canadians on the progress it is making as it goes through its 
deliberations through its website.  A completed standard is 
expected within the next six to twelve months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By initiating such an open and inclusive process to develop a 
labelling standard, my hon. colleagues should be aware that 
Canada is indeed a leader worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no other country in the world that is actively engaging 
such a broad range of stakeholders on this issue.  Other 
countries have announced their intention to implement mandatory 
labelling policies, but so far they have not been able to figure 
out how to effectively do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, on the other hand, is fully engaged and speedily 
developing its own national standard in full consultation with 
stakeholders, in a way which is open and transparent to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that the development of this 
labelling standard is very similar in nature to that of the 
national standard for organic agriculture.  This organic standard 
was ratified in April 1999 by the Standards Council of Canada and 
outlines principles for organic agriculture which endorse sound 
production and management practices to enhance the quality and 
sustainability of the environment and ensure the ethical 
treatment of livestock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This project was managed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency 
and was funded largely through Industry Canada's standards 
initiative program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of the government's leadership is evident in its 
request to the Royal Society of Canada to appoint an independent 
expert panel to examine future scientific developments in food 
biotechnology.  This forward thinking body will advise Health 
Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Environment 
Canada on the science capacity the federal government will need 
to maintain the safety of new food products being developed 
through biotechnology in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often we hear from the other side of the House that the 
government acts unilaterally, that it imposes its view of what 
should be done on Canadians without due consultation.  The 
government is adapting a balanced and consultative approach, not 
only to the labelling of foods derived from biotechnology, but 
also around a broader set of issues involving consumer choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the federal government has created the Canadian 
Biotechnology Advisory Committee as a key group which will help 
raise the public's awareness of the regulatory process and 
provide an ongoing forum for the Canadian public to voice views 
and opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The development of a comprehensive Canadian standard for the 
labelling of foods derived from biotechnology allows consumers, 
health care professionals, other levels of government, 
processors, distributors and producers all to work together in 
establishing a single national standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also ensure that the standard which is developed 
provides for labels and messages which are understandable and not 
misleading to Canadian consumers.  Procedures and guidelines will 
also be set up to verify the truthfulness of food labelling, 
truthfulness in advertising and the truthfulness of claims.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government is doing the right thing by taking this 
approach.  As consumers, Canadians have the right to clear, 
concise and accurate information that allows them to make 
informed choices about the foods they eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that it is important to respond to the 
public's desire to understand biotechnology and the safety of its 
products.  The government has done a good job in developing 
widely used materials, such as Canada's Food Guide and the recent 
<I>Food Safety and You</I> brochure which was sent to every 
Canadian household across the country.  We remain committed to 
addressing the concerns of Canadians and to developing means to 
provide Canadians with the information they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While working quickly on a consensus approach to a national 
labelling standard, the government is continuing to maintain the 
stringent requirements of the food safety system in Canada. 
Around the world Canada is regarded as a leader on this issue. 
For example, we chair the prestigious Codex Alimentarius 
committee on food labelling.  Over 160 countries are on that 
committee.  We are also leading a subcommittee of Codex that has 
worked over the past year to draft recommendations for the 
labelling of foods derived from biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments, consumers and industry are working together to 
achieve the approach that is right for Canada and one that will 
work for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
want to thank the minister of agriculture for taking part in this 
debate. I am honored that he did so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to his speech. It is true that we have an 
enviable reputation regarding food safety. However, it is also 
true that the principle of equivalence that we use to approve 
foods is challenged by a number of scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned another topic, which brings me to ask him 
a question about the standards for organic or biological farming 
that were approved in April 1999, barely a year ago. In the whole 
issue of GMOs, I believe that organic farming is the most 
threatened sector. We have a hard time, even this year, finding 
products with less than 5% GMO content in transgenic seeds, while 
the international standard for the sale of these products is 1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the minister of agriculture has a 
particular concern for our organic farmers who, after nine years 
of waiting, finally got specific standards for the sale of their 
products. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member may want 
to clarify this later, but I believe she referred to some 
countries of the world, probably meaning those forming the 
European Union, which have put in place regulations which suggest 
that any food product that has over 1% of content which comes 
from a crop that has been genetically modified should be labelled 
as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out in my speech, and I have done so many times in 
response to questions from this hon. member and others, that even 
though these countries have done that, no one has yet found a 
testing process that can assure it.  That is the type of thing 
that needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not opposed to labelling, but it has to be 
credible, meaningful and enforceable.  It is not enforceable.  If 
we are going to be fair to the consumer, all of those criteria 
have to be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member referred to the difficulty in finding product, 
and I am not sure what she meant.  If she is talking about the 
availability of seeds and plants to the individual producer, that 
choice is there.  They can make that choice.  If they wish to 
plant products that have been genetically modified for whatever 
reason, then that opportunity is there for those producers. 
They will have to make that decision.  They are very capable of 
making decisions on which ones to plant and which ones to grow, 
and I am sure that they will do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Genetically modified organisms and what effect they have on 
people have been a topic of debate across the country and around 
the world.  We need to have more research and we need to know 
more about what is going on.

morning about grain transportation, increased fuel costs and 
increased input costs to farmers, but I will stick to the issue 
at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister is aware, there have been suggestions that a 
joint subcommittee of the agriculture committee and health 
committee be struck to study this issue.  If this does happen, I 
would like him, as the agriculture minister for Canada, to assure 
the agricultural community that it will be well represented as 
the witnesses come forward to bring testimony to that 
subcommittee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is within the 
jurisdiction of the House leaders.  It is my understanding, and I 
could stand corrected, that the issue of labelling will be before 
the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member mentioned, there was a desire to have a joint 
committee but it is my understanding that in order to have a 
joint committee there has to be full agreement of all parties in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally think that a better way to discuss this would have 
been a joint committee of Health Canada, which sets the 
regulations, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, which is 
responsible to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food for 
doing, enforcing and monitoring the labelling.  However, it is my 
understanding that the Bloc Quebecois would not agree to that and 
therefore there will be one committee, the agriculture committee. 
The discussion will be around the labelling of food.  I do not 
know whether it will get into a discussion of the role of the 
Ministry of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as safety to humans, the Ministry of Health reviews all 
food products, including those which are the results of 
biotechnology.  The Canadian Food Inspection Agency reviews those 
with respect to the safety of animals and to the safety of the 
environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
brief question for the minister based on his remark that no other 
country has developed effective mandatory labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning some of us had the opportunity to hear the 
secretary general of the OECD, a former cabinet minister in the 
House, Donald Johnston, speak on this subject.  He indicated to 
those in attendance that on April 10 a mandatory labelling 
process had come into effect in the European Union.  He also 
indicated that one is already in effect in Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a discrepancy from what I heard a couple of 
hours ago and what the minister is saying now.  I wonder if he 
could clarify it from his viewpoint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said in my 
comments, there may very well be other jurisdictions in the world 
that have a system, but to date none of them have been able to 
make it work.  It is one thing to pass laws and to have 
regulations, but we want to make sure that when we do it in 
Canada it is one that is enforceable.  When that is done in any 
country of the world, the role of Codex Alimentarius is very 
important because they set the international standards for the 
labelling of foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in Canada, with all the incredible ability we have to 
produce a diversity of different food products, we import nearly 
one-third of our food.  Food is moved from one part of the world 
to the other.  When any country determines that there must be a 
mandatory something, and I am not saying it should not, as long 
is it meets those other criteria, in this case the labelling with 
regard to GMO or the labelling with regard to the level of 
protein, fat or carbohydrates, there must be a world standard so 
that if a product comes into a country, that country is assured 
that the process in the country of origin is one that is 
credible, meaningful and enforceable.  If this is not done, then 
it is very meaningless and could be misleading to the consumers. 
That is the importance of the discussions around Codex 
Alimentarius.  Everybody must know that what is happening in 
another country is meaningful to them and vice versa.  Everybody 
must know what is expected when they ship or sell a product into 
another market and be able to demonstrate that there is testing, 
et cetera, for that product.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time a number of questions need to be answered. 
The challenge we all have is that if it cannot be tested then how 
meaningful is it to consumers.  If consumers see something, bring 
it to the authorities, point out what it says on the packaging, 
ask whether it is right or not and there is no ability to take 
the product and say it is or no it is not right, then the 
consumer is no better off.  If it is not right, then the consumer 
may be even more misled than before.  We cannot and do not want 
to go there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am indeed pleased to participate in today's supply day 
motion put forward by our Bloc colleagues, that the government be 
called upon to make it mandatory to label all genetically 
modified foods, including genetically modified ingredients in 
foods so the population can make a clear choice as to what they 
consume. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, are one of the fastest 
growing issues of concern for Canadians today.  This is a truly 
global issue.  However, one of the difficulties vexing Canadians 
on all sides of this debate is the ability to find bona fide 
research that confirms or negates different parts of the 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one side of the debate are those who feel that any changes to 
our food supply are automatically bad.  Regardless of the quality 
of science, good or bad, the result is bad.  There are also those 
who believe and are willing to accept what the scientists say 
without questioning whether or not the scientific proof comes 
from a company or someone who has a vested interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that prior to any knee-jerk reactions calling for 
labelling of any sort, we must define what a GMO actually is. 
Although I am certainly not a scientist, I believe that an 
appropriate working definition for a genetically modified 
organism would be any plant or animal that has had genetic 
information inserted into it from a different plant or animal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest difficulties in debating a subject such as 
GMOs is the incredible rate of change that the scientific field 
is undergoing.  What was unknown yesterday is common knowledge 
today and passé tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate of change that we see in genetic engineering is 
incredible and what we may consider as being unthinkable or 
unattainable today is surely within the realm of the possible and 
the reachable tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within this debate, we must also remember that the 
cross-pollination of plants has led to new hybrids that have 
assisted Canada a great deal.  I am no expert but I do know that 
new hybrids for wheat and other grains, as well as certain fruits 
and vegetables, have been cross-pollinated specifically for our 
northern climate and, consequentially, the shorter growing season 
that we experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that my hon. colleague from Selkirk—Interlake, our 
agricultural critic for the Canadian Alliance, would be able to 
add greatly to this particular part of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate is not as simple as whether or not we want to label 
genetically modified organisms.  We must be sure of course of the 
safety of the product before we even release it to the public. If 
we accept that a product is safe and viable for the general 
public, what is the best way to label the product?  Should we 
label those products that are modified or should we label the 
ones that are free of modification?

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One major concern I have is that the debate on genetically 
modified organisms is being largely led by rhetoric and sometimes 
scare tactics without the reliance and proof of good, sound, 
provable science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When organizations or noted individuals speak out, of course 
they gain immediate media attention, and certain portions of our 
society will follow along with their recommendations regardless 
of the validity and truth behind their statements.  People will 
follow along simply because a certain organization or individual, 
an individual who they perhaps support, has made that statement. 
When any notable person or group makes a statement, they need to 
be able to stand by their comments, not in a micro-version of the 
words used but from a macro standpoint.  Any organization that 
needlessly elicits concerns without proof is being negligent in 
its duties not only to its membership but to the general public 
at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in an information society and many people willingly 
accept what information is displayed for them across the banner 
headlines of their daily newspaper or what they happen to read on 
Internet sites.  Unfortunately many people also read these 
headlines without taking the time to critically think about what 
is being said or reading the full debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that such is the case with some of the tactics used in 
the debate on genetically modified organisms.  We have all seen 
the headlines calling for a complete banning of Frankenfoods.  We 
have all seen the news clips of anonymous people destroying 
fields of wheat in Europe all because we have been told that it 
is bad for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not really know if it is bad for us or not. I am not a 
scientist.  I am not a genetic engineer.  What I hope I am is a 
critical thinker.  I do want to know, however, the full story on 
genetically modified organisms.  I think every member in the 
House wants the same thing.  Members should note that I said the 
whole story not just a selected portion that fits the agenda of 
any particular group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would all agree that our food supply is one of the 
most critical things necessary to sustain life not only here but 
around the globe.  Whether we read today's newspaper or one from 
five or ten years ago, we can read stories of crops or food 
supplies devastated by drought or plague, early frost or lack of 
nutrients.  The fallout effect of these things have been 
devastating.  To see the pictures of starving children pulls on 
my heartstrings, as I am sure it does on everyone else here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can genetically modified organisms solve those problems?  I 
frankly doubt it.  Can they solve some of the problems? Possibly. 
Are there risks involved?  Most certainly.  I believe the bigger 
questions are:  What are those risks, and, are they acceptable to 
the public at large? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all take risks every day.  Most of us take a risk just 
getting up in the morning.  Stepping off the curb in front of 
Centre Block carries the risk of a car or a bus running us over. 
I think I can safely state that the risk of endangering our food 
supply is something that all of us want to be very cautious 
about.  This brings us back to the question of the need for 
scientific proof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not unique in our debate on this issue.  There are many 
countries around the world that have entered into the current 
debate.  Many world governments have expressed concerns over 
GMOs.  However, we must note that many of these foods remain on 
European store shelves around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that we have not fully researched the entire 
issue of genetically modified organisms.  As a father and 
grandfather, I share the concerns over the testing, publicity and 
safety of genetically engineered products.  Canada currently has 
42 genetically modified organisms approved for use in Canada. 
However, the issue of labelling and perceived safety by consumers 
certainly remains an outstanding issue and one that has to be 
faced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 23 of this year I introduced a private member's 
bill, Bill C-434, an act to amend the Department of Health Act 
(genetically modified food).  Through this bill, I have requested 
that the Standing Committee on Health review and recommend 
legislation concerning the testing, approval and labelling of 
genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically in that bill I have identified the need to conduct 
research in order to, first, establish whether the consumption by 
a human being or an animal of genetically modified foods 
produces, in the short term or in the long term, dangerous or 
harmful effects on their health. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is to establish whether the cultivation of plants 
from genetically modified seeds produces in the short term or in 
the long term dangerous or harmful effects on the environment, 
insects and other plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is to make regulations on the labelling of genetically 
modified foods in order to allow consumers to easily identify 
that characteristic of the food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remainder of my bill sets out steps to take for 
implementation and examination of ethical problems which may go 
against certain religious practices.  It encourages a public 
debate on the issue and is intended to set up information 
programs for the general public to make people aware of the 
effects of the consumption of genetically modified organisms, 
including a full parliamentary review process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we come to the rather delicate issue of labelling.  If we 
recognize that genetically modified organisms exist and therefore 
will continue to exist in one form or another, and if we have a 
general agreement that individuals want the ability to freely 
choose what they feed their families, we need to be clear and 
consistent with our labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that one aspect missing from today's motion is the cost 
factor in the whole equation of labelling.  There is no doubt 
that there would be a cost involved when additional labelling 
comes about.  The Manitoba <I>Co-operator</I> reported that the 
largest portion of the increased costs would arise from the need 
to segregate GMO crops and non-GMO crops all the way from the 
field to the consumer's plate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although something like this is very attainable, what is the 
full cost and who will bear it?  We do not know that.  Will the 
producer bear the additional costs, considering that he is the 
one who planted the seed?  Will food processors bear the costs 
since they are the ones who purchase the raw material and sell a 
finished product?  Or, should consumers bear the cost since they 
are the end users?  Certainly labelling has a cost involved and 
today's motion does not particularly identify what that might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Down under in Australia and New Zealand a report by KPMG 
estimated that the cost of mandatory labelling to the food 
industry would be $3 billion in the first year and $1.5 billion 
in each subsequent year.  According to its study this amounts to 
a 6% tax on all food products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also according to the study the true costs of labelling 
compliance would include such things as verification of the 
maintenance of an identification system for both GMO and non-GMO 
food products.  It would include checks and audits for each batch 
of ingredients within a product.  It would include testing and 
record keeping for each batch.  It would include analysis on 
non-compliance and/or non-specified testing or audit results.  It 
would also include the investigation of non-compliance complaints 
and subsequent prosecution records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not asked my constituents but I am pretty certain that I 
know the answer if I asked whether or not they would be willing 
to add 6% to their food bill.  A few would say that it would be 
worth it.  A few would not care.  However I suspect that the vast 
majority would be very concerned about adding 6% to their food 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently a meeting took place in Montreal to debate and 
determine a protocol regarding genetically modified organisms.  I 
believe it is important to note that the protocol fails to follow 
the principles supported by the Canadian Alliance of using 
scientific information to determine if an agricultural or food 
biotechnology product meets Canadian health and safety 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that, as for most treaties or protocols, 
parliamentary approval is not required for Canada to ratify this 
particular protocol.  It will not come before parliament.  We 
will not have our say in it.  That is fundamentally wrong in our 
democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The signing of such agreements should not be left to bureaucrats 
alone.  Rather they should come before parliament for debate and 
ratification.   We are the lawmakers of the land.  The courts are 
not the lawmakers.  The United Nations is not the lawmaker.  We 
are the lawmakers and we should be the ones to make the final 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do we go from here?  I believe it is safe to say that 
there is a great deal of scientific research being done on 
genetically modified organisms. 
Is it all valid research?  I do not know, but experts are 
available that can assist members of parliament to better 
understand the entire issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are sent here as members by our constituents to represent 
their views, to determine the best policy route for our great 
nation, and to ensure that all Canadians are well taken care of 
no matter what the issue.  It was with a great deal of enthusiasm 
that I filed a motion with the Standing Committee on Health that 
we study the health and safety of genetically modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the opposition on the health committee supported 
the motion, but as usual the Minister of Health dictated through 
the parliamentary secretary and the chair of committee what would 
and would not be studied, so the health committee at this point 
in time is not studying GMOs.  Yet it seems to me that is exactly 
where it should be studied, if we are concerned about the safety 
of our food system, our food supply, and its effect upon the 
health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those on the committee this should not be a major surprise, 
considering that the same committee has also refused to study the 
larger issue of health care, the number one issue of concern for 
Canadians today.  It steadfastly refuses to study the number one 
priority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Liberals have no answers or solutions to the 
enormous questions and problems concerning health care and GMOs. 
Therefore there is a lack of desire to seek them out and to be 
embarrassed by the public response to their non-compliance with 
the demands of Canadians to study such vital concerns. 
Unfortunately in the end result all Canadians continue to lose 
under the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is mandatory labelling the full and best answer?  In order to 
make clear personal choices some consumers wish to be assured 
what foods do or do not include genetically modified organisms. 
Clear and concise labelling is important to these consumers.  The 
Canadian Alliance would cite the volunteer labelling and industry 
regulated process that organic farmers currently use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In stark comparison to the motion put forward by the Bloc 
Quebecois today, I would like to read a press release from SPEC, 
the Society Promoting Environmental Conservation.  It indicates: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower Lonsdale's trendy Artisan Bake Shoppe is the first retail 
outlet to display the bright yellow and green sunflower symbol 
indicating products that are free of genetically modified 
organisms.  SPEC president, David Cadman, and Artisan master 
baker, Katarina Dittus, launched the new GMO-free label campaign 
on Saturday, March 18, 2000.  SPEC will be inviting restaurants, 
grocery stores, specialty shops and other food outlets throughout 
the lower mainland of British Columbia to commit to carrying only 
GMO-free products. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the lead taken by this north Vancouver bakery is 
probably a far more appropriate route to follow than mandatory 
labelling.  It seems more akin to the process used by organic 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree consumers demand choice.  I agree they need to have the 
resources to enable them to make knowledgeable decisions.  To not 
allow consumers to have access to full and good science restricts 
them from being able to make those complete and full decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am led to believe that mandatory labelling of all genetically 
modified organisms leads to a food supply that is overregulated 
by bureaucrats and subject to the whims of government.  By 
comparison, voluntary labelling for all products that are free of 
genetically modified organisms encourages a food supply that is 
self-regulated, market driven and supports the freedom of choice 
of consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also question the minister of agriculture and his 
department and wonder aloud what the cost of sending out a food 
safety booklet to every Canadian would be when the researchers 
and the minister's blue ribbon panel have not completed their 
work.  How can the government waste money when the job at hand is 
not yet completed?  Has it learned nothing from the HRDC 
boondoggle?   Maybe not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I relish the opportunity to debate genetically modified 
organisms today, I believe that the debate is perhaps not in the 
proper space.  As a House we need to have the experts come before 
its members and discuss the entire issue and safety of GMOs. That 
is properly done before the health and agriculture committees.  I 
call again for a joint committee between agriculture and health 
to discuss this huge issue.  We need to have that done.  Although 
we have asked for this opportunity, the government has so far 
refused to research and publicly debate the issues at the 
committees that should be studying them.

with the need to bring the particular motion to the House and to 
have this kind of debate, I would say that we have to keep the 
debate open in terms of labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance does not have an issue with safety of these 
organisms, but we do take issue with the mandatory labelling of 
all GMO products.  We should look at the other side of the coin, 
the labelling of non-GMO products that could be driven by 
consumer choice and not by the bureaucracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to the remarks of our colleague from Nanaimo—Cowichan with great 
interest.  He addressed an aspect that had not yet been looked 
at: the cost of mandatory labelling of transgenic foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is an aspect that is rarely addressed, it is because 
there is so little information available.  I listened to his 
demonstration.  If there is labelling, this will amount to a 6% 
tax on all food products to cover the costs of monitoring, which 
is moreover already being done by the agency, according to the 
information we have currently available, because there are few 
laboratories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague whether he has weighted the 
cost factor against the potential loss of market, for instance in 
Japan, the European community, Korea, and many other countries 
requiring mandatory labelling.  I think this would lead to a most 
interesting cost reduction. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague and her 
party have put this matter before the House I know that it opens 
up the whole debate.  There is no question that we must have it 
and we must ask ourselves important questions such the one she 
has raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally I would not know the answer to the particular 
question.  There are many unanswered questions in this whole 
area, but I think the issue of cost is one which was not raised 
in her motion.  I am perhaps the first person to raise the 
particular point in the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an issue that has had the full investigation it should 
have.  We can only go on what we have before us.  There is the 
example of the Australia-New Zealand experience where they are 
suggesting that there would be an extra cost to the consumer for 
the mandatory labelling of these products.  We must look at it in 
terms of what it would do to our markets overseas and weigh that 
in the balance.  We must look at all sides of the issue.  The 
verdict is still out and I am grateful we have the opportunity to 
debate it in the House today.

transparency in genetically modified foods and labelling to 
permit the public a clear choice in this matter.  I congratulate

today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some significant witnesses will appear before the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, beginning in a couple of 
weeks, to look in depth at the issue of labelling. 
Certainly we will be looking forward to that. I suppose today's 
debate serves as a preamble to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with care to what the minister of agriculture said in 
his remarks a few minutes ago.  To paraphrase it I think he is 
clearly saying, and we all agree, that the onus is not on the 
Monsantos, Novardis and DuPonts of the world to prove the safety 
of foods but it is government that must regulate those.  He 
believes and we all hope he is right when he says that we are 
well served and that Canadians do have a very high standard and 
can rest assured that the food they are ingesting is regulated 
well in advance of its going to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue seems in many ways to come down to one of the 
environment.  As has been noted several times already, there has 
been lots of discussion on this topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know for example of the battle between the giant Monsanto 
versus a farmer in Saskatchewan, Mr. Schmeiser, about pollution 
from a GM crop that went to Mr. Schmeiser's field.  Today in the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> Thomas Walkom has a column based on a report 
out of the <I>New Scientist</I> about a farmer in Alberta who grew 
three different fields of GM canola, one that was seed resistant 
to Roundup, another from Cynamid and a third for Liberty.  What 
has happened over the last three years since he first planted 
those crops is that he now has weeds that are resistant to all 
three.  He is looking at an extensive cocktail solution to try to 
dispose of the supermutant weeds that have been created in the 
wake of using these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of questions are being raised by Canadians. I think there 
is a growing market concern as a result of that and perhaps even 
a rebellion by some farmers to the giant chemical and 
pharmaceutical companies that are busy promoting these products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumer resistance has certainly come to Europe in the wake of 
the mad cow disease, to the extent that the European Union is 
prepared to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars a year for 
importing North American beef into that continent.  Because the 
beef may well have been injected with hormones, they are not 
going to allow it to come in and they are prepared to pay a 
significant penalty under the WTO provisions in order to keep 
that product off the European food shelves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that consumer resistance is also spreading to 
Canada and North America.  We have seen a significant growth in 
that in recent years.  In recent months giant Canadian companies 
such as McCain, McDonald's hamburgers and Frito-Lay have 
indicated they want to ensure that their consumers are not 
ingesting genetically modified products.  Even a company like 
Monsanto is obviously aware of the problems. It is hiving off its 
agricultural division because of the spate of bad news and it is 
changing its name. It is interesting that Novardis, one of the 
leaders in GM food, now has a baby food is labelled as GM free. 
Marketers and big business are doing what they always need to do 
to ensure they have a strong market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninety-five per cent of Canadians say that we should have the 
right to purchase non-genetically modified food and a 
corresponding high percentage say that there has to be labelling. 
We know that in a few very well to do Canadian households there 
is the opportunity to purchase non-GM foods, but without 
labelling the vast majority of us would not necessarily know 
where to go, although we did hear about the flour that a member 
talked about previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am trying to say is that the precautionary principle 
should still prevail in this area.  Lack of full scientific 
certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost 
effective measures.  That means it has to be science based and 
not based on science fiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the New Democratic Party convention last year I was pleased 
to take part in a resolution that dealt with this topic. The 
points contained in that resolution which was passed 
overwhelmingly at the convention were that there be a full scale 
public discussion initiated on GMO foods; that the labelling 
process to make consumers aware be mandatory; that there be 
adequate protection for farmers; that liability for genetic 
pollution shall rest with the huge companies, the Monsantos et 
cetera; and that for food safety there must be the capacity to 
evaluate GMO food and to ensure that this evaluation is 
independent of the food producers and the food producing industry 
and government food marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the government in its wisdom, or lack thereof, 
dispensed a booklet that was referred to by the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, “Food Safety and You”.  This has 
generated a lot interest in my constituency.  I had a recent 
letter, an e-mail, from people who are very concerned and unhappy 
that the government had put out this product.  To quote in part 
from a letter from the Hjertaas family: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for “labelling,” it seems to me that Allergy Associations 
have been fighting for years to get all ingredients labelled for 
health reasons and I'm not sure we are there yet.  For instance 
the unlabelled practice of putting corn grits on the bottom of 
bread has made my son sick more than once! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And why in the world would the Government of Canada use the 
organic standards developed under the Canadian General Standards 
Board as a model for the development of labelling for foods 
derived from biotechnology?  Biotechnology has no place in 
organics as is well illustrated in the new U.S. organic 
standards. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The writer concludes that the Government of Canada has 
absolutely no business supporting the corporate agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a very recent interesting article by Brian Flemming, a 
Halifax writer and columnist, in the current issue of <I>Policy 
Options Politiques</I>.  He talked about the huge government 
conflict of interest brewing in Ottawa where genetically modified 
foods are beginning to trouble both bureaucrats and the Canadian 
public.  He indicated, as I have said, that a majority of 
Canadians would be less likely to buy GM food if they knew it had 
been modified.  The same Canadians would no doubt also 
overwhelmingly demand that the country's food regulator be just 
that, a regulator, and not a promoter of GM foods like canola. 
He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ethically, the federal government has a duty not to extend its 
regulatory reach any further into the GM food world without first 
divesting itself of its current, conflicting roles, of promoter 
of, or financier for, GM foods. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He ended by saying: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the following “regulatory commandment” should be posted on 
the walls of the offices of all ministers and deputy ministers: 
Thou shalt not simultaneously regulate and promote, regulate and 
finance, or regulate and insure any industry. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I think that would be a very good commandment for 
the government to follow on this lively issue of genetically 
modified foods.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened with a great deal of interest to what my colleague from 
Palliser has had to say, and there are a lot of questions I could 
ask, because he raised a number of different aspects, but I will 
restrict myself to one on research.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether he has asked himself questions 
about the somewhat embarrassing, if not downright incestuous, 
connections between major companies and those carrying out 
research.  It is true that the government has pulled out, which 
has forced our researchers, our academics, to look for 
partners—a term I feel has been worked to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it possible to maintain independent research, purely 
scientific research relating to GMOs that responds to the 
concerns of the consumer, not just those of big business? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Louis-Hébert for the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a developing area for all of us.  What I was trying to 
say in my remarks, and it is reflective of the question and what 
is going on in the industry, is that the latent concern people 
have had about this issue has become more significant in recent 
months and the last few years.  There is a recognition that we 
need to have independent research and an arm's length or longer 
arm's length relationship between the government and generally 
speaking the transnationals that are engaged in or funding much 
of the research in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent the government's announcement to fund more 
science, scientists and chairs at universities will be helpful. 
We have gone away from that in recent years in our obsession with 
eliminating the deficit as quickly as possible and cutting back 
in so many areas of the public sector.  It is to our detriment 
that we have done that.  It seems that at least in some areas we 
are now in a period of modest growth. This may very well be one 
of them and that would be welcome news for all. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too want to indicate our appreciation to 
the hon. member for Louis-Hébert for bringing this issue before 
the House today.  It is possibly one of the most important topics 
we will be discussing this year.  If we think of the old adage 
that we are what we eat, the question we are discussing today is 
what on earth are we eating?  We do not know what we are eating. 
We do not know the impact of the foods we are eating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the number of people whom we all know who at this time 
of the year spend a good deal of their waking hours scratching 
their eyes and sneezing.  There are allergies from coast to coast 
to coast in increasing numbers.  On any plane these days half of 
the passengers are sneezing, wheezing and hacking.  It looks like 
they are all sad and crying.  It is an increasing reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we hear of pesticides all over the world and people dying 
of this and that.  There are pesticides in the snow in the 
Antarctic and Arctic, dying whales and so on.  There are 
increasing levels of cancer in our society.  I suspect there is 
not a single one of us in the House of Commons who does not have 
a close associate, friend or family member who has contracted or 
died from this horrible disease.  It is everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What causes all of this?  It is increasing.  To say it has 
nothing to do with what we are talking about today, I do not 
think anybody would believe that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important topic.  I want to indicate my 
appreciation to my colleague from Palliser for enabling me to say 
a few words about it this morning.  I look forward to listening 
to the debate as it progresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of elements of the genetically modified food issue are 
important.  As my friend from Palliser indicated, one of them is 
the issue of the environment.  In his comments he referred to a 
recent study in the prestigious <I>New Scientist</I> magazine. 
Thanks to Thomas Walkom of the Toronto <I>Star</I> it was brought 
to more public attention than those who simply read the <I>New 
Scientist</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article refers to an Albertan farmer who has recently made 
history. 
His genetically modified canola crop has created mutant weeds 
which are now resistant to not one, not two, but three common 
herbicides. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you have a quizzical look on your face.  You 
thought, like others, that the reason we used the products which 
Monsanto has been promoting was to avoid spreading extra 
pesticides on weeds.  They were supposed to take care of all 
this.  Allow me to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main selling points which the <I>New Scientist</I> 
points out regarding genetically altered crops is that they are 
supposed to require fewer toxic herbicides.  Genetically 
engineered canola, for instance, includes an alien gene which 
makes the crop resistant to specific, common, broad applications 
of garden herbicides such as Monsanto's Roundup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the farmer sprays his crop with Roundup, the theory goes, 
everything except the canola will be killed.  Otherwise the 
farmer would have to use a cocktail of more toxic, weed specific 
herbicides, including the very potent 2,4-D. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This article refers to alien genes.  I become a little concerned 
when I think of alien genes coming into my system, alien genes 
coming into my body because of what I am eating.  The thought 
that alien genes have invaded my body, and presumably everyone 
else's, makes me nervous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The backers of genetically modified food and genetically 
modified crops say that this is a boon to the environment, that 
it will save the environment and be useful for environmental 
reasons.  Surprise, surprise, the <I>New Scientist</I> is now 
almost like a joke book, because it has said “Wake up and smell 
the roses.  This is not happening”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the <I>New Scientist</I> reports that an Alberta 
farmer began growing genetically modified canola in 1997.  He 
planted one field with seed resistant Roundup from Monsanto, 
another with Cynamid's Pursuit herbicide, and the third with 
Liberty.  We are all familiar with these from our own gardening. 
The alien genes in this canola refused to stay still.  They 
migrated to the very weeds they were designed to control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 1998 the farmer found that he had weeds resistant to two of 
the three garden variety herbicides he was using.  By 1999 his 
weeds were resistant to all three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the poor farmer in Alberta has to use 2,4-D to control these 
new superweeds, these supermutant weeds which his genetically 
modified crops were supposed to have eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of this?  This is where we get kind of 
panicky, because the Ontario government has been flogging this 
report which shows that insecticide use has dropped in Ontario 
during the past 15 years.  This was to imply that these new 
Monsanto type of products were being effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now find after more thorough research that this study about 
the drop in herbicide use took place before the genetically 
modified food issue came up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened since the genetically modified crops have been 
introduced?  Herbicides have increased by 50%.  Not only are we 
using these potentially monster type approaches, we are requiring 
vastly more toxic chemicals to apply to crops as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend from Palliser pointed out, Monsanto is a little red 
faced today.  It is saying “We are getting out of this business. 
We are selling off our agricultural products and we are changing 
our name as well”.  If Monsanto is saying that it is clearing 
out of this field, that is a pretty big name and we should be 
paying attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has looked at the biotech stocks in the last little 
while has seen that they are on the way down because people are 
concerned.  They realize that maybe this has been kind of a snow 
job which we have all been led to accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend from Palliser pointed out, and I am really happy 
that he did, all sorts of private sector companies are saying 
“Listen, we are getting concerned about this from a profit point 
of view”.  Frito-Lay is saying “We are out of this genetically 
modified food business”.  McDonald's, which realizes the value 
of popular viewpoints, is saying “We are getting out of this”. 
McCain's is saying “We are out of this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All around the world people are saying “Wake up.  What is going 
on?”, except for one group of people, the folks sitting on the 
other side of the House which form the government.  They are 
sending out little brochures to everyone saying “Relax. 
Everything is okay.  We have this under control”, when in fact 
we have been hearing today that it is not under control.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this an absolute Frankenstein system?  We do not know the 
answer to that.  Many people say it is not.  Some people ignore 
David Suzuki, but a lot of people pay attention to him.  He says 
that we have to be very careful about this.  The point is, we 
really do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been handing out the document <I>Food Safety 
and You</I>, telling Canadians “Don't panic.  Don't worry, the 
Government of Canada will take care of you”.  That is probably 
the first clue to panic.  These are the same people who said 
“Don't panic.  Elect us and we will not sign the North America 
Free Trade Agreement, and for sure we will get out of the GST 
business”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When government members say “Trust us, we are working on your 
behalf”, we should be aware that these are the same people who 
promote the WTO, support the IMF, the activities of the World 
Bank and so on, unquestionably.  We should be concerned.  That is 
why having this debate today is helpful.  I want to thank my 
friend and colleague from the Bloc for making this possible.  As 
she has indicated, we will have other opportunities to discuss 
this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Palliser reminded the House, and I am pleased 
that he did, that not long ago, being normally ahead of a lot of 
the issues, the New Democratic Party saw this coming.  We 
realized we had to take this more seriously.  We introduced a 
motion at our last federal convention.  I do not have enough time 
to read the entire motion, which was overwhelmingly adopted, but 
in brief it said “Let us look into this very carefully to ensure 
that the farmers, the food producers of Canada, are protected and 
that consumers are protected.  Let us look into this issue of 
labelling foods carefully”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems a little odd to me that we would be reluctant to tell 
people what is in a food product.  Why would we not want to do 
that?  We do it for all sorts of other things.  Why would we not 
tell consumers that a certain food has been genetically modified? 
What does the government do?  I do not want to get into the 
possibilities because I would be speculating and fearmongering. 
The point is, we should let the consumer decide.  For the 
consumer to be able to decide they have to know which foods on 
the food shelves are genetically modified or have come from 
genetically modified crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my colleague from Palliser for allowing me to 
participate in today's debate and the hon. member for 
Louis-Hébert for bringing this issue to the floor of the House of 
Commons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, actually, with respect to the name of my riding, 
Victoria County has been eliminated under the new restructuring 
and it is now called the City of the Kawartha Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the member from Louis-Hébert for bringing 
forward this issue and the questions brought forward by our 
colleague from Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member deals with the allergy season and the 
medications people are required to take.  I have allergies and I 
use a spray every morning.  I suffer from watery eyes and usually 
by the end of the day I lose my voice.  Allergies have many 
different effects on people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something that has always concerned me is the labelling showing 
the country of origin on products.  A bottle of orange juice 
claims to be 100% orange juice, but on further study the label 
actually says “from concentrate”, which is really pulp.  I 
automatically think of Florida and California.  After calling the 
1-800 number for consumer information which is listed on some of 
the products, the one thing I am not told is the country of 
origin.  A lot of the pulp for oranges comes from South America, 
Malaysia, Singapore or Ceylon, places which use any kind of spray 
whatsoever.  A chemical analysis is almost required when we pick 
up a bottle of orange juice to know where the pulp originated. 
As we know, in business, whether it is making orange juice or 
anything else, it is purchased where it is cheapest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would comment on that and suggest how the 
government could correct that particular problem, which fits into 
genetically modified foods, which are also going to be very tough 
to identify unless we have a chemical analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think I can answer 
my colleague's question in any great depth, but I thank him for 
flagging another important issue that is related in some respects 
to today's discussion.  He is absolutely correct that if we are 
going to know whether we are ingesting safe foodstuffs we need to 
know their source, origin, what is being applied on those crops 
and so on.  I thank my friend for his interest in this topic and 
for adding one more element to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the opportunity to read through a recent poll, which 
indicated that 75% of Canadians are very concerned about the 
safety of GM foods and 95% said that consumers should be able to 
buy food that is not genetically modified.  Another 95% felt that 
genetically modified foods should be labelled and 56% said they 
lacked confidence in the government's ability to protect the 
health and safety of Canadians when it came to GM foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That goes back to a question that was raised earlier about 
scientific research being done and the fact that we have seen 
such significant cutbacks in federal sponsored research programs. 
A lot of this now falls in the hands of the corporations involved 
in the products or the research that they finance, which is 
always somewhat suspect.  This points out another issue that 
today's debate has revealed, which indicates the value of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by suggesting that we urge the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-food and the Standing Committee on Health to 
get together to evaluate the issues that are being put on the 
floor of the House of Commons today.  Also, as parliamentarians 
we should give some thought to having a special debate on this 
subject before the summer recess, because only a handful of 
members will be able to participate today.  That would give 
everybody who wishes to participate the opportunity.  Perhaps we 
could have an eight hour debate around this issue to get all of 
the items on the table. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the impression I got from the member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys was that he was speaking in opposition to GMOs, 
genetically modified organisms, or foods in general.  In fact, 
the allergy reference obviously indicated that any GMO would 
cause allergies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member is aware, we have a huge problem with 
peanuts.  There are a number of people in this society who are 
allergic to peanuts.  There is an opportunity, by genetically 
modifying the peanut, to remove the allergens so that people will 
not die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member say that this is an area that we should not be 
researching, that it would not be a benefit to society, and that, 
in general, we should not be going forward with GMOs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to 
my friend's intervention.  I think what we are all saying today 
is that we are concerned about genetically modified foods.  We 
want more good scientific based evidence before we proceed with 
the enthusiasm we are proceeding with today.  We want to make 
sure that the health of Canadians is not put at risk by ingesting 
these kinds of foods or foods made from these products.  That is 
all we are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell my friend what is always in the back of my mind 
when we have these discussions.  I remember the debate around 
irradiated foods.  I remember a group of scientists who came 
before the committee on irradiated foods who said that we should 
not be concerned because they had done a lot of study on rats and 
not much happened to rats that ingest vast amounts of irradiated 
food.  They said that the only things that happened were that the 
female rats often became barren and the male rats lost their 
testicles.  Other than that, nothing else happened.  We thought 
that losing testicles or becoming barren was something that we 
should be a little concerned about.  For a scientist, this was 
not an issue of much concern.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was referring to the mindset of scientists, their terms of

A bit of caution at this point is certainly warranted. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is certainly a great segue to move into my opportunity to 
talk about genetically modified organisms.  The previous speaker 
has already taken fearmongering to a whole new level.  Now we 
will obviously lose our testicles if we eat genetically modified 
foods.  By the way, we have all eaten genetically modified foods 
every day of our lives for the last number of decades.  Members 
of the House may have to go back and check to see whether or not 
they have gone through the same process the hon. member just 
suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will be sharing my time with my colleague from New 
Brunswick Southwest who will be taking 10 minutes of the time I 
have to speak.  At this time I also thank the member for 
Louis-Hébert, an excellent member on the agricultural standing 
committee who speaks with eloquence and passion when dealing with 
genetically modified foods.  She does it not as a fearmongerer 
but simply as an individual, a member of the House who wishes to 
put on the floor of the House debate of a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member previously suggested, each and every one of us 
recognizes that food safety is the vital component of the debate 
we are having today.  There is absolutely no question about that. 
Anything we deal with respecting genetically modified foods or 
biotechnology must deal with the confidence of consumers in food 
safety not only in Canada but internationally as well.  Canada is 
an exporter of a number of food products.  We must have the 
confidence of the world market in order for us to export those 
foods.  This means that we must have confidence in our food 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative government in the 1980s identified 
biotechnology as a key and strategic area of future economic 
prosperity and promise for Canada.  The opportunities with 
biotechnology and genetically modified organisms are phenomenal. 
Canada today is a leader in the research and development of 
biotechnology in GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge we now face in creating a solid and dynamic 
biotechnology industry is twofold.  First, we must create a 
climate in which industry sectors can flourish both here and 
internationally.  Second, we must meet the public's concerns 
about health, the environment and the safety of genetically 
modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although much of the focus in the media has been on food 
products derived from biotechnology, there are also 
pharmaceutical, health and pest control products on the market. 
With respect to food products, biotechnology has the potential 
too.  I would like everyone to pay very close attention because 
we have an awful lot of benefits in Canada with respect to 
biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, it increases the competitiveness of the 
Canadian agri-food industry by increasing individual 
competitiveness in exporting high value agri-food products.  We 
in Canada are an export nation.  We must export the products we 
grow in order to prosper as farmers and agri-food producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biotechnology increases the yields needed to compensate for the 
increase of world population.  We will be seen as the bread 
basket of the world.  We will be providing food for the world in 
the not too distant future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biotechnology will allow us to develop more sustainable 
agricultural practices by reducing the need for chemical and pest 
control.  The hon. member spoke about how this was a fallacy and 
that more pest control and chemicals were required.  That is not 
the case.  It has been proven by science that with genetically 
modified organisms we can control the use of our pest controls, 
which is very important for us as consumers.  I do not want to 
have any more chemical and pest control products affecting my 
food than is absolutely necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biotechnology enables the environmentally beneficial practice of 
no till agriculture, which reduces carbon monoxide emissions, a 
very important factor when dealing with the environment today. 
We recognize that we have to remove and reduce our CO2 emissions. 
One way of doing that is to allow us to develop the type of 
agricultural production which will reduce it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Biotechnology will create new markets by introducing value added 
products.  Value passed on from producer to consumer can be and 
is being done.  It is possible to immunize the population by 
placing medications in foods known as neutraceuticals or output 
traits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it was reported recently that scientists in the 
U.S. had created a strain of genetically altered rice to combat 
vitamin A deficiency, the world's leading cause of blindness.  I 
ask the member from Kamloops if it makes sense to be able to use 
the genetically modified and biotechnology science of today.   We 
would then be able to have a rice, which is consumed by the poor 
populations of the world, that will reduce vitamin A deficiency. 
This is a wonderful innovation from biotechnology.  We should not 
stop just because there are those among us who believe that we 
should go back to the way it was in the 1920s and 1930s and not 
allow us to develop our foodstuffs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of concerns.  I have done an 180° turn on the 
issue.  Initially I asked why we would want to have a mandatory 
labelling policy.  Why not?  On the food shelves of our stores 
right now 75% to 80% of products have in some way, shape or form 
been modified.  Whether it be potatoes, flour products or the 
canola oil we sometimes use for cooking, whatever we pick up has 
been modified.  Why would we want to mandatorily label 95% of 
products? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done a turnaround because I agree with the member who has 
just spoken.  Our consumers must have the opportunity and ability 
to choose what it is they are consuming.  We as a federal 
government and as members of the House have put forward the 
proper information and education.  We must allow consumers to 
make their choice based on proper science, education and 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately another group of individuals has put quite a 
substantial amount of misinformation out there which does not 
allow the consumer to make an honest and rational decision.  That 
is what we have to do.  That is where the federal government 
comes into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Louis-Hébert, a very honourable and effective 
member on our committee, has put forward a motion which speaks to 
mandatory labelling.  Unfortunately I must tell my hon. colleague 
that I cannot support her motion.  I do however support the 
principle that we must go forward and listen to the stakeholders 
who will come to our committee in the near future to discuss 
their positions with respect to genetically modified organisms 
and biotechnology.  I cannot support this mandatory labelling 
motion without listening to the arguments that will be put before 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that it may not be the only way to go.  That 
is not to say that the member for Louis-Hébert is not bang on. 
We may well have to mandatorily label.  I am perhaps leaning a 
little more to that side than I was not that many months ago. 
However I would like to listen to the stakeholders such as the 
farmers who produce the food and are impacted substantially by 
any changes we may make in the House regarding what they can and 
cannot grow effectively or economically.  Food processors will be 
impacted.  Some 95% of food products may have to be labelled if 
there is mandatory labelling.  What will that do?  It seems to be 
a waste of energy and time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens with segregation of our food products?  We do not 
have the ability currently to segregate a canola seed that may be 
genetically modified from one that may not be.  How do we 
segregate?   There may be a cost that is substantially more than 
what consumers are prepared to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Kamloops made some very valid points. 
Industry is probably its own worst enemy.  It has a tendency not 
to put forward solid, scientifically based information or to have 
a terribly good reputation when it comes to educating the public. 
Perhaps we have to move in that direction to make it more 
achievable for consumers.

them over the next number of months, but I say to the member for 
Louis-Hébert that this issue has to be dealt with sooner rather 
than later.  The hon. member and I, as well as number of other 
members on that committee, have been pushing for it for a long 
time.  The government seemed to be somewhat reluctant.  It is 
finally coming out of its shell and allowing it to happen at the 
agriculture committee.  We will finally be able to get to the 
root of some of the major issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to the speech by my hon. colleague from Brandon—Souris.  I know 
he is wise, and, if he is better informed, he will perhaps change 
his mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we can let consumers be treated as unwilling 
guinea pigs and not know what is in their plate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What interested me particularly in his speech were his remarks 
on the biotechnologies, which we all support, if they mean better 
things for humanity.  He spoke of the bread basket of the world, 
an appropriate expression for people from the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, how can we export?  We talk of the bread 
baskets of the world, so we will have to export more than we do 
now.  The canola market is closed in Europe at the moment and 
will be closed in Japan if we do not make labelling mandatory. 
There is a world trade problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How, can the government want to become an ever expanding 
exporter and fail to honour the requirements of the countries we 
export to? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Louis-Hébert recognizes that Canada depends quite a substantial 
amount on export markets, the globalization we have identified 
over the last number of years through free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of our trade partners have closed their markets with what I 
consider to be non-tariff barriers, particularly with canola, and 
that is the European Common Market.  It is not so much the 
genetically modified organisms in my opinion that have closed 
that market with non-tariff barriers.  We recognize that 
commodity has actually grown in Europe.  It is trying to stop us 
from exporting or importing into its markets a better quality and 
certainly a cheaper product than what it can produce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a global understanding as to genetically modified 
organisms.  There has to be a global agreement.  As a matter of 
fact, in Montreal recently Canada agreed with other countries of 
the world that we would have a labelling component to genetically 
modified organisms.  I am not opposed to that, as the member 
knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am simply saying that rather than identifying it as mandatory 
in the motion let us listen to the stakeholders.  Ultimately the 
decision will be made and perhaps it will be made to the 
satisfaction of the hon. member that it may well have to be a 
mandatory labelling of genetically modified organisms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is a truly interesting debate today.  It reminds me 
of the story of two economists locked in a room.  After 
discussions they came out with three different points of view 
because one disagreed with himself at the end of the day.  The 
more we listen to this debate, the more confusing it gets in a 
way.  We all have our views on the issue which are all worthy of 
note.  Who is right and who is wrong is what we are attempting to 
determine in terms of genetically altered and modified foods. 
There are varying degrees of genetically modified foods.  As the 
member mentioned, there are very few of us who will go through a 
day without having eaten some genetically modified foods.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The race to achieve success within the agricultural community is 
the one single thing that has driven this.  At the end of the day 
it means a profit for the corporations that get to the starting 
gate the quickest.  We have seen that in the U.S. and certainly 
in Europe more than in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the member from Kamloops spoke, he was questioned by my 
colleague who used the story of the peanut.  He wanted to know if 
we could genetically modify a peanut to make it less dangerous or 
not dangerous at all to those people who are allergic to the 
peanut, which is probably the number one allergic reaction in 
terms of a food commodity that can be deadly for many.  The 
member is absolutely correct in talking about what could happen 
if we were able to achieve that by taking the enzyme, which 
causes the allergic reaction, out of the peanut.  That would be 
an advancement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out how complicated this can become and ask 
where it actually ends.  I will mention something that is 
contrary to the situation that the member pointed out.  In 1995 a 
group of scientists from a company called Pioneer Hi-Bred 
International Inc. placed genes from a Brazil nut into a soybean. 
The Brazil nut is frequently seen at Christmastime and is really 
hard to crack.  The objective of placing genes from a Brazil nut 
into a soybean was to help increase the levels of the amino acids 
in the soybean which made the beans more nutritious for animal 
feed.  The plan worked but there was an unforeseen demonstration 
of what can happen in the food chain when just a few molecules of 
DNA are altered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people are allergic to the Brazil nut.  Anyone eating the 
soybean product could die from an allergic reaction without 
making the connection to the Brazil nut and this gene coming from 
it.  In other words, what might have worked for the peanut did 
not work for the soybean situation.  That just shows how terribly 
complicated it can become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case science won out because it actually was not taken 
to market because of the unforeseen consequences of crossing a 
soybean with a Brazil nut.  It might help in the House if we were 
to cross-pollinate some of the nuts in this place.   The message 
is clear that when we start tampering with science, where does it 
end.  What we are talking about today is what controls can we in 
a common sense way place on that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of what we are doing is for a good cause.  We are 
attempting to increase competitiveness, increase crops and reduce 
the number of hungry people in the world.  Those intentions are 
all good.   If we can develop a crop that is resistant to weeds 
or cold, or extend the growing season later into the fall, that 
is good, but there is also a downside. We have heard more than 
one member today speak about the effects it had on the weed crop. 
In other words, superweeds have developed in some fields around 
the crops.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now building a supercrop that, in turn, cross-pollinates 
with weeds which develop into superweeds.  We are then back to 
square one in what we can use to kill the superweed. What happens 
then?  If it is a bug, we must come out with stronger pesticides 
and herbicides to kill stronger weeds.  It is a process that 
never ends.  That is why there has to be control over it and 
common sense built into the equation before we simply run rampant 
with these advancements not knowing fully what will be there for 
us at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A poll was conducted to show what average Canadians were 
thinking about in this area of genetically altered foods.  The 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> of January 15 reported on a survey of 500 
people in Canada in late November and early December 1999.  The 
survey found that 67% said that they would be less likely to buy 
foods they knew contained genetically modified products.  A lot 
of that was through fear-mongering because there has been a great 
deal of that, as happens in any unknown science.  Another 28% 
said that it would make no difference.  Only 4% said they would 
be more likely to buy genetically altered products and 1% said 
that they were unsure.  The survey states that a sample of 500 is 
accurate to 4.5 percentage points 19 times out of 20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same survey was taken in other countries of the world.  For 
example, 82% of the people surveyed in Germany said that they 
would be less likely to buy food if it was genetically modified, 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fear is out there.  The agricultural community has to be 
cognizant of that fear.  There can be a downside to it. I am not 
disagreeing with any of the members in the House on either side 
of this issue.  It is an important one and it is worthy of 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want safeguards built in that can work.  I am not sure that 
enforcement is the right way to go on this issue.  Enforcement 
would be almost impossible.  What we want is some truth in 
labelling and public education on behalf of the consumer so that 
they are knowledgeable about what they are eating.  At this 
point, a ban would be very difficult.  It would be very tough on 
the agricultural community.  I think a great deal of study has to 
go into this topic.  I am sure that as Canadians we will ensure 
that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day I believe we will be more confused than we 
were at the start of the day.  We will agree on some things and 
disagree on others but the topic is worthy of debate.  We look 
forward to this as it goes through the various stages in the 
House.

normal, thoughtful intervention in this debate.  I find that I 
agree with much of what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With his opening remarks about two economists having three 
viewpoints by the end of the day, the member indicated the 
complexity of this issue and the need for unbiased, objective 
research.  Does he share the concern that I have, with the 
cutbacks in federal financial support for pure research, that we 
have to rely more than ever on corporate sponsored research, 
either directly or indirectly, and that this in itself will not 
necessarily hasten the clarification that we and others so 
desperately seek on this issue?. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate his views on how he sees the research, 
particularly the funding of research in this area, as having 
somewhat of an impact on its validity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a point we have to stress 
in the House, and where we are headed in the question and the 
answer, is the power of some corporations to push their agenda. 
At some point there has to be someone to call them into check and 
to examine what they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at company called Monsanto.  The resources, 
the strength and the research capacity of that company are simply 
unbelievable.  It is a case of whether the tail is wagging the 
dog when it comes to a company like Monsanto versus the 
government and public awareness.  There is a role and probably a 
stronger role for the government to do the research that is 
necessary for the safety of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much to be considered in that regard.  The federal 
government has to use enough foresight so that we have some 
confidence going into the future that these foods are safe and 
that there will not be repercussions down the road for farmers 
and consumers alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Quebec mentioned the impact some of these 
genetically altered foods have had in the marketplace in terms of 
our export capacity.  It is something for which we have to be 
careful.  I would love to think that the government is wise 
enough to put more resources into research and, at the end of the 
day, make it safer for all consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question 
involves Monsanto.  On a number of occasions the hon. member has 
indicated the very strong positioning that Monsanto has taken in 
this discussion and the development of these genetically modified 
products and genetically modified crops.  We recently learned 
that Monsanto has decided, in its best corporate interest, to 
sell off its agricultural sector and to change its name.  Would 
the member have some views on why it would have taken this 
corporate course? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, part of it has to do with 
share price.  If I am not mistaken, the share price of Monsanto 
in U.S. dollars was about $95 a share a year or so ago and it 
dropped to around $30 in December.  That was in large part simply 
because of the reaction by the public to some of these so-called 
Frankenfoods that people envisioned the company was working on. 
It basically boils down to the company moving too quickly in the 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, do you remember a company called Panasonic whose 
slogan was “Slightly Ahead of our Time”?  In politics we cannot 
be too far ahead of our time.  In business we cannot be too far 
ahead or obviously too far back, but just slightly ahead of our 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Monsanto was leap years ahead and pushed too aggressively and 
was forced to sell because of public backlash on some of the 
advances it was making.  If the member recalls, it was Monsanto 
that came up with the so-called terminator seed, a seed we would 
have to buy from Monsanto but a seed that could not reproduce. 
Someone growing wheat, canola or whatever would be forced to buy 
that seed from Monsanto year in and year out.  The repercussions 
in some Third World countries would be devastating.  They would 
be held captive by a huge corporate giant.  I think public 
reaction was one of the reasons it was forced to sell.  I think 
the public was right.  They had to bring these people into check. 
We hope governments will continue look out for the interests of 
their citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
extremely pleased to rise today in this debate I would describe 
as one of the most important ones going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has been amply studied.  We are debating this very 
important question today thanks to the work of my colleague from 
Louis-Hébert and the members of my party, who worked extra hard 
to enable us to have a real debate on this issue of the GMOs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will touch upon two points which, I think, are of 
interest for farmers. Since the riding of Lotbinière has one of 
the highest concentrations of farming in Quebec, I want to talk 
about the consequences of not labelling seeds and agricultural 
exports in general. Second, I want to talk about organic farming, 
which was adopted by many farmers in my riding who are very 
concerned about the ever increasing presence of GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us begin with the international context. On April 12, 2000, 
the European Union amended its regulations on genetically 
modified organisms, which were adopted in 1982, to impose 
mandatory labelling. Japan did the same thing and Korea is about 
to do likewise. The countries of E.U., Japan and Korea are 
countries to which Canada and Quebec export on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those countries begin to wonder whether or not our 
agricultural exports contain GMOs, our producers could lose 
millions of dollars. This is why it is so important for Canada to 
follow the example of these countries and impose mandatory 
labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of talk about GMOs these days. There may be some 
interesting things with regard to GMOs, but there is also the 
whole issue of international marketing. Last October, I attended 
a meeting, the last one before what can now be called the Seattle 
fiasco, where GMOs were at the forefront of discussions among the 
various countries present at that meeting, namely countries from 
South, Central and North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative that the federal government act quickly in this 
area to reassure farmers and also to show its biggest clients 
that it is making every effort to see to it that agricultural 
exports to those countries do not contain any GMOs. Those were my 
comments regarding the economic side of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, let us look at the side of the issue that is of greater 
interest to the riding of Lotbinière, namely the future of 
organic farming. It is a known fact that transgenic seeds are 
more expensive than traditional seeds. This means that farmers 
must have an increased yield for that practice to be 
cost-effective. It seems that the yield of GMOs varies greatly 
depending on the area and the type of soil, and some studies 
apparently show that the yield is often equal or even inferior to 
that of traditional seeds. What is Canada doing to ensure that 
serious studies on GMOs are done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the cuts to research and development budgets, the only 
studies that are now available to the Canadian government are 
studies done by companies that produce GMOs. So how can the 
government have a serious policy on the future of GMOs? Without 
long term studies, what will we know about the effects of GMOs on 
cultivated soils and on the environment around the farms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction and large scale production of GMOs is a real 
threat to organic farming. 
In the riding of Lotbinière, as well as in many others 
agricultural ridings in Quebec, there are pioneers. People have 
been fighting for 15 or 20 years. There are more and more who 
are responding to a trend, to a demand by consumers for organic 
farming. In this respect, I want to mention someone who is very 
well known in my region, namely Gérard Dubois, of Plessisville. 
As a member of the UPA, he introduced these notions of organic 
farming.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently, these people are concerned because we do not know how 
a field containing transgenic seeds may be affected. What would 
happen to another field farmed organically? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Genetically modified plants pollinate plants grown in 
surrounding fields. This is called the gene flow, because genes 
may be dispersed by wind, insects or animals over a distance of 
up to 10 kilometres, according to certain evaluations. For 
producers of organic plants and food products, this represents a 
real threat of contamination to their fields by neighbouring 
transgenic crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not know that seeds contain GMOs, and a producer 
happens to plant such seeds, one can imagine what the 
consequences could be for an organic farmer established a 
kilometre or two away if the transgenic seeds were to mix with 
the organic ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organic farmers have made enormous efforts. They have to abide 
by very strict standards in order to obtain the certification of 
their crops. 
Once again, if we ever discovered that there was even the 
slightest possibility of contamination by genetically modified 
seeds or some of their by-products, those people would see all 
their efforts of several years reduced to nothing. They could 
lose their certification if their neighbours were producing 
genetically modified plants close to their own fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a matter of common sense. How can we ask of organic 
producers that they start a business, put in the efforts and 
market organic products if the arrival of genetically modified 
seeds and plants constitutes a permanent threat to organic 
products? The federal government must act quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of my speech, I mentioned the potential threats 
to the agricultural industry and our exports to countries which 
have already moved towards mandatory labelling. 
In a riding such as mine, organic producers also feel threatened 
by the presence of genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could keep talking for a long time on this issue because I am 
vitally concerned with it. During the last two weeks of recess, 
I had the opportunity to meet agricultural producers who told me 
about their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to support the motion moved by the hon. member 
for Louis-Hébert. It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to demonstrate openness with 
regard to genetically modified organisms, starting by making 
mandatory to label genetically modified foods or foods 
containing genetically modified ingredients, in order to enable 
Canadians to make informed choices about the foods they eat. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to make another effort to inform the population of 
Lotbinière and make it aware of the issue. On June 3, we will be 
holding a symposium organized by the Centre agronomique de 
Sainte-Croix, which is affiliated with Laval University. Experts 
will be in attendance. Once again, we will bring ourselves to 
date on this most important issue of GMOs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this very popular and trendy matter, and on 
the motion by my colleague from Louis-Hébert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has done a tremendous job on this issue of 
genetically modified organisms. She is really qualified for this 
type of work. As we all know, she was the first woman in Quebec 
to graduate as a professional agrologist. She should be 
congratulated for her efforts and for her pioneering work at the 
beginning of her career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is very well informed on that subject. She has travelled all 
over the province, consulting people in every region. 
She held a town hall meeting in my beautiful riding of 
Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, which I attended. There were about 50 
people in attendance. I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank Mr. Daniel Goyer, from the UPA, and Mrs. Monique Paquette, 
from the local agricultural training center. They both helped me 
to prepare this consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amongst the 50 participants, there were farmer-producers, 
teachers, researchers, officials from the agricultural training 
center, formerly known as the Agricultural College, and organic 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to admit that the discussion was slow to start, but we 
soon found out that everybody was interested in the matter of 
genetically modified organisms. All the participants showed 
concern about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major concerns were coming from the big producers in my 
riding. They were wondering what would become of the land if 
they used genetically modified foods or products. They asked if 
they would be able to plant something other than wheat in two or 
three years. There is definitely a fear of so-called terminators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big producers said they felt compelled by Monsanto and other 
companies to use modified products, because if they did not, 
their next-door neighbour or someone over in the next riding 
would. Production costs vary greatly. With the terminators, 
there is no more need for pesticides, there is almost no need 
for spraying and one gets a yield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that consultation and the story published in the local 
papers, I received hundreds and hundreds of telephone calls at 
my office. 
As a matter, the local journalists had done a great job. I 
tabled a petition in this regard in the House, signed by people 
who supported the motion by my hon. colleague for Louis-Hébert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners asked that people at least be in a position to 
know what they were eating, to know at least whether the 
products they use contain GMOs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main concerns of the people who attended the meeting held in 
my riding, as my colleague for Louis-Hébert could confirm, could 
be summed up with these questions. Why are we genetically 
modifying plants, foods, organisms? Who benefits from that 
modification, the companies, the producers or the consumers? 
What are the benefits and the disadvantages for the producers? 
What impact do GMOs have on public health and on my own health? 
What are the issues revolving around this new type of farming 
and traditional farming? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of traditional farming, I want to digress to ask a 
question. 
Since the government over there is supposedly going to invest so 
much into research on genetically modified foods, is there still 
going to be money left for research on traditional farming? 
That is a question I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the effects of GMOs on the environment?  What are the 
social consequences of the introduction of GMOs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 50 people that got together that evening had so many 
concerns that our meeting at a sugar shack, which should have 
lasted about two hours, from 7.30 to 9.30 p.m., as my colleague 
will recall, was still going on at 10.30 p.m.  The discussion 
ran until 1.30 a.m., and the people of the community, farmers 
and the people involved in agricultural training, voiced all 
manner of concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were not ordinary people. 
They were people involved hands-on every day, the farmers of my 
riding, the berry producers, the field crop producers, the 
cattle farmers.  I must also thank the presidents of most of the 
unions affiliated with the UPA in my region, who were also 
present and voiced many concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, this meeting raised a lot of questions in my 
mind.  I am not necessarily against genetically modified foods. 
I am not opposed to the project.  Before it is introduced widely 
into the market, however, the research would have to be more 
focussed and more detailed.  I as a citizen would need to have a 
least some small idea of what the impact on my health might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that my colleague's motion calls for the minimum as far 
as the GMO issue is concerned, which is the labelling of the 
products on our grocery store shelves according to whether or 
not they contain genetically modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon all my colleagues, regardless of party affiliation, 
to support the motion by my colleague from Louis-Hébert, because 
this is, in my opinion, an issue with very considerable 
repercussions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, the Europeans are calling for the contents of 
products to be identified on the labels.  Will Quebec and 
Canadian producers not end up having their products boycotted in 
five, ten or fifteen years, as was the case with asbestos?  We 
could not sell our products in Europe or even in the U.S.  If I 
am not mistaken, I think that the Americans are in the process 
of seeing to the identification of genetically modified 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a worrisome question.  We politicians, we MPs, will have 
to consider it and try to be as reasonable as possible.  The 
first step is labelling foods we find everyday on the store 
shelves. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to rise in the House today to speak to this 
very important issue.  I represent a farming riding, at least in 
part, a significant part I might add.  The issue with respect to 
genetically modified foods is a very important debate that is now 
taking place across Canada, and certainly in my riding.  As a 
former farmer I have a very keen interest in the particular 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I want to say that Health Canada has a very strong 
responsibility to Canadians to ensure that all foods are safe. We 
know that and quite frankly take it for granted.  We need to know 
that food and the food supply, even though it is foods derived 
from biotechnology, are safe and nutritious for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to remind not only the members 
of the House but Canadians wherever they live in our great 
country that Canada in my view, and it is shared by many people, 
has the best food safety systems in the world.  We need to 
remember that and ensure that we keep it in perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when manufacturers of novel foods are required to 
notify Health Canada before the sale of their products, this in 
effect means that Health Canada ensures that a team of Health 
Canada people reviews and scrutinizes those foods.  They include 
people like toxicologists, molecular biologists, nutritional 
scientists and chemists to discuss, to look at and to conduct a 
thorough review as it relates to safety for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end I remind the House that Health Canada has 
established under the Food and Drugs Act and regulations a new 
division that defines the concept of novel food and requires 
notification prior to the sale or advertising for sale of such 
products in Canada.  This permits Health Canada to conduct a 
thorough safety assessment for each product.  That is important. 
Canadians need to know that and take comfort in that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Novel foods include but are not limited to food products derived 
from genetically modified organisms.  These kinds of regulations 
as they relate to those foods were published as part II of <I>The 
Canada Gazette</I> on October 27, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to assist developers in collecting the information 
required to demonstrate the safety of their product, Health 
Canada has issued the publication entitled “Guidelines for the 
Safety Assessment of Novel Foods”.  Health Canada's safety 
assessment approach for biotechnological derived foods reflect 
scientific principles developed through international expert 
consultations carried out by the World Health Organization and 
the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, as 
well as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important because it underscores the commitment of the 
Government of Canada to work with global partners in ensuring 
that we have the kind of food and food safety that Canadians take 
for granted. 
This approach mirrors that of the regulatory agencies of 
Australia, New Zealand, United States, Japan and other countries, 
especially those in the European Union.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach used to assess the safety of biotechnological 
derived foods was first described in an OECD publication, 
“Safety Evaluation of Foods Derived by Modern Biotechnology: 
Concepts and Principles (1993)”.  This publication was the 
report of a group of about 60 experts from 19 OECD member 
countries who spent more than two years discussing the challenge 
of how to assess the safety of novel foods including 
biotechnological derived foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the experts were all nominated by governments. 
They were regulatory scientists from government agencies and 
ministries in member countries who have the onerous 
responsibility of ensuring consumer safety.  These people were 
well versed in the kind of issues at hand and the kind of 
requirements that needed to be put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also remind the House that in 1996 after three years of 
experience in the safety assessment of various biotechnological 
derived foods participants at an expert WHO-FAO consultation 
again supported the approach used to assess the safety of 
biotechnological derived foods that was first described by the 
OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in the case for approval of most products by regulatory 
agencies around the world, companies or proponents of 
biotechnological derived foods are required to submit a set of 
data which must be of sufficient high calibre and meet the 
criteria specified in the guidelines.  This information is 
reviewed by a team of scientific evaluators representing 
expertise in molecular biology, toxicology, chemistry, 
nutritional services and microbiology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific validity of study protocols used and the raw data 
submitted are critically analyzed as indeed they should be in a 
scientific review.  If any part of the information provided is 
insufficient further studies will be provided by the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety assessment of technologically derived foods including 
consideration of the long term effects of such foods in the diet 
involves, first, how the food crop was developed, including the 
molecular biological data which characterize the genetic stage 
and change; second, the composition of the novel food compared to 
non-modified counterpart foods; third, nutritional information 
for the novel food prepared and compared to non-modified 
counterparts; fourth, the potential for new toxins; and, fifth, 
potential for causing allergic reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the tools used in the safety assessment approach for 
biotechnological derived foods is based on comparing the 
biotechnological derived food with a conventional non-modified 
food with a long history of safe use.  This is good science and 
it is appropriate that we in Canada would use it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tool is known as substantial equivalence.  This does not 
mean that we approve biotechnological derived foods if they are 
substantially equivalent to their traditional counterparts.  What 
this approach means is that scientists assess biotechnological 
derived foods against their traditional counterparts which have 
long been safely consumed in the human diet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comparative approach permits linking the composition of new 
foods to existing products with a history of safe use to permit 
predictions on the impacts of new foods in the diet.  Differences 
identified in the comparisons are the focus for further intense 
scrutiny which will involve traditional, nutritional, 
toxicological, immunological testing or long term studies as 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the important benefits of applying the concept of 
substantial equivalence is that it provides flexibility, which is 
a very useful tool in food safety assessment. 
The application of the concept allows us to consider that 
everything that is the same between the biotechnology derived 
food and conventional food to be safe and to identify any 
differences intended or unintended which would be the target of 
the safety evaluation.  Again this is important.  It underscores 
the commitment of the government in terms of good science to 
ensure food safety not only in our system but for others to 
emulate around the world.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists further focus on the novel trait or component 
introduced to foods using genetic modification.  These novel 
traits or components are then assessed using the full range of 
methods which consider the impact of the new trait or component 
in a modified organism, characteristics related to the new trait 
or component in the final food, nutritional quality, the 
potential that the new component may be a toxicant or reduce the 
nutritional integrity of the food product, and its potential 
allergenicity as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional research or testing is often required if scientists 
are not satisfied.  That is important to note because it 
underscores the commitment of the government to ensure that 
safety is the absolute key in this process.  If there is not 
satisfaction at any stage in the safety assessment process, 
further measures are taken.  Only if all of Health Canada's 
stringent criteria are met is a novel food allowed access to the 
Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns have been expressed by some advocacy groups that the 
foods and ingredients derived from biotechnology have not been 
adequately evaluated in terms of their potential long term impact 
on health, especially on human health.  Health Canada's 
regulatory system already provides for the requirement of long 
term studies when they are necessary.  It is important to note 
that Health Canada is taking a very keen lead role in this area 
knowing that Canadians wherever they live require it, demand it 
and insist on it, and rightfully so because of the importance of 
this issue. Health Canada is taking the lead required in this all 
important area.  I will give an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the application of biotechnology to a food resulted in 
significantly different nutrient combinations or other novel food 
characteristics not previously encountered in the food supply, 
long term studies would be required to further demonstrate the 
safety of the food.  If longer term studies are required, the 
food will not be approved and the company or proponent will be 
obligated to carry out those studies and report as necessary the 
findings and results before any further consideration of its 
submission.  Again this underlines the very stringent criteria 
Health Canada has in place in this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the science of biotechnology continues to evolve on a rapid 
basis, the Government of Canada keeps pace by using the best 
technology available at the moment and continually reviews the 
effectiveness of its approach in all these matters. It plays an 
active role in the international arena, for example at the WHO, 
FAO, OECD and other places.  It shares expertise in developing 
assessment strategies ensuring that Canada's strategies are as 
effective as those in other countries.  We share our knowledge 
with others and they share with us to ensure we have the best 
science, the best data and the best expertise to ensure safety in 
the food supply for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government recognizes it must ensure that it will 
have the necessary scientific and regulatory capacity in order to 
adequately regulate the products of biotechnology as a science as 
it continues to advance and new products are proposed for 
commercialization.  We see that in a non-ending pace. Everywhere 
we look new technologies are coming forward.  We on this side of 
the House and Health Canada have to ensure that these kinds of 
protocols are in place to ensure that we have the best and safest 
food supply.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, I remind all members of the House that an 
independent scientific expert panel on the future of food and 
biotechnology has been established to examine future scientific 
developments in food biotechnology.  This independent expert 
panel will also advise Health Canada, the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency and Environment Canada on the science capacity 
the federal government will require to continue to ensure the 
safety of new food products being developed through biotechnology 
in the 21st century.  What an important expert panel that is in 
order to enable the government to ensure all Canadians that the 
kind of food safety system we have is the best in the world.  It 
reflects the concerns of Canadians to ensure we have the 
processes in place to do precisely that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is absolutely committed to the ongoing 
process of ensuring that its regulations on genetically modified 
foods are appropriate for the state of science that exists 
presently as well as into the future and the types of food and 
plant products that are being developed through research.  As a 
part of this commitment Health Canada has been engaged in formal 
consultations since 1993 regarding the assessment and approval of 
genetically modified foods to strengthen the protection of health 
and safety for Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, I come from a riding that is heavily 
farmed and which includes a great deal of agriculture and 
agri-food business.  It is important that we look at food safety. 
Canadians are very interested in this matter. I am interested in 
it and I know my constituents are.  It underscores the fact that 
Canadians want the best when it comes to food and food safety. 
That is a rightful thing to ask and it is rightful to ask the 
government to ensure the safety of the food ingested by us and 
our families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report to the House and Canadians in general 
that Canada has the best food safety system in the world.  In 
co-operation with other member countries around the globe, we 
work to continually ensure that through partnership and the kinds 
of efforts made through a number of organizations, bilateral 
agreements and arrangements, we are able to share expertise, 
skill, knowledge and science and make sure that we do the right 
thing when it comes to food safety.  Why do we do that?  Quite 
frankly we do it because it is in the interests of all of us as 
individuals and for Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased the government has moved in this area in a manner 
that is consistent with the values that Canadians hold.  I am 
pleased that Health Canada and other branches of the government 
are working diligently in a manner consistent with what Canadians 
want, desire and need in this all important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to speak to this motion and indicate what we on 
the government side are doing to ensure that we continue to 
maintain good food safety for all Canadians wherever they live in 
this great country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the speech by my colleague from Waterloo—Wellington, and in 
some respects, I still have concerns on the work of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, I have the impression that the government created a 
lot of committees and panels last year, to some extent in order 
to gain a little time and to some extent to move forward so that 
at a given point it will be impossible to stop or go back.  Some 
things are being questioned, and the government is not admitting 
that.  I think, for example, of the principle of equivalence 
disputed by a number of scientists.  I am not a leading 
scientist, but I look at what is going on and it concerns me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote to the Canadian food inspection agency a year ago now, 
asking a simple question about how they approved genetically 
modified food.  I have three boxes of documents.  They are 
petitions I have been sent, it is crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at how they approved “New Leaf Y” and “New Leaf Plus” 
potatoes.  In the past two weeks, the push was on to approve 
these potatoes, because people were asking for them and Monsanto 
works with the government and was working in this case with 
potato producers.  In my opinion, there is a lack of 
impartiality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is as follows: given all of this, how can the member 
for Waterloo—Wellington say we are really safe and are doing 
the right thing? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reason I can say it is 
because it is true.  The reason it is true is because the 
Government of Canada has long since gone on record and in fact in 
deed and in word has ensured that the food safety system is in 
place in a manner consistent with what Canadians expect, what 
they need and what they desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out for the hon. member that the government 
works diligently in this very important area not only with what 
she mentioned in reference to my speech about equivalents and 
other scientific ways of measuring safety and ensuring that it is 
in place consistent with good science, not emotionalism but 
rather good science, truth and consistency. I am pleased to be 
part of a government that is able to do that, has done so and 
will continue to do it.  Canadians expect that of their 
government, they want it and they think that it is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go on record to mention what I think is an important 
point that the people of Canada should know and I challenge the 
members opposite, especially the Bloc members to ensure that they 
mention it at every opportunity.  The federal government 
encouraged the development of standards for the voluntary 
labelling of new foods.  This project was launched by the 
Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors and the Canadian General 
Standards Board with the goal of developing consistent codes of 
practice for labelling to keep Canadians better informed in this 
all important area. The Bloc members should mention that when 
they talk about food safety.  They should give credit where 
credit is due and I am sure they will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude in answer to the hon. member's question by saying 
once again that we have the best food safety system in the world. 
The reason we have it is because Canadians want it, Canadians 
need it and Canadians deserve it.  We as a government will 
continue to provide it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to address this issue, even though I did not really have 
time to prepare, because I was supposed to speak later. Still, I 
am pleased to speak from the heart about an issue which, I 
think, concerns all of us to a high degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dedicate this speech to my brother's daughter, who should be 
born today, if she is not already born at this moment. I 
dedicate my speech to her, because today's debate concerns food 
safety, something she will have to live with, as will all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased, as the first critic on globalization in the 
House, to address a topic that leads us directly to the ethical 
issues to which globalization can give rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going through a number of revolutions and the case of 
genetically modified organisms is a telling one. Globalization 
brings about all sorts of things, and we have had, among other 
issues, to deal with food safety. We can now say that the Earth 
can adequately feed nine billion people. Our planet can feed 
nine billion human beings. Since there are only six to seven 
billion of us, there is an incredible abundance of food. But the 
problem, and I think everyone here will agree, is in how that 
food is distributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But even though this is a very interesting and relevant issue, 
it is not today's topic. Today's topic is not about who will 
eat, but about what we will eat. An increasing number—and this 
is a global issue—of people all over the world are concerned 
about what they are eating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 50 or 100 years, people might look back at the history of 
genetically modified organisms and talk about how the 
international community was concerned, and about GMOs scaring 
people. That may be true. Genetically modified organisms may be 
a step in the right direction for mankind and they may be 
something extremely positive. But, then again, they might not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are perhaps long term consequences for the environment, 
food safety and human beings.  We cannot take chances when these 
are at stake.  The fact of the matter is that, right now, we do 
not know, and that is what worries me.  I am worried less by the 
positions being taken on both sides of the House than by the 
lack of knowledge about the long-term consequences of genetically 
modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find more interesting—and this will be the thrust of my 
speech—is that this is a problem like many others, but one that 
has something in common with other problems we are experiencing 
right now which are caused by globalization, i.e. it is a 
globalized issue.  I am going to use this expression because, 
when one talks about globalization, one can talk about the 
globalization of certain things, good or bad; but when I talk 
about a globalized problem, I mean that it concerns the whole 
world to the same extent ultimately. Everyone has the right to 
know what he is eating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to look at another aspect that concerns me and I will 
perhaps digress a bit from the issue of GMOs and take a look at 
globalized issues.  I find it a bit—I will not say strange—but 
perhaps worrisome that we are still debating these issues 
nationally. 
We are facing a world problem that is being debated nationally 
and I am sure that a number of parliaments in the world right 
now are raising all these questions—perhaps not today, but they 
have already addressed them or are in the process of doing so—are 
engaging in this kind of debate, particularly in Europe, where 
the issue is very advanced.  There have been international 
meetings where there was discussion about genetically modified 
organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question, and I put it to members of the House, is this: 
What is the role of parliamentarians with respect to issues that 
are now globalized?  When I refer to globalized issues, I also 
refer to the problems now caused by financial markets, by 
ecological disasters, by environmental issues, by epidemics, by 
genetic codes of ethics and all the resulting scientific 
advances. 
Who oversees these issues? Should there not be an international 
authority? Several authorities may already be examining those 
issues. Who will be responsible for legislating? Who will have to 
establish an code of ethics on the use of science on humans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have been eating genetically modified foods for several 
years already without even knowing it, and I am sure that many 
members did not know it either. We have been eating those foods 
for several years now. Have we been used as guinea pigs? Are my 
fellow citizens and myself being used as guinea pigs? I am 
concerned. I believe that the research being done in this area is 
being conducted by multinationals, large companies which have 
huge financial resources and the means to call upon the brightest 
minds and the best researchers to work for these same companies 
producing genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about this extraordinary combination of science 
and financial interests of large companies, because we cannot 
deny that the first goal of those companies is to make profit and 
become more efficient for their shareholders. I have no problem 
with that. I am concerned however about who will establish the 
rules regarding the use of scientific progress because this has 
an impact on everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listen to proponents of genetically modified organisms, I 
say “Yes, you may be right”, and when I listen to those who 
express some concern, I tell them “Yes, perhaps”. The problem 
is that I would like to be able to do like those multinational 
companies that call upon the best researchers and the brightest 
minds in the world to achieve technological breakthroughs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a political and democratic point of view, it is not time 
that we, as parliamentarians, be able to ask the best researchers 
in the world how GMOs could be used not to increase profits, but 
in regard to the safety of those organisms for human beings who 
eat them? I think this is a fundamental issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this topic of interest because all my reflection focusing 
on the urgency of discussing certain world issues more thoroughly 
relates to globalization.  I have often said I have nothing 
against globalization, far from it.  I am in favour of 
globalization if there are rules of ethics for the good of the 
people.  That is what we need at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that the direction politics and democracy must 
take is to make use of parliamentary forums and tools, to make 
use of debates, in order to find a unanimous response to 
questions as crucial to food as those relating to GMOs?  I 
believe that this entire issue must lead us to reflect on a new 
outlook, with an awareness of our limitations as members of 
national parliaments with regard to setting frameworks and 
drafting regulations that relate to problems that have now become 
global in scope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course this can be discussed in the House. Canada can adopt a 
position and then defend it in the international forum. However, 
I think that the time has come to work in a different way, to 
work all together, saying “We have a common problem here, which 
is genetically modified organisms”.  The problem is that we do 
not know what the long term effects of GMOs will be. The 
reflection will have to be focused on this with a view to a 
common solution, one which will some day bring all partners on 
line, I trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there has been considerable progress in this area, and 
everyone knows about GMOs.  The process is moving along, more or 
less, but some work has been slow.  Who is responsible?  We have 
a pretty good idea.  There is matter for concern, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see that the future will bring more and more problems and 
issues with it.  It is our duty as parliamentarians to reflect on 
this. We must quickly start thinking of mechanisms that would 
better equip us to respond properly to problems such as the one 
we face at the present time, so that the public will no longer be 
used as guinea pigs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the speech of my young colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean. I know he is 
greatly interested in globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know that groups of opponents regularly stage big 
demonstrations, in Seattle or Vancouver, or in Montreal, as we 
saw recently. Their point, and I believe it is not well 
understood, is they do not want to be regulated by 
multinationals but they want citizens to be able to express 
themselves. They talk about health, the environment and 
biodiversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean to tell us if he 
shares these concerns or if he is aware of this phenomenon. How 
could we stop it, or support it, if need be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find this a very relevant 
question, as it deals with the civil society. It is thanks to 
the civil society that we are talking about these issues today. 
It is the civil society that appealed to us, and when I say us, 
I mean politicians. The hon. member will remember that Biotech 
Action Montréal appealed to us on these issues. It is the civil 
society that sounded the alarm by submitting petitions and by 
suggesting the introduction of bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, young activists wanted to stir things up on these 
issues, because they were concerned. The same happened with the 
multilateral investment agreement where, for the first time, we 
saw a activist movement globalize through the Internet, which 
led to these issues being raised. We saw this also in Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I think that, in a democracy, people need to be 
vigilant. 
In this case, it is the people who alerted parliamentarians to 
these issues. So I applaud all the activists and all the people 
who are interested in these collective issues that are of 
crucial importance for the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All my colleagues in the House certainly agree that we are 
confronted with so many increasingly complex issues that the 
civil society should act as a watchdog and alert parliamentarians 
to these issues before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply impossible for any member of Parliament to keep 
track of all problems. If the public is vigilant, issues end up 
in the political arena. An example of this is Biotech Action 
Montréal, which took an interest in food security, helped with 
research, raised concerns, underlined the long term impact of 
genetically modified foods, and informed the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what should be done. It is wonderful. In this 
instance, the voice democracy was heard. I hope there will be 
more cases like this one. I encourage all citizens to be more 
vigilant. These issues are fascinating and very interesting, but, 
most of all, they are crucial for mankind. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to this opposition 
motion of the Bloc Quebecois on the labelling of genetically 
modified foods, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to demonstrate openness with 
regard to genetically modified organisms, starting by making it 
mandatory to label genetically modified foods or foods containing 
genetically modified ingredients, in order to enable Canadians to 
make informed choices about the foods they eat. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate deals essentially with the rights of citizens to get 
correct information so that they can make an informed choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is of great importance considering the impact of all 
the new biotechnologies and the intensity of the debate 
surrounding the issue of genetically modified foods. Since the 
famous Aldous Huxley novel <I>A Brave New World</I> was published, the 
reality of new technologies has gone way beyond fiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first stars of these new technologies was named 
Dolly. It was the first cloned animal. Something that used to be 
found only in science fiction novels became reality and it 
rekindled the debate on the relationship between ethics and 
science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for foods containing genetically modified 
organisms. 
There is nothing wrong with the idea of modifying organisms such 
as plants to give them characteristics that they would not 
naturally have, to make them more resistant to diseases, for 
example, or more resistant to harsher climates—we know the 
climate in Quebec and Canada is often difficult for plants. 
Doing so to increase the productivity of certain varieties can 
also be considered progress. After all, we must feed the planet, 
which is faced with such problems as desertification and the 
decreased productivity of certain soils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could also be very beneficial to consumers like you and me. 
But it still raises several issues. For example, at this time, 
no one can predict accurately the long term effects of these 
modifications on the genetic heritage of our planet. Some people 
do not hesitate to call genetically modified foods frankenfoods. 
This is not very reassuring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate this, I would like to mention a case that drew the 
attention of a lot of people recently. A Newfoundland researcher 
succeeded in modifying the growth process of a type of salmon, a 
species we know is on the verge of extinction. He managed to do 
that through genetic manipulation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As seen on TV, the result was striking, the modified salmon was 
two or three times larger than a natural salmon of the same age. 
Of course, fishermen might be interested in catching such an 
extraordinary specimen, but what about when the salmon ends up on 
one's plate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not inappropriate to call for a public debate, a broad 
discussion, since genetically modified foods, salmon being only 
one of them, end up daily on our plates without our really 
knowing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to existing data, 50% to 60% of the food for sale in 
Canada or Quebec's food markets, food that we eat contentedly 
three times a day, sometimes even four, contain genetically 
modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are beautiful, unblemished tomatoes, perfectly symmetrical 
potatoes, corn, canola and soybean. This is definitely not a 
rhetorical debate, but one that concerns all Canadians, because 
it involves our food supply, our health and the health of our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, the government must make it mandatory to label 
GMOs. The right to information exists; Canadians have the right 
to make choices, informed choices, about the foods they eat. 
Mandatory labelling does not mean a ban on these products. The 
object is to let the consumers know what is in the products they 
are buying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current regulations already require that labels on food products 
list all the ingredients. Have you ever looked at these labels, 
Mr. Speaker? Of course not, but I am sure you eat nothing but 
butter. I would suggest though that you take a minute to look at 
the long list of ingredients in ordinary margarine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be most advisable to clearly identify GMOs, as we 
already identify other ingredients. Moreover, the fact that the 
GMO labelling is not mandatory will only make a good number of 
people suspicious, that is those who are aware of the potential 
risks this technology poses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mandatory labelling is not only for the benefit of consumers, 
but also for the benefit of producers. It could help to maintain 
the level of food and agricultural exports from Quebec and 
Canada. Many countries have already adopted measures to make 
labelling mandatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 12, the European Parliament amended its 1992 
regulations, making GMO labelling mandatory. The products that 
contain more than 1% of GMOs will now have to be labelled in 
order to be offered throughout the European Union territory. We 
are talking about millions of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can ask ourselves if the products made in Quebec and in 
Canada will still be allowed onto the European market. Could it 
be that by refusing to make the labelling mandatory, we could be 
putting our food and agriculture industry at risk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amongst the countries who have already adopted these kinds of 
measure are Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea. These 
countries are all in the Far East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of my speech, I talked about the ethical aspect 
of the issue we are debating today. Scientific research has to 
be governed by an code of ethics to guarantee that these studies 
are carried out in the best interests of the population and not 
in the sole and sacrosanct interests of the biotechnological 
companies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, there is the whole issue of intellectual property 
as it relates to living organisms.  When a company succeeds, 
after much research and millions of dollars of investment, in 
isolating a given gene, at the present time it can then patent 
that gene.  We must ask ourselves whether it is desirable for 
the genetic heritage of a planet to be privatized, in a way, 
solely and uniquely to benefit the biggest and most successful 
of businesses because they have more money to invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, if these few companies control a sizeable proportion of 
genetic engineering, one may well wonder also whether other 
researchers will be able to continue to move ahead in the same 
field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a few companies control the world market in seeds, 
insecticides, herbicides and pesticides.  I do not need to name 
names.  Everyone knows who they are.  This has significant 
consequences on supply prices and security, and on farmers' 
lifestyles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an illustration of this, there are two types of seed that 
have been modified to be herbicide resistant, both made by the 
same company.  Farmers are therefore in a way slaves to a 
certain company.  This does not strike us as being in the 
interests of the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the so-called terminator technology, which 
produces plants whose seeds are sterile.  This is getting pretty 
close to Aldous Huxley. 
Farmers, particularly those in the developing countries, are 
opposed to this technology, which prevents them from producing 
seed to sow for their next crop, thus creating dependency on the 
seed companies, which is both increasing and unavoidable. 
Strong objections have kept this technology from being put into 
application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is vital, therefore, for the government to act as a prudent 
administrator by making it mandatory to label genetically 
modified foods and by establishing measures for detailed testing 
in order to assess the long term impact of GMOs on human health 
and on the environment, as well as passing, after consultation, 
legislation on the safe and ethically responsible use of 
genetically modified organisms and on the creation of a 
structure for informing and educating the public.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with some interest to the member opposite.  I 
can tell the House that I was born, raised and still live on the 
family farm.  For me and indeed for all Canadians it is very 
important that we have very stringent criteria when it comes to 
food safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say that?  The answer is clear:  Canadians deserve and 
expect a food safety system that is in place and they expect 
their government to ensure it is in place in a manner consistent 
with what Canadians not only need, but require for themselves and 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House that Canada has the best food safety system 
in the world.  We have gone to great lengths through the years to 
ensure that we have a system in place that underscores the 
commitment of the government and our people to get the right 
quality of food, nutritious food and good high calibre food in 
keeping with the Canadian way.  I think it is important that we 
emphasize that and that we understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that Canada chairs the Codex 
Alimentarius committee on food labelling, which is an 
international body.  It underscores the fact that Canada is part 
and parcel of partnerships throughout the globe when it comes to 
this all important area.  I think Canadians, wherever they live 
in this great country of ours, need to know the high calibre and 
the high regard in which Canada is noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that our Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food on September 17, 1999 announced the voluntary labelling 
of foods derived from biotechnology. 
That was in partnership with the Canadian Council of Grocery 
Distributors as well as the Canadian General Standards Board. 
That too underscores the commitment of our government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member.  I want to know if the 
sovereignists can tell us where the $37 million in federal money 
went which was allocated to farm insurance stabilization in 
Quebec.  Why did the Quebec government not include it in its 
budget for the year 1998-99, as reported by the auditor general 
of Quebec on March 28?  I want to know from the hon. member where 
the money went that was allocated for farm insurance 
stabilization.  Where is the $37 million hiding?  Where did it 
go?  Why was it not spent in the appropriate place?  Why was it 
not spent?  Let us hear the sovereignists answer that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, after having praised 
the quality of Canadian food products, which nobody denies, I am 
pleased to tell my hon. colleague, in response to his brilliant 
speech, that the money he mentions was handed over to the 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see how making labeling mandatory—because the issue, 
here, is voluntary labeling, and everybody knows what happens 
with voluntary measures—would undermine the quality and the 
reputation of food products coming from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must have a very narrow vision to think that our reputation 
would be tarnished if we adapted to a new reality. My hon. 
colleague should be proud that there are in this parliament 
sovereignist members who want to have a debate on something that 
is fundamental for everybody, whether one is a sovereignist or a 
federalist. I would not want my hon. colleague, who is so 
brilliant, to lose some of his smarts after eating too much 
genetically modified food.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was interested in the motion put forward by our colleagues in 
the Bloc.  On the surface, when we first read it, it seemed to 
have merit.  Why would we object to labelling on these foods so 
that the Canadian people can be sure that what they are getting 
when they go to the grocery store is safe and has passed all the 
appropriate tests?  Who would object to that?  It is an 
interesting concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at what has happened in the area of GMOs, 
genetically modified foods, on the surface for the Canadian 
public it is a little frightening.  We hear of huge cucumbers. 
They tried growing them in Newfoundland.  Actually, they were 
sprung cucumbers.  They sprung a leak and never got off the 
ground.  They tried doing it many years ago.  This is not new. 
This is rather old stuff.  It did not work.  The market was not 
there.  People looked at these things and said “My God, what are 
they?”  They did not feel comfortable with them.  Even though 
genetically they had been altered, they were safe and there was 
no question of consumption or safety issues involved.  However, 
it did not fly in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the issue around modifying food genetically and why 
would we be concerned about telling people on a label exactly 
what it is they are getting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike my colleague, I was not born on a farm, have not lived on 
a farm and do not live on a farm at the moment, but, as you can 
tell, Mr. Speaker, I enjoy food, as we all do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On a serious note, if they are improving the crop, if they are 
improving the yield, if they are improving the quality of the 
product, is this not something that we should perhaps investigate 
to determine whether or not it is safe?  I think we should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through motions like the one before us today and debates by some 
members in this place we create a sense of fear that we should 
not eat something because it will ruin our liver or whatever.  In 
any event, we understand that it is creating an atmosphere of 
fear.  The purpose of the motion is not to say that genetically 
modified foods are safe.  It is to somehow try to paint the 
government into a position of being embarrassed because it does 
not want to share the information with people.  That is not true. 
That is one of the fundamental flaws of a motion like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite know that Canada leads the world in food 
safety.  People come from all over the world to visit Health 
Canada and our other regulatory bodies so they can see what 
procedures we have in place to determine whether or not food is 
safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one hand I say to Bloc members that I would like to think the 
intent of what they want to do is good.  We want ensure the food 
that goes on our tables for our children is safe every day. On 
the other hand, I wonder if there is not a hidden agenda, 
particularly when funds, such as the $37 million my hon. 
colleague mentioned, are transferred to the provincial government 
only to disappear somehow magically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They may show up as Premier Bouchard, the new reborn Mike Harris 
of the province of Quebec, finds a way to suddenly become a 
revolutionary and bring forth budgetary cuts and tax cuts.  Maybe 
the money that was given to Quebec for the specific purpose of 
dealing with food safety will show up in some mysterious way in a 
tax cut.  It would not surprise me.  We have seen it before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen what Mr. Harris has done in that regard by simply 
borrowing money, increasing the total debt of the province of 
Ontario by $21 billion while somehow trumpeting the fact that he 
is giving a tax break.  We all know that he is giving a tax break 
to his rich friends and not helping the people who need help.  I 
digress somewhat from the issue but it will probably occur from 
time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not had the opportunity in this place of listening to the 
position of the Canadian Alliance Party.  It occurred to me that 
this would be a perfect motion for that party to debate because 
what we are seeing is a genetically modified political party.  It 
is trying to turn itself inside out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that when we genetically modify a lemon we get a 
lemon.  It might be bigger.  It might be more yellow.  It might 
be sweeter, but we still get a lemon.  When a political party 
like the Reform Party is genetically modified we get a lemon 
again.  I do not think there is any question about it.  I have 
not heard its position. A little bird told me that it will 
support the government on this issue.  Every time that happens I 
say to myself that maybe we are wrong, maybe we should revisit 
it. I heard someone else say that it would not support the 
government on this issue.  Frankly that party has been all over 
the map. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share a couple of quotes.  I took a look at the new 
book of the genetically modified political party and I tried to 
see if there were any differences.  It is pretty much the same 
old gang that cannot shoot straight.  I do not know why this 
gentleman constantly gets quoted, but the member for 
Yorkton—Melville said in a local paper about his party that the 
principles and policies of Reform are in there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My dear friend, the member for Wild Rose, said in a newspaper in 
his riding that he would always be a Reformer.  He had his hat 
and boots on.  He said that he would always be a Reformer and 
that this new party was based on Reform Party principles and 
platforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where will that party go with genetically modified food?  Will 
it change its position?  We have seen more flip-flops on this 
issue, but it is still sticking by the old principles, and I know 
it is an oxymoron, of the former Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lakeland said that they would stand for the same 
things that they were elected on.  Will that be the case for 
GMOs?  Will that mean they will line up and vote with the Bloc on 
this issue?  Will they line up and vote here?  It is truly a 
mystery.  We can watch the process unfold.  We can watch the fact 
that many members are busy working on various campaigns and 
trying to bring in members of the Conservative Party of Ontario 
that do not want to come.  It is an absolutely amazing sight.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I am not worried.  What I am really 
curious about is what this group will do in relation to the 
particular motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
have been listening for some time now to what the hon. member has 
to say. I am usually very tolerant. On a matter of such 
importance, in a very serious debate on genetically modified 
organisms, how can we, in this House, let the hon. member go off 
topic and get into purely partisan issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I ask you to call the hon. member to order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I listened carefully to the comments made 
by the hon. member for Mississauga West. I heard him say the 
words genetically modified in his speech. That is why I did not 
interrupt him. While he is talking about a genetically modified 
political party, he is not too far off topic and, hopefully, he 
will soon get back to the motion before the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the member should 
show a little patience because the point of what I am attempting 
to put across is simply that there are five parties in this 
place.  Actually we are not sure how many parties there are any 
more.  We know the position of the Bloc.  I am trying to 
determine what will be the position of the official opposition or 
in fact whomever it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants me to be a little more serious about the 
issue, as he said, why would the Bloc put forth a motion to force 
mandatory regulation, to force the machinery of government into 
an industry that already has the safest testing methods in the 
world?  I made that point earlier and I was being quite serious 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Bloc doing this because it is concerned about the safety 
and quality of food or because it is one of those bugbears?  This 
is one of those issues with which we can whip people into a 
frenzy: that if it is genetically modified it will cause an 
illness, will cause cancer, will lead to blindness or will do who 
knows what.  We can fearmonger with any issue we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that the government led the way.  We have been 
working with consumer groups.  We have been working with 
agricultural groups.  Health Canada continues to monitor the 
safety of food.  If there were any doubt in that regard, perhaps 
the suggestion would make some sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also chair an international body that develops food safety 
standards called the Codex Alimentarius Committee on Food 
Labelling.  We are doing work in this area.  If the member wants 
to say that somehow we should eliminate this science, I would 
question that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at the fact that in 2000 and the years to come 
there will be ways of increasing the productivity of agricultural 
food producers in this country and around the world.  Lord knows, 
we have a serious problem in many parts of the world where this 
would be a major asset, perhaps allowing Canada to extend more of 
the already very generous foreign help that we offer throughout 
the world.  In areas where there is famine and terrible 
tragedies, why should we not look at this?  Instead of focusing 
on what may be politically exciting, why not focus on how we can 
improve science in this area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give the example of health products.  We all know that there 
was quite a controversy.  I recall going with the Minister of 
Health into an area of downtown Toronto where health products 
were being sold, all these different products that are for sale 
in drug stores now.  Many of us take them on a regular basis in 
the belief that they are doing something for our systems.  They 
are not based on prescription drugs but rather on natural 
products coming from the earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe they have an impact.  I have no scientific proof of 
that.  I am not a scientist or a doctor.  I am not trained 
medically to make that decision, but I believe that they improve 
diet and health.  Hopefully they will keep people out of hospital 
and out of the medical system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big fear about them and the reason there was a big question 
about whether or not they should be required to be regulated and 
licensed in the same way, prescribed by a doctor, kept behind the 
counter and away from the public, was some imaginary safety 
problem.  The research was done by Health Canada.  Our Minister 
of Health went out to that community and determined that they 
were safe products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ensure that the Canadian public has the confidence 
that the investigatory and regulatory bodies of this government 
and provincial governments where appropriate have done their 
homework.  Because of that we have to know the various positions 
of those who would purport or wish to govern in any particular 
legislature or parliament.  That is why I raise the issue of the 
flip-flops and concerns about the Canadian Alliance.

billion new dollars each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The teachers recommend that the funds be allocated to seven 
priority areas, including a comprehensive early childhood

Look at the hon. member for Ahuntsic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today let us look at the spending patterns at the Atlantic

</I></B></P><P align=left>We obtained a list of all ACOA grants, contributions and loans 
from 1996 to 1999.  There was a dramatic increase before and 
during the 1997 election writ period.  Average monthly spending 
jumped from $30 million to $54 million just before the election 
and to a high of $71 million by the end of the campaign.  It is 
plain and simple.  It is just like the transitional jobs fund.

period of time when ACOA did spend a lot of money and it was not 
exactly on good investments.  What was that period, as defined by 
the auditor general and the public accounts?  The years 1991 and 
1992 when the political party was in that the hon. member wishes

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

spending jumped by a total of $100 million during the 1997 
campaign.  That is $100 million that could have gone to tax 
relief.  It could have gone to hospital beds.  It could have gone 
to education.  It could have gone to something useful.  Instead, 
the Liberals spent it on ACOA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the long-suffering taxpayers have to spend their tax

<A NAME="LINK196">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was earlier pointing out some interesting anomalies in the 
political structure and relating them to this issue.  I do not 
want to go back there because I think I made the point that we 
have a genetically modified political party in our midst.  I will 
let people think about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to stress is why an opposition party would feel 
the need to put forward a motion that would require tremendous 
regulatory efforts by the government to mandate labels on 
products that are clearly tested and go through a very stringent 
safety program.  Perhaps we could deal with the facts instead of 
the fearmongering that we see around this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure it is confusing, if not boring to most Canadians when 
they hear the issues around modifying food genetically.  I am 
sure it is extremely important, however, to the agriculture 
producers, to the industry, and to all of the different 
associations and groups that work in the industry.  That is why 
this government has attempted to work with all of those groups to 
ensure there is a process in place which will provide the safety 
mechanisms and checks for food that will be sold to the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some comments were made that perhaps the government was not 
taking this motion seriously enough.  There may be a reason for 
that suggestion or that feeling.  The reason is that it smells a 
little more like pure politics rather than dealing with the 
facts.  I want to take a moment, if I may, to share some of the 
facts, the background and the research that we have done on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is looking for a solution to the problem which 
will provide a level of confidence to the Canadian consumer while 
at the same time allowing producers to access the new science and 
technology that is available.  In virtually every walk of life 
science and technology grows in leaps and bounds.  There are 
tremendous advances, virtually on a daily basis.  We have to make 
sure that we stay abreast of all of them and not simply scare 
people into thinking there are problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard we invested $90 million in the last budget, not 
only to ensure that we stay on top and on the cutting edge of 
this biotechnology, but also to ensure that our food inspection 
and regulatory system remains first class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that area I want to say once again that Canada has a 
reputation for having the finest safety system for food 
inspection in the world.  It is not just standing and beating our 
chests or doing a beer commercial and saying “I am Canadian”, 
it is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada works very closely with all different agencies to 
ensure that the Canadian people can trust the products that go on 
the shelves of their grocery stores.  It works very diligently 
with the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that there is safety 
in the drugs that are produced.  It works very closely the 
companies which produce health products to ensure that what is 
being put on the shelves is safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about many of those different products that have burst 
on to the scene in recent years, which hopefully will help to 
prevent illness and make Canadians more healthy, with the idea 
that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is very diligent about ensuring that all of the 
products which are available to the consumer are safe.  I would 
suggest that is true in the case of GMOs just as much as it is in 
health products and drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important that we realize what we as 
parliamentarians, as a government and indeed as members of the 
opposition should be saying to the Canadian people.  We should be 
saying that we are prepared to ensure that the new sciences, the 
new biotechnological efforts that are being put into modifying 
food for the purpose of increasing production and making more 
food available to Canadians, will ensure that the food is 
nutritious and will fit into the Canadian diet without causing 
any form of illness.  We should stop the fearmongering that this 
motion is attempting to bring about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened to what my colleague from Mississauga 
West has had to say before and after Oral Questions.  I note that 
he has become more serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before Oral Question Period, he sort of went off topic.  He 
referred to the former Reform Party members, now members of the 
Canadian Alliance.  This was a kind of departure from the debate 
on GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that he has got back to being serious, I would like to ask 
him some serious questions.  He seems not to be in favour of 
labelling GMOs.  This does not mean banning them or preventing 
studies or experiments. There is simply a need to respect the 
public's right to know what it is eating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he refers to the numerous consequences of labelling, I 
would like to hear some figures from him.  How much will this 
cost?  Has he evaluated this or examined the studies?  Even if he 
managed to come up with figures, we must ask ourselves: If people 
want to know what they are eating, is this not a right that must 
be respected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is Canada one of the countries most vehemently opposed to 
such labelling?  The European countries have adopted it, as have 
Japan and South Korea.  These are civilized nations.  Why would 
what is good for Europe be bad for us and for our producers? 
There seems to be a world trend toward being more and more in 
favour of labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear his explanation of this. It seems more as 
if he were inviting us not to support a policy of transparency. 
It is as if he had something to hide.  I trust that is not what 
he wants people to think, that Canadian farmers have something to 
hide.

mean.  They are almost never applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to clarify his position, to give us the 
technical and financial data that would justify his position.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am curious about the 
question.  By the way, I could not resist poking a bit of fun at 
the genetically modified political party.  There is nothing wrong 
with having a bit of that mixed in with what I perceive to be a 
very serious topic, but let me answer the gentleman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, I have not done an analysis of the cost.  This is where I 
have some concern.  The question was about why we are not in 
favour of voluntary labelling.  Those were the member's words 
through the translator, and I am assuming they were translated 
correctly.  We are.  We already have voluntary labelling.  We 
have encouraged the development of standards for the voluntary 
labelling of new foods including what might be called designer 
foods.  This project was launched by the Canadian Council of 
Grocery Distributors and the Canadian General Standards Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just add, in answer to the hon. member, that the 
government has asked the Canadian General Standards Board to 
develop a Canadian standard for voluntary labelling in 
consultation with consumer groups, producer groups, interest 
groups and other governments.  If the member is saying we should 
have voluntary labelling, I think Bloc members should stand to 
clarify their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make labelling mandatory when we already have an extremely 
successful inspection system in place to ensure both quality and 
safety in terms of the products that hit the kitchen table is 
nothing more than asking to extend the long arm of government and 
bureaucracy.  Although I have not done the cost analysis, I 
assume it would cost a tremendous amount of money to the industry 
and would be a price that need not be paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B>  Sit down, sit down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I do not need to sit down because you 
do not happen to agree.  Voluntary labelling is a totally 
different issue.  It is like Bloc members to sit there and say 
“sit down” when they do not like the message, when they do not 
like the truth that comes from this side of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my hon. colleague who 
uses great eloquence in the House.  With grace, wit and humour he 
is always on his mark in terms of how he delivers his speeches. 
He knows exactly the kinds of issues that affect Canadians, and 
on this there was no exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in the Bloc member's question.  Some $37 
million went missing in terms of federal money that went to 
Quebec.  Even the auditor general of Quebec is quoted in <I>Le 
Devoir</I> as wondering where that money was.  They can caterwaul 
all they want over there.  They can natter away, but the reality 
is that there are $37 million of federal money for which they 
cannot account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member for Mississauga West.  He 
represents a great part of Ontario.  I listened with interest to 
how he noted that the Reform-CCRAP alliance has been genetically 
modified.  The only comment I would add is that in light of the 
genetically modified Reform-CCRAP alliance perhaps we should have 
an amendment today that requires the Canada Elections Act to be 
amended so that there is a warning label on the ballot to 
indicate that those people opposite are nothing more than the 
reformed, warmed over people they were before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never mind that.  Does the hon. member agree that Canada, under 
the leadership of the Prime Minister and the minister of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we should stand 
to congratulate the member for Waterloo—Wellington for those 
wonderful words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a serious note, though, I want to share with the House what 
actually takes place.  It is important that Canadians understand 
that the motion was drafted with some political intent.  All GMO 
foods must be submitted to Health Canada for a strict safety 
evaluation by an expert team of toxicologists, biologists, 
environmental scientists, chemists and nutritionists to determine 
if the food is as safe and nutritious as food already in the 
Canadian marketplace.   I do not know if I want to eat it after 
they have all had a hand in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The team considers how the crop was developed, including the 
molecular biological data which characterize the genetic change, 
the composition of the food compared to its traditional 
counterpart food, the nutritional information compared to 
non-modified counterparts, and the potential for introducing new 
allergens and toxins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on this file as a government.  We are doing the job.  To 
the question asked by the hon. member on whether Canadians can 
feel safe with the quality of food I say absolutely, with the 
systems we have in place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here today to 
speak to the Bloc motion concerning mandatory labelling of foods 
produced from genetically modified plants and seeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I have heard from the Bloc Quebecois speakers today, 
they seem to place a high emphasis on the organic farm industry. 
That is what they seem to be trying to represent with the motion 
today.  At the end of the debate we will see that a broader 
perspective should be taken and the whole of agriculture, 
including a lot of social aspects of the issue, has to be 
examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biotech industry is important to Canada and is growing.  It 
must be debated within reason and not have restrictions placed on 
it that would unduly hamper, for no good scientific reason, the 
advancements that will make our lives and the lives of our 
grandchildren better in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 282 biotechnology companies in Canada.  There are 
10,000 employees in the industry, 1,900 in agriculture and food 
processing and 6,700 in the health care sector.  Employment 
forecasts are that it will increase by 10% over the next year. 
Biotechnology company sales are in the neighbourhood of $450 
million in seed, feed, foods and other products.  The last 
statistic that I will give is that 46% of Canadian biotechnology 
companies operate in health care and 29% in agriculture.  The 
issue is much bigger than just food supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago most people would not have heard of 
biotechnology or knew what it meant.  Scientific breakthroughs 
such as Dolly the cloned sheep have vaulted the word into 
headlines around the country.  However, most of us still have the 
uncomfortable feeling that we really do not know what 
biotechnology means.  That is where the government of the day 
needs to come in with excellent information programs for the 
general public so that public fears will be allayed and people 
who are fearmongering, like some of the special interest groups 
are doing, will not hold sway with their arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must address the concerns of Canadians who chose 
not to eat food containing GMOs, as well as Canadians who want to 
chose the increased variety at lower produce costs.  We see that 
this can be accomplished through voluntary labelling in the 
marketplace, including food companies, grocery stores and fast 
food outlets quickly going to a voluntary system in order to 
continue making sales.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard a few red herrings being thrown out, particularly 
by our NDP friends, with regard to Europe not accepting beef that 
had received growth hormones at some point while it was being 
fattened for slaughter.  That one case is the best example that 
science should rule the trade world.  Europe has been found at 
fault in that issue and has no scientific reason to restrict 
imports.  As a result it is paying penalties for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go into the rest of the NDP logic with regard to 
supporting mandatory labelling, but it is a poorly thought out 
position for a party to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mandatory labelling of all genetically modified organisms would 
place a significant financial burden on Canadian farmers, food 
manufacturers and consumers.  Increased costs of product 
segregation beginning at the farm gate would dramatically 
increase the costs of storing, transporting and processing 
Canadian grain. It is not impossible to do this, but if it were a 
mandatory requirement by government regulation the question of 
who would pay the costs would have to be decided.  All 
technological requirements of segregation would be very complex 
and would increase the cost of our food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc is calling for this in spite of the fact that there is 
no scientific evidence of any kind that food produced from 
genetically modified seeds is any different from food produced 
from seeds that have not been genetically modified.  We are 
talking about the same food with no detectable change to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the increased costs, the product price for consumers 
would rise and the net commodity price for farmers would fall. 
Farmers have traditionally never been able to pass along the 
costs.  I do not see how this would be any different if mandatory 
labelling were required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmer choice would also fall.  Because of increased costs 
farmers would have fewer commodity varieties to choose from.  In 
modern farming practices it is important to have access to GMO 
crops due to disease that is better controlled through genetic 
manipulation of the plant characteristics.  Consumer choice both 
in terms of price and variety would also be lessened by mandatory 
labelling.  Without having genetically modified crops available, 
all these options would be taken away and we would all be poorer 
for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumer demand has created a market for products voluntarily 
labelled free of genetically modified organisms.  No one has any 
problem with that.  If the farmer is fully compensated for his 
production he will produce what the consumer is willing to buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal regulators recognized this demand far too late and have 
failed to develop guidelines for voluntary labelling.  I know 
that is currently being done, but it should have been done when 
GMOs were being researched back in the early nineties and science 
was advancing to the point where we knew they would be available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under a voluntary labelling system GMO-free foods would be 
marketed similarly to organic foods.   Voluntary labelling would 
address the calls for consumer choice.  Ultimately that is 
exactly where it has to be.  I will point out later in my speech 
some of the problems that consumers face if food prices become 
very high.  Consumers would shift to various types of foods to 
find a source of protein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voluntary labelling would address the needs of producers, giving 
producers who want to grow GMO-free crops the ability to develop 
niche markets.  There is nothing the matter with that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voluntary labelling would also correctly dilute the costs 
associated with segregation.  Here again it would be farmers, the 
grain handling industry, the grain companies, the railways and 
the truckers all responding to a legitimate market signal 
indicating that there was a demand for segregation and the 
foodstuff that is either GMO or non-GMO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear a lot of negativity that it is people who do not want the 
GMOs but as we see, developments are coming along so that people 
will demand the GMO product and GMO food.  One indicator for the 
poor countries of the third world in particular is that rice is 
to be modified.  It will give them a vitamin source which they do 
not currently have which will prevent blindness which is endemic 
in some parts of the world due to diet.  Voluntary labelling 
would correctly distribute the costs associated with segregation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken about the size of the industry in Canada and that 
it is growing.  I should point out at this time that other 
countries are booming along with their research and development. 
In particular the third world countries realize it is the only 
way they will be able to feed their ever increasing populations. 
It is only the super rich countries that have the luxury of saying 
“Maybe we should label this, maybe we should scare everybody off 
and we will not have to worry about feeding our population 
because we can afford to do it”.  An awful lot of poor people 
around the world cannot afford that luxury.  In fact there are a 
lot of poor people in Canada who cannot afford it either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biotechnology offers significant benefits. One benefit is drugs 
to treat cancers, AIDS and diabetes. We also see increased and 
more effective vaccines, antibiotics, insulin and hormone 
replacement.  We see new high nutrition foods, new production 
methods and varieties that will allow farmers to better manage 
weeds and insects while reducing the use of chemical pesticides. 
We will also see opportunities for better management of municipal 
waste and toxic spills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biotech industry has indicated that its research will have 
great benefits for the future.  Examples are new vaccines for 
common diseases such as malaria and cholera.  Those diseases kill 
millions of people each year, not in Canada but in third world 
countries which have those problems.  There is gene therapy for 
hereditary disorders.  It is also possible to remove allergens 
from food crops.  There is the improvement to the nutrition or 
shelf life of fruits, vegetables and grains.  I mentioned rice 
with enhanced vitamin A and iron to reduce child blindness. 
Vaccines are built into crops, fruits and vegetables.  We have 
increased productivity from the world's farmers.  This is 
necessary to meet the nutrition needs of the world's growing 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also are looking for rapid reforestation of areas that have 
either been logged or destroyed through natural means.  We need 
to restore those forests.  There is conversion of organic wastes 
into biofuels.  There is also better, more efficient use of the 
world's scarce arable land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These tremendous advancements that are available and the 
potential benefits to mankind will not come about if we scare the 
consumer from consuming the very products both on the health care 
side and the food side to the point where the research companies 
will no longer invest in research.  I take the stand quite 
clearly that if the product, the vaccine, the treatment for AIDS 
or cancer or the food that we consume has been checked out by the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency and it has been scientifically 
proven to be safe within acceptable risk limits, then we should 
purchase those products as a society and use them. 
That gives the companies the incentive to continue their 
research.  If we do not do that they will pull back their horns 
and we will not have these great advancements.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told it takes at least seven years of testing before new 
plant varieties are given a Canadian licence.  When I hear groups 
like the Sierra Club, Greenpeace or the Council of Canadians 
pooh-poohing and going against the idea that GMO foods can be 
good, I question their motives and where they are coming from 
when they make statements which are not based on scientific 
evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I met with two young women from the Sierra Club 
who were very nice and pleasant.  As our debate and discussion 
went on in my office, I asked them who was going to pay for the 
segregation and the added costs of mandatory labelling. They were 
quite serious and were not being flippant but their answer was 
that the big company Monsanto would pay.  I said that in the real 
world that was not the way it worked.  The farmer, the lowest 
level, will pay.  He cannot dictate his costs to anybody else. He 
has to stay in business.  He cannot start and stop a farm easily. 
The reasoning by some of the objectors to genetically modified 
foods does not stand up to common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wonder about fellows like David Suzuki who is really a 
media personality although it says on his resume that he has a 
bit of a background in genetics.  When he makes his arguments how 
many times does he actually come up with scientific evidence and 
research or points out that it is accepted by the scientific 
community?  It is more a case of generalizations and assumptions 
which are not backed up by scientific fact whatsoever.  Being 
media personalities, I know these fellows and women are paid big 
salaries, in the millions of dollars, including endorsements and 
that.  In Mr. Suzuki's case, I wonder if he has some investments 
in the non-GMO companies and he thinks it would help them along 
if we could kill off the GMO industry.  We have to look at the 
background on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have called for absolute scientific guarantees that 
GMOs will not have any negative long term impact. In any 
endeavour this is an impossible measure to meet.  Had this 
standard been in place, we never would have had the light bulb. 
We would have avoided the industrial revolution and we would 
still likely be debating the benefits and perils of fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If governments listened to these radical lobby groups, they 
could significantly slow or even stop essential research.  It is 
not their direct influence that counts; it is their scare and 
fearmongering toward individual consumers and users of these 
products that hurts research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1969 the House of Commons, except for the Reform Party and 
the Canadian Alliance Party which were not here, said that it was 
going to eliminate or drastically reduce child poverty.  Child 
poverty has actually increased.  What would the low income 
earners and children who are considered to be in poverty say if 
the government and parliament required mandatory labelling?  It 
would drive up the price of food and they would have to pay for 
that at the grocery store. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make things better for people and for children who 
live in poverty.  One way is to continue to provide them with 
cheap, reliable and safe food.  The basic necessity for food has 
to be the primary consideration for all the population as opposed 
to some idea that mandatory labelling would be nice to have and 
would help some industry group which is lobbying for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Any decisions must be based on sound science and not on 
political interference.  All new food products must be tested by 
Health Canada scientists to determine if the new food is safe for 
Canadian consumers.  We have heard about allergenic 
considerations.  It is my understanding that we test for 
allergenic properties in food and if they are present, the food 
is labelled.  That is another red herring which has been brought 
up by other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any food that has a demonstrated health risk cannot be released 
into the Canadian market.  It has been that way for years. Any 
food that could generate an allergic reaction must be labelled. 
All regulatory decisions must be based upon clear independent 
scientific information and not just public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian consumers have lost confidence in the scientific 
testing process overseen by Health Canada in some instances.  The 
BST issue with the dairy cattle was one example.  As a result we 
have seen political interference and loss of confidence in that 
issue.  It is the federal government that has really contributed 
to that.  I blame the Liberal government we have had since 1993 
for not being ahead on this issue and making sure that consumers 
were informed and ready for the future, for the changes that were 
coming that are for the benefit of all of us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the speech by my colleague and I am a bit 
disappointed by his position. He is well aware of the issue, 
since we talked about it several times at the Standing Committee 
on Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he talks about fearmongering groups, I can tell him that it 
is also a frightening idea to let the farmers alone bear the 
burden of all that will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the companies wash their hands of all this?  How can the 
government leave all the responsibility for this to the farmers? 
This is not how I see events unfolding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is embarrassing to hear the member talk about the poor 
children, when groups of Canadian bishops, of American bishops 
and ecumenical groups are studying the question and are asking 
for mandatory labelling both in Canada and the United States. If 
ever there were people concerned about poor children, they are 
surely the ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to get back to the producers.  I have heard it 
said that farmers producing non genetically modified foods will 
simply have to find their own market. Because my colleague comes 
from western Canada, I must say that in Saskatchewan, Mr. Hyden, 
an organic farmer, is losing customers because his neighbours are 
growing genetically modified foods. The seeds are blown into his 
fields or carried there by the birds and the bees, and when he 
applies for approval of his products, he gets a poor rating at 
the international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can the member propose as a solution to those organic 
farmers who want to stay with traditional farming but are 
surrounded by genetically modified crops and lose their own 
market because of that? Last fall, in spite of all the problems 
they had in western Canada, organic farmers kept their market and 
fared better than the others. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly I support the 
Bloc member for Louis-Hébert in her motion which we adopted at 
the agriculture committee to look into all of the aspects of 
genetically modified organisms as it pertained to the agriculture 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the answer to some of the questions that are being posed 
in the House today will be answered by the experts.  I would hope 
Mr. Hayden will be one of the presenters who will give us the 
scientific evidence he has that the products that he is producing 
were contaminated by GMOs, to whom he was trying to sell them and 
how they determined there was GMO content in the food that he was 
selling.  I think we will have very good hearings on the GMO 
issue. 
The question of food costs to not only low income people but to 
all Canadians is one of great importance.  I also welcome any 
studies done by ecumenical church groups on this issue and invite 
their input when we hold our hearings.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to enter into the debate on genetically modified organisms. 
As I walked into the Commons today, somebody offered flowers 
signifying cancer research.  I would note that cancer research is 
another area where we actually use genetically modified organisms 
to solve some of the real problems of our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there are too many people here today who would 
argue against finding a cure for cancer.  Similarly, I do not 
believe there are too many people here who would argue against 
finding better ways to produce agricultural substances and doing 
that in a healthful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the debate is somewhat skewed.  The fact 
that people do not like genetically modified organisms is not so 
much that GMOs exist but rather the process undertaken to create 
GMOs.  This to me is essentially what is wrong with this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our primary concern and the primary concern of Health Canada is 
that the food we consume is safe, not the process that was 
undertaken to create it.  It is analogous to the production of 
steel.  If manufacturers were to buy steel for their automobile 
production facilities, their concern would be whether the steel 
was suitable for producing an automobile, not about the actual 
process that created the steel.  This is part of the labelling 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that what people want to say— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The debate is important and I would like the members to speak to 
the motion. The hon. member is going on about steel, cancer and 
all kinds of things. These too are very legitimate concerns, but 
as the motion is rather precise and we are short of time, I would 
like us to stick to the subject. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I will pay much 
closer attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member cannot 
understand the importance of the differences in processes, 
genetically modified organisms being a process similar to a 
steel-like process, I am sorry but I cannot help her with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, we live in very exciting times.  I farmed for 
about eight years in another part of my life, which I enjoyed 
very much.  I was very aware of the concerns of not only 
consumers but producers and people who worked in the agricultural 
sector about the use of pesticides, herbicides and so forth in 
farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our farm communities, genetic modification is not new.  I 
can recall someone coming into my office one day and presenting 
me with a cob of corn that was only five inches long.  That was 
the average length cob of corn that existed approximately 30 
years ago.  We are consuming genetically modified foods every 
day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the riding I represent, we have built a huge industry in the 
breeding of Holstein cattle.  We have used artificial 
insemination.  We have used the superflushing of cows for embryo 
transplants.  This has been very successful for the last 20 or 30 
years.  The basic cow in our area is the Holstein-Friesian. 
Durham has been so successful in producing purebred 
Holstein-Friesian animals that we now actually ship them back to 
Holstein and Friesland where they are used in genetic stock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to this debate with some interest in the whole area of 
genetic modification.  As I mentioned, farmers have been using 
this for some time.  Just look at the great benefits that exist 
in genetic modification.  As hon. members know, Canada is a 
threatened country when is comes to its climate.  The growing 
season is very short, but with the use of genetic modification we 
have been able to shorten the growing time for many crops.  That 
has not affected the quality of the end product.  It has 
increased the ability of some Saskatchewan and prairie farmers to 
effectively compete on the world market.  That has done nothing 
but good and we will continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area, for instance, people are using genetic modification 
in apples to thwart blight.  In other words, we can actually get 
the product off the trees and into the supermarkets faster, 
better and more efficiently and it is a healthier food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great assumption is that genetic manipulation is somehow 
bad.  The fact is that we have been able to reduce disease and 
pestilence in our food supplies to the betterment of the 
consumer.  The consumer is far better off with these genetic 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, we cannot have a situation where that kind of 
experimentation gets out of hand.  We cannot have a situation 
where the mutant organisms are allowed to cross-pollinate and 
possibly cause dangerous mutations.  There is a great deal of 
work that goes on, not only in Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 
but also in Health Canada, to ensure that sort of 
cross-pollination does not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the benefit of being in British Columbia where we were 
experimenting with that sort of genetic manipulation.  What we 
are attempting to do in Canada is to reduce the infestation of 
our softwood lumber in British Columbia to improve forestry 
stocks.  This is another way of genetically using the science 
available to us to have better products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talked to the science community, I asked them what was up 
in the real world of science and forestry.  They talked about 
some of the research going on in Weyerhaeuser in the United 
States which is using genetics to build a faster growing tree 
with fewer branches and therefore more efficient when harvested. 
It causes less pressure on existing forestry and our conservation 
program is protected because of the abundant source of softwood 
lumber being grown commercially.  These are all positive ways in 
which the economy can co-exist with the concerns of 
environmentalists, which is what I fancy myself to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are of course limitations to genetic manipulation.  Most 
of us have read recently about the cloning of cows and sheep. 
There is certainly a moral argument that goes along with this 
whole file.  I will not get into that issue today because I know 
the Bloc member wants to talk about relevance and genetic 
modification.  However, there is no question that most members of 
the public today are concerned about cloning and some of the 
moral issues that revolve around that.  That is not a part of my 
speech today but I am sure there are limitations to the amount of 
genetic manipulation that we should engage in. 
I know our government has a concern about regenerative technology 
and has studied it to the point of possibly passing legislation 
on the use of that kind of technology.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Health, under the food and drug 
administration, requires any food process that has been altered 
or has changed its nutritional value to be labelled.  We have a 
labelling system already in Canada.  The Bloc members would like 
us to think that we have a laissez-faire attitude toward 
labelling, but that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is another agency that has 
as its primary purpose to ensure that the food we eat is safe and 
consumable.  The government supports the efforts of the Canadian 
Council of Grocery Distributors and the Canadian General 
Standards Board, which are entering into the process of people 
coming forward and voluntarily labelling their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the concern about genetic manipulation seems to be 
generating, to some extent, out of Europe.  The European Union, 
which I had the advantage of being in about two weeks ago, in 
using its precautionary principle in trade, is using a lot of 
these areas, not for the protection of their own populations but 
rather to embargo Canadian imports.  It is embargoing Canadian 
beef into the European Union.  It is embargoing wine into the 
European Union.  It is embargoing many of our agricultural 
products. I really question whether the European Union is a free 
trade area or an anti-free trade area because it does not want to 
trade with anyone other than the people who live within the 
European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we not let that kind of fear take over our 
communities.  One of the other speakers mentioned the increase in 
populations around the world.  This is a great opportunity for 
Canadian agriculture.  There is no question that southeast Asia 
and China will unlikely be able to continue feeding their 
populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not only an opportunity but an obligation to meet the 
challenges in the world definition of countries being able to 
feed themselves.  We have an obligation to continue with a 
science-based approach to agriculture to ensure that our food 
products are the best in the world and that we can increase the 
amount of production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers have led that challenge.  Canadian farmers have 
been at the forefront.  We now ship close to over $2 billion 
worth of agricultural products around the world.  We have been 
successful in those things because we have been willing to 
embrace, accept and use change and new processes to make our 
products safe for Canadians and everyone in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to tell members that the need for protein by 
different countries is increasing at an alarming rate.  There is 
no question that these countries will be depending more and more 
on Canadian production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I once had the advantage of visiting Taiwan.  I was impressed. I 
had just arrived at the Taipei airport when someone asked me how 
the biological industry was doing in Saskatoon.  I must admit 
that at that time I was not fully up to speed about the 
tremendous experimentation and results of our own scientists in 
Canada who have made such a huge contribution to biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A simple thing, like the ability of plants to absorb nutrients, 
such as phosphates and nitrogen, from the soil is done 
imperfectly.  There are now ways to inoculate seed so that the 
seed actually assists the plant.  The plant will absorb more 
phosphates and more nitrogen than it did previously. 
Why is this important?  It is important because farmers will now 
need less fertilizer to grow their crops.  It will create less 
degradation of their environment because they can grow crops more 
efficiently.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the things the Bloc members are talking about, some of 
what they believe the organic farm is doing, biological 
technology is allowing other farmers to also do that. This is a 
tremendous accomplishment for Canadians.  Being the size of 
country that we are, we have become world leaders in the whole 
area of biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time not only for politicians but for the science 
community itself to get out there and tell their message.  A lot 
of people in this country, in the European Union and others are 
saying no, it is a terrible thing and that people are going to be 
born with three legs and four eyes because this stuff has been 
genetically altered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in England not long ago and talking to the science and 
technology committee.  They have had lots of problems with this 
issue politically.  People are concerned about genetically 
altered food.  They did a study on the media and what the 
responsibility is of the media in their country to inform people 
about the basic importance of the foods they eat.  They 
discovered in the articles and the newspapers where people are 
talking about this issue that less than 15% of the writers in any 
of the newspapers had any background in science.  In other words, 
the people who are spreading the stories about biotechnology are 
not scientists.  They are people who are using most of their 
information as innuendo and things that are totally 
unsubstantiated by the science community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is we have to provide more responsible debate on 
the whole issue. There has been too much emotion and not enough 
science.  There has been too much concern that somehow someone is 
manipulating our food supply and not enough thought process about 
the potential benefits not only for Canadians but for our ability 
as a country to feed the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to end on that note.  I probably have not used up 
all my time but that is not necessary.  All I can say is I 
certainly defend the importance of using genetic manipulation but 
within the obvious context to ensure that our food is safe. I 
believe that is happening.  We can do more.  We are going to do 
more.  People are demanding that we do more.  Clearly our health 
department and our department of agriculture are very focused on 
the area to ensure that Canadians are consuming safe food but at 
the same time to unleash our ability to do even better in the 
future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going to 
share my time with the hon. member for Sherbrooke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to speak to the motion from my colleague from 
Louis-Hébert which says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to demonstrate openness with 
regard to genetically modified organisms, starting by making it 
mandatory to label genetically modified foods or foods containing 
genetically modified ingredients, in order to enable Canadians to 
make informed choices about the foods they eat. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on genetic engineering has been going on for some 
years, mainly because the development of cloning techniques was 
widely reported in the media. In recent months, the public 
learned that genetic engineering has been extended to the food 
industry and that, for some years now, much of the food that 
ends up on our table is genetically modified, this without the 
public having been informed or consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises several questions: Why are plants and foods 
genetically modified? Who is benefiting from that? What are the 
benefits to consumers? What are the effects of GMOs on health 
and the environment? 
What are the challenges for agriculture and the environment? 
What are the economic and trade issues? What are the social 
repercussions of the GMOs? What are the regulations on GMOs? And 
what is the position of the federal government on GMOs?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many questions, and I think it is only natural to ask 
ourselves such questions, because right now we do not know what 
we are eating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the hon. member for Louis-Hébert, we have the 
opportunity today to discuss those issues and to offer answers 
to the legitimate questions of the public. 
I hope to have time to provide a chronology of the speeches made 
by my Bloc Quebecois colleague, the hon. member for Louis-Hébert, 
on the GMO issue. It took her one year of hard work to finally 
get the chairman of the agriculture committee to agree to 
undertake a study on the labelling of GMOs. I congratulate my 
colleague on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the effects of GMOs on health? According to Health 
Canada, transgenic foods are not dangerous in the short term. 
However, there is no study on their long term effects on human 
health. In order to approve a transgenic product, the federal 
government relies on studies conducted by the companies, which 
it merely reviews. While the approval of new drugs may take 
years of in-depth study and testing, that of transgenic foods 
takes just a few weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal deputy minister of health himself, speaking before a 
Senate committee in the spring of 1999, recognized that, at the 
time, the government did not have any expertise whatsoever in 
genetics. As he put it, “its labs are not really up to it”. How 
can the government guarantee the safety of these foods without 
adequate expertise and independent scientific studies? How can 
the government say that transgenic foods are not dangerous in 
the short term? There is currently no analysis being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also said that, because of a shortage of personnel at the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency, there are major shortcomings, 
particularly in the area of research on transgenic foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 30, 1999, 200 federal experts on food quality and 
safety wrote to the Minister of Health. Their letter underscored 
the fact that the Agency is in a conflict of interest position 
as it must, on the one hand, ensure that foods are harmless, 
while on the other hand encourage food production and export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>GMO lobbyists are very powerful. They often win over our 
ministers and this government because they are using GMOs for 
partisan purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to say, because people must know, that these lobbyists 
often interfere, but not always to promote the health of the 
public. They often do for partisan purposes. Considering their 
contributions to election campaigns, the government prefers to 
ignore some situations, particularly in research on transgenic 
foods. Let us not delude ourselves. There is big money in GMOs. 
We all know what money can do. 
But it is often to the detriment of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These federal experts wrote to the Minister of Health that they 
were in a conflict of interest situation. It was not an easy 
decision for these 200 federal government scientists to abandon 
their usual reserve and sign their names to such a letter, thus 
endangering their jobs. They were so concerned that they felt 
they had to speak out. These are career scientists; they know 
what they are talking about. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT74"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT74"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1610

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what they say: “We are not testing these products 
ourselves. Not a single researcher in Health Canada has been 
assigned to genetically modified foods, because we do not have 
the financial resources for that kind of work, a scientist 
said”. Yet, these products end up on our tables. No study has 
been done to date, yet Health Canada states that there is no 
danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also concerns about food allergies. Why is it that 
more and more people, and especially children, have food 
allergies? Could it be because of the nature of what we eat? For 
the time being, we cannot answer this question, because there 
have been no studies. But there are food allergy problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also concerns about resistance to the antibiotics 
present in certain GMOs, because GMOs are spread in the natural 
environment. The EU scientific steering committee has recommended 
that antibiotic genes in genetically modified plants be removed 
because of the dangers of antimicrobial resistance for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proponents of GMOs are not short of arguments. Let me go through 
a few and comment on them. They say that GMOs will make it 
possible to feed an increasing world population, in particular in 
developing countries. There is no shortage of food around the 
world; in fact, there is an overproduction. 
There is, however, a problem of distribution, among other things, 
because developing countries do not have the means to buy food 
produced in developed countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Developing countries use vast agricultural lands for primary 
crops, like coffee, cocoa, cotton and flax, which they sell to 
industrialized countries instead of using them to feed their own 
populations. So, these lands offer an opportunity. It is still 
possible to increase the yields in these countries through 
traditional techniques and financial support. It is worth 
mentioning that this government has reduced its international 
assistance budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proponents of GMOs contend that there is no proof that those 
organisms represent a health risk. They may be right, but the 
absence of studies on the long term impact of GMOs on human and 
animal health as well as on plant and animal life does not prove 
that they are not dangerous. Yet, food containing GMOs have been 
sold for the last five years and the production of 42 genetically 
modified plants is authorised in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Suzuki, a renowned broadcaster with a background in 
genetics, once said that politicians who say that GMOs are not 
dangerous are either liars or idiots. Countries in the European 
Union advocate the precautionary principle according to which, in 
the absence of scientific evidence, caution must be exercised to 
prevent potential damages from GMOs to the health and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proponents contend that all genetically modified foods are 
tested in Canada. Actually, GMOs are not systematically tested. 
The government relies on companies who produce GMOs and simply 
reads their studies without any further assessment. It should be 
noted that new drugs are approved after long studies conducted 
over several years, sometimes up to ten years. This reduces risks 
while not eliminating them completely. GMOs used for agriculture 
and food production are approved very quickly, within 60 to 90 
days, without any in-depth study or second assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being told by some people that we are currently eating 
food containing GMOs and that there is no cause for concern. No 
study has been done. This is the reason why we call at least for 
the mandatory labelling of GMOs, so that people can choose what 
they want to eat. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Science, Research and 
Development), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to qualify what 
the hon. member just said on the government's position on GMOs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT75"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT75"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1615

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from agriculture and health never said that GMOs 
were totally without danger. The role of the government is to 
protect Canadian citizens. Our protection agencies do the best 
they can based on the knowledge currently available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that some countries which adopted regulations on 
voluntary or mandatory labelling some months ago are now forced 
to back down because they do not have the technical and 
scientific means nor the necessary financial resources to 
implement these regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the whole GMO issue is being overdramatized. I do 
not want to stand up for GMOs as such. It is biotechnology. The 
role of the government is to control risks associated with GMOs 
as with, for example, drugs or public transportation, like 
planes. When the government issues a licence authorizing a plane 
to fly, it is clear that it cannot guarantee that that plane 
will never crash, but at least the risks are weighed. It is the 
same thing with drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for GMOs, the government is doing a great job of protecting 
the public. We have set up a committee of experts who will make 
recommendations on labelling to the government. We are also 
looking at what is being done in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally met with officials from other countries such as 
Australia and New Zealand, where labelling is currently 
impossible for scientific and financial reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleagues not to be alarmists. Yes, there may be 
risks, but the government is there to control them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> First, Mr. Speaker, I would like the 
hon. member to name the countries that backed down, because it 
is the first thing I hear about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, I do not think that the Bloc Quebecois is fear 
mongering. We just want the people to know what they are eating. 
I think it is a very basic proposal to ask that Canadians and 
Quebecers be told that the food on their plates contains 
GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, scientists at Health Canada denounced a number of 
things. A research scientist with the department told us that 
no research was being conducted at Health Canada and no 
researcher had been assigned to transgenic foods, because there 
is no money for that kind of research. This is not the Bloc 
Quebecois that is saying this, but a research scientist with 
Health Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned and the people I represent are concerned as 
well. 
I just held a press conference on this issue with the member for 
Louis-Hébert. The people in the riding of Drummond have reacted 
and they too are concerned about the lack of money for research 
on transgenic foods. So do not tell me that I am alarmist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to straighten out another fact. Time permitting, I would 
have liked to provide a chronology of the speeches made on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois by my colleague, the hon. member 
for Louis-Hébert. It took her one year of tireless work. I could 
mention those made on May 14, June 11, and so on. I have that 
list. It took the hon. member one year of tireless work, of 
questions and comments. It took a great deal of patience on her 
part to get the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food 
to agree to study the labelling of transgenic foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone talks to me about the goodwill shown by this 
government, give me a break. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure you 
have noticed the difficulty I have in containing my joy in 
addressing 301 genetically modifiable organisms this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my speech with a question. Are you sure, Mr. 
Speaker, that you have not eaten any genetically modified 
organisms today? If you are one of those who do not care, the 
question is irrelevant. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if you are one of those who wonder about the 
appropriateness of such a process, you want to know what you 
eat, you want to be free not to eat certain foods and you want 
to know the short, medium and long term effects of GMOs on 
health, agriculture and the environment. This raises many 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has taken a clear stance on the issue. We are 
not systematically against GMOs but are against the fact that 
labelling is not mandatory. As a matter of fact, my colleague 
from Louis-Hébert, who is our party's agriculture and agri-food 
critic, has succeeded in getting the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food to study the issue, and I 
congratulate her for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This study will begin on May 16 et will continue until the 
summer recess and perhaps even until the fall, in co-operation 
with the three other opposition parties and, I hope, all Liberal 
members of goodwill. We also want to invite the scientists who 
will assess the potential risks of GMOs, members of the public, 
farmers, particularly organic farmers, and consumers to give 
their input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study of GMOs will allow us to analyse the consequences of 
labelling on international trade, to know the advantages and 
disadvantages of GMOs for agriculture as well as the long term 
effect of GMOs on human health and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 4 of last year, my colleague from Louis-Hébert 
introduced Bill C-309 on mandatory labelling. 
We learned a few weeks ago that Europe has gone ahead and decreed 
that from now on all products containing GMOs should be labelled 
as such. This is a first victory for consumers. This step taken 
in Europe should make it easier for us here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not content with taking action only in the House, we, in 
the Bloc Quebecois, have started a petition on labelling, which 
so far has been signed by 44,000 to 45,000 people across Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My office prepared and mailed leaflets on this topic to my 
constituents. They were asked to answer two questions. The first 
one was “Do you believe the general public is properly informed 
about GMOs?” The second one was “Do you believe it is justified 
to demand that genetically modified foods be labelled?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are a few of the comments my office has received so far. On 
the first question as to whether the public is properly informed 
about GMOs, here are some of the answers and general comments: 
“Not at all. Governments have no regard for the public”. Or “No, 
there is not enough outreach, especially regarding health 
impacts”. And again “No, people are just starting to realize how 
huge this problem is. Quality and health risks are only the tip 
of the iceberg”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one says “No, we only receive very vague information, 
often by word of mouth”. And a last one “No, I heard about it 
for the first time in the fall of 1999 in my microbiology course, 
and I study animal health”. As you may suspect, the answer was 
no 99.9% of the time.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the second question as to whether it is justified to demand 
that genetically modified foods be labelled, an overwhelming 
majority said yes. Again, here are their comments. “The right to 
know is fundamental. Labelling should be mandatory. It should be 
mandatory so we can make an informed decision”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another comment. “If we cannot stop companies from 
producing GMOs, we should at least know what products contain 
them”. Another citizen said “I am totally outraged to see that 
companies could force us to eat whatever they want to put in 
their products”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment says—and I have many, but I will not read them 
all, only a few more—that “Labelling should be mandatory, 
especially if our lives are at risk. There might be more cancer 
or other illnesses that destroy our very fragile cells”. Another 
citizen wrote “I would like to have the freedom to know what I 
put in my body”. A last comment states “We are given the list 
of ingredients that are contained in food products. It is quite 
normal that I should know also if they contain GMOs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are very concerned about this issue and support the 
mandatory labelling of food products containing GMOs. They said 
so in a Léger & Léger poll published last month. According to 
the poll, 50% of Quebecers surveyed are concerned about GMOs, 
and three people out of four would prefer a tomato without GMOs, 
even at a higher price, to a tomato with GMOs that were 30% 
cheaper. A proportion of 68% of the Quebecers polled would 
prefer a tomato a little bruised or damaged without GMOs to a 
more beautiful and redder tomato containing GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Canadian government, I cannot remain silent about a 
brochure that I consider to be misinformation on food and also 
on GMOs. 
This brochure, entitled “Food Safety and You”, which the federal 
government sent to many households during the week of  March 27, 
talks  about the benefits of GMOs, stating that they may reduce 
the need for chemicals in agriculture. It also states that they 
are as safe as foods already on the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the federal government say such a thing when we know 
that genetically modified foods are not tested and inspected 
differently from other food products? Researchers do not do a 
second assessment of GMOs, but simply read the research protocol 
provided by companies seeking approval for their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the brochure, there is nothing about the fact that no studies 
have  been conducted on the medium and long term impact of GMOs 
on health. 
We cannot just tell the people that genetically modified foods 
are good for them without answering legitimate questions about 
the possible risks of the GMOs for human health and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the federal government, through the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency, has awarded a contract for more than $300,000 
to Telemedia Communications, in Toronto, to have <I>Canadian Living</I> 
and <I>Coup de pouce</I> magazines insert a special section in their 
June issue to reaffirm the security of GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal government is financing advertising campaigns 
with taxpayers' money, Health Canada and the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency have no money to conduct real studies on the 
long and medium term impacts of GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many questions remain unanswered.  This new technology was 
introduced very quickly under pressure from a few herbicide and 
seed companies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is important to be cautious and to hold a public 
debate on GMOs so that the public can be well informed about the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you do not know what a genetically modified organism  looks 
like, you can get an idea just by looking at my colleagues on 
the other side.  They are politically modified organisms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my colleague from Sherbrooke for his excellent 
presentation. I would like to ask him a few questions concerning 
genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we genetically modify plants and foods? Who benefits from 
that and what are the benefits to consumers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from 
Drummond for her question, to which I will answer in a different 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month, I attended a seminar of the Association des 
biologistes du Québec. I had the chance to participate in a 
session where people were asking themselves very serious 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had a number of concerns. Of course, some made speeches, 
saying “A certain balance exists in nature”. Thousands of years 
were needed for organisms to develop genetically and for a 
balance that I would describe as a delicate balance to be 
achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People were wondering about the impacts this will have on our 
food chain. Incorporating herbicides into genes will eliminate 
certain mosquitoes and many other things. They were wondering 
about human intervention in genetics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were concerned primarily with ethics. 
They were wondering how far this will go. Earlier, a colleague 
from the other side said “We have a tree and we modify it 
genetically because we believe it has too many branches or does 
not provide enough shade”. All reasons are good. One must wonder 
where it will stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Food is now the issue, and then it will be animals. As a matter 
of fact, it would seem that it is already the case. Some day, in 
the name of the sacrosanct development of science and 
technology, it will probably be human beings who will be 
modified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I cannot see the colour of your eyes but if, 
according to the government, they are of the wrong colour, will 
they be genetically modified? I am wondering. Ethics is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone said that organic food producers took their faith in 
their own hands. Labelling is not a constraint, it amounts to 
marketing. 
People have adopted internal regulations concerning the 
labelling of organic foods, in order to promote their sale and 
support those who buy them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is true for organic foods is also true for genetically 
modified foods. Some people do not want to eat them. We should 
inform them. It is more than a mere marketing decision. With 
regard to genetically modified foods, there is a requirement to 
let the people decide whether they want such foods or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst, Gasoline Prices; the hon. member 
for Halifax West, Foreign Affairs; the hon. member for 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, National Parks; the hon. member for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will reread the opposition motion to the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to demonstrate openness with 
regard to genetically modified organisms, starting by making it 
mandatory to label genetically modified foods or foods containing 
genetically modified ingredients, in order to enable Canadians to 
make informed choices about the foods they eat. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the Bloc member for putting forward the motion 
today.  I totally support the system in the Department of Health 
today for making sure that the quality and safety of our food 
supply is under control, but I believe it is the responsibility 
of the House to have a deep and thorough review because of the 
rapid rate with which people are experimenting and working with 
altering our food products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us are not that sensitive to the whole genetically 
modified organism system involved with our food.  Over the last 
few months I have been using a lot of my parliamentary time as a 
Toronto member looking at our whole food chain system.  It is 
absolutely amazing the number of urban or city people who have 
never taken the time to get their heads around the food chain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we walk into a supermarket in downtown Toronto it is 
amazing how much food we see.  The quality of the food and its 
prices are so consumer friendly, every aspect of it, that we just 
do not realize what is going on behind it.  We do not get into 
the whole area of food processing and what is happening there. 
Very few of us who live in cities go back to the contribution 
farmers are making, which is ultimately the area we must all 
begin taking a closer look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even before we get to genetically modified or altered foods, we 
in urban Canada should be aware that most studies will show that 
if we do not become engaged in this food chain there could be a 
danger two years from now that we will lose close to 80,000 
family farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue deserves long hours of debate and long hours of 
analysis.  The Bloc is doing a good thing by putting this motion 
on the floor of the House of Commons.  At the same time we must 
realize and reinforce for consumers that the system out there 
right now is not without control.  The products on the shelves in 
stores today have been reviewed by Health Canada and the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency.  Let us not send a sense of alarm into 
the community today because that is not the way to advance this 
debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has to go right back to the producer of food.  The men 
and women who have spent their lives producing food are the ones 
who are best equipped and have the know-how.  They can inform us 
in an enlightened and experienced way on whether or not they feel 
the food processing system ultimately ending up at the retailer 
needs the type of specific recommendation of mandatory labelling 
that is proposed in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole labelling system needs to be reviewed, not just in 
terms of the notion of genetically modified foods but also the 
whole area of foods produced in Canada, specifically family farm 
foods.  The percentage that most farmers receive, outside the 
ones protected by supply management, is something that needs 
review as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last couple of months my experience with consumers 
suggests that if they knew they were purchasing products which 
came from Canadian family farms and that there was some type of 
royalty system, they would not mind an extra two or three cents 
on particular products, whether it be a loaf of bread, a jar of 
jam or a box of cereal.  I believe they would participate in 
something like that to help family farms maintain their viability 
and sustainability.  That has been my experience in testing the 
idea in a very unscientific way over the last couple of months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get into the business of looking at labelling we have to 
do it in a most comprehensive way.  I do not think we should just 
look at genetically modified food.  We have to go deeper and look 
into where the food is coming from, be specific to Canadian farms 
and make sure that we use the process of identifying the quality, 
safety and source of our food as a means of rebuilding and 
renewing the commitment our country should have to sustaining the 
family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most consumers would hate to see a day when they suddenly woke 
up and it was decided that our food dependency should be from 
imports rather than from our domestic supply.  A good friend of 
mine, Paddy Carson, once said, and he actually repeats it often, 
that a nation which cannot feed itself will feed upon itself. The 
whole realm of rebuilding our agricultural foundation is 
something we must become seized with over the next few months as 
we work away in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am totally supportive of the general thrust of the motion on 
the floor of the House of Commons today.  However, I would also 
like to bundle it into a more comprehensive approach where every 
food product from a family farm is recognized in terms of its 
quality.  We could also figure out a royalty system when 
consumers choose to buy products identified as Canadian family 
farm products.  With that economic stability and predictability 
when the quality and long term security of supply will be 
maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate having participated in the debate, but I would say 
that it should be bundled up into a more comprehensive labelling 
program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
my colleague's proposal with great interest because it goes even 
further than what I have suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about the traceability of foods and, there again, we 
have a lot of catching up to do with Europe. I think that what 
he is proposing is ideal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was only involved in one aspect of this great project, but it 
would really be great if we went all the way, because we would 
be protecting both consumers and farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What worries me is the fact GMOs have been on the market for 
five years. 
We started talking about this a year or so ago and, in the 
meantime, things have continued to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Minister of Industry. There is the biotechnology 
advisory committee, which was set up in September 1999, and 
there is also a committee on the future of biotechnology made up 
of scientific experts who will look at what is going to happen 
in the next ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want it to be very clear that I am not against setting up such 
committees because looking at the future is already something. 
What really bothers me, however, is the present. I have a 
problem with the present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reviewed a study by Ann Clark, a professor at Guelph 
University. She carried out tests on toxicity levels or loads 
and found that 70% of the 42 MGO crops in Canada had not been 
tested for toxicity. 
She adds that allergenicity was not assessed in laboratory or 
through feeding experiments for any of the 42 crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an alarmist, but a scientific approach requires that we 
have scientific answers to our questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I have this question for my colleague: Does he think that 
a collective effort is in order to move ahead faster in 
answering these questions? We are eating these foods; they are 
already on the market. That is what worries me. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe passionately 
that we should deal with this issue in a comprehensive way, and I 
think we should have done it yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a health care challenge in this country and one of the 
ways we will repair, rebuild, renew our health care system is by 
making sure that we focus on diet and nutrition.  At the basis of 
that is food production.  If we do not have our heads around the 
quality of food production and the impact of certain types of 
genetically modified foods it may have a disastrous effect on our 
capacity to renew our health care system.  I see food and health 
as being inextricably intertwined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Minister of Industry, who is in the House today, 
feels passionately about this issue.  But as the member for 
Louis-Hébert mentioned, this is not just a health issue and it is 
not just an industry issue; it is everybody working together.  I 
am confident that all of us in the House will deal with this.  I 
think I can say on behalf of everyone in the House that we are 
all pretty sensitive about the food we eat.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member talked a bit about labelling products that 
are produced on Canadian farms so that Canadian consumers would 
know that. He feels there would be a willingness by the Canadian 
public to pay a little extra for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason our farm community is in trouble is low commodity 
prices, and those prices are being driven by subsidized products 
from around the world.  It seems that every time the agriculture 
community wakes up in the morning there is a new challenge facing 
it.  Fuel costs are up.  The government announced that 
transportation rates are up for shipping grain off the prairies. 
The issue of species at risk legislation could affect agriculture 
producers, as well as the idea of controlling greenhouse gas 
emissions.  These are all issues of concern to the agriculture 
community.  To say that we would label food produced in Canada so 
that the consumer would pay a little more might come up against 
some opposition.  There are a lot of consumers who cannot afford 
to pay any more for food.  We would somehow have to do it in a 
way that would benefit all of society, the farmer at one end and 
the consumer at the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be get back to the labelling.  A lot of products are 
labelled “made in Canada” now.  How in the member's mind would 
something like that be structured to ensure that the benefit of 
such a program would return to the producer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would not want to 
suggest the real specifics, the process or the technique.  I do 
not have that in my mind, nor do I believe anyone else would 
today.  We are debating today.  However, I think that the 
concept of designing a system whereby Canadian family farm 
products would be identified in a way that the consumer would 
realize that a percentage of the product they purchase would 
return in a royalty format to the farm community has merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I would exclude from that those farmers who are part 
of supply management.  As we know, most of those farmers are very 
well protected.  I am not suggesting that we enhance that sector, 
I am thinking more of those farmers who are outside that realm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to sit down to figure out a way to have a 
royalty system.  We do it in other sectors of the economy.  We do 
it with artists who perform.  They get royalties for their work 
on top of their basic wage.  They get a royalty, a bonus or a 
dividend.  We do it in many other sectors.  We do it in business. 
I do not see why we could not design a Canadian family farm 
dividend, which would really be nothing more than the consumer 
recognizing and realizing that they want to keep a secure, high 
quality farm system in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a huge problem in urban Canada waking up certain 
consumers to the fact that the food supply which they see when 
they go into a Loblaws, a Knob Hill, a Sobeys or a Dominion 
might be in short supply a year from now from a Canadian source 
point of view.  They have a difficult time imagining that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want the House to think this would be an easy sell, but 
our duty as members is not just to take the easy sells.  Our duty 
is to take hold of an issue that we know is going to hit us 
between the eyes in 14 to 15 months, and we may have to go 
against the wind of certain consumers who may resist. 
We may have to tell them that they will have to do this in order 
to maintain that security of Canadian family farm supply.  I for 
one would be happy to take up that challenge.  Once we educate 
and inform them of what the long term benefits would be, in terms 
of health and everything else, most Canadians would buy in.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to rise today to speak to the motion that 
this House urge the government to demonstrate openness with 
regard to genetically modified organisms, starting by making it 
mandatory to label genetically modified foods or foods containing 
genetically modified ingredients, in order to enable Canadians to 
make informed choices about the foods they eat.  It is an 
excellent motion which the Progressive Conservative Party 
definitely supports.  We support the idea of much greater 
consumer awareness of genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An estimated 60% of processed foods contain genetically modified 
ingredients.  An Angus Reid poll recently found that Canadians 
would be less likely to buy food that they know is genetically 
modified.  They get very nervous about it, which is 
understandable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of what I will say has been said already today, but I think 
it bears repeating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1980s the PC government identified biotechnology as a 
key and strategic area of future economic prosperity and promise 
for Canada.  During its mandate our government encouraged the 
creation of a strong biotechnology sector and provided funding 
for research and development that would allow every region to 
benefit.  My region benefits from the Lennoxville research 
station, which does a lot of work on biotechnological products, 
particularly for the farming industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge we must face in creating a solid and dynamic 
biotechnology industry is twofold.  First, we must create a 
climate in which industry sectors can flourish both here and 
internationally.  Second, we must meet the public's concern for a 
healthy environment and the safety of GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Environmental Protection Act defines biotechnology 
as the application of science and engineering in the direct use 
of living organisms or products of living organisms in their 
natural or modified form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although much of the focus in the media has been on food 
products derived from biotechnology, there are also 
pharmaceutical, health and pest control issues.  I should say in 
passing that we have seen many problems from these other 
products.  Pest control products have been a big item as of late. 
People have been treating their lawns with them.  That type of 
situation has caused many problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to food products, biotechnology has the potential 
to increase the competitiveness of the Canadian agri-food 
industry by increasing individual competitiveness and by 
exporting high value agri-food products.  It could also increase 
yields to compensate for the increase in world population.  It 
could develop more sustainable agricultural practices by reducing 
the need for chemical weed and pest controls and by enabling the 
environmentally beneficial practice of no-till agriculture, 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions.  It could create new markets 
by introducing value added products.  It could improve nutrition 
and remove allergens from food crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Value passed on from the producer to the consumer can and is 
being done.  It is possible to immunize a population by placing 
medications known as nutraceuticals or output traits, for 
example, in foods to lower cholesterol levels.  It was reported 
recently that scientists in the U.S. have created a strain of 
genetically altered rice to combat vitamin A deficiency, the 
world's leading cause of blindness.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a world leader in biotechnology.  If the government 
fails to give support in fostering this emerging technology, 
Canada's competitive advantage as a leader risks becoming a lost 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are concerns.  The principal concern is with the use of 
biotechnology in food products as a question of food security. 
There have been numerous reports mostly in Europe that have 
negatively impacted consumer confidence in Canada as a result of 
the claims made about food safety. There are concerns that there 
is not enough risk assessment work being done on consumer 
products derived from biotechnology in Canada. Most of these 
concerns have been raised by lobby groups such as Greenpeace, the 
Council of Canadians and the Canadian Health Coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government announced its support for a voluntary 
labelling project of foods derived from biotechnology on 
September 17, 1999.  The Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors 
and the Canadian General Standards Board launched a project to 
help develop the standards for voluntary labelling that are 
meaningful and enforceable. There already exists a mandatory 
labelling policy for nutritional changes or safety concerns on 
food products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 17, 1999 the ministers of health, agriculture and 
environment announced their intention to establish an independent 
expert panel, the Blue Ribbon Scientific Panel, to examine future 
scientific developments in biotechnology.  The panel is expected 
to file a preliminary report in June and a final report by the 
end of the summer 2000. The Canadian Biotechnology Advisory 
Committee is also involved in the recommendation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January the Government of Canada agreed to an international 
biosafety protocol that will allow countries to assess and 
regulate shipments of living modified organisms.  A living 
modified organism is any living biological entity that possesses 
a novel combination of genetic material obtained through the use 
of modern biotechnology that is capable of transferring or 
replicating genetic material.  Examples of products containing 
LMOs are pharmaceuticals, seeds for sowing, saplings, fish, seed 
for food, feed and processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protocol is designed to ensure that the trade of LMOs do not 
have a negative impact on biodiversity and the world's 
ecosystems. The impacts of the protocol on agricultural exports 
are not fully known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give an interesting example not in the food itself but in 
what I talked about before, in pest control for lawns and the 
dangers involved because things are not properly labelled.  We 
have heard recently of many cases of people who are worried about 
having lawns sprayed and what happens to the neighbours. I have a 
personal example.  Lawns in my area had been sprayed and then 
cut.  The cuttings gathered onto the street.  After that small 
dogs in the neighbourhood which love to eat grass ate the grass. 
There ends up being a very heavy concentration and many animals 
have died as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers have clearly indicated they want to be informed 
through labelling about foods that have been altered.  They 
favour foods that provide tangible benefits. An Angus Reid survey 
conducted in November and December last year found that 
two-thirds of the Canadian population would be less likely to buy 
food they know has been genetically modified. A study done for 
the governments of Australia and New Zealand in October 1999 
suggests that mandatory labelling would raise food costs by 5% to 
15%.  The study states the requirements to label all foods which 
may contain GMOs is a very major undertaking for both industry 
and regulators.  The simple part is the change of labels.  A far 
more extensive process is needed to determine both GMO status for 
food ingredients and monitor their continuing status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mandatory labelling could also mean labelling 95% of all food in 
this country which is considered genetically modified in some 
way. This could provide unquestionable value to the customer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Developing national guidelines and labelling must be done in 
conjunction with the development of standards at the 
international level, for example the Codex Alimentarius 
Commission which is the international standards setting body for 
food.

what they eating.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker and hon. 
members, it is a pleasure to say a few words on this very 
important topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has an enviable reputation around the world for the 
safety of its food and the rigour of its food inspection system, 
including foods derived through biotechnology.  If imitation is 
the sincerest form of flattery, then Canada's food safety system 
is certainly one of the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regulation through sound science is an essential step in the 
continued safe production of biotechnology derived foods.  The 
federal budget confirms this priority in Canada's regulatory 
system.  The $90 million investment in the regulatory system for 
biotechnology products will allow Health Canada, the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency, CFIA, and other regulatory departments to 
continue to enhance and involve its safety first regulatory 
approach to keep pace with the next generation of scientific 
discoveries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of science based organizations within the 
Canadian government that rely on leading edge science to carry 
out regulatory and other science based mandates.  One of these is 
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 targets regulation of biotechnology products as well 
as upgrading federal laboratory facilities.  This funding 
includes approximately $30 million directly to the CFIA for 
biotech regulation. What is this funding for?  This funding will 
help the CFIA to increase its capacity for monitoring, for 
inspection, for testing and for enforcement; to meet human 
resource and technical needs to ensure CFIA staff have up to date 
expertise; to generate research and knowledge that will underpin 
regulation; and to strengthen international co-operation and 
harmonization on regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's science based regulatory system for agricultural 
products has been a major factor in contributing to the 
reputation of the safety and the quality of Canadian goods around 
the world.  In order to maintain that reputation the government 
is dedicated to upholding the regulations that protect the health 
and safety of Canadians, of animals and of the environment.  This 
is the government's first priority and to achieve that we must 
have regulation through sound science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that the budget confirms the priority of 
health and safety for Canada's regulatory system.  The government 
believes that biotechnology derived products must go through the 
same stringent regulatory and approval processes as all other new 
foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget 2000 investment in the regulatory system for 
biotechnology products will allow Canada to continue to enhance 
and evolve the safety first regulatory approach. The continued 
dedication to supporting this regulatory system will mean the 
continued reputation of the safety of Canada's food supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is committed to protecting human health, animal health 
and the environment.  Our regulatory system is dedicated to 
maintaining the highest scientific standards.  We continually 
strive to ensure that scientific advice is broadly based and that 
our assessments will keep pace with new scientific discoveries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This commitment is reflected in the establishment of two 
important groups.  An expert panel and an advisory committee have 
been set up at the request of the government. The Royal Society 
of Canada at the request of the government has appointed an 
expert panel to examine future scientific developments in food 
biotechnology and to provide advice to the federal government 
accordingly. 
This proactive, forward thinking body will advise Health Canada, 
the CFIA and Environment Canada on the science capacity the 
federal government will need to maintain the safety of our new 
foods derived through biotechnology into the 21st century.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In examining the leading edge of this technology, the panel will 
identify the possibility of new or different issues related to 
the safety of products of food biotechnology.  It will suggest 
what new research, policies and regulatory capacity if any may be 
needed by the federal government to keep our standards of safety 
as high for the next generation of biotechnology derived foods as 
for what we have for the products approved today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Society's panel consists of people who have widely 
recognized expertise in specific areas of knowledge.  The panel 
is carefully balanced with respect to the various points of view 
on biotechnology issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Royal Society panels operate entirely independently of the 
agencies which request their reports, in this case the 
government.  They also operate independent of the Royal Society 
itself.  In short, Canadians can be assured that the Royal 
Society's expert panel will be balanced, fair and completely 
impartial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of challenges and opportunities associated 
with biotechnology that require detailed consideration and public 
discussion.  Food biotechnology presents Canadians with 
unprecedented challenges but also unprecedented opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recently formed Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee, 
CBAC, will bring stakeholders and interested parties together to 
advise the government, to raise public awareness and to engage 
Canadians in an open and transparent dialogue on biotechnology 
issues.  The CBAC will deal with tasks such as the issues 
surrounding regulation and stewardship of emerging applications 
of biotechnology with public education about biotechnology and 
the social, economic, environmental, legal and ethical issues 
related to food biotechnology.  It will monitor scientific 
developments that underpin new developments in the field of 
biotechnology and the application of these new developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to take part in the dialogue on food 
biotechnology.  The CBAC will actively create opportunities for 
Canadians to participate in its activities and discussions.  This 
will include an interactive website for interested Canadians to 
review, consult and provide input into the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this work is completed and the CBAC has also received the 
work of the Royal Society's expert panel, the CBAC will create an 
overarching report with recommendations to the government that 
will be informed by the work of the panel.  The work of the Royal 
Society's expert panel and the CBAC will contribute to a balanced 
and consultative process where all concerns can be thoroughly 
considered.  The government looks forward to the contributions 
that the expert panel and the CBAC will make to further the 
dialogue on biotechnology issues.  This is an example of the 
government's commitment to the exchange of ideas and the issues 
surrounding biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the expert panel and the CBAC, the scientists and 
specialists at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency as well as 
those at Health Canada all contribute to maintaining the safety 
of the food supply of Canada.  They help to ensure that Canada's 
regulatory system remains science based, that the regulatory 
system is fair and transparent, and that Canada's food supply 
remains one of the safest in the world.  That is money and effort 
well allocated and well spent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to the member talk about the regulatory process. 
I wish the members could understand that we are somehow 
questioning the regulatory process because we would like to go 
beyond what exists at present, beyond the equivalence principle. 
Of course, what we want is the security of our food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are not alarmists, we are quite happy when committees 
are struck to advise the government. I do not wish, however, for 
too many committees, because things would get bogged down 
and everything would be put off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we want our food to be safe, and we will go beyond what the 
regulatory process offers today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We are going to do 
things a little differently because I made a mistake.  Debate 
does not end until 5.30 because this is a non-votable motion. 
Therefore, the hon. member for Egmont who is on his feet, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health, has nine 
minutes in which to continue his dissertation.  I had instructed 
that there was only two minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If not, the hon. parliamentary secretary can take as long as he 
wants in responding to these questions, and then we will get to 
the member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière if there is time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will respond briefly to 
the hon. member's question. 
She says that she is not an alarmist and that is good news. 
There are a lot of alarmists around the world who are upsetting 
people unnecessarily when it comes to their comments on foods 
derived from biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the government is striking these panels, striking 
these advisory boards, getting as much information as possible 
and going through rigorous testing to make sure that any new 
foods are subjected to rigorous regulation and investigation 
before we ever put them before the Canadian public as food. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
to begin with, I would like to congratulate my colleague from 
Louis-Hébert for having presented this motion to the House, which 
reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to demonstrate openness with 
regard to genetically modified organisms, starting by making it 
mandatory to label genetically modified foods or foods 
containing genetically modified ingredients, in order to enable 
Canadians to make informed choices about the foods they eat. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read this text over many times, particularly the first 
words “That this House urge the government to demonstrate 
openness—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the member for Louis-Hébert have to urge the government 
to demonstrate openness? We have all followed the debate that 
took place in the first few months of the year and that was 
orchestrated by the so-called Miami group, to which Canada and 
the United States belong and which is opposed to the food 
labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why all this opposition when European and Asian countries like 
Japan and Korea have already adopted such measures. If it is 
good for the Japanese and the Europeans, why would it not be 
good for Canadians and Quebecers to know what is in the products 
that they consume? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for Louis-Hébert for bringing forward this 
debate in the House and also for having toured the province. 
She invited the members to accompany her. I was unable to attend 
the meeting held in my riding because of a death in the family, 
but I inquired about what had happened. I also listened to 
colleagues who talked about the various consultations that took 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Louis-Hébert did not only consult consumers. She 
also talked with producers and people from the industry. She 
held a balanced consultation process without bias or witch 
hunts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course she has proposed food labelling and in a way was 
rather innovative in putting this issue up for debate in the 
House of Commons. However, it is a matter that concerned a lot 
of people in the country, at least in Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A while ago I asked her to how many signatures had been 
collected for the petitions on the labelling, not the banning of 
GMOs, and she said that between 45,000 and 50,000 signatures had 
been collected so far, only in Quebec. This means that a lot of 
people are worried. The issue is not necessarily being discussed 
every day, but occasionally, at the Montreal debate for example. 
It is therefore a public concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She probably gave out information when she was touring Quebec, 
because people came unsolicited to my riding office and said “I 
want to sign the petition”. They were well informed. Eight out 
of ten were mothers. They are more concerned about the food their 
children and their family eat. They probably care more than men, 
but I know that some men are also concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen that the majority of Liberal members have spoken 
out in opposition, although there were what I might call some 
heartening exceptions. The Liberal member who spoke before the 
last speaker went even further, asking that all products be 
labelled. We cannot object to this principle, but there are some 
natural products the contents of which we do not need to know 
because they have been around for so long, for hundreds of years, 
and they never made anyone sick. But GMO technology is rather 
new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father was a farmer. I am 52 years old today, and when I was 
a kid, I used to help him spray DDT on potato crops. It was not 
illegal then, and we did not use any protection or protective 
masks. DDT was used to protect the crop from insects, especially 
those called potato bugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some time later, it was realized that DDT is extremely 
dangerous. As soon as they were made aware of this, farmers 
immediately discontinued this practice. Most farmers are 
responsible people. They do not want to harm people's health or 
their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I sat on the environment committee for my 
colleague from Jonquière. The committee had a discussion on 
pesticides. We can see their impact and the concerns they raise. 
Members in the party opposite are deeply concerned about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many kinds of pesticides, of course. There is a 
certain analogy to be made with GMOs. Members from all parties 
were asking whether we have made all the studies we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who have described the hon. member for Louis-Hébert as 
a scaremonger, I would say that she is just being cautious. In 
matters of food and human health, caution should prevail. We 
should not scare people but we must show them that we need to be 
cautious. The principle of openness underpins democracy and we 
have a right to information. That is what the charter says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a principle is guaranteed in the charter, it must mean 
something. It must be adhered to. We cannot say, as the Liberal 
government does, that it would be too costly or that we would 
need more human resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, 200 food quality experts from the federal 
government wrote to the Minister of Health to let him know that 
because of a lack of personnel they could not make all of the 
required analyses. This is the reality now, but, because of a 
lack of personnel, are we going to close our eyes, ignore the 
risks and prevent any check? This would be absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to go too far, because I know that this is a word 
that is almost taboo in this House, but regarding hepatitis C and 
all the problems caused by the HIV tainted blood and so on, who 
would have thought at that time that such a thing could happen? 
The problem was acknowledged, because caution is always the best 
way to go. Of course, here, we are not talking about these kinds 
of issues, but there are people who are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Louis-Hébert is not being alarmist, because I 
know that she is a great specialist in this area. She was the 
first woman to become an agrologist in Quebec. This is quite 
something. That dates her, but it is true. She was an assistant 
deputy minister in Quebec's Department of Agriculture. She was a 
member of the Commission de la protection du territoire agricole. 
Her father was a searcher in this area. So, I do not see how she 
can be embarrassed of my reminding her of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have full confidence in her and I have known her for many 
years. When the hon. member for Louis-Hébert immerses herself in 
an issue like this, she takes it seriously and is very thorough. 
Indeed, she became some kind of an expert on GMOs for many 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I am in favour of progress and I think that we must 
not necessarily reject GMOs because they have tremendous 
possibilities and many benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I rise today to speak to the issue, it is to protect the 
right to information of the public and to promote transparency. 
I think that those principles command that we put the efforts, 
the money, the resources, the research and the studies needed. 
We know that knowledge is important. For that reason, it is 
important to know all that needs to be known and not to let 
something as fundamental as food subject to arbitrary or hasty 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about food, but we could also talk about the risks for 
the environment. I am a farmer's son and I know that in some 
parts of the United States and elsewhere in the world, the soil 
has been overexploited. In the end, if proper care is not taken, 
the farming potential of the land can be affected. We cannot ask 
too much too rapidly from farm land without dire consequences. 
That applies to the use of fertilizers and other things. That is 
the risk I saw when I read the documentation on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first sight we could think that it would be better to have 
bigger and faster growing fruits and vegetables. Of course there 
are clearly economic benefits, but I ask myself some questions. 
When the same companies, the same corporations, that extol the 
virtues of genetically modified organisms are selling 
pesticides, insecticides or chemical fertilizers, it is almost 
as if the doctor owned the drugstore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, there was a time when it was like that, but it is not 
allowed anymore. We are trying to avoid integration, because we 
do not want to put people in a conflict of interest because they 
are promoting one industry and trying to offset the effects of a 
phenomenon that they are benefiting from at the same time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance)</B> 
moved: 
<A NAME="LINK220">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should defend 
the constitutionality of Section 43 of the Criminal Code in the 
Courts and, if necessary, should take legislative action to 
reinstate Section 43 in the event that it is struck down, 
including invoking the notwithstanding clause of the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms (Section 33 of the Constitution Act, 1982). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege and an honour for me to 
rise to speak to Motion No. 341, a motion which would protect 
teachers, parents and their children from unwarranted and heavy 
handed state intrusion.  I will read the motion again: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should defend 
the constitutionality of Section 43 of the Criminal Code in the 
Courts and, if necessary, should take legislative action to 
reinstate Section 43 in the event that it is struck down, 
including invoking the notwithstanding clause of the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I brought the motion forward is that some children 
rights advocates want to see section 43 declared by the courts to 
be in violation of the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1999 a group calling itself the Canadian Foundation 
for Children, Youth and the Law asked the Ontario superior court 
to declare section 43 to be in violation of the charter and 
therefore unconstitutional.  My motion opposes such efforts.  I 
understand from other colleagues in the House today that there is 
a fair bit of support for the nature of the motion before us, and 
I am grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 43 of the criminal code today parents are allowed 
to use physical force to restrain or correct their children as 
long as it is not abusive, is by way of correction and is 
reasonable under the circumstances.  The relevant statute is 
section 43 of the criminal code which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every school teacher, parent or person standing in the place of a 
parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a 
pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the 
force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section of the code limits the way force can be used on a 
child in two ways.  First, a parent is justified in using force 
only if the force is intended and used for a specific purpose, 
namely by way of correction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That requirement has existed in Canadian law since 1864 in a 
decision in which the court stated that the power of correction 
can only be used in the interest of instruction.  It cannot be 
for some arbitrariness, anger or bad humour.  That would be an 
offence punishable like other ordinary offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, force is only justifiable if it is used in the 
best interest of a child to correct a child from engaging in 
improper conduct.  The section does not justify a parent using 
force to vent anger.  An instructional purpose with respect to 
the child's interest must motivate the use of force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a parent's use of force is limited also in that it must 
be reasonable under the circumstances.  In assessing whether the 
force used by the parent was reasonable, the courts have 
formulated a test which considers the following factors, and I 
think they are good factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court takes into account the nature of the child's offence 
calling for punishment and whether such conduct merits 
punishment.  It takes into account the age and the character of 
that child; the likely effect of punishment on the child; the 
degree and gravity of the punishment; the manner in which the 
punishment was inflicted; the injuries that resulted, if any; the 
parts of the body where the force was applied; and whether 
punishment was motivated by arbitrariness, caprice, anger or bad 
temper.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While judges sometimes apply these criteria differently it is 
safe to say that the successful application of such criteria 
demonstrates the effectiveness and the value of section 43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In court hearings in December last year the Coalition for Family 
Autonomy noted that a database search of the weekly criminal 
bulletin showed that there were 99 cases in which parental 
discipline was the issue.  In these cases we see the criteria of 
reasonableness at work.  For example, since 1965 there have been 
five cases where acquittals were entered when bruising occurred 
but 16 cases involving bruising where the accused was convicted. 
The court took this into account and convicted 16 of these 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In cases involving objects used to strike a child, the case 
survey indicates that there were twice as many convictions as 
acquittals.  Of the 47 cases which reported the use of some 
object in striking or the “discipline”, there were 31 
convictions and just 13 acquittals.  In every case involving 
children under two a conviction was entered.  The case law survey 
also indicated that courts are mindful of the manner in which the 
discipline is administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is simply that section 43 has operated in practice in 
a manner where the jurisprudence has developed a detailed set of 
factors which the courts have used to interpret section 43 and 
its demand for reasonableness.  All this points to the fact that 
this section in the criminal code is both workable and is 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 34 year period from 1965 to 1999 in only 24 of the 99 
cases found in the database search was there an acquittal of a 
parent charged of assaulting his or her child.  That very low 
number hardly suggests that adults are routinely using section 43 
to get away with abusing their children.  In fact the more 
numerous convictions indicate otherwise.  In the 24 acquittals 
there may have been instances in which the judge made a error and 
should not have acquitted the parent.  That is a problem with the 
judge.  The appeals should happen and it should be pursued to the 
full extent of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43 of the criminal code is doing its job.  Prior to the 
enactment of this section of the code there was no legislation 
placing limits on the use of physical correction and there were 
no government agencies designed to protect children from abuse. 
When section 43 of the code came into law, children had for the 
first time legal protection from physical abuse.  Thanks to 
section 43 parents cannot physically abuse their children in the 
name of discipline.  They cannot exceed what is reasonable under 
the circumstances.  As long as the police and the courts do their 
jobs, child abusers will be prosecuted under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat ironic that the very same people who are arguing 
for the removal of section 43, argue that it protects only 
parental rights.  That is clearly not the case.  The irony is 
that the whole reason section 43 came into existence in the first 
place was to balance the right of parents to correct the 
behaviour of their children and the rights of children not to be 
abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good law.  It was well conceived at the time.  It has 
served its purpose well and continues to serve us well today. For 
that reason section 43 strikes that necessary balance between the 
rights of parents and the rights of children.  On one hand, 
parents must have the freedom to fulfil their responsibility to 
their children and to society and to raise their children to be 
moral, decent people who respect others.  On the other hand, we 
believe that children have the right to be free from physical 
abuse and bodily harm.  Section 43 strikes that proper balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is disconcerting that some children rights 
advocates, specifically the group calling itself the Canadian 
Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law, are trying to have 
this section of the criminal code removed or declared 
unconstitutional.  If this group succeeds in having section 43 
struck down, the results would be absurd and totally 
unacceptable.  Many good and loving parents from that point on 
would be made criminals overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics indicate that some 70% of parents spank their 
child from time to time as a reasonable corrective discipline in 
respect to their children.  Removing section 43 would mean that 
many of them would become criminals overnight.  It would simply 
not be true of parents who swat little Johnny on the bottom from 
time to time.  It would be true of parents who do not even spank 
their children. 
When a parent tries to restrain a child, that could be treated as 
an assault subject to criminal prosecution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to talk about why there is a real chill for teachers 
if section 43 is removed. If section 43 is removed, a parent 
could be charged with criminal assault for forcibly removing a 
misbehaving child from a shopping mall, for picking up a 
misbehaving child and putting him or her out of the way of harm 
or for putting him or her to bed against his or her will. 
Teachers share this exact same concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Teachers' Federation appeared as an intervenor in 
last December's court case in Ontario and argued in favour of 
retaining section 43 of the criminal code.  The federation 
believed that removing the section would be detrimental to 
maintaining a safe and secure school environment.  The federation 
pointed to a number of day to day school situations in which the 
safety of students and the learning environment could be 
adversely affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure there are teachers here who could tell us of specific 
instances where restraint is required in a school situation for 
the safety of a student and the protection of others as well. The 
teachers in their intervention cited instances where there is the 
need to protect students or teachers when a fight occurs at 
school, including the need to restrain those students if 
necessary.  Also there are situations where there is a need to 
escort an uncooperative student to the principal's office, to 
bring him or her along by the arm.  In that instance lo and 
behold an assault charge may be laid for that type of escort down 
the hall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The teachers referred to a situation involving ejecting a 
student who refuses to leave the classroom or the school itself. 
The teachers' federation also referred in its intervention to 
situations such as during a field trip when they have to place a 
young student on the bus who has refused to return to the bus. 
There are also situations where teachers may have to restrain a 
cognitively impaired student. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The teachers' federation is concerned that if section 43 were 
removed from the criminal code, the result would be widespread 
fear among teachers of being charged with assault.  As a 
precaution teachers would be advised or would choose not to 
intervene in school situations since stepping in to resolve the 
difficult situation might lead to their being charged with 
assault.  That reticence of teachers to step into the gap could 
result in more serious injuries to students as well as in a 
deterioration of the school learning environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Removing section 43 for our schools and Canadian families would 
be a disgrace to our judicial system.  If it were struck down, it 
would be a massive intrusion of the state into the educational 
and family environments of our nation. Former Prime Minister 
Trudeau said that the state had no business in the bedrooms of 
the nation.  Anyone who removes section 43 of the criminal code 
will be moving the state into the nation's family rooms.  That 
would be tragic.  The state makes a lousy parent and should not 
presume to tell parents how best to shape the moral character of 
their children as long as abuse is not involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I have introduced this motion, to defend section 43 
of the criminal code, even to the extent of going into court 
situations and invoking the notwithstanding clause if necessary. 
The aim of the motion is to enable caring non-abusive parents to 
do the best job possible of raising their children to be 
responsible, well adjusted individuals and members of society. It 
protects the rights of parents to raise their children in 
accordance with their moral and religious beliefs about the 
effect of child rearing, their personal knowledge of the unique 
characteristics of their own children and their own understanding 
of how best to discipline children which has been gained from 
their parents and their own experiences during childhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion accomplishes this goal in two ways.  First, it 
requires that the government defend section 43 of the criminal 
code in the courts.  In the event that one or more rulings were 
to strike down section 43, the motion would permit the government 
to invoke the notwithstanding clause of the charter of rights and 
freedoms. Notwithstanding a court's decision to strike down the 
law, section 43 would remain the law of the land. After the 
Sharpe decision relating to child pornography, more and more 
parliamentarians are realizing that parliament has an obligation 
to protect Canadians from judicial rulings which we cannot 
understand and which do not make a lot of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parenting has always been a challenge.  Raising children to be 
responsible and law-abiding members of society is more of a 
challenge than ever before.  The surge in teen violence during 
the past decade testifies to that fact.  The shootings a year ago 
in high schools in the U.S. and Canada have horrified all of us. 
Now is not the time to handicap parents in their role as moral 
guides.  It is for these reasons that I brought forward this 
initiative.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my wrap-up in the last five minutes I will refer to some of 
the effects of physical discipline on children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I want to ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House to have the motion before us deemed adopted and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Wanuskewin has asked for the unanimous consent of the House to 
have his motion passed.  Does the hon. member for Wanuskewin have 
the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to the member's motion in support of the 
general thrust of the motion. The tone of my support is somewhat 
different from that of the member who moved the motion.  He 
tended to configure his support for the motion in the context of 
being anti-state or keeping the state out of how the family is 
run.  I would suggest to him that section 43 is already a 
manifestation of the state having a right to set limits on what 
parents are able to do in terms of disciplining their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was somewhat of a contradiction in the member's argument. 
Either the state has this right or it does not.  I would suggest 
that it does and that section 43 is an appropriate reflection of 
that right of the state. The member himself pointed to the fact 
that the origin of this section was an intention to protect 
children and to limit and to eliminate physical abuse of 
children.  It was not designed to condone, to permit or to 
promote, but rather to set the appropriate context where physical 
discipline can be used by parents on children and by teachers on 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would call the attention of the House to the fact that this is 
not just a matter of individual members of parliament having this 
concern, it is also a concern that teachers have.  It has been 
expressed as the member noted by the Canadian Teachers' 
Federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federation argued quite persuasively that with the 
elimination of section 43, if it were to be removed from the 
criminal code, there would be a dramatic increase in the number 
of assault charges on teachers.  As a precaution teachers would 
be advised or would choose not to intervene in school situations 
since their stepping in to resolve the situation might lead to 
their being charged with assault. The reticence of teachers to 
step in would result in more serious injuries to students as well 
as a deterioration of the classroom and school learning 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about here is not the premeditated corporal 
punishment of strapping that used to occur in schools.  We are 
talking about those situations in which teachers want to have the 
freedom to intervene in the moment to protect students when there 
is a fight, to escort uncooperative students, to eject a student 
who refuses to leave a classroom, to place a young student on a 
bus who refuses to leave after a field trip or who refuses to go 
and needs to go, or to restrain certain students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things do not have to do with the old fashioned 
premeditated corporal punishment that took the form of strapping, 
the efficacy of which I always doubted very much.  I think 
schools are better without it.  I do not see any evidence that 
schools perform worse in any significant respect given the 
absence of strapping or the absence of premeditated corporal 
punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that teachers would not be able to do anything would 
be a mistake, just as it would be a mistake to suggest that 
parents cannot do anything.  Whenever we get into a zero 
tolerance situation we create a culture of fear and intimidation. 
We already see this now with the whole notion of physical 
contact. 
Teachers and other people who deal with children are afraid to 
put their arms around anybody.  They are afraid to hug a child 
who needs emotional support.  They are afraid to do all kinds of 
things for fear they might be accused of child abuse or sexual 
harassment.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to eliminate judgment from our society.  When 
anything can possibly be used in a negative way we say let us not 
have it at all.  That is a mistake.  We are human beings.  We are 
given a certain amount of freedom and we have to exercise 
judgment.  The motion says that we do not want parents or 
teachers to be able to exercise judgment and to be held 
accountable for the kind of judgments they make. We want to 
eliminate that capacity for judgment.  That is a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of obvious examples.  When toddlers or kids want to 
put their hands on a hot stove, are we to be criminalized for 
tapping the tops of their hands and telling them not to put their 
hands on the hot element or in the fire?  Are we to be 
criminalized for patting them on the bottom if they persist in 
running out into traffic?  These kinds of little things can 
create an atmosphere for various kinds of witch hunts. There is 
also the example of siblings harming each other who need to be 
kept from doing so even if it is by physical restraint or 
physical discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think section 43 at the present time is sufficient. I have 
received a lot of mail from constituents who seem to feel that 
the elimination of section 43 is imminent and they want me to 
stop it.  There is a bit of political campaigning here. Some 
people are trying to exploit this issue for political purposes, 
creating a sense that something is about to happen which is not 
about to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always made it clear to constituents who have written to 
me that I would not be in favour of repealing section 43 for the 
reasons I have just outlined, and I think the majority of members 
of parliament would not either. If there is a way we can put this 
to rest both for the sake of the substance of the matter and to 
eliminate some of the politics that have surrounded the issue, 
that would serve everybody very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a family which for at least two generations the use 
of corporal punishment was something that was exceedingly rare so 
my comments are not out of defence of anything I have found in my 
own experience.  I think all of us, at least those in my 
generation, would attest that many of our parents come from a 
generation where corporal punishment was the rule of the day. 
Family stories are replete with what happened if a child talked 
back to his or her father or misbehaved.  There has been all 
kinds corporal punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not making an argument for corporal punishment.  I am just 
saying that some of the connections we often simplistically make 
do not always hold up sociologically and historically. I think 
one of the best generations that ever existed in this country, my 
parents' generation, was a generation that was raised in a 
context where parents dished out a lot more physical discipline 
than any of us here would regard as acceptable.  I am not saying 
that was a good thing; in fact in many respects I think it was a 
bad thing, but to draw any quick and easy psychological or 
sociological conclusions about when people are on the receiving 
end of corporal punishment, if it happens in an appropriate 
context it is not always for the worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should leave section 43 as it stands. I hope other members 
feel likewise.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I seconded this motion because I support section 43. I 
want to discuss this motion and take the approach of a lawyer as 
opposed to a teacher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say for those who are following the debate either in 
<I>Hansard</I> or on television or in other reported media that 
this is a motion, not a bill.  This motion was not deemed to be 
votable by the subcommittee on private members' business so there 
will be no vote. 
Indeed, the speeches this evening will end after one hour of 
debate and the subject matter will be dropped from the order of 
debate.  Having said that, I think the subject matter is 
important.  I commend the hon. member who is the mover of the 
motion for bringing it forward, particularly in view of the 
current legal history.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for the federal government to defend the 
section.  As I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice will point out when he gets a chance to 
speak, the federal government is defending section 43 and did 
defend section 43 before the Supreme Court of Canada.  I want to 
take a look at the section specifically.  We are talking about 
section 43, but perhaps people do not truly know what it says. 
It is really very short, so I propose to read it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to <I>Martin's Criminal Code</I>, which refers to 
section 43 of the Criminal Code of Canada.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a 
parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a 
pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the 
force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note exactly to whom this section applies. 
It applies to schoolteachers.  It applies to parents.  It applies 
to persons standing in the place of a parent.  It applies to 
child and pupil.  It does not apply, let us say, to police, 
coaches or others who might come in contact with children.  It 
applies to those individuals named. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read a brief synopsis of section 43 contained in 
<I>Martin's Criminal Code</I>. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section justifies the use of force by certain persons to 
correct a child or pupil. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course “force” is not defined.  Some people call this the 
spanking section, but there are many other kinds of force that 
may be used in varying degrees that are not spanking.  It is 
important to note that we are talking about the use of force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The persons who may rely upon this section are schoolteachers, 
parents or those standing in the place of a parent.  The child or 
pupil must be under the care of the person using the force, and 
the force must be applied for the purpose of correcting the 
child. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is critically important.  The force must be applied for the 
purpose of correcting the child.  It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, if the child is too young to learn from the correction or 
is incapable due to mental disability, the use of force will not 
be justified by s. 43.  The force applied cannot exceed what is 
reasonable in the circumstances... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In determining whether the force used has exceeded what is 
reasonable under the circumstances, the court must consider both 
from an objective and subjective standpoint such matters as the 
nature of the offence calling for correction, the age and 
character of the child and the likely effect of the punishment on 
the particular child, the degree of gravity of the punishment, 
the circumstances under which it is inflicted and the injuries, 
if any, suffered. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two citations I have made specifically because to me they 
indicate how this section is to work.  It is a very specific 
section, designed for very specific people in very specific 
circumstances.  It is designed to be examined on a fact by fact 
situational basis.  To me that is what is important.  What may be 
reasonable use of force by a teacher in one circumstance may not 
be reasonable use of force by a teacher in another circumstance. 
It is very important that there be a combination of the objective 
and subjective tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also very important for the reasons we heard from the two 
members who spoke previously, that the use of force in 
appropriate circumstances in a reasonable manner be continued to 
be permitted. 
We heard a couple of the more obvious examples given by the 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona, in particular where the immediate 
safety of the child is of concern.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who have opposed section 43, in my opinion, have 
taken worst case fact situations and applied them to tar section 
43 with an unnecessarily black brush.  The court system is 
adequately designed to deal with each individual fact situation. 
If there is an aberrant decision by an aberrant judge, the court 
of appeal is there to provide guidance in a particular 
circumstance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of appropriate force in appropriate circumstances has 
been part of human history since the first child was produced. 
It seems eminently reasonable that section 43 is there not only 
for the protection of the child, but also for the protection of 
those who apply force in reasonable circumstances for the purpose 
of correction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I really do not want to go on ad infinitum. 
The section is reasonable.  There is no reasonable argument that 
I can see or accept for the abolition of the section.  I think it 
should be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say one thing, however, about the use of section 33. 
I think that the motion stated that if the section were to be 
found unconstitutional, then we should use section 33.  With that 
I agree.  That is a nuclear option that parliament has to control 
the courts.  It should be used very sparingly and very carefully, 
but it can be used and should be used in appropriate 
circumstances to demonstrate the supremacy of parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is a very interesting and timely debate that 
has been brought forward by the hon. member for Wanuskewin. 
Private member's motion No. 341 talks about defending the 
constitutionality of section 43 of our criminal code and, if 
necessary, taking the legislative action to reinstate section 43, 
including invoking the notwithstanding clause of our Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very supportive of the upholding and the reinforcement, if 
necessary, of section 43 of our criminal code.  I think the 
member opposite and previous speakers have spoken quite 
eloquently and have set out before the House the necessity and 
the background with respect to why we have section 43 in the 
criminal code.  It is there essentially to set very much a 
standard for the reasonable force that can be used to take 
corrective measures or to take action when necessary to 
discipline a child in a situation, whether it be at home or at 
school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That section of the criminal code has been in place for a number 
of years.  It has been tested in the courts.  It has been 
examined extensively by courts and by litigators across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member for Wanuskewin for bringing this 
motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I have some difficulty with respect to invoking 
the notwithstanding clause with respect to this type of criminal 
code section.  That is not to diminish the importance of what the 
hon. member is seeking to accomplish.  I think it is a productive 
opportunity here in the House to examine the situation, to flesh 
out this issue further and to look at the issue of discipline, in 
particular with respect to parents, teachers and community 
workers, those who are in regular contact with children.  It is a 
very trying time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that adults are very much in a situation 
at times where they are forced to make the judgment call to 
decide whether to take the appropriate physical action, which 
they must measure, and somehow try to apply a standard of 
restraint when it comes to physical coercion or restraint of a 
child.  It becomes a very dicey and grey issue.  This type of 
debate is helpful in that regard. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1840"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents are in a unique position because they know their 
children best and they know when they have to take that type of 
extraordinary measure in terms of controlling a child in certain 
instances.  Children, obviously, at times need discipline and 
parents need the power to invoke this type of reasonable 
corrective action.  Parents know best.  They know the unique 
characteristics of their children and they know the most 
effective way, for the most part, to raise their child, including 
discipline in that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is obviously a need to protect the bodily integrity of 
everyone, and our criminal code does so.  It goes without saying 
that children are more informed about their rights than they have 
ever been at any time in our history.  That is a good thing.  The 
education system teaches children and teaches our citizens 
generally more about the law than in previous generations.  It is 
very important that Canadians know and understand their legal 
rights and the obligations which flow from those rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43 would help to defend the right of a parent or an 
adult to intervene in certain circumstances and apply measured, 
reasonable, restrained physical force.  Thus, the issue becomes, 
is there a necessity to protect that right?  Yes, there is.  That 
is what is at the very root of this motion.  It is a genuine, 
sincere attempt to protect and uphold a section of the criminal 
code that has a very important and productive background and 
necessity in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that there should ever be any indication that 
this section should be misused or that this section should be 
construed in some way as to condone or encourage any sort of 
excessive physical force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some high profile cases before the courts.  The 
one that comes to mind is a recent case in which an American 
citizen, in this country, was seen to be using what was 
perceived, in a parking lot area, to be excessive force in 
disciplining his daughter.  That case resulted in the police 
intervening and has become somewhat of a cause célèbre in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts have been quite measured in examining these 
situations.  They have, in their discretion, looked at the 
factual circumstances of each and every case.  Again, as referred 
to by the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest, it is very much 
an individualized situation.  In every case before a court of law 
there is an ample opportunity to flesh out the circumstances, the 
factual evidence.  The crown prosecutor, in conjunction with the 
police, is to present evidence that would support a charge of 
assault or a like charge that involved the use of force.  Section 
43 is very much there as a filter and a sword to protect the 
person who has been accused of exercising this type of physical 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is understandable that there is some trepidation.  We have 
all received calls both in our constituency offices and here in 
Ottawa from concerned citizens every time there is a case before 
the courts.  Every time this situation arises there is a concern 
that parents and adults, likewise, feel that they will not be 
permitted to use reasonable force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only trepidation I have in the wording of this particular 
motion is with the reference to the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had discussions with the mover of this motion, who gives 
assurance, and I think it is implicit when we read it carefully, 
that it is very much not a pre-emptive strike, but it is there in 
its wording to suggest that if things proceed in the fashion that 
the hon. member anticipates, there may be the need for the 
government to intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I find it difficult to justify the way in which 
it is presented.  That is to say, at this time there is not an 
epidemic of abuse, where individuals are relying on this section 
to justify abuse.  We are not faced with a situation where there 
is a great deal of misunderstanding as to what type of force is 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, when physical injury results or when force is used in 
a very inappropriate way, sometimes it is not just the physical 
abuse that needs to be examined. 
We obviously know of occasions where a child can be berated, 
verbally abused, intimidated and scared, and that type of abuse 
also has to be examined when looking at like situations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an important quote by Morris Manning that I want to put 
on the record.  In his legal commentary, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our freedom of conscience or religion can be taken away by a 
law which operates notwithstanding the Charter, if our right to 
life or liberty can be taken not in accordance with the 
principles of fundamental justice, what freedom do we have. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is obviously suggesting that we must tread very lightly when 
using the notwithstanding clause.  Much akin to the idea behind 
this motion and behind section 43 of the criminal code, we must 
be very measured and careful before invoking such an extreme 
measure.  It was referred to as the nuclear bomb of our legal 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To use the notwithstanding clause essentially annihilates 
precedent.  It annihilates the use of the courts to do their job 
and to exercise discretion and judgment over our laws.  It 
suspends discussion on a legal principle and on a law.  We have 
to be extremely cautious before going down that road.  I know the 
hon. member who moved this motion is aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very subjective and objective debate when it comes to 
the appropriateness of physical intervention.  I suspect all 
members in the House feel very strongly about upholding the 
importance and integrity of section 43 of the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons, I feel it is appropriate that we exhaust all 
avenues currently within our system and that judicial discretion 
be respected in each and every case.  One would hope that this 
particular factual circumstance under section 43 will not be 
struck down by our courts.  That is not to anticipate what any 
superior court or supreme court in the country will do, but at 
this time I do not feel it is necessary to invoke or at least 
threaten to invoke the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again congratulate the hon. member on his initiative in 
bringing this forward.  It is a useful debate and one that may 
have to be revisited at some time in the near future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak.  I have done a lot of work in this area and have 
formulated a declaration of parental rights and responsibilities, 
which, if time allows, I will go into a little bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say several things in the short time I am allowed.  I 
want to show the necessity of the resolution we are debating.  I 
also want to point out clearly that the government says one thing 
but does another.  It talks the talk but it does not walk the 
walk.  That is why this resolution is necessary.  I will give a 
couple of very good examples of that. That is why this should 
have been voted on in the House but the government would not 
allow that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go into this, I will point out my view and the views of 
many of my constituents on this.  Parental discipline is quite 
different from child abuse and neglect.  Child abuse and neglect 
should not be tolerated but section 43 strikes a balance by 
protecting children from abuse while still allowing parents to 
correct their children, within the limits that are acceptable to 
Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Teachers' Federation states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43 of the Criminal Code does not sanction or condone 
child abuse.... There is no evidence to indicate that the 
existence of Section 43 is a root cause of child abuse or that it 
encourages abuse of children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that responsible, loving parents sometimes have 
to correct their children to keep them from harm.  Removing 
section 43 of the criminal code may make criminals out of parents 
who use reasonable corrective action with their kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents, not the government, are best suited to determine the 
needs, including disciplinary measures, of their own children. 
Removing a means for parents to discipline their children will 
result in more state intrusion into family life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maintaining section 43 of the criminal code shows respect for 
Canadian parents.  It shows respect for the democratic process. 
It is through debate in parliament, not in the court chambers, 
where important public policy decisions like this should be made.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are concerns about what is deemed reasonable in 
parental discipline, it would be better to develop guidelines 
rather than potentially criminalizing all parents by a court 
decision.  Using tax dollars to fund a lobby group to make an end 
run around the democratic process and push social policy through 
the courts is inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are my views and that is where I am coming from when I 
make my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have laws that address abuse.  The government has done a 
terrible job on family issues and should not interfere with 
parental rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a former teacher.  I want to read what the Canadian 
Teachers' Federation had to say about section 43 of the criminal 
code, because this section does not just deal with parents, it 
also deals with teachers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Teachers' Federation appeared in court in December 
to argue in favour of keeping section 43 in the criminal code. 
The federation believes that the removal of section 43 would be 
detrimental to maintaining a safe and secure school environment 
for all students.  Removing section 43 would encourage some 
students to engage in insubordinate or disruptive behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I was a teacher for 24 and a half years and I think 
that is a very key point.  We should not tie the hands of our 
teachers in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Teachers' Federation points to a number of day to 
day school situations in which the safety of students in the 
learning environment would be adversely affected if section 43 
were to be repealed.  Such situations are more likely to occur in 
a school setting than in the home given the large number of 
children and youth who attend school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some examples that the Canadian Teachers' Federation 
puts forth.  There is a need to protect students or teachers when 
a fight occurs at school, including the need to restrain students 
if necessary.  Another example is the need to escort an 
unco-operative student to the principal's office.  A third 
situation would involve ejecting a student who refuses to leave 
the classroom or the school itself.  A fourth situation would be 
placing a young student on the bus in a situation where the 
student has been on a field trip and refuses to return on the 
bus.  The last example would be restraining a cognitively 
impaired student. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all examples I can relate to because I had similar 
concerns and incidents when I was teaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Teachers' Federation is concerned that if section 
43 were removed from the criminal code, the result would be a 
dramatic increase in the number of assault charges.  As a 
precaution, teachers would be advised or choose not to intervene 
in school situations, since their stepping in to resolve the 
situation might lead to their being charged with assault.  We 
would accomplish the very opposite of what we want, which is the 
protection of our children.  That is why we should not change 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that since the state has discouraged 
the use of physical correction in schools, violence has 
increased, which is the opposite of what many of these groups 
have argued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said I would give a couple of examples in the few minutes 
remaining.  I do not have time to read the entire response to a 
petition I had submitted in the House.  The response comes from 
the government and indicates quite clearly that the government 
says one thing to the public but it does not walk the walk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This document states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government fully recognizes the indispensable role of parents 
in the upbringing of their children and the need for governments 
at all levels to support parents and families in the exercise of 
this role. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It then goes on to say that section 43 of the criminal code is 
consistent with these principles and that it will protect them. 
There is no indication on the part of government that it is going 
to withdraw this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say “and is not funding any research on its 
removal from the criminal code”.  The government said this on 
July 22, 1998.  Guess what we found out in November of that year? 
We found out that it was funding the Canadian Coalition for the 
Rights of Children, a loyal lobby group purchased with $365,000 
of taxpayers' money.  We also found out that the government was 
only funding one side of the issue, and this was the only 
organization it was funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had more time because I think this is a key point.  The 
government says that it is defending parents, that it is 
defending their rights, that it will not touch section 43 and 
that it will not fund any of these things, but a few months later 
we find out that it was in fact pouring big bucks into that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my colleague from Calgary Centre pointed this out, he sent 
an inquiry to the bureaucracy about the parliamentary review of 
Canada's report that it was sending, and we found out that the 
government funded only one side of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second example is the court challenges program.  Here we 
have the government again funding only one side of the issue.  I 
have evidence on this but I do not have time to give it.  This is 
yet another example of the government saying one thing but doing 
another.  The funding of the Canadian Foundation for Children, 
Youth and the Law is clear on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had time to quote from my declaration of parental 
rights and responsibilities but I will refer people to my website 
on the Internet if they want to know what I proposed in this 
regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this motion calls on the federal government to, first and 
foremost, defend the constitutionality of section 43 in the 
courts.  I want to indicate at the outset that the federal 
government is doing exactly that.  We are defending the 
constitutionality of section 43 in the courts.  This matter is in 
fact still before the courts and, accordingly, it would be 
inappropriate for me to provide further comment on this specific 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a general misunderstanding of the purpose and the 
ambit of section 43.  Section 43 provides that a parent, teacher 
or a person standing in the place of a parent may use force to 
correct a child, provided that the force used is reasonable in 
all circumstances.  This is what sections 43 says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43 does not, however, condone or authorize the physical 
abuse of children.  Equally important, it does not shield 
parents, teachers or caregivers from interference by the state or 
guarantee their freedom to discipline or correct children in any 
manner they see fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does section 43 operate?  A person who has been charged with 
the assault of a child under his or her care can raise section 43 
as a defence.  In other words, section 43 provides a defence to a 
criminal charge of assault for a limited category of persons in a 
limited set of circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43 is a limited defence to a criminal charge because it 
is only available to an accused who is a parent, teacher or 
person acting in the place of a parent, and only with respect to 
a child or pupil under the person's care.  It is a limited 
defence because the force in question must have been administered 
for the purpose of correction.  Force exerted in a fit of rage or 
in a deliberate attempt to hurt a child will not be justified 
under section 43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is a limited defence because the force used must 
have been reasonable in all of the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian courts are very accustomed to applying a standard of 
reasonableness.  Courts that are asked to consider a section 43 
defence generally assess the reasonableness of the force by 
considering a number of factors.  For example, they consider the 
nature and severity of the force in question, including any 
injuries suffered by the child, the child's behaviour or action 
calling for correction, the age of the child and the history of 
disciplinary action by the parent, vis-à-vis that child. Further, 
when determining whether the force used was reasonable, the 
standard that the courts apply is that of the Canadian community 
and not the standard or practice of the individual family or 
school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To return to the specific issue raised by the motion, the 
federal government is defending the constitutionality of section 
43 on the basis that it reflects a constitutional balance of the 
interests of children, parents and of Canadian society.  However, 
section 43, interpreted and applied in conformity with the 
charter, does not condone or authorize child abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that the protection of children 
from child abuse is not only a priority for the federal 
government in terms of criminal law reform.  Provincial and 
territorial child protection legislation authorizes state 
intervention to protect children in need of protection, including 
to protect children from child abuse.  As a result, even if the 
charges are not laid under the criminal code, child protection 
authorities can and do intervene under provincial or territorial 
legislation where parental discipline is inappropriate or 
excessive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also calls on the federal government to invoke 
section 33 of the charter or the notwithstanding clause in the 
event that section 43 of the criminal code is struck down.  In my 
view, it is inappropriate to consider the invocation of the 
notwithstanding clause of the charter at this point in time. 
Invoking section 33 is a serious step that we must not take 
easily or casually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If section 43 is ultimately struck down as unconstitutional, I 
would caution us to allow for a considered review of all of the 
options open to us to deal with both the criminal law system and 
the child protection laws before ever contemplating using section 
33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Invoking 
section 33 of the charter is a serious matter which should only 
be considered in exceptional cases and only after all other legal 
avenues have been exhausted.  This is the only responsible choice 
open to us as members of parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (WanusKewin, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think it was the understanding of all members in the House, including 
the Liberal member opposite, that the use of section 33, the notwithstanding 
clause, was only “if necessary”.   We would first use the full 
extent of the law and the appeals process.  Because of the 
importance of this whole issue, once that was exhausted only then 
would section 33 kick in.  The record has to be clear.  We are 
not talking about using section 33 pre-emptively or prematurely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note with some sadness though, and members of the House may be 
aware of the fact, that the government has defended section 43.

funded the Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law, 
the very group that brought this challenge into the Ontario 
superior court to declare section 43 in violation of the charter. 
It is a bit sad that tax dollars are used by the government to 
erode or undermine section 43 by way of the funding dollars given 
to such a group through the court challenges program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the remaining moments I want to talk about what the research 
says about the effects of physical discipline on children.  A 
number of studies have been done over the years.  Some studies 
have found negative outcomes while others have found positive 
ones.  I would like to describe why the conclusions have varied 
so much by referring to the work of Dr. Robert Larzelere of the 
University of Nebraska Medical Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 he published in the journal “Pediatrics” one of the 
most important resources we have for understanding the debate 
among current researchers.  He undertook a literary review of all 
the empirical studies published in scholarly journals over the 
last 30 years.  He studied 35 relevant articles on this topic and 
found conflicting results among them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reviewing the literature he discovered that the different 
results could largely be explained by the different methods and 
approaches used by the researchers.  His key finding was that 
studies which show that physical punishment had negative results 
did not distinguish abusive from non-abusive physical discipline. 
They sought families in which physical discipline was used but 
failed to inquire about the nature of the physical discipline. 
Some of these methodologically flawed studies then included 
family situations where unreasonably harsh or abusive measures of 
physical punishment were used.  On the other hand, studies which 
showed positive results from physical punishment or discipline, 
the word I would prefer to use, were the ones that excluded 
abusive family situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a breakdown of the results from those 35 studies done by 
Dr. Larzelere.  Only 11 of the 35 studies excluded abusive family 
situations.  Those are the ones within the parameters, the ones 
to consider.  The others in effect could be set aside because 
they had a methodologically flawed approach.  Six of these eleven 
studies showed beneficial outcomes, four showed neutral outcomes, 
and only one showed any negative outcome.  That suggests that 
when used properly by parents who truly love their children, 
mild, moderate physical correction when kids are young can have 
positive results and no negative results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These observations are relevant to the debate over section 43 of 
the criminal code.  Both sides in the debate agree that abusive 
physical punishment is harmful to children.  We should not allow 
it or tolerate it.  Where we disagree is on the effects of 
non-abusive physical punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The studies that saw negative results from physical correction, 
which included abusive family situations, have to be disregarded 
in the interest of fairness and in the interest of truth for the 
situation here if we want to learn about the outcomes of 
non-abusive physical discipline by loving parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can cite from my own family situation.  I have a son who is 21 
years old, a daughter who is 18 years old, a son who is 6 years 
old, and a little one who is five months old.  The six year old 
has had one little spank on the bottom in his some six years of 
life.  Considering his personality and so on, I suspect that he 
will not ever require more than a glance sideways or some other 
method of discipline.  However I do believe that the backup, the 
fact that he knew it happened once in the far distant past, is a 
good thing.  It is also helpful that we use all other alternative 
methods of discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we cannot confuse apples and oranges here by talking 
about clearly abusive family situations where there is all kinds 
of dysfunction and balanced and proper functioning family 
situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have actually been more recent studies since the 1996 
publication of Dr. Larzelere's article, but all those studies do 
not challenge the finding of his literary review that in 
non-abusive situations physical correction can in fact be 
positive and beneficial to the child.  The most recent study by 
Marjorie Gunnoe in <I>Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine</I>, August 
1997, provides important confirmation of those findings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I very humbly and straightforwardly seek unanimous 
consent of the House to have the motion before us deemed adopted 
and passed.

read this question to be sure that those who are listening 
understand why I am speaking in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, I said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—gasoline now costs 71.9 cents a litre in Bathurst, while diesel 
is at 79.4 cents a litre in Yarmouth, the highest level in ten 
years. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are discouraged and now truckers from Ontario, Quebec, 
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are protesting at the New 
Brunswick border against this drastic increase in the price of 
gasoline. Some of them even think they may have to hand over 
their trucks to the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the federal government finally 
act, or will it wait until the situation becomes a national 
crisis? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the answer of the Secretary of State for International 
Financial Institutions: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, it is true that the price of oil has actually 
doubled since last year. Taxes went up by only 1 cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the problem for people buying gasoline. The problem 
is not taxes, but the fact the price of oil has doubled. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never mentioned taxes in my question. What I asked was if the 
government intended to act. I asked the government to take 
action because, as we all know, it has responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the cost to truckers, not only those of New Brunswick 
but everywhere else in Canada, to drive their truck and work day 
after day. For instance, they had to go to the New Brunswick 
border. How many truckers in Quebec were forced to organize 
protests because of oil prices? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked why the federal government did not take action like, for 
instance, the Government of Prince Edward Island. 
The federal government is going to say that it is not its 
responsibility, that it is the provinces' responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question dealt with the fact that the federal government 
could have co-ordinated national meetings. It was unacceptable, 
in our country, to see how oil companies reacted when the price 
increased. On weekends, the price of gas was high, on weekdays, 
it was lower. It changed every day. In my book, that is almost 
like stealing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, speaking of taxes, I will give an example. In the Atlantic 
provinces, the government brought in the harmonized tax. Before 
that tax, people in New Brunswick did not pay tax on heating 
oil. After that tax was introduced, even the poorest people had 
to pay tax on heating oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government can work with the provinces and reach 
agreements to help people. It did not do that. In fact, it did 
the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer I got to my question was that it was just a one cent 
increase. In my question, I did not talk about taxes. But since 
we are on that subject, I will tell the government that it can 
do better than that, that it can remove the GST on heating oil, 
that it can help Canadians, that it can do something and also 
that it can join with the provinces in telling oil companies 
that this is unacceptable in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that I do not have more time. I just wanted to 
raise this issue and show how the government is out of touch 
with the people. Again, it missed a golden opportunity. But, 
what can one say, it is a Liberal government after all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want to point out that recent gas and diesel oil price 
increases in Canada are directly due to the fact that 
international crude oil prices have almost tripled since the end 
of 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the federal government does not control crude oil 
prices, under an agreement signed in 1995 with Alberta, British 
Columbia and Saskatchewan, it closely monitors the conditions and 
competition practices on the oil markets under the Competition 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase in oil prices is probably temporary. OPEP ministers 
will meet to discuss the possibility of increasing supply, which 
would reduce prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, I can assure hon. members that the Canadian 
government, as one of the 24 members of the International Energy 
Agency, will co-operate with its international partners to ensure 
stable international oil markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Canadians truckers, they will benefit from the tax relief

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canada 
must not in any way be party to nuclear arms buildups or to 
actions which may lead to a cold war environment.  Canada must 
loudly and proudly say no to the U.S. proposed national missile 
defence system.  On behalf of the federal NDP I urge the 
government to take a stand sooner rather than later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised the question of our participation in the system on 
March 16.  The Minister of National Defence stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot yet take a position.  There are too many unknowns. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not believe my ears.  Of course we can take a stand.  We 
should take a stand and we must take a stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is also fully aware that DND started work on a $637 
million project to provide Canada with a foothold in the arms 
buildup strategy of the U.S.  This expenditure involves putting 
military surveillance sensors in space.  The U.S. treats Canada 
like the 51st state and the Liberal government reacts like a 
whipped dog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. threw down its gauntlet in comments from U.S. deputy 
defence secretary in a speech to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce 
when he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at an important pivot point in our relationship with each 
other.  Unfortunately I think that pivot point is going to 
revolve around the issue of national missile defence.  Canada 
needs to take the lead. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an explicit threat from where I sit:  either do what the 
U.S. says or we will suffer.  I am shocked that the government 
did not respond to this thinly veiled threat.  The foreign 
affairs minister said on March 22: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unilateral efforts to build defences against these dangers are 
unlikely to provide lasting security, and might quite possibly 
increase insecurity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impulse to build walls should be resisted.  The answer 
instead lies in creating a multilateral approach to stop missile 
proliferation in the first place. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand we have the minister of defence meekly 
stating: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot yet take a position.  There are too many unknowns. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, however, it seems as if the big defence corporations and 
the U.S. brass have given our minister of defence marching 
orders.  More recently he is making statements which seem very 
much to suggest that NORAD is anything but a joint Canada-U.S. 
defence command and is in reality an easy way for the U.S. to 
tell us to heel and to roll over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious matter.  Canada's role in international 
affairs hangs in the balance.  I ask the Liberal government for 
an answer to my question.  Whose words rule the Liberal roost? Is 
it those of the defence minister or the foreign affairs minister? 
I ask the Prime Minister to make a public statement on Canada's 
opposition to the U.S. government's plans to crank up the arms 
race with this national missile system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence minister says there are too many unknowns.  Allow me 
to clarify the picture for him a little.  The defence minister of 
France, Alain Richard, has said the threat of ballistic missile 
attack is sometimes hyped or exaggerated.  Military affairs 
analyst John Clearwater said of the proposed system: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is money down the toilet...any rogue country shooting a 
missile at the U.S. knows it will be wiped out. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This insane missile plan will destabilize the current state of 
arms control.  Even the conservative <I>Globe and Mail</I> stated 
that Canada should deny U.S. support on this measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question the U.S. is consciously heading on a 
collision course with Russia, despite Russia's most recent 
positive efforts at ratifying the START II, the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  The NMD totally 
contradicts the 1972 ABM Treaty with Russia.  The U.S. would have 
to withdraw from or violate the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has the duty and the responsibility of playing a

<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the most fundamental point about 
the national missile defence program is that it is a U.S. 
program.  The United States has not yet decided to deploy it and 
the U.S. government has not officially invited Canada to 
participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Work has continued in the U.S. on ballistic missile defence 
since the start of the star wars program in the mid-eighties.  A 
national missile defence system, NMD, would be based on Earth and 
not in space although space sensors would be used to detect and 
track missile launches.  An NMD system would launch from the 
ground an unarmed projectile called a kill vehicle that would 
intercept an incoming missile and destroy it by the sheer force 
of impact.  As currently planned, NMD would counter an attack by 
a limited number of missiles and warheads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proponents of NMD in the U.S. argue that the emerging threat 
caused by the proliferation of missiles and weapons of mass 
destruction technology is a new factor, that the old bipolar 
world no longer exists and that U.S. security is being 
undermined.  A rogue state with an ICBM, an intercontinental 
ballistic missile, could limit American foreign policy options by 
blackmailing future American governments.  Its intelligence 
estimates indicate that states of concern could develop such a 
capability within the next five to 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 23, 1999 President Clinton signed the National Missile 
Defence Act which states that an NMD system will be deployed when 
technologically feasible.  The deployment decision has not yet 
been taken and might not be taken by this or even a succeeding 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he signed the National Missile Defence Act into law, 
President Clinton stressed that a final decision to deploy a NMD 
system would take place only after a deployment readiness review 
had been completed.  He also set out the following criteria that 
would govern a deployment decision: whether the threat is 
materializing; the status of the technology; whether the system 
is affordable; and national security considerations, including 
arms control and disarmament regimes, relations with Russia and 
the impact of the decision on allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The target date for this review is now July.  While a decision 
to deploy could be taken as early as August this year, it would 
be some years before any—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in March a panel on Canada's national parks released 
a landmark report which called for the re-establishment of 
ecological integrity as the guiding principle for parks 
management in the future.  Rightly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National parks were originally created out of a desire to 
preserve some of our natural beauty for people to enjoy.  In fact 
it was in 1885 when Canada established one of the first national 
parks in the world, Rocky Mountain National Park or Banff as we 
call it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vision and the commitment of countless Canadians to preserve 
some small part of our natural heritage is best put to words 
appropriately enough by the authors of the first National Parks 
Act which was passed by the House of Commons in 1930: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks are hereby dedicated to the people of Canada for their 
benefit, education, and enjoyment....Such parks shall be 
maintained and made use of so as to leave them unimpaired for the 
enjoyment of future generations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, this vision has become clouded.  The value of our parks 
and their natural heritage has been reduced to a matter of 
dollars and cents by the government in particular.  Our parks 
have suffered as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drive to generate revenue from park services puts an 
emphasis on the development of things like golf courses, hotels 
and even movie sets.  At the same time services like park guides, 
wardens and the upkeep of camping facilities have been cut to the 
bone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to use the example of Prince Albert National Park.  In 
Prince Albert National Park the Narrows campground is a popular 
spot where many people take their families to camp each summer. 
Liberal government cuts have diverted resources away from the 
campground to the point where it is now in a shambles.  The park 
has struggled to keep up the campground but last winter people 
were told that this summer they might have no modern toilets or 
fresh water.

this report as an excuse to delay reinvestment in services.

should have their funding restored and restored right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expert panel's report acknowledges that the concept of human 
use and enjoyment is fundamentally linked with national parks, 
but this human use and enjoyment is under attack. As I have 
mentioned it is under attack in the Narrows campground where 
people are not going to get even the basic services which they 
really deserve and have used for years.  This is not an attack on 
the integrity of the park.  This use has coexisted with the 
integrity of the park for many years.  Why should people who are 
prepared to make responsible use of the park have to wait for 
basic maintenance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has not issued an edict to stop the use of 
pesticides on golf greens or hotel lawns within the borders of 
the parks, nor should she allow Liberal cutbacks and neglect to 
shut down simple campground services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders what the minister might be waiting for.  I certainly 
hope it is not another federal election and more red book 
promises to provide funding required to begin the process of 
preserving our parks for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsible use without abuse and experience in the parks are 
goals we all share.  Ecological integrity must be our long term 
goal and it must come before profit, before greed and before 
politics.

Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, basically, we agree with 
a great deal of what the hon. member has just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has introduced Bill C-27, the purpose of which is 
to establish ecological integrity as a basic and priority 
principle, and to proclaim loud and clear that this is a basic 
principle we consider of the utmost importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members of all parties opposite will support this very 
important bill now before the House, because it shows that the 
government is committed to implementing the report of the panel 
on ecological integrity and to create eight new parks. This is 
in contradiction with some of the remarks of the hon. member 
opposite, to the effect that the government does not intend to 
keep its word and complete the national parks network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope hon. members will support this bill, as the NDP critic 
seemed to indicate, because it meets the legitimate aspirations 
of Canadians, who want to preserve our national parks for future 
generations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to once 
again rise in the House to discuss a very serious matter on the 
Atlantic coast with regard to the fishing industry and the recent 
case of R. v. Marshall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans a couple of weeks 
ago basically what the government was doing to ensure common 
peace in our waters as the May 1 lobster season opens in Atlantic 
Canada.  The minister said that the government is looking at all 
avenues and almost half out of 34 bands in the area have reached 
either agreements or agreements in principle after the Marshall 
decision and that was a positive sign in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question which still needs to be asked is what about the 
other half of the other bands which have not yet come to an 
agreement?  It has caused discord between the non-aboriginal 
communities and the aboriginal communities throughout Atlantic 
Canada on exactly who is fishing what, when, where, how and who 
is actually mandated to regulate the industry to ensure that 
precautionary principles and conservation principles apply in 
each and every single term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great respect for the hon. member for Labrador, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
I would ask him in his rebuttal to this query to put the 
bureaucratic notes down that he received from the DFO office and 
speak to the House as the member for Labrador, which I know he is 
very good and capable of doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that in the end he stands up for the fishing communities 
of his riding. That is why he has been elected and why there is a 
good chance he will be re-elected.  However, I can assure him if 
he continues to speak from bureaucratic notes from a department 
that has destroyed the stocks throughout Atlantic Canada and 
western Canada, his prospects of being re-elected will get 
slimmer every time.  That is my bit of election 101 advice for 
the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is what the communities need to know and what the five 
provinces and even Nunavut need to know is does the government 
have a long term strategy in place to integrate the aboriginal 
communities on a long term basis?  Right now the agreements are 
short term only.  Negotiations will be ongoing in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that elections happen.  Ministers go through the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans like it has a revolving door. 
Who is to say that certain strategies may not change as we go 
along?  This uncertainty is scaring a lot of fishermen, 
especially a lot of independent fishermen in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lobster fishery is the last independent fishery in Atlantic 
Canada.  The groundfish stocks are gone or have been 
corporatized.  The crab stocks are more or less into area 
management zones now.  The larger crab dealers in the Gaspé for 
example have control of the crabs.  Lobsters are the last 
independent resource for an independent living for lobster 
fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government have a long term plan to protect the 
resource and the livelihood of all fishermen in Atlantic Canada?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed 
quite gratifying to hear the comments from my colleague and great 
friend.  I salute his mom once again for a great breakfast in 
Richmond, B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say this much to the hon. member.  While I did come fully 
prepared to speak with notes today, I will make him a promise 
that the next time I make an adjournment debate speech, I will 
speak without prepared notes.  That is a fact.  I will make my 
points and I will make them the way he did which was in a most 
compelling way.  However, I have the pleasure right now to speak 
from notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to speak about the progress that has been made 
to accommodate aboriginal peoples in Atlantic Canada pursuant to 
the Supreme Court of Canada's Marshall decision of November 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditions are coming into place for a successful, orderly 
and regulated fishery in the maritimes and Quebec.  We have now 
made interim fishing agreements or agreements in principle with 
over half of the aboriginal communities.  We expect that most of 
these will be in place by June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened to the voices of the fishing industry who asked that 
a voluntary licence retirement program be used to make room for 
aboriginal fishers in the commercial fishery.  We initiated such 
a program over three months ago and have received some 1,400 
applications and have acquired over 350 licences so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach is working well and we are matching supply and 
demand.  The overall number of aboriginal entrants remains low 
relative to the total of 23,000 vessels and 44,000 fishermen—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it has been four months since Canadians first learned 
that the Liberal government bungled $1 billion of their tax 
dollars.  That is a disturbing thought for the millions of 
hardworking Canadians who just filed their tax returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then there has not been a single resignation, there has 
not been a cabinet shuffle, and there has not even been an 
admission of guilt.  Instead Canadians have been subjected to a 
steady stream of arrogant abuse from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister tells us he is only doing a good job as an 
MP, despite numerous RCMP investigations into HRDC grants in his 
riding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have discovered that one Liberal member after another 
benefited from well timed government grants.  In a glaring 
conflict of interest the HRDC minister approved three grants 
totalling over $700,000 in her own riding which went against the 
rules of the transitional jobs fund.  Even more shocking was the 
news that she had approved an additional $840,000 in grants the 
day after her officials told her about the bungled funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every week new details surface about more improprieties in how 
the HRDC grant money was doled out.  Just this week we heard how 
the Deputy Prime Minister took advantage of Canadian taxpayers by 
directing $1.6 million into his riding and skirting the rules by 
spending only a paltry 20% of the funds on wages for employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government fails to understand that the money it so 
callously threw around is not its money.  It enrages Canadians 
when they realize that the government has yet to understand this 
concept, continuing to bungle billions of tax dollars on 
boondoggle spending while hardworking Canadians suffer because of 
deteriorating health care systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of treating this health care emergency the Liberals 
patted themselves on the back, increasing the 2000 budget for 
federal grants and contributions by a further $1.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes that Canadians would rather see 
money spent on improving the quality of health care than see it 
lining the pockets of the Prime Minister's friends.  We believe 
that this funding is better spent upgrading the quality of health 
care.  We are deeply concerned about the future of our health 
care system.  No one wants to see people suffer when they fall 
ill.  No one wants an American style health care system in 
Canada.  We believe that health care should not be based on 
financial status and that all Canadians should have timely access 
to essential health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we form government we will provide greater freedom of 
choice when it comes to ensuring well-being and access to medical 
care and medical facilities.  We believe that the needs of 
patients must come first in the delivery of health services.  We 
will work together with the provinces so that they have the 
resources and flexibility to find more effective approaches to 
the financing, management and delivery of health care, thereby 
ensuring that patient choice and quality of care are maximized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the government to go.  It becomes clearer every 
day that the government is incapable of offering solutions to 
these problems.  It has become detached from the concerns of 
Canadians and cares only about feeding its own inflated ego. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can be assured that the Canadian Alliance is ready and 
willing to tackle the ongoing problems of high taxes and 
substandard health care.  We can no longer afford to become 
complaisant as our country falls to pieces under the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much longer will long suffering, overtaxed Canadians have to 
put up with this Liberal arrogance instead of getting reasonable 
value for their tax dollars? 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when the 
hon. member first asked his question in the House he referred to 
a specific grant.  At that time the minister invited him to 
provide us with the details of the story he was telling.  She 
promised to look into the matter and provide him with an adequate 
response.  However he did not bring it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not surprised because he is continuing on with the style 
of the party he represents.  That involves presenting incomplete 
information and leaving innuendoes, giving Canadians the 
impression of wrongdoing on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that is consistent is that members of that party never 
have any proof.  When invited to bring forward information in 
order that an investigation can be launched, they never bring 
their information forward.  This suggests to me that they want 
their accusations and their innuendoes to hang in the air, 
poisoning the trust of Canadians in their government, eroding the 
traditional bond of trust that has existed between Canadians and 
their government and is the basis of civilized behaviour in this 
country.  This is irresponsible.  If taken to the extreme, if 
Canadians believed these innuendoes, it could lead to social 
chaos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would they be doing this?  The reason is that they want 
Canadians not to have faith in sending their tax dollars to 
Ottawa.  Why is that?  It is because their rich friends want 
their taxes reduced.  They want the government to have less money 
to provide the kinds of programs that HRDC provides so well to 
Canadians who do not have so much, Canadians who do not have 
jobs, Canadians with disabilities, unemployed Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need tax dollars to provide those programs to give all 
Canadians the dignity of work and the dignity of a life that is 
as comfortable as most other Canadians have.
