	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to table the Main Estimates of the Government of 
Canada for the 1997-1998 fiscal year.
<P>
	In 1993, the Red Book stated: ``We will exercise unwavering 
discipline in controlling federal spending and will reorder current 
spending priorities to make sure that maximum return is obtained 
on each investment''.
<P>
	These estimates mark the turning point: the point where we 
regain control over government spending. The point where we 
deliver public services adapted to today's reality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As we promised in 1993, we are working to put the country's 
financial house in order. The main estimates I am tabling today 
contain expenditures that are closer to our means.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are fully committed. We have worked hard and we are on the 
verge of achieving our objectives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8350"> 8350 </A></B>
<P>
	In the span of four years, we have significantly reduced the 
deficit, we have built a more efficient public service. We are 
working to deliver quality services to all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	For example, this year, Revenue Canada will process several 
million tax returns, and it will do so in less than 10 days.
<P>
	Environment Canada has rationalized its approach. The number 
of weather offices was reduced from 71 local offices to 17 regional 
offices. This was made possible by better use of modern equipment 
and technology. Weather information and services provided to 
Canadians will be improved.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By the end of the current fiscal year, the percentage of the gross 
domestic product allocated to federal programs as a whole will be 
the lowest it has been in almost 50 years. Government program 
spending will account for only 11.9 per cent of the gross domestic 
product in 1998-99 as opposed to 16.8 per cent in 1993-94.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since it assumed responsibility, this government has reduced the 
federal government's expenditures from $120 billion to $106 
billion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As we promised, we have changed the way in which we govern 
even as we continue to put public finances in order. We took up the 
fight and we will win the battle to provide our citizens with quality 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The people of Canada elected us because they had confidence in 
us and believed, with just cause, that we could succeed. Our 
expenditure plan will live up to their expectations, but we still have 
a long way to go to transform government. This year we can 
achieve our financial goals without announcing any new 
reductions.
<P>
	I left the public service and decided to enter the political arena in 
order to protect the financial future of our country. I was already 
dreaming of the day when I would be part of the birth of a new 
culture of public financial management.
<P>
	In December 1993, I said: ``Over time, governments collectively 
have promised more than they could deliver- and delivered more 
than they can afford''. Today marks a turning point in the history of 
the administration of public finance in Canada. We have examined 
our financial situation, made firm decisions, and taken action to 
achieve our objectives. We have governed strongly and wisely.
<P>
	But make no mistake: the battle has not yet been won. To relent 
would be to stray from the path that we have set. We are readying 
ourselves to enter the 21st century on sound and solid footing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In February 1994 I told hon. members that we had to undertake 
an in depth review of the roles and responsibilities of the federal 
administration so that we could give the country a government 
equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
<P>
	Program review has been the cornerstone of our strategy. Thanks 
to this unprecedented exercise, we have been able to achieve our 
deficit reduction targets, to improve the delivery of services to 
Canadians and to clarify the role of the federal government in a 
number of areas.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have reformed the system of expenditure management. We 
have inaugurated an ongoing program review, and soon will be in a 
position to provide public services within our financial limitations. 
We have created a stable long term planning framework for the 
departments.
<P>
	The program review has, among other things, led us to the 
conclusion that, at the close of the 20th century, the state did not 
need to be the owner of railways, airports, or even the St. Lawrence 
Seaway in order to serve the taxpayers' interests. It enabled us to 
more clearly define the areas in which the government can best be 
involved in co-ordinating the actions of all citizens.
<P>
	The main focus of public administration must still be the pursuit 
of program excellence and quality, in keeping with our means and 
with the needs of all of our fellow citizens.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	Our mission has been developed without ever losing sight of the 
goal of enhancing the measurement of outcomes and of 
accountability. We are still faced with the challenge of maintaining 
a culture of state administration which supports constant 
improvement.
<P>
	To that end, we have put in place a number of initiatives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In partnership with industry we have eliminated half of the 
administrative irritants identified by small businesses. By next 
September, Veterans Affairs Canada for instance will have cut the 
time it takes to process an initial disability claim in half. All of this 
has been done while in fact spending less than we had predicted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8351"> 8351 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While reducing costs and providing quality services to 
Canadians, we are preparing partnerships with the provinces, the 
private sector and the NGOs.
<P>
	The Canada infrastructure program is one example of a 
successful partnership.
<P>
	Another is the transfer by Transport Canada last November of its 
civil air navigation services to a private sector not-for-profit 
agency, which today employs 6,000 former public servants.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Not only must program delivery reflect today's reality but most 
important, it must meet the needs of Canadians. Soon Canadians 
will be using more of the new information technologies to deal 
with government. This is a more economical, more efficient 
approach that will be accessible to Canadians at any place and at 
any time. The government would like to develop cost recovery 
more fully; however, we will move forward cautiously to avoid 
obstacles that might unduly inhibit the competitiveness of 
companies or the access of Canadians to services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This tool will lead to a change of attitude in both public servants 
and those who pay user fees. Departments will have to better tailor 
their services to users' needs.
<P>
	Thanks to the determined support of the public servants who 
have been behind our undertaking for the past four years, we have 
made considerable progress. Thanks to their innovative nature, 
these public servants have proven their ability to adapt rapidly to 
change, while keeping firmly in sight the objective of the pursuit of 
excellence and the delivery of quality services.
<P>
	Canada has an administrative system that is the envy of the rest 
of the world. Yet we cannot rest on our laurels. The constantly and 
rapidly evolving world economy demands greater efficiency and 
greater rationalization of our operations.
<P>
	Our public administration had become too unwieldy over the 
years. The governmental machine had multiplied its areas of 
intervention, and had built cumbersome and costly structures. After 
reviewing the functions of the state, we were forced to reduce its 
size.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	However, we are treating our employees with civility and respect 
as we move through the public service reduction process. 
Accordingly, we established the early departure incentive program, 
called the EDI, and the early retirement incentive program, or ERI, 
both of which offset a number of the consequences of staff 
reductions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The number of federal public servants has gone from 225,000 
down to 195,000 between April 1995 and December 1996.
<P>
	We all want a modern and dynamic public service. We also want 
a quality public service. We cannot afford to be left behind, nor to 
let events overtake us. Accordingly, we have introduced a series of 
measures and strategies to address this issue. The program known 
as ``La Relève'' is the catalyst for building a modern and dynamic 
public service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The return to collective bargaining is another important step for 
the government. I look forward to successful negotiations with the 
unions. We are expecting a great deal from these negotiations. We 
are looking for financial accountability. We are looking to establish 
the concept of total compensation and we are looking at 
transforming the public service.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada deserved a new way of managing public affairs. We have 
a vision of the future that is shaped by the need to move forward 
with pride.
<P>
	I do not need surveys to know that Canadians are happy that their 
financial independence is within reach and that they will soon be 
free once again to choose the type of society they want.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our vision held true as we improved results, assessment, 
transparency and accountability. These changes mean that we can 
establish a new public service culture in the best interests of all 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We still have much to do, but I am proud of what we have 
already accomplished.
<P>
	The House will recall that last March we introduced, on a pilot 
basis, a new format for six of the Part IIIs of the Estimates.
<P>
	In October, I also tabled performance reports for 16 departments 
and agencies. These reports provided the House with more detailed 
information on the results achieved. And they brought this 
information to members six months earlier than if we had waited 
for the tabling of the traditional Part III. These documents were 
well received and appreciated. They reflect our efforts to improve 
the information we present to Parliament. We have therefore 
decided to continue with the initiative this year.
<P>
	The 16 departments and agencies have prepared outlook 
documents, entitled ``Plans and Priorities&quot;, which I am tabling as 
their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8352"> 8352 </A></B>
<P>
Part IIIs. They are the outcome of  discussions with members of the 
House and the auditor general.
<P>
	I would like to thank all of them for their valuable contribution, 
especially the member for St. Boniface and the members of his 
working group.
<P>
	As further good news for Canadians, I am also making public 
today another document: ``Getting Government Right-Governing 
for Canadians''.
<P>
	This document-which is close to my heart-is a report on the 
current status of government reform, as well as a description of the 
action we will be taking to achieve our goals.
<P>
	We promised to create quality government. Canadians can be 
proud of their government. We have kept our promises. We are 
back on the right path-the path to cost-effectiveness and to 
quality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
minister said a few minutes ago, in 1997-98, the federal 
government will budget nearly $106 billion for program spending, 
2.9 per cent less than in the current fiscal year.
<P>
	In his speech, the President of the Treasury Board seems to be 
looking at the world through rose coloured glasses, and what he 
says is far removed from the experience of thousands of public 
servants who have been laid off or whose professional future is 
uncertain.
<P>
	Take, for instance, the situation at the cheque printing centres, 
where employees, non-unionized and in a vulnerable position, were 
given the choice of accepting a 40 per cent drop in salary or staying 
home, when their service was privatized.
<P>
	The minister's self-congratulatory tone is hardly appropriate, 
considering the unemployed who are getting poorer because their 
benefits were cut as a result of unemployment insurance reform, 
while today, the Minister of Finance is using the UI fund surplus to 
reduce his deficit artificially.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	The minister tells us, and I quote: ``We are working to put the 
country's financial house in order''. How can the minister say that 
when we know that 50 per cent of spending cuts represent cuts in 
transfer payments to the provinces? Similarly, putting the country's 
financial house in order explains only 21 per cent of spending cuts, 
in other words, $1 out of every $5 committed by the government.
<P>
	The minister went on to say, and again I quote: ``In the span of 
four years, we have significantly reduced the deficit''. What the 
minister should have said in the House this morning is that, in 
addition to the provinces, the unemployed have also significantly 
reduced the deficit, when we realize that the other major weapon in 
the battle against the deficit is the unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	The minister also said: ``This year, we can achieve our financial 
goals without announcing any new reductions''. However, as a 
result of cuts in transfer payments, the provinces will have to cut 
funding themselves and do the minister's dirty work.
<P>
	Of this $14 billion in spending cuts, only $3 billion is directly 
the result of spending cuts within the federal government. Does the 
absence of new reductions mean the end of federal house cleaning 
before the election?
<P>
	Making the provinces pay and thus take the blame for spending 
cuts in health care, education and social services and making the 
unemployed pay as well, is that the beginning of a new culture in 
public financial administration the minister has been bragging 
about?
<P>
	The minister also said the government was treating its 
employees with civility and respect as it moved through the public 
service reduction process. Where is the civility and respect in 
refusing, as the minister himself did, to invest the $18 million 
required to align the federal employee drug plan with the plan 
under which all Quebecers will be covered once the Rochon plan is 
in place?
<P>
	In Quebec, maximum insurance coverage is $760 per year. This 
means that federal employees who suffer from a serious medical 
condition will have to pay 20 per cent of their drug costs however 
high they may be, which could amount to thousands of dollars 
every year.
<P>
	In response to a question on this particular situation, the minister 
told this House only 2 per cent of federal employees living in 
Quebec may be affected. If so few of them are affected, why not put 
them on an equal footing with the other 98 per cent, those who are 
blessed with better health?
<P>
	The minister added that, between April 1995 and the end of 
December 1996, the federal public service shrank from 225,000 to 
195,000 employees. We will have to check how much 
contracting-out the government did during the same period, 
especially now on the eve of a federal election.
<P>
	This old Liberal habit of spending money they have not earned 
yet is obvious here. Where is this financial independence the 
minister is referring to when he tells us, as he did a moment ago, 
that he does not need polls to tell him that Canadians are pleased 
with regaining their financial independence, when the accumulated 
debt is $600 billion? The only good news is that the debt collector 
is no longer knocking at Canada's door? Thanks to the contribution 
of the unemployed and the provinces, the threat of bankruptcy and 
insolvency is not as imminent as it was four years ago.
<P>
	Go ask the unemployed, those who despaired of ever finding 
work and dropped out of the labour market altogether, and the 
provincial finance ministers. Where is the financial independence 
the minister is boasting about this morning?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8353"> 8353 </A></B>
<P>
	Here is an example of this old Liberal habit-one might even 
call it an atavistic trait-to spend other people's money.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	At page 2-14, Part III, of the 1997-98 Estimates, we read the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government is considering obtaining four UPHOLDER class submarines 
from the Royal Navy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I hope Canada is no longer buying the old tubs that the British 
Navy wanted to get rid of a few years ago. It goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Delays in approving this project resulted in expenditures which were paid through 
the operating budget, to support an additional program to overhaul OBERON class 
submarines.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is also $8.6 million to buy a patrol frigate by March 1997; 
$61.3 million to buy sophisticated air-to-surface missiles. 
However, as regards spinoffs for the Canadian industry, the defence 
department document says: ``Since the weapons, pods, testing 
material and spare parts will be bought through the American 
government, the Canadian industry will not be directly involved in 
the contracts''.
<P>
	In other words, this document, the Estimates, is drafted in 
Canada, but benefits the American industry.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the minister is proud of these results.
<P>
	Granted, the minister is an intelligent person. However, he does 
not live in the same world as we do, he does not live in the same 
world as Canadians do. That is the tragedy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to respond to the President of the Treasury Board's tabling 
of the estimates this morning. I think that we have to point out that 
not everything is as clear as he would like us to believe. I refer to 
his speech in which he said ``we will exercise unwaivering 
discipline in controlling federal spending''. That is a wonderful 
statement.
<P>
	When I looked at the <I>Globe and Mail</I> last week I happened to see 
an article that said ``next week's government spending estimates 
will prove the ad hoc and very political nature of the heritage 
minister's eleventh hour $10 million gift for CBC because the 
money won't be there''. Guess what, I checked the estimates and 
the money is not there. There is a little column for last minute 
add-ons for the political changes made by cabinet and sure enough 
we find that the heritage minister at the very last minute, after the 
estimates were printed, was able to squeak in another $10 for her 
little favourite programs. So much for the unwaivering discipline 
in controlling federal spending. Obviously it is completely and 
totally subject to the whims of the people who have power around 
here. Therefore we have to take a look at  the political nature of the 
rest of the documents to see what else we have found.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board goes on to talk about the 
fact that the percentage of program spending is going to be the 
lowest in GDP for almost 50 years, but again he completely fails to 
tell us about how much money in addition to program spending we 
are paying in interest. Canadians have to take out $45 billion to $50 
billion a year of their pockets to pay for interest for the past 
mistakes of this government and the previous government. The 
Tories and the Liberals combined for the last 25 years have been 
spending with abandon. Now Canadians have to come up with $50 
billion a year or the better part thereof just to pay for these 
mistakes. They were not their mistakes, they were the 
government's mistakes but guess who gets to pay. And that is the 
shame of these estimates.
<P>
	What else did we find in the president's speech: ``Over the last 
few years the federal public service has grown too large and 
therefore we have to make it smaller''. A wonderful statement but 
what do find? Let us take Nav Canada. Again in his speech he 
referred to the fact that he has transferred 6,000 former federal 
employees into this hybrid crown corporation, not for profit 
organization, hid from the auditor general organization; 6,000 
federal employees and he claims he is reducing the public service.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Not one person lost their job. It was a transfer from one 
department into a not for profit agency. Nothing changed. Yet he 
would have us believe that he is downsizing the federal civil 
service, that we are getting more efficient and that we can manage 
our money better. Wrong. Completely wrong.
<P>
	We saw the Minister of Finance stand up in this House and heard 
him boast about his accomplishments, how he has brought down 
spending, how he has brought it under control and how we are 
finally getting the federal government's fiscal house in order.
<P>
	When we look at it, we find that the federal government is 
getting its house in order again at the expense of somebody else. 
Remember how I said that the taxpayers have to pay for the 
government's mistakes. We are also finding that provincial 
governments are now paying for the federal government's saying it 
is getting the job done. The health and social transfer to the 
provinces is how it is doing it.
<P>
	Last year the federal government transferred to the provinces 
$14.9 billion for health, education and social services tax. This year 
it is only going to spend $12.5 billion. That is a reduction of $2.5 
billion right there that did not reduce the size of the federal 
government one inch.
<P>
	It did not reduce the number of civil servants by one. It was a 
case of passing the buck to the provinces and  saying ``you will do 
with less in order for us to balance our budget''. Is that responsible 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8354"> 8354 </A></B>
<P>
government? Is that the way we want to manage our federal 
government, by passing the buck to the provinces with $2.5 billion 
less while Canadians are saying ``what about my health care, it has 
fallen to pieces''? Does it care?
<P>
	It cares about the Minister of Finance's being able to stand up 
and boast about his accomplishments. We read in the paper and I 
see in Edmonton, where I come from, that people have been denied 
emergency services, that people have died because they have had to 
transfer from one hospital to another in an emergency. They died in 
the process because there was not a bed available for them.
<P>
	This government is cutting $2.5 billion in cash from health and 
education. It says it is a good job. The other day the Minister of 
Finance stood up and said ``Boy, am I good. I am going to throw 
another couple or three hundred million dollars back into health 
care. Is that not good news?''
<P>
	Compare that to the cut of $2.5 billion from health care in one 
year. That is terrible news. Canadians ought to know what is really 
going on when it comes to this government's management of health 
care for Canadians. Abysmal. Downright abysmal.
<P>
	We have also heard the Minister of Finance tell us about how 
interest rates have come down and how he is saving all kinds of 
money. Let us recognize that interest rates are down right around 
the world. They are down in Japan. There are practically non 
existent there. They are down in the United States. They are down 
in the United Kingdom. They are down all through Europe.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister is taking credit for all that, too. The 
reality is he just happened to catch the benefit of a wave that was 
going around the world. Let us remember that interest rates came 
down not because the Minister of Finance caused it. He just 
happened to get the benefit of it.
<P>
	This year we are going to see a reduction, finally, in the cost of 
our debt. It is going to drop by $1.8 billion, the prediction is, down 
to $46 billion. Let us remember that it was not the management of 
this government and it was not the management of this Minister of 
Finance that caused it.
<P>
	Thankfully Canadians who have mortgages and loans with taxes 
to pay are getting the benefit of it. Again there are the seniors who 
would rely on their investment to give a little enhancement to their 
quality of life on top of the pittance this government gives them. 
What happened to their incomes?
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	I did not hear the Minister of Finance say seniors are going to be 
better off because interest rates are coming down. While he was 
boasting that someone with a big mortgage would save $500 a 
month, he did not say that the senior who has a $100,000 
investment is going to lose $500 a month. I did not hear him say 
that, but that is what happened.
<P>
	My hon. colleague is going to be retiring after the election. He is 
going to have to suffer because his investments are going to bring 
him less money. Does the Minister of Finance care? Perhaps not.
<P>
	The point is there are hundreds of thousands of Canadians across 
this land who are being squeezed by the reduction in interest rates, 
squeezed by taxes going up, squeezed because health care is not 
there for them, all because the Minister of Finance says ``boy, am I 
doing a great job''. Canadians know he is not doing a great job. 
They know that their jobs are potentially in jeopardy. One in four 
Canadians is concerned about a job. There are 1.5 million 
unemployed who are looking for a job, and high taxes are 
destroying these opportunities.
<P>
	University graduates are asking how to get a job. The Minister of 
Finance is saying they will have an extra six months to before they 
have to start to repay their student loans. Let me assure the House 
that each and every one of them would rather have a job 
opportunity than an opportunity to defer the payment of a student 
loan. But these are the types of things that are going on that we do 
not hear about. We did not hear it in the government's tabling of the 
estimates.
<P>
	I refer to the people in power seeming to be able to get what they 
want. In a stack of documents I have here there is a little interest in 
what is going on in the department of heritage. If I remember the 
numbers clearly, while the Minister of Finance says: ``I am 
squeezing everybody, everybody is having to do with less'', does 
anybody get more? Yes, the Deputy Prime Minister and the 
minister of heritage gets more. I think she gets about $90 million 
more, an 8.4 per cent increase in her budget.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Her Canada pension payments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Not her Canada pension payments, it is for the 
little programs she wants, the CBC, $10 million; flags for 
everybody, another few million dollars; the information office, $20 
million. She gets what she wants and everybody else has to do with 
less.
<P>
	She is on the left side of the party and she thinks government 
exists to spend money, government exists to manage the economy 
and manage people's money properly. She does not even know 
what that means. That is why these estimates fall in hard behind the 
budget. It tells us that Canadians are being duped by the 
government.
<P>
	The other thing I want to point out is the smoke and mirrors. The 
Minister of Finance said that program spending is coming down 
and we are finally getting a handle on this. But let us take a look at 
the numbers. CRTC's budget in the main estimates is down by $18  
million, from $22 million to $3 million. Wow, what is going on 
here? I checked into it and I found that the revenues that were 
collected have been netted against the expenditures for the depart-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8355"> 8355 </A></B>
<P>
ment. Therefore rather than showing the $22 million which is 
normally spent, the revenues have now been netted out and they are 
down to $3 million. But it is still going to spend $22 million.
<P>
	So what has changed other than the numbers on the piece of 
paper? The facts are that the way the numbers are presented would 
lead one to believe that major progress is being made. But when we 
ask the questions behind it, we find that is not the case. That is the 
story of the government. That is the story everywhere.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	It does not matter if the department of heritage states at the last 
minute that it wants another $10 million out of taxpayers to get 
their favourite programs on TV. It does not matter if it is the 
President of the Treasury Board who stands and says that civil 
servant numbers are coming down. He is just moving them off the 
balance sheet. It does not matter if the Minister of Finance stands 
up and says that interest rates are coming down because of his great 
management. That is also wrong.
<P>
	I could go on and on. The point is that the election is coming up 
and Canadians will have a real choice between the fiscal 
responsibility and management by the Reform Party and the fiscal 
irresponsibility by this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I am wondering if I 
might have unanimous consent to reply on behalf of the New 
Democratic Party to the tabling of the estimates.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I hear nos.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order.
<P>
	I was wondering if the estimates that have just been tabled are in 
order considering a motion that was passed by this House 
approximately one year ago. This motion gave direction to this 
House as well as to components of the legislative branches of 
government.
<P>
	Today in raising this matter, I think it is the first time that the 
motion could be put in its context and be applied to the business of 
the House and in this case, the business of supply.
<P>
	To remind us, back on December 11, 1995, we passed a motion 
in this House of Commons that reads in part as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the people of Quebec have expressed the desire for recognition of 
Quebec's distinct society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) the House recognize that Quebec's distinct society includes its 
French-speaking majority, unique culture and civil law tradition;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) the House undertake to be guided by this reality;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, that is the part of the resolution which I want you to 
take under consideration, ``that the House undertake to be guided 
by this reality''.
<P>
	The fourth part reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) the House encourage all components of the legislative and executive branches 
of government to take note of this recognition and be guided in their conduct 
accordingly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, that is the item I am raising in this point of order, as 
to whether this motion has been considered in the process of 
determining the presentation of supply to the House. Mr. Speaker, I 
refer you to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 553:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every question when agreed to assumes the form either of an order or a resolution 
of the House. By its orders the House directs its committees, its Members, its officers, 
the order of its own proceedings and the acts of all persons they concern;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask if you considered what the 
motion's procedural significance had on the receivability of the 
supply here today and would have on other bills, motions, 
amendments, questions and other proceedings that are going to be 
placed before the House. If you read the motion that was passed by 
this House as I did, the government and this House must take the 
reality that Quebec is a distinct society into consideration in all that 
they do.
<P>
	On page 16972 of <I>Hansard</I>, the Prime Minister tried to clarify 
the motion when he said to us in this assembly:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Once it is passed, this resolution will have an impact on how legislation is passed 
in the House of Commons. I remind Canadians that the legislative branch will be 
bound by this resolution, as will be the executive branch.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Today the minister is a representative of the executive branch.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is a real, dynamic recognition, recorded in the very heart of our country's 
government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	Considering that the distinct society motion has been in effect 
for over a year, those so ordered by this House have had sufficient 
time to take the reality that Quebec is a distinct society into 
consideration when planning budgets and drafting bills, including 
any change as to how the proceedings of this House conform to that 
order.
<P>
	It is our responsibility at this time to ask those so ordered by this 
House how they have considered the motion. You, Mr. Speaker, by 
virtue of this motion have been ordered to do so. The minister who 
just tabled the estimates has been so ordered. While under those 
orders did he confer upon Quebec any rights, any privileges or 
benefits not conferred upon the other provinces of Canada? That is 
a very key question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8356"> 8356 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, many Canadians agree that Quebec is a distinct 
society. However, they are concerned with the impact it would 
have on them if it were entrenched in the Constitution. They are 
also concerned with having this reality, as the Prime Minister 
described it, recorded-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order, please. I have 
listened very patiently to the hon. member in spite of some 
concerns that others may be having and I fail to see any tie-in 
between the point of order that he has raised and the form of the 
estimates. I fail to understand why it would be that the estimates, 
which appear to be in the normal form for estimates as required by 
the rules and orders of this House and by our longstanding practice, 
should take on a different form based on the point which the hon. 
member has raised.
<P>
	Accordingly, having heard nothing that would convince me there 
is anything irregular whatever in the form of these estimates, I can 
only say that I believe the hon. member's point of order is not well 
taken. I think we should proceed with the business of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think your decision is in fact 
justified, and this is proof that the distinct society resolution meant 
absolutely nothing because, as you see, in something as important 
as the budget, it has no application.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I would ask the hon. 
member to be circumspect and not to put words in the Speaker's 
mouth. I merely indicated that the hon. member for Lethbridge was 
out of order in questioning the Estimates tabled by the minister and 
recommended by His Excellency in the House today and the 
resolution we passed. That is all that I said.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I do not want the hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois to draw 
any other inference from what the Chair said as he is trying to do at 
this time.
<P>
	I would suggest we move on to the regular business of the 
House. I do not believe that a point of order has been raised.
<P>
	I will hear the hon. member for Lethbridge briefly, but I have 
listened very patiently and I think he has had a fair hearing on this 
matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time 
which you have allotted to me because the matter is of very great 
significance.
<P>
	I would ask for a clarification on your ruling. I am not 
questioning your ruling but in terms of clarification, with respect to 
the motion which was passed on December 11, 1995, are you 
saying that the House or a member of the executive council does 
not have to consider that motion as ordered by the House as it 
relates to a piece of legislation or the estimates of today or any 
other matter? Is that what I interpreted-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> No. I simply said that the 
hon. member had failed to show that there was anything in the 
estimates which was not in compliance with the motion. I 
respectfully suggest that was his point. Having failed to prove it on 
any cogent argument, in my view the point of order is not well 
taken and I so rule.
<P>
	I am prepared to move on with the business of the House at this 
point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague from Lethbridge 
specifically referred to the motion passed in the House on 
December 11, 1995 and the fact that this House will take these 
things into consideration.
<P>
	The estimates which were tabled this morning by the President 
of the Treasury Board contained no reference whatsoever that this 
motion has been addressed in the preparation of these documents. 
Therefore, I ask that the-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. I have already 
ruled on this point. I think the hon. member is re-arguing the point. 
The Chair has given a ruling and I think it is quite clear. There was 
no evidence put forward in any of the lengthy argument of the hon. 
member for Lethbridge to show that there was anything irregular in 
the tabling of these estimates. I am sure that we could get into a 
protracted debate as to whether the estimates have taken into 
consideration the point that was adopted by the House in the 
resolution to which the hon. member for Lethbridge has referred. I 
suggest that is a matter for debate. It is not a matter of a point of 
order.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	The minister and the members who wish to argue this point can 
do so on one of the allotted days when we will be considering these 
estimates, as no doubt we will be over the next coming months. I 
suggest that it is a matter for debate. It is not a point of order. The 
estimates appear on their face to be in order and I respectfully 
request that we move on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I need some clarification.
<P>
	This distinct society motion indicated that, in all its actions and 
decisions, the government was to take this reality into account. 
That was what was passed.
<P>
	That being said, the estimates bear, among other things, on the 
heritage department. Through the issue of culture, whether Quebec 
or Canadian-
<P>

same point. As I said, we have already ruled.

	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour to present in both official languages the fifth report of the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade. 
This is the first report of the subcommittee on sustainable human 
development entitled: ``Ending Child Labour Exploitation: A 
Canadian Agenda for Action on Global Challenges''.
<P>
	I would also like to thank the witnesses who appeared before the 
committee as well as the members of Parliament for their work on 
this committee. This is a very important report that I think will 
guide the government in its approach to this very significant 
question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, ``The State 
of the World's Children'' is the title of the latest Unicef report, 
from which I quote the following: ``Today, over 250 million 
children around the world-in countries rich and poor-work and 
many of them are at risk from hazardous and exploitative labour. 
Denied education and trapped in cycles of poverty, their most basic 
rights, their health and even their lives are in jeopardy. The 
contributing factors are multiple and overlapping, including the 
exploitation of poverty, lack of access to education, and traditional 
restrictions, particularly for girls''.
<P>
	Today, the government is tabling the report of the sub-committee 
on sustainable human development on this same topic, along with a 
proposed action plan on this intolerable situation.
<P>
	I must say that the Bloc Quebecois members took part in the 
activities of this sub-committee with interest. Our active 
participation contributed to improving the report, and the 
government party accepted almost all of our recommendations.
<P>
	We must point out, however, first of all, that the conditions under 
which the final report was drafted and translated into French are 
unacceptable.
<P>
	I would just like to indicate that we played a significant part in 
the drafting of this report, and we are calling for the government to

Fiscal Arrangements Act (provincial legislation contravening the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am, in fact, introducing two bills whose 
purpose is to wake up francophone members outside Quebec who 
are usually asleep or hide their heads in the sand when enforcement 
of the Official Languages Act in Canada is at stake. The President 
of the Treasury Board, when he was principal secretary at Foreign 
Affairs, even tossed out the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	This bill is intended to give enforcement of the Official 
Languages Act in Canada more teeth. It would ensure that funding 
earmarked for Canadian francophone communities gets to those 
communities. Unfortunately, this money is appropriated by the 
provinces for other purposes.
<P>
	The bill therefore suggests that transfer payments to those 
provinces be reduced, if the money does not go to these 
communities or if the provinces violate the Canadian Constitution 
as it applies to the minority rights of francophones. That is, in fact, 
the case in most Canadian provinces.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to introduce my 
private member's bill, an act to amend the Agreement on Internal 
Trade Implementation Act.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade that was signed nearly three 
years ago was a start. However, it has not yet been completed. The 
main obstacle to the completion of this agreement is the use of the 
term consensus as it has been used by the negotiating committee 
comprised of cabinet level representatives from federal, provincial 
and territorial governments.
<P>
	This committee has interpreted the definition of consensus to 
mean unanimity. Therefore, any one government, regardless of 
population, can impeded the progress of the agreement, and indeed 
that of the Canadian economic union.
<P>
	My bill will allow the federal government to use its 
constitutional responsibility under sections 91 and 121 of the 
Constitution to complete sections of the agreement on internal 
trade. It is important to note that this action will be taken only in 
situations where co-operative agreement between the provinces has 
been sought and not reached.

Canadian businesses which previously have been restricted by 
these barriers.

Canada announced he would work toward diverting the Sable 
Island gas pipeline to Quebec City. It is unacceptable for the Prime 
Minister to decide the destination of Nova Scotia natural gas 
without consulting Nova Scotians.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEBUDGET">THE BUDGET</A></H3>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FINANCIALSTATEMENTOFTHEMINISTEROFFINANCE">FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE</A></H4>
	The House resumed from February 19 consideration of the 
motion that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of 
the government; the amendment, and the amendment to the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to respond to the budget presented by the finance minister 
earlier this week.
<P>
	I want to begin by pointing out that a budget can never be looked 
at in isolation from what is going on in the country. It can never be 
looked at in isolation from the government's history, nor from what 
is going on in the current economic and social climate.
<P>
	Frankly, that is the great weakness of the government's budget. It 
wanted to give the impression that this was a budget about which 
Canadians should feel very good, that all the problems of the past 
were behind us and now we can look forward to a bright future.
<P>
	When the government presents a budget that implicitly says that, 
it ignores what is going on in the real world.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	The fact is many Canadians today are asking ``If this is such a 
good budget, why am I not seeing any of the benefits? Why am I 
not, for instance, able to find a job? Why can I not rely on the 
health care system? What about the pension system''? Those are 
the kinds of questions people in the real world are asking today. I 
did not see any of that reflected the budget we heard just two days 
ago.
<P>
	Some have referred to this budget as the fudge-it budget. I think 
that is a good name because this budget is remarkable not for what 
is in it but for what is not in it. A budget should take into account 
all the big issues that are out there today, particularly economic 
issues. The budget sets the agenda for the government for the entire 
year. However, if it does not address the issues that Canadians are 
concerned about, to that degree it has no relevancy to what is going 
on in the real world. Obviously if the government is going to show 
leadership, be responsible and accountable to Canadians then the 
budget should be relevant to the situation of Canadians today. But I 
do not think the budget is. I think the budget completely missed the 
point on some very important issues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8361"> 8361 </A></B>
<P>
	I mentioned a minute ago that people today are concerned about 
jobs. I was astounded when I read the budget document and the 
booklet dedicated to the issue of employment that there was not 
one reference to the fact that taxes kill jobs. I heard the minister 
say in this place that taxes, payroll taxes, are a cancer on job 
creation. Many people in this place have said the same thing. But 
in that whole document there was nary a reference to the fact that 
payroll taxes kill jobs.
<P>
	It would be bad enough at any time, but coming five days after 
the finance minister announced a 70 per cent in payroll taxes for 
the Canada pension plan is absolutely astounding. How could he 
not know that Canadians were going to be outraged by a 
tremendous increase in taxes, the largest tax increase in the history 
of the country? There was no reference to the impact it would have 
on job creation.
<P>
	When the government thinks it is going in its favour and 
announces a 10 cent or a 30 cent decrease in UI premiums, it crows 
about how many jobs that will create. It alleges that a 30 cent 
decrease in UI premiums will create 40,000 jobs. But on a huge 70 
per cent increase in CPP premiums, there is not a word on how 
many jobs it will kill. There is not one word in the budget. Nowhere 
is it seen.
<P>
	To bring forward a budget five days after it announced that CPP 
premiums were going to go up a whopping 70 per cent and to not 
even mention it is simply outrageous, neglectful of the 
responsibilities of the finance minister. Frankly, it proves beyond a 
shadow of a doubt how out of touch the government is with the 
concerns of ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	During the last election campaign the government ran on the 
issue of jobs, jobs, jobs. When I went through the jobs document I 
did not see a single reference to the 9.7 per cent unemployment 
rate. It was nowhere to be found in the document. There were some 
words in the budget speech about how we should be concerned 
about joblessness. However, in the jobs booklet, an appendage to 
the budget document, under the section of economic indicators one 
would think that somewhere in there would be a mention of the 9.7 
per cent unemployment rate. Somewhere it would mention that we 
have 1.5 million unemployed Canadians.
<P>
	Hon. member across the way will correct me if I am wrong, but I 
believe that going into the last election we also had 1.5 million 
unemployed Canadians and he government ran on the promise of 
jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	We had 1.5 million unemployed Canadians at that point. Three 
and a half years later we present a budget with no mention of the 
fact that we still have 1.5 million unemployed Canadians. If the 
Liberals ran on that promise I would suggest, in the strongest 
possible language, that they have completely failed to keep that  
promise. The promise was a sham, it has not been fulfilled and 
Canadians have been let down, including the millions of Canadians 
who voted for the Liberals based on the promise that they would 
soon find employment. It simply did not happen.
<P>
	One of the things that was not mentioned in the budget 
document, even though the Liberals had to put some numbers in 
but was not remarked on in any significant way is the fact that 
revenues have gone up dramatically under the Liberal government. 
Tax revenues have gone up dramatically. If we look at the five year 
mandate of the government, according to its own numbers going 
from 1993, including its projections for next year, its total tax 
revenues will go up about $30 billion. That means a 30 per cent 
increase.
<P>
	However, if we look at what has happened to the incomes of 
ordinary Canadians, I would argue that in a direct comparison 
ordinary Canadians have fared very poorly. Their incomes have 
gone down 10 per cent. The government's income has gone up 30 
per cent. There was no recognition of that in the budget.
<P>
	Again, I think the budget should be relevant to Canadians. It 
should reflect what is going on in the real world. It is fine for the 
finance minister to speak from the Ottawa bubble and suggest that 
things are going well, but it ain't necessarily so back in the real 
world.
<P>
	Taxes not only kill jobs but they make it impossible for people to 
fulfil their dreams. We should remember that the whole point of 
having a budget and of having a government is to serve the people. 
That is why we are here, we are public servants. However, I do not 
believe that has been reflected at all in this budget document either.
<P>
	I would argue that what we find when we read the budget are a 
lot of self-congratulations and an attempt by the government to put 
the best possible face on a very bad situation.
<P>
	I mentioned a minute ago that people are not able to fulfil their 
dreams because of the staggering level of taxes. However, that is 
probably the best case scenario for some people. For many people 
who went bankrupt, including all those people who went bankrupt 
last year as result of this government's high tax policy, it has been a 
complete and utter disaster. In 1996 in this country we faced record 
bankruptcies. That is not a surprise because, after all, we had 
record high levels of taxation. We had record high levels of 
personal indebtedness. We saw disposable incomes fall by $3,000 
from the time the government came to power in 1993. Again, that 
was nowhere reflected in the budget documents. I believe it again 
reflects a disconnectedness with where Canadians are at today.
<P>
	There are other reasons why I think we need to refer to this 
document as a fudge-it budget that does not give the whole story. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8362"> 8362 </A></B>
<P>
One of the things that the government  and the minister crowed 
about was the new spending initiatives that he introduced in the 
budget, about $1 billion a year over two years.
<P>
	However, what he did not say, and we should always point this 
out when we have a debt approaching $600 billion, is that this 
reinvestment was with borrowed money. That is the first thing we 
need to point out.
<P>
	The second thing we need to point out when the government is 
proposing to spend new money on areas that it asserts are important 
to Canadians, and I believe it is right when it says that, is that when 
it spends a billion dollars in areas like research and development or 
health care initiatives it should, to be fair, point out that it also cut 
$7.5 billion from the Canada health and social transfer and it has 
made cuts to research and development in the past.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	The impact of those cuts is far greater than the benefits of the 
money that it is proposing to put in. This year alone it is another 
$2.8 billion in cuts to the Canada health and social transfer, and it is 
crowing about $300 million that it is going to put into health care 
over a three year period.
<P>
	Let us put things in perspective. For every $1 the government is 
putting back in this year it is going to take $10 out. I do not think 
that is much of a help to ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	A lot of ordinary Canadians are going to say this is nothing but 
pre-election flimflammery. They have every right to be cynical 
about what the government is doing and they really wonder what 
the exercise or what the purpose of a budget is. If it is not to tell the 
complete story then what exactly is the government doing? 
Obviously it is trying to put the best possible face on a very bad 
situation.
<P>
	One of the concerns I have is that over the three and a half years 
we have been here our party has railed away day after day on the 
problem of the deficit. I want to give the government some credit 
here. The government is finally taking the deficit situation 
seriously. After nine years that we have pounded away about the 
deficit, it has become an issue. I would like to suggest that perhaps 
the Reform Party can take a bit of credit for raising that issue and 
making it a big issue. I applaud the government for finally 
recognizing that it is important. It has taken a while but the 
message has gone through.
<P>
	Where we disagree completely with the government on its 
approach to the deficit is in how it has lowered it. The government 
has taken a completely different approach than our party would 
have taken. I want to expand on that for a moment.
<P>
	The government has raised revenues. It has raised taxes, raised 
revenues, and it has used that money in a couple of different ways. 
It has used it partially to reduce the deficit and it has used it 
partially to maintain a government that is far too big, far too 
wasteful, far to inefficient; a government that still has all kinds of 
pools of money to give out to special interests, to business groups 
and to many big businesses like Bombardier. The government has 
used the money to curry favour with regional interests. It has used 
it in a number of ways that are not very efficient and do not 
contribute to the overall betterment of the Canadian people and the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	That is one of the big differences between what the government 
does and how the Reform Party would handle this situation. The 
government says that it thinks it is okay to gradually reduce its 
spending until it has a government of around $107 billion or 
somewhere around there. We say it is much better to reduce the size 
of government down to about $94 billion and to turn the savings 
back to Canadians. In other words, the government has 
continuously raised revenues up, and that has come from only one 
place, from the pockets of ordinary Canadians. Meanwhile 
Canadians' incomes have fallen.
<P>
	We say it is time to reverse that trend. We would make 
government smaller and give the benefits back to ordinary 
Canadians in the form of a $15 billion tax relief package. It would 
amount to $2,000 for the average family of four by the year 2000. I 
will go into that in more detail in a moment.
<P>
	However, there is another area where we are critical of the 
government. We are critical of the government in so far as when it 
has reduced spending it has reduced it by cutting transfers to the 
provinces.
<P>
	We came here three and a half years ago, coming out of an 
election campaign where the Reform Party proposed to balance the 
budget over a three year period. We called it zero in three. In that 
package we outlined a number of spending reductions. We said 
because Canadians have made it very clear that health care is a 
priority for them, we would preserve health care spending and 
higher education spending, but that just about everything else 
would have to be looked at. In that plan we were able to come up 
with enough cuts that we would be able to balance the budget over 
a three year period.
<P>
	When we were proposing those things the government members 
across the way at that time during the election campaign pilloried 
the Reform Party despite the fact that we were going to save health 
care and save higher education. What did they turn around and do? 
They proceeded to cut health care far more dramatically than 
anything anybody in the provinces ever proposed. We proposed to 
save it; they cut it by billions and billions of dollars. There are 
hospitals closed around the country today due to what the Liberals 
did after they said they would not do it.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8363"> 8363 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	In the election campaign they went around the country telling 
people they were going to be the defenders of medicare. I do not 
think there is anybody who would buy that line today. The finance 
minister has served as the Dr. Kevorkian of health care in this 
country. He has pulled the plug on health care in many, many 
regions of the country. I hope the Liberals will pay the price for 
that.
<P>
	Cutting transfers to the provinces is the wrong way to cut 
spending. We say that it is much better to look at your own house 
first. When you do that then you have the moral authority, you have 
exercised leadership and people are much more willing to accept 
cuts at their level if you have already demonstrated that you are 
willing to accept cuts at your own level.
<P>
	In order to get its spending in line the government cut defence. It 
has cut that department by about $3 billion since it has been in 
power. Defence has been the whipping boy of successive 
governments for a long time and the cuts have to stop.
<P>
	When we add up the cuts the government has made to transfers 
to the provinces which amount to about $7.5 billion, and the cuts 
which it has made to defence which are about $3 billion, it amounts 
to $10.5 billion. It has only cut $17 billion in total. The other $6.5 
billion has come from cuts to its own administration.
<P>
	If we add that to the increase in revenues which the government 
has brought in, which amount to about $28 billion and which 
include user fees and other revenues, this indicates that only about 
5 per cent of the overall improvement in the bottom line is due to 
cuts in its own backyard. It has only cut itself by 5 per cent. 
Taxpayers have taken a major hit. Their pocketbooks are empty 
because of what the government has done. The provinces have 
taken a major hit. The people in defence have taken a major hit. But 
only 5 per cent of the improvement in the bottom line is due to cuts 
that the Liberals over there have taken.
<P>
	One of the most egregious examples is the cementing in place of 
the MP pension plan that Liberal members were thrilled to engage 
in about two years ago. Now they turn around and say: ``We are 
going to go after seniors and all the rest of the people who are 
coming up through the ranks and paying into the Canada pension 
plan by raising their premiums by 70 per cent''.
<P>
	It is typical of what has happened in this budget. It is typical of 
what has happened in the past. Liberal members pad their own 
pockets first and then ensure that their way is paid for by higher 
premiums and higher taxes from ordinary hard working Canadians.
<P>
	This budget is a fudge it budget. It has not told the complete 
story about what is going on in the country. The government has 
proven that it is disconnected from what is going on in the country. 
The government has  proven it does not understand the pain which 
ordinary Canadians are feeling. The government has completely 
broken its promise on jobs. It has left the young people of the 
country out in the cold. Youth unemployment stands at 17 per cent.
<P>
	There is a better way. The Reform Party will provide people with 
a better way through lower taxes, smaller government and a 
reinvestment in social programs. I hope that Canadians punish the 
government in the next election for what it has done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party continues to talk about how Canadians feel.
<P>
	I wonder if the Reform Party has considered how the disabled 
feel about this budget. Their benefits have been enhanced. I wonder 
if it has thought about how students feel about the expanded tuition 
credits and deductions they are going to get. I wonder if it has 
thought about how seniors feel now that there is in place a seniors 
benefit program and amendments to the CPP which will guarantee 
pensions and disability benefits. I wonder if it has thought about 
how Canadian parents feel about the enriched child tax benefit.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	Has Reform thought of how the Canadian tourist industry feels 
about the significant injection of funds, or about how the 
technological industry in Canada feels? How about the agricultural 
sector? How about the youth strategy, the jobs and opportunities? 
These are also Canadians and they understand that the government 
has delivered a budget of hope.
<P>
	The member spent a lot of time dealing with health care and how 
awful it is. Let me talk about what has happened with health care in 
my province of Ontario. The CHST was decreased by two and half 
per cent of provincial revenues which is far less than what we cut 
our own spending by. What happened is that the Ontario 
government then proceeded with a 30 per cent tax increase. The 
National Forum on Health has stated that the problem with our 
health system is not money itself but how the money is spent.
<P>
	My question has to do with the Canada pension plan. I would 
like the member to answer some questions for the House and 
Canadians. Do the Canada pension plan collections received by the 
government reduce the deficit? Do individuals, corporations and 
self-employed people pay less tax because they are paying a little 
more in CPP?
<P>
	If the answers to those questions are what they should be, then 
the member will also agree that the government deficit increases as 
a result of the CPP increase in premiums because of lower tax 
revenue from individuals, corporations and self-employed people. 
The Reform Party has said that CPP increases are a tax grab, but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8364"> 8364 </A></B>
<P>
they  are actually reducing the government's revenues and 
increasing the deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of different issues 
there. I hope the hon. member will forgive me if I do not get to all 
of them.
<P>
	He touched on students. I will try to answer the member's 
questions about what this budget does for students. As I said 
before, this budget is not remarkable only for what is in it but also 
for what is not in it. The hon. member forgot to mention that the 
government has already cut seven and a half billion dollars in the 
health and social transfer. Transfers for education have been 
dramatically reduced by this government. When the hon. member 
says that the government has thrown a bone to students, he has 
forgotten to say that it already took about 10 bones away. He should 
mention that in fairness.
<P>
	The same thing applies to the disabled. There have been billions 
of dollars in cuts to health care. The disabled more than any other 
group rely on health care. In fairness he should point that out. We 
do not have a problem with the government contributing more 
money toward the disabled; that is not a problem. But he should in 
fairness point out that the government has dramatically reduced 
transfers to the disabled.
<P>
	With respect to the child tax credit, we have no problem with 
money going into programs for poor people in this country. That is 
a good idea. We have no problem with that. Our point is that if you 
keep raising taxes and hurting people, poor people in particular 
who have the least income and cannot afford tax increases, then 
you are undoing any good you could possibly do by giving them 
more money through a program to alleviate child poverty.
<P>
	With respect to technology, if you raise taxes through the roof, 
which is what this government has done, and then you throw people 
a bone in a pre-election budget, that is superficial. People 
understand exactly what the government has done in the past. 
Those cuts are still hitting home today. So let us not be misled.
<P>
	What was in the budget with respect to agriculture? I did not hear 
anything. Was there anything? There was nothing in there, despite 
the fact that we have tremendous transportation problems in the 
west and we have a wheat board which many people would argue is 
completely dysfunctional. So let us not suggest there was 
something in there when there was not.
<P>
	With respect to youth, I simply must say when the member talks 
about a youth strategy, what people really want are jobs. This 
country has a 17 per cent youth unemployment rate. It is 
horrendous especially considering the government ran on a 
promise of jobs, jobs, jobs. We do not need more programs, what 
we need are more jobs.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	Finally with respect to CPP-
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.
<P>
	I respect the views of the hon. member for Medicine Hat but that 
is the third time he has used the term ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' which was 
Mr. Mulroney's statement.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That will not come out of the time of the 
hon. member for Medicine Hat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, Liberal, Tory, same old story.
<P>
	With respect to the CPP, I simply must point out that the finance 
department itself has called the premiums on CPP a payroll tax. 
Therefore it is a payroll tax and we must not mislead Canadians by 
suggesting that somehow this is an investment which is what I 
think my friend across the way wants people to believe.
<P>
	In fact if it were an investment, it would be the worst possible 
investment I have ever heard of in my life: premiums go up 70 per 
cent and there is a 10 per cent decrease in the pension. How in the 
world can members across the way call that an investment? If it is 
an investment, it is a Liberal investment and the worst possible one 
I have ever heard of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a comment and a question for the member for 
Medicine Hat generally on the debate yesterday and today.
<P>
	I see a tremendous circus spectacle being undertaken here. 
Jugglers from all sides of the House are throwing brightly coloured 
balls into the air, diverting the attention of Canadians from what is 
really happening behind them. The political agenda of both the 
government and the Reform Party is being ignored while the public 
watches all these coloured balls but Canadians see through this. 
They are not watching the balls in the air any more. They are 
concerned about what is happening behind the jugglers.
<P>
	We see today in particular the Reform Party's finance critic 
talking about jobs and what would happen under the budget. I have 
to accept all of the critical words the member for Medicine Hat has 
put out with regard to the government's record on jobs. The 
government's record is abysmal in this regard and the government 
knows it.
<P>
	The member for Medicine Hat also knows that the program 
which created no job creation in this country is the same type of 
program he would advocate were he the finance minister. There 
would be additional cutbacks in the public service and tax breaks to 
the large corporations which have not produced any additional jobs 
in this country.
<P>
	I would like the member for Medicine Hat, who is Reform's 
finance critic, to comment on some of the numbers that have come 
out of the budget, in particular  one set of numbers. In 1993, the last 
year of the Mulroney government, 5,250 taxpayers earning over 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8365"> 8365 </A></B>
<P>
$70,000 a year paid no taxes. Under the current government there 
has been a 400 per cent increase in that 21,270 Canadians who earn 
$70,000 a year or more paid no taxes. There are more Canadians 
paying less taxes or no taxes-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time will be up in one 
minute and eleven seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the same response to my hon. 
friend. The Reform Party is an advocate of a much simpler taxation 
system that ensures everybody pays taxes. In fact we have been at 
the forefront of the debate in advocating a flat tax system and 
would certainly invite my hon. friend and others to contribute to 
that debate. It is wrong for people to escape paying taxes in this 
country if indeed they have an income, or in the case of 
corporations if they are making a profit. That would be the short 
answer.
<P>
	The other point I would make to my hon. friend is we believe 
that subsidizing businesses by giving them taxpayers' money is 
equally wrong. That is something my friends across the way in the 
Liberal Party have been guilty of for a long time.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	The most blatant example of that was recently when they gave 
their friends at Bombardier hundreds of millions of dollars in 
subsidies. I note in the budget that another $250 million has been 
set aside for precisely that. They should be ashamed of that 
approach to job creation because it only creates jobs for their 
corporate buddies in corporate Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
splitting my time with the hon. member for Saint-Denis.
<P>
	With this, our fourth budget, we begin to build the future while 
recognizing we are still constrained by the past. As we head into 
the new millennium, we are continuing to restore Canada's fiscal 
health. We are continuing to invest in immediate jobs and growth. 
We are continuing to invest in job creation and growth in the long 
run and we are continuing to invest in a stronger society.
<P>
	From the beginning our government has struggled under the 
weight of massive debt; like a $500 billion ball and chain, the debt 
prevented us from going where we wanted.
<P>
	Today we are by no means unchained. The only thing we spend 
more on than interest is transfers. We spend more on interest on the 
debt than on everything else combined, excluding transfers. So 
debt remains a problem. Even when the annual deficit has gone 
down to zero the ball and chain of debt will remain until we pay off 
our enormous loan.
<P>
	As the economy grows and the debt declines we will be able to 
move more and more freely. So no, we are not unchained but our 
deficit is lower than it has been in 15 years. We have restored 
international confidence in our fiscal management of the country. 
We have restored our fiscal sovereignty. We have restored interest 
rate sanity and our load is beginning to lighten. We can now begin 
to move beyond securing, stabilizing and sustaining, toward 
striving for a stronger society, toward seizing our destiny in the 
21st century.
<P>
	There are those who say this is simply an election budget, that 
we are not showing our true colours, that our new spendings on 
jobs, health care and poor children are just short term election 
ploys. To them I say look at the numbers. They all add up and we 
are still ahead of our fiscal targets. If we could not sustain these 
programs and this new spending, would that be so? To them I say 
look at the markets. Our interest rates are a full two and a quarter 
percentage points below the U.S. and the dollar is staying strong. 
When did that last happen? If we could not sustain this spending, 
would that be so?
<P>
	As we begin to shed the mantle of heavy debt, our true colours 
are beginning to shine through. But let us not forget that for the 
parties of the right, not just the Reform Party but also the 
Conservative Party, we have not cut quickly enough. The 
Conservative leader demanded that we clean up the mess his 
government left behind. He wanted us to cut deeper. He wanted us 
to cut faster. But our government has taken a more balanced 
approach.
<P>
	From the beginning, even as we cut many areas of government to 
meet our deficit targets, we invested what we could in key 
Canadian priorities. We cut our own government the most and we 
cut our transfers for social programs the least. As we gain greater 
fiscal freedom we are continuing to invest in those priorities.
<P>
	With this, our fourth budget, we are continuing to invest in 
immediate jobs and growth. Jobs and growth have been our number 
one priority from the start; 790,000 new jobs since we started is 
nothing to sneeze at but it is not nearly enough.
<P>
	We are extending the Canadian infrastructure works program 
which has created jobs for 100,000 Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	We increased funding for youth employment, including doubling 
assistance for summer jobs. We are investing $15 million per year 
more on promoting tourism. That is an investment that will help to 
draw people to the rugged rocks of Peggy's Cove and the beautiful 
beaches of Queensland and Hubbards.
<P>
	We are continuing to invest in job creation and growth in the 
long run. We are establishing the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation, an $800 million foundation to support research 
infrastructure especially in health, environment, science and 
engineering.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8366"> 8366 </A></B>
<P>
	In the short run, this means jobs for those who will design and 
build these new and expanding research facilities. It also means 
more jobs at universities and hospitals in places like Halifax. In 
the long run, the research this money supports is key to competing 
in the global race for jobs in the 21st century.
<P>
	As we all know, a better education means a better job. We are 
helping students and their parents cope with the rising cost of 
education. We are improving the student loan system and 
enhancing the education credit. We are continuing to invest in a 
stronger society.
<P>
	When we began, our indebtedness was threatening the very 
future of our social programs. Now we are investing $300 million 
over the next three years to support key recommendations of the 
national forum on health. Now we are allocating $600 million in 
new funds for the child tax benefit to reduce child poverty. Now we 
are allocating $230 million over 3 years to assist Canadian with 
disabilities.
<P>
	When we began, Canadians had to marshal a great national will 
to keep Canada from going broke, to secure our social programs 
and to make them sustainable. Now we need to begin to marshal 
that same will to build a Canada that works for everyone. Now we 
need to strengthen our society to make sure Canada can stride 
unshackled toward its destiny in the 21st century.
<P>
	With this budget we turn the page. With this budget we take the 
first steps together on a great new journey.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a couple of questions for the member from Nova 
Scotia. He has accepted the premise of the budget about improving 
the economy and moving us forward. In particular, I want to talk 
about the children of the working poor, many of whom I know live 
in Nova Scotia and for whom Nova Scotians are looking to the 
member for representation.
<P>
	This morning in a news conference in Ottawa on Parliament Hill, 
the federal New Democratic Party leader Alexa McDonough urged 
the federal government to reverse plans hidden in the budget from 
Tuesday that will cut benefits for some 288,000 children of 
working poor in this country.
<P>
	She released some evidence, including copies of newspaper 
clippings from Toronto yesterday, that women living in the Toronto 
area were shocked to find out that they will get less money under 
the new program once it is brought into place than they were 
getting to date.
<P>
	It is noted that the combined working income supplement and 
the child tax benefit for families with one child will be $1,625 
under the new proposal instead of the $1,770 that they are getting 
today. This represents a 20 per cent cut in benefits for roughly 40 
per cent of those estimated to be Canada's working poor families.
<P>
	I want to ask the member whether he believes that this 
information is correct. If it is, would he work to help change the 
direction that is being taken by the government with regard to this 
part of the budget?
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	My second question deals with the lack of attention that the 
budget paid to the goods and services tax. The House had a major 
debate here over the harmonization of the GST for three of the four 
Atlantic provinces. I was not present to hear comments from the 
hon. member from the Halifax area with regard to the 
harmonization of the GST.
<P>
	I see that the Senate is about to hold hearings in Atlantic Canada, 
something the House of Commons and the government chose not to 
do. Therefore I am wondering if the member would appear before 
the Senate committee touring Atlantic Canada and what he would 
say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake for his question. I always enjoy 
hearing questions from this hon. member because he holds the seat 
that my grandfather, Jack Harrison, held many years ago and we 
have once in a while had exchanges in the House and it has always 
been a pleasure to discuss important issues with him.
<P>
	Since I came to this House in 1993 I have worked, as have many 
of my colleagues, on issues relating to child poverty. It has been an 
issue of priority for me for many years, long before I came to this 
House, as some members will know.
<P>
	When I hear the hon. member say that this is going to make 
people worse off, we have had a look at the numbers. The fact is no 
one will be worse off than they are under the present system. Here 
are the numbers, here are the facts. The maximum benefit will be 
increased from $500 per family to $605 for the first child, $405 for 
the second child and $330 for each additional child. Benefits will 
continue to be phased in based on family earned income over 
$3,750, not a very high threshold, and reduced as family income 
exceeds $20,921.
<P>
	This is a very important measure in the right direction. We have 
to go on. I do not say this is enough. I do not begin to say that we 
are investing in this budget all that we need to do in the long run to 
solve the problem long term of child poverty, but we are beginning 
to see the light at the end of the tunnel. We are beginning to make a 
very important investment. We are showing that this is the 
direction we want to take on this important national challenge of 
fighting child poverty.
<P>
	The member raised the question of the GST and the HST. The 
changes to the GST and HST in Nova Scotia are very important and 
very valuable in many ways. They are not perfect. I have never 
seen a change in taxation that was, unless it is actually eliminated. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8367"> 8367 </A></B>
<P>
We would love  to be able to do that. However, when we are paying 
$42 billion-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. member's time 
has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
is a budget, we may ask. It is a blueprint for action.
<P>
	Over the past three years our budgets have served as a road map 
for Canadians, telling them what lies ahead and forging a path to 
the 21st century.
<P>
	When we first received our map over three years ago the roads 
had been washed out in my opinion. We were heading down the 
road of economic destruction and social inequity. Nine years of 
failing to meet the targets by the Conservatives had taken their toll.
<P>
	In 1993 Canadians gave this government their overwhelming 
support to draft a new economic road map. We set about restoring 
public confidence by providing good government and creating a 
climate for putting more Canadians back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our fourth budget is our latest contribution to turn around the 
nightmarish economic and fiscal situation inherited from the 
previous administration. In January 1994, the deficit was $42 
billion, and our debt load had jeopardized the future of our social 
measures. It is no wonder that so many Canadians lost hope. But 
four Liberal budgets have put us back on track.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have made progress. Our fiscal policy of restraint in 
government spending and program review over three previous 
budgets is today showing tangible results.
<P>
	Let us make no mistake. Jobs and growth as well as preserving 
our health and social programs have been a priority of this 
government from the very beginning.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	Since coming into office, we have initiated a series of actions to 
stimulate immediate job creation. We have worked in collaboration 
with municipal and provincial governments, even Quebec, in an 
effort to improve the well-being of all Canadians. We took 
immediate action. We introduced the infrastructure program which 
was a success from coast to coast and, for that reason, we have 
decided to reintroduce it.
<P>
	In my riding of Saint-Denis, one of the biggest infrastructure 
programs was launched to renovate Jarry Tennis Stadium and 
thereby ensure that the international tennis tournament remains in 
Montreal. In the case of my riding, I have seen tangible evidence of 
Canadian tax dollars working to improve the well-being of my 
constituents.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In 1996 alone, more than $3.5 million has been invested in the 
riding of Saint-Denis by various ministers and state secretariats. 
With these subsidies, organizations were able to carry out many 
projects, bettering the lives of our fellow citizens and creating 
more than 50 permanent jobs and nearly 80 summer jobs.
<P>
	Several non-governmental organizations, including La 
Jarnigoine literacy centre in Villeray and the recreational and 
educational and heritage activities association, have received 
federal subsidies. Moisson Montréal, and its affiliate Renaissance 
Montréal, were also able to further their objectives in providing the 
most disadvantaged with either food or clothing at a very low cost.
<P>
	One of the priorities I set for myself when I ran in the last 
election was to ensure a better future for young people in Saint-Denis.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister of Finance who said in 
his budget speech this week: ``Let us recognize that Canada's 
greatest natural resources do not lie buried deep in the ground but 
in the skills and talents of those who walk on it''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The youth employment strategy announced last week by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development will help young people 
achieve their goals by providing them with the necessary tools.
<P>
	Some $60 million of the amount earmarked in the 1996 budget 
was used to double the number of student summer jobs, which 
climbed to 60,000 in the summer of 1996.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	New internship programs in partnership with the private sector 
will be put in place to allow young Canadians to gain work 
experience, a first job. How many times have we heard frustrated 
graduates say: ``I have the degree, now if I could only get some job 
experience''. We have given them that opportunity.
<P>
	Total federal spending on youth employment programs, 
including Youth Services Canada, Youth Internship Canada and 
Student Connections, over three years, 1996 to 1999, will be about 
$1 billion, a substantial commitment to Canada's future leaders.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Several organizations in the riding of Saint-Denis have already 
been able to hire under the summer career placement program, 
including the Coopérative fédérée du Québec, the Copains de 
Saint-Simon, Résidence Louvain and Cap du College de 
Bois-de-Boulogne.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8368"> 8368 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, we have carried out in Saint-Denis four Youth 
Service Canada projects, providing employment for 63 young 
people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will mention two examples today, the first one is the Octave 
Cremazie project. Fifteen young people who had never had any 
opportunities are now working in cleaning the environment in one 
sector of my riding. The other example is the Park Extension Youth 
Organization. We gave these kids their first opportunity to work 
and have some experience in working with a team. It was the first 
time that it had ever been done in one of the poorest districts in all 
of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Liberal government's fourth budget will also help students 
and their parents deal with the increased cost of higher education, 
through three important measures: the amount on which the 
education tax credit is based will be doubled, the student loans 
program will be improved by providing a longer payment period 
for students, and the ceiling on annual contributions to an 
educational savings plan will be doubled. Once all these measures 
are in place, they will increase by $275 million per year tax 
assistance to students and their families.
<P>
	I think this is good news to the students of Collège de 
Bois-de-Boulogne and throughout the province of Quebec. At a 
time when the unemployment rate for young people is close to 20 
per cent in Quebec, it is inappropriate for provincial authorities to 
criticize any attempt by the federal government to improve the 
situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Small and medium size businesses with fewer than 15 
employees account for approximately 42 per cent of all private 
sector employment. They have generated between 70 per cent and 
80 per cent of all new jobs in Canada over the past three years. In 
Saint-Denis, small and medium size businesses dominate the 
industrial sector.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Last month I organized an information seminar for these 
entrepreneurs. Despite the snowstorm, nearly 100 business people 
were present. Many were impressed with the gamut of services 
which have been introduced by the Minister of Industry and by the 
Secretary of State for the Federal Office of Regional Development.
<P>
	We often hear those same entrepreneurs complaining about the 
amount of paperwork they have to complete. The 1997 budget, 
along with the Minister of National Revenue, addressed these 
concerns. For example, the requirement to file monthly payroll 
deductions will be eliminated for small businesses with a perfect 
compliance record. They will now be permitted to file quarterly. 
This measure has the potential of benefiting up to 650,000 small 
businesses.
<P>
	In addition, the budget proposes to raise the ceiling on the Small 
Business Loans Act from $12 billion to $14 billion, providing 
additional borrowing assistance for fixed assets. Budgets are not 
just numbers. They speak of people's futures, their economic, 
social and mental well-being.
<P>
	To illustrate the important role of government in people's lives I 
wish to quote a great Canadian born economist, John Kenneth 
Galbraith. He said: ``There must be, most of all, an effective safety 
net-individual and family support-for those who live on the 
lower edges of the system or below. This is humanely essential. 
This is also necessary for human freedom. Nothing sets such stern 
limits on the liberty of the citizen as the total absence of money''.
<P>
	Let us not forget that 1997 is the international year for the 
eradication of poverty. We have made a commitment to that effect 
to the poor children and families of the country. The measures 
introduced in the budget are important steps toward this goal. But 
that is only the beginning. We must do more. We are now at the 
crossroads of our road map.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As of July 1998, the federal contribution for children will go up 
from $5.1 billion to $6 billion. The Canada child tax benefit will 
provide increased support to one million Canadian families, and 
their children.
<P>
	The two levels of governments made a commitment to create a 
new national child tax benefit program, which would be based on 
the Canada child tax benefit.
<P>
	We did our share and I hope the provinces, including the 
separatist government in Quebec, will do theirs, so that as much 
money as possible is available to reduce child poverty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The road has been a difficult one. We can all attest to that. All 
members of the House, on both sides, felt the suffering and loss of 
hope which many families and young people have endured these 
past few years. We have made many difficult decisions in the past 
three years, but we had few choices. Thus we have strived once 
again with this budget to provide a road map which will better the 
quality of life of all Canadians as we approach a new millennium; a 
map which will lead us to eliminate social and economic 
inequalities, a map that guarantees educational and work 
opportunities for our youth-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member 
but her time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for the opportunity to make a comment and also to put a question to 
the hon. member for Saint-Denis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8369"> 8369 </A></B>
<P>
	She stated that measures in the budget are important. I certainly 
understand that comment and the arguments she has made to 
support that position.
<P>
	The question I would like to ask the hon. member relates to a 
motion which was passed in the House of Commons on December 
11, 1995, which gave some direction to the House. Has the 
government or she as a member of the Liberal government taken 
that motion into consideration in terms of support for the measures 
that are strong in this budget.
<P>
	Just to remind the House, the wording of the resolution was:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the people of Quebec have expressed the desire for recognition of 
Quebec's distinct society:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) the House recognize that Quebec's distinct society includes its 
French-speaking majority, unique culture and civil law traditions;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) the House undertake to be guided by this reality;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the operative part and the direction to this House and the 
item I would like the hon. member to comment on.
<P>
	Third, I would like her to comment on this portion as well:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the House encourage all components of the legislative-branches of government 
to take note of this recognition and be guided in their conduct accordingly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	Are we being guided?
<P>
	The Prime Minister reinforced the direction to this House by 
saying: ``Once it is passed this resolution will have an impact on 
how legislation is passed in the House of Commons''. I would think 
that should apply to budgets as well. ``I remind Canadians that the 
legislative branch will be bound by this resolution, as will be the 
executive branch. This is a real dynamic recognition recorded in 
the very heart of our country's government''.
<P>
	Today in an earlier ruling by the Speaker it was felt that this 
procedure did not have significance.
<P>
	There was a directive of the House. We are talking about the 
budget of the country which is the framework on which many other 
decisions are made. Does the motion we passed, supported 
wholeheartedly by the government, have any affect on the budget?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. On this side of the House we make no distinction between 
different parts of the country. As far as we are concerned the budget 
is for all Canadians. The same measures apply across the country.
<P>
	As I said at the end of my speech, we want to ensure that all 
Canadians are treated equally by the government. Throughout our 
three-year mandate we have addressed areas where there are 
inequities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this question is a follow-up to my question to the member 
from Halifax. It is with regard to the working income supplement 
and the child tax benefit for families. I believe the member who 
just spoke heard what I had to say on that issue.
<P>
	The National Council of Welfare has concluded that the child tax 
benefit will actually cost tens of thousands of families with one 
child more than $500 over two years. Yesterday the finance 
minister told the Toronto <I>Star</I> that families with one child will 
receive less money from Ottawa, and the member for 
Elgin-Norfolk also told the Toronto <I>Star</I> yesterday that he is not 
happy with this situation and that he would try to get it fixed.
<P>
	Last year the budget set out a scheme for providing additional 
funds to families of the working poor. This budget has changed that 
formula dramatically and has cancelled the increase for families 
from last year. Because it is now child based rather than family 
based, it will result in a 20 per cent cut in benefits to 288,000 poor 
children or roughly 40 per cent of the poor living in Canada.
<P>
	Will the member for Saint-Denis also work to correct this 
deficiency in the system?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question but I will repeat what other hon. members have said.
<P>
	These budget measures will result in all children being better off 
than they were three years ago. I find it kind of unusual that the 
hon. member is not applauding some of the efforts outlined in the 
budget.
<P>
	The NDP should be applauding some of the measures that have 
been introduced. They are measures to ensure a better future for 
Canada's children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this fourth 
budget brought down last Tuesday in the House by the Minister of 
Finance is election minded and centralist.
<P>
	It is centralist because the areas it addresses are all, without 
exception, provincial in jurisdiction: literacy, tax benefits for 
children, tourism, higher eduction, students, the disabled, health 
and medical expenses.
<P>
	It is election minded because it consists of a scattering of timid 
measures and a few million dollars tossed out to attract groups that 
are generally anti-Liberal.
<P>
	Let us take the example of tourism, in which they will invest $15 
million annually. As Alain Dubuc pointed out yesterday morning in 
the editorial in <I>La Presse</I>, the interest alone on the federal debt is 
over $125 million daily.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8370"> 8370 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Seventy million dollars will be spent this year on the child tax 
benefit, less than the cost of servicing the debt for 17 hours, 
corresponding to 53 cents per child per week. There will be a 10 
cent reduction in UI premiums for every $100 of insurable 
earnings.
<P>
	In addition, the Farm Credit Corporation will receive $50 
million to support diversification in rural Canada, and $10 million 
in funding will be provided to help connect rural areas to the new 
information highway.
<P>
	You will observe that all these areas come under provincial 
jurisdiction or are areas in which Quebec has been trying to defend 
its jurisdiction for years, with no success, given Liberal policy.
<P>
	The Liberals' strategy could not be clearer. After cutting 
transfers to the provinces by several billion dollars and forcing 
them to struggle with increased deficits and, in the case of Quebec, 
to manage downsizing in education and health, with all that that 
represents in terms of management of collective agreements and 
workforce reduction, the federal government is tossing a few 
scraps the way of the provinces to increase its visibility in the 
months leading up to the election.
<P>
	This budget is Machiavellian, because it leaves the dirty work of 
cutting back program spending to the provinces. Because, year 
after year, the federal government has dipped into the $5 billion 
surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, deficit reduction is 
also supported by employers, for whom it is a sort of payroll tax in 
disguise, and by the workers, for whom it represents a hindrance to 
employment. The unemployed who are still searching for 
employment are 1.5 million strong, and there are another 1.5 
million who are no longer in the unemployment statistics, having 
given up hope of finding a job.
<P>
	The tax burden has increased by $22 billion in four years. Over 
that time, expenditures have decreased by $14 billion, over half of 
that the result of decreased transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is concealing his true margin of 
manoeuvrability from us. It is impossible for his deficit to decrease 
by only $2 billion next year, when it has already gone down close to 
$10 billion this year. The minister is hiding several billion dollars 
up his sleeve, just for the purpose of justifying his approach to 
cutting the deficit.
<P>
	There is nothing for employment, nothing for the battle against 
poverty. The government will earmark $800 million for the 
creation of a Canadian foundation for innovation. As if by chance, 
this amount of $800 million comes from transfer payments to the 
provinces, which are precisely $800 million less than what was 
forecast for 1997-98 in the 1996 budget, essentially due to an 
improved economic situation.
<P>
	This foundation duplicates services already provided by the 
provinces. Creating a new foundation instead of reinforcing 
existing research bodies would give the Liberals a chance to put in 
their own people, people who will act as a kind of liaison in 
connection with future appointments and fundraising for the 
Liberal campaign, now the election is only months away.
<P>
	There is no provision for compensating the Quebec government 
for harmonizing the GST in 1991, while the maritimes will be 
entitled to $1 billion in return for doing what Quebec did six years 
ago, without any compensation at all.
<P>
	The minister is reactivating some good news that was announced 
a few months ago, and prefers to remains silent on the cuts that will 
kick in this year and were included in last year's budget.
<P>
	Instead of reducing duplication and overlap, the federal 
government increases these as well as the inefficiencies for which 
it has been criticized by the Bloc Quebecois for the past four years. 
However, there may well be no more duplication and overlap in the 
future.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	As transfers to the provinces are reduced, the provinces will have 
to hand over entire components of their mission to the federal 
government. That is not how the provinces and Quebec taxpayers 
would like to see duplication and overlap eliminated.
<P>
	The 1997 budget elbows the provinces aside even more, so there 
will be more programs flaunting the maple leaf. What matters most 
to the government on the eve of an election is the visibility of the 
maple leaf on printed matter sent to Quebec and Canadian 
households between now and June 9, and the government is even 
happier if this mailing perhaps includes a cheque.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the increase in tax revenues over the past four 
years, the reduction in transfer payments to the provinces and the 
appropriation of the unemployment insurance fund, the minister 
does not expect his deficit to drop by more than $2 billion next 
year. The minister therefore retains considerable flexibility, and the 
measures to deal with unemployment and poverty are minimal, 
compared with the actual spending capacity of the federal treasury. 
They could even forecast a zero deficit for the year 2000 or even 
1999.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois estimates that today, the Minister of 
Finance has about $8 billion to use as he sees fit. The minister is a 
year ahead of schedule in his fight against the deficit. If he refuses 
to disclose the real numbers, it is because he wants to prevent any 
action by the provinces, community groups and unions which 
would certainly ask him to refinance social transfers to the 
provinces.
<P>
	If we look at how the budget has changed in the past four years, 
we see that 52 per cent of the $14.2 billion reduction in federal 
government spending involves  transfers to other levels of 
government, primarily the provinces. Only 21.1 per cent, or one 
dollar in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8371"> 8371 </A></B>
<P>
every five, of this reduction comes from direct government 
expenditures.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance says he did not raise taxes in his 1997 
budget. Since the Liberals have been in power, personal income 
taxes have continued to increase and at a rate greater than the GDP 
year in and year out. This increase in the personal tax burden 
especially on the middle class is not the result of a review of the tax 
system aimed at improving tax equity. Not at all. It is the result of 
several subtle increases, such as the non indexation of the tax and 
tax credit tables, causing individual income tax to rise every year in 
Canada.
<P>
	The minister talks of an improvement in the child tax benefit, 
which will not have a real impact until 1998, thus after the election. 
Will the Liberals give the child tax benefit the same treatment they 
gave the promises on the national child care system they promised 
in the last election?
<P>
	After impoverishing their parents through massive cuts to social 
transfers and unemployment insurance, will the Liberal 
government in a gesture of cynicism ease the lives of the children 
of these families?
<P>
	Family policy and the fight against poverty are provincial 
matters. The continued and even expanded federal intrusion into 
areas of provincial jurisdiction is not acceptable and hampers the 
implementation of coherent policy in Quebec. While ministers 
Harel and Marois in Quebec are struggling to find the millions 
required to help children, families and the jobless, the federal 
finance minister is trying to develop a family policy, an area that 
does not come under the responsibility of the federal government 
and for which it does not have the necessary expertise, since this 
has traditionally been a provincial jurisdiction, in Quebec and in 
the other provinces.
<P>
	Looking at this cynical and centralizing budget, one stops 
wondering why a majority of Quebecers long for a sovereign 
Quebec. It is to finally be free from this perpetual state of 
confusion where the level of government that controls the purse 
strings does not know what the needs are and does not have the 
human resources to serve a public which is, at any rate, far away.
<P>
	Leading anti-poverty organizations estimate that at least $2 
billion more would be required every year to put up a serious fight 
against poverty. But starting in 1998, the government will be 
spending only $850 million per year on the fight against poverty. 
This is therefore not nearly enough, especially since the federal 
government has considerably impoverished the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	It has been announced that unemployment insurance premiums 
will be reduced by 10 cents starting January 1, 1998. This is an 
announcement that is normally made in  November. Knowing him 
as we do, we can expect the Minister of Finance to announce this 
good news twice. In addition, this reduction is much smaller than 
what employers' associations have asked for and what it should 
have been, given the huge surpluses in the unemployment 
insurance fund.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois asks that the government substantially 
reduce UI premium rates and improve the employment insurance 
program, which has become too restrictive and is, unfortunately, 
forcing onto welfare people who, as job seekers, should continue to 
receive benefits.
<P>
	The accumulated surplus is large enough to allow eligibility 
rules to be relaxed and the premium rates to be reduced even 
further. Any annual surplus is a hidden tax paid by employers and 
employees. A 10 cent reduction of the 1998 premium amounts to 
$700 million. With a $5 billion surplus forecast for 1998, it should 
be possible to reduce the premium rate by 70 cents. The $15 billion 
surplus accumulated by the end of 1998 should even translate into a 
tax break, since it is in fact an employment tax of $2.10 for one 
year.
<P>
	One can see the feeble attempt made by the Minister of Finance 
to help job creation. The minister claims that serious studies 
estimate at somewhere between $10 billion and $15 billion the 
reserve required to prevent another recession. Just look at what will 
happen when the next recession occurs. Since the reserve is already 
being used to reduce the deficit, the minister will suddenly and 
drastically increase the premium rate, because the reserve will have 
disappeared.
<P>
	In November, the Bloc Quebecois released a comprehensive 
study on corporate taxation, so as to make an honest and objective 
contribution to the debate and to provide suggestions to the 
minister, who is often bereft of ideas.
<P>
	Today, it is obvious that the 1997 Estimates include no changes 
to corporate taxes. There is no tax measure to promote job creation. 
The minister is clearly showing that he did not want to change the 
corporate tax system to promote employment. The minister's 
inaction regarding the corporate tax issue reflects his inability to 
adjust to the current economic context and to make job creation his 
top priority.
<P>
	In conclusion, I feel the minister has turned a deaf ear to the Bloc 
Quebecois' recommendations regarding obsolete tax deductions 
for business. Obsolete tax shelters and deductions should be 
replaced by a tax system designed to promote employment. But 
nothing of the sort was done. The Bloc Quebecois suggested using 
up to $3 billion in ineffective tax deductions to create jobs instead.
<P>
	Given the current economic context, job creation should be the 
main thrust of the corporate tax policy. However, under the budget, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8372"> 8372 </A></B>
<P>
corporate tax revenues will only fluctuate by $205 million, of 
which $175 million is the result of a mere accounting exercise.
<P>
	The only other measure affecting corporate taxation is the 
decision to extend the temporary tax on large deposit taking 
institutions. This represents $25 million. Given the sky-high profits 
made by Canada's major banks, it is a very small contribution on 
their part to the community's well-being.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we, in 
this House, have spent the last three years listening to myths being 
spread by Bloc Quebecois members and their PQ friends in 
Quebec. The first such myth is that Quebec is not getting its fair 
share from the Canadian government. This is a myth which Bloc 
members continue to spread, with the help of their friends.
<P>
	The facts are undeniable: year after year, Quebecers receive 
more than they contribute in federal taxes. As for equalization 
payments, they receive 42 per cent of the total amount. I hope that 
some day Quebecers will be told the truth.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	My question to the Bloc member is this: Why is the Quebec 
government, which is also my government, unable to balance its 
debts or, to be more specific, unable to reduce its deficit, like other 
provincial governments have done? Indeed, other provincial 
governments have implemented changes. Mr. Klein even 
announced a surplus.
<P>
	I find it sad that the object of the hon. member's whole speech is 
to blame the federal government. These are myths, and we must 
say so. We have a responsibility to Canadians and to Quebecers, 
but so does the provincial government. We have taken action 
because the Quebec government did not act to eliminate poverty 
among Quebec children, women and families.
<P>
	I would like to know what the Bloc has done to help the 
provincial government achieve its goals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Saint-Denis 
for her question. My colleague spoke of myths. She said we were 
perpetuating myths. I would like to tell her that the biggest myth 
circulating in Quebec and in Canada is the one about centralizing 
federalism as practised in Canada for the last 30 years, during 20 of 
which the Liberals were in power. That is the biggest myth.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec is having difficulties because the 
federal government is offloading its deficit onto the backs of the 
provinces.
<P>
	Let us take the example of research and development. Over the 
last ten years or so, Quebec has received approximately 17 per cent 
of federal research and development grants, while the neighbouring 
province of Ontario has received 50 per cent. Historically, the 
federal government has always put less money into economy 
building measures.
<P>
	What Quebecers want is not just transfer payments to help 
subsidize welfare and assistance to the less fortunate members of 
society. What they want from the federal government is spending 
that will have an impact on the economy, such as Ontario has seen 
for ten years or so. Historically, Quebec has never received its fair 
share.
<P>
	When there are massive cuts by the federal government in 
transfer payments, such as we are now experiencing, Quebec is 
more severely affected than Ontario or other provinces. The federal 
government has not put money where it would have allowed 
Quebec to have proportionately fewer people living in poverty. 
When this kind of spending is cut, people are hard hit.
<P>
	Finally, the flexible federalism, the decentralized federalism we 
keep hearing about from the Prime Minister and the federal 
government is always based on a double standard. If this is the kind 
of distinct society the Liberal government wants to talk to us about, 
we are not interested.
<P>
	Take the case of the GST. The maritimes received $1 billion in 
compensation for harmonizing with the GST. Quebec did the same 
thing in 1991 without a cent of compensation, when it should have 
received approximately $1.9 billion. If that is what they mean by 
distinct society, treating Quebec differently where taxes are 
involved, I can understand that Quebecers are increasingly 
considering sovereignty.
<P>
	I would also like to tell the member for Saint-Denis that what the 
Bloc Quebecois most dislikes about the Minister of Finance's 
budget is its scattershot approach. The amounts involved are small, 
a few million dollars, and they have been ladled out all over the 
place. Rather than watering down the impact of the $1 billion 
available in the 1997 budget, why did they not target one or two 
specific areas in order to produce a bigger bang in terms of jobs and 
wealth?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos: </B>Mr. Speaker, as I said before, there are myths 
and myths. When a government spends taxpayers' money on 
political propaganda, there is less money left to invest in helping 
young people and the poor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> It is true. But I have another question for my 
colleague. As I said before, what does the provincial government 
intend to do to balance its books? Taxes cannot absorb everything. I 
pay a lot of income tax in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
Saint-Denis for her question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8373"> 8373 </A></B>
<P>
	Speaking of propaganda, I hardly think we can criticize the 
Government of Quebec, when we consider the 23 million flags 
distributed by the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saint-Denis asked me how the Quebec 
government will balance its books at the end of the current fiscal 
year and in the years to come, to help the disadvantaged. Well, it 
will not be easy. The Quebec cabinet is involved in a series of 
complex accounting exercises. They may have to renegotiate 
collective agreements with unions in the public and parapublic 
sector, and that will not be easy.
<P>
	Now, if the federal government were to send, as soon as possible, 
a first instalment on the $1.9 billion the federal government owes 
to Quebec for harmonizing the GST with its provincial sales tax, 
that would be a good start.
<P>
	If the federal government then sent another cheque as a first 
instalment on the $2 billion in transfer payments that were cut in 
the case of Quebec, over the past few years, we would be well on 
our way to balancing the budget, and we could go ahead and give 
people additional protection.
<P>
	As I said before, historically, the percentage of disadvantaged 
people and poor people has always been higher in Quebec, because 
the federal government never did the kind of strategic spending it 
did in Ontario and the other provinces.
<P>
	What Quebecers want is research and development and 
investment in technology.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> They want political stability too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> We have had more than enough welfare, social 
assistance and unemployment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very proud I was elected in 
Quebec. I am a Quebecer and a Canadian. I want to say this because 
some hon. members do not believe me, but the Liberals also defend 
the interests of Quebecers.
<P>
	The hon. member said it was always the federal government's 
fault. Another myth that our separatist friends have perpetuated.
<P>
	By the way, he did not answer to my question. ``It is the federal 
government's fault again'', is something we have heard in Quebec 
for years. I want my provincial government to take steps to ensure 
that with the co-operation of the federal government we can 
improve the lives of all people, especially the people in the riding 
of Saint-Denis, and we do that by providing political stability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the following comment for the 
hon. member for Saint-Denis. Will the hon. member promise, on 
behalf of her government, that the federal government will stop 
reducing transfer payments once and for all? Could she promise, on 
behalf of her government, that these cuts will be stopped once and 
for all?
<P>
	The government is trying to balance its public finances, and this 
is not easy. I think it will manage. There is a budget plan. At the 
summit last year, there was an agreement with employer 
associations and unions in Quebec. There was a consensus to the 
effect that Quebec's budget would be balanced by March 31, 2000. 
I think we are on the right track.
<P>
	However, if the federal government keeps reducing historic 
transfer payments to Quebec, it will be well high impossible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Vancouver South.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to rise today to speak in response to the budget 
speech. I would first like to congratulate the minister and all the 
assistants who laid the foundation for this budget. It was a job well 
done. I think it has been well received across the country.
<P>
	When I consider all the nuances of the budget, it is the human 
component that to me is the most significant. Addressing child 
poverty, support for the disabled, youth employment initiatives, 
health care reform and pension adjustments are just a few. It is my 
wish today to discuss post secondary education as the focus of my 
comments.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	We live in a world where knowledge and education are the keys 
to long term industrial success. They ensure that a country's 
industries can apply innovation to seize new opportunities in global 
markets and they provide workers with the skills employers need.
<P>
	The number clearly indicate this. In Manitoba, my home 
province, in 1995 only 4..8 per cent of students who dropped out of 
high school have found jobs, compared to 71.9 per cent who stayed 
in school, graduated and found employment.
<P>
	Post secondary graduates fared even better. About 80 per cent of 
Manitobans with a post-secondary certificate or diploma or 
university degree were actively involved in the labour force. This 
pattern is virtually the same across the country.
<P>
	It is for this reason that the government has increased federal 
support for post-secondary education by $137 million in 1997, 
reaching $275 million annually when the changes have all matured.
<P>
	This funding is targeted to provide assistance for students and 
their families, including workers upgrading their skills to help 
them cope with the rising costs of post-secondary education, 
students facing higher debt loads after graduation, and parents 
saving for their children's educational future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8374"> 8374 </A></B>
<P>
	I should note that these issues build on the $80 million increase 
in direct federal tax assistance for post-secondary education that 
was provided in the budget one year ago and they are 
complemented by the creation of the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation which will ensure that post-secondary students have 
access to better facilities and equipment to prepare for the 
knowledge based economy of the 21st century. For this the 
government is making up front investments of $800 million.
<P>
	I will get to the foundation in a moment, but first let me discuss 
the government's plans to increase access to higher education.
<P>
	Specifically, the budget proposes several measures. First, the 
amount used to establish the education credit will immediately rise 
to $150 per month from $100 and to $200 per month for 1998 and 
subsequent years.
<P>
	As tuition fees increase, the amount of assistance provided by 
the tuition fee credit increases automatically. However, as a parent 
of three daughters who are all attending university, and as an aside 
all three were in university in one academic year, I know that 
students also have to pay a number of mandatory fees on top of 
their tuition. The budget proposes to extend the tuition tax credit to 
cover additional mandatory fees imposed by universities to cover 
these costs of higher education.
<P>
	Second, students or their parents may not have enough tax 
payable in a given year to fully benefit from the tuition and 
education credits. To ensure that all students can use those credits 
fully, students will now be able to carry forward all unused portions 
of these credits and to be applied against any future income.
<P>
	At a time when university and college classrooms are filled with 
more and more mature students, it is important to note that this 
measure will also benefit workers who have decided to return to 
school after a short period in the workforce.
<P>
	To demonstrate the effect of these budget measures I will give a 
simple example. By 1998 a student in full time attendance at a 
post-secondary institution faced with tuition fees of $2,800 and an 
additional fee of $300 will receive over $1,200 in combined federal 
and provincial tax assistance per year. This is no small amount. In 
fact, it represents an increase of more than 30 per cent from the 
$900 of assistance available to the student in 1995.
<P>
	The 1997 budget also announced an important change to the 
Canada student loans program. Students are expected to start 
repaying their loan six months after graduation. But students facing 
hardship are allowed to defer making payments on these loans for 
up to 18 months. The federal government pays the interest accruing 
on the student loan during this period.
<P>
	Recently a coalition of groups representing the post-secondary 
educational community agreed that while this system provides 
considerable help, changes needed to be made and they issued a 
proposal which pointed out among other things that some students 
are unfortunately left unable to meet these obligations. I supported 
this coalition in their call for change, as did other members of 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	It is clear today that our government listened to what Canadians 
were telling it and subsequently agreed. As a result, the budget 
proposed to extend to 30 months from 18 months the period of time 
during which students are allowed to defer making payments. 
Combined with the initial six months after graduation when no 
payments are required, this means that students will have up to 
three years to deal with their financial debt load. This measure will 
come into effect on August 1, 1997. It is projected that it will 
provide an additional $20 million a year in assistance to students.
<P>
	In addition, the federal government is ready to pursue with 
interested provinces, lenders and other groups a new repayment 
option that would offer students another choice. Students would be 
able to choose between current repayment arrangements and an 
income contingent repayment schedule. By tailoring payments to 
individual circumstances, the debt would be made more 
manageable.
<P>
	We are also acting to improve incentives for parents to save for 
their children's education. Parents with young children are 
increasingly worried about whether or not they will be able to 
afford the rising costs of their children's education.
<P>
	Registered education savings plans, or RESPs, exist to provide 
parents with incentives to save for their children's education. The 
full benefits of these tax sheltered plans are reaped by parents who 
start saving when their children are quite young.
<P>
	The budget proposes that annual contribution limits to RESPs be 
doubled to $4,000. This will assist parents who are not able to start 
saving for their children's education when they are young and 
therefore have fewer years to make contributions.
<P>
	Under RESP provisions, all RESP income must go for 
educational purposes and the family loses the investment income in 
their plan if their child does not pursue post-secondary education. 
Since this can discourage parents from starting an RESP, two 
measures are proposed to address this problem.
<P>
	Individuals winding up an RESP will now be allowed to transfer 
all or part of this deferred income to RRSPs, provided they still 
have room in their RRSP accounts. Alternatively, individuals 
without available RRSP room or who do not wish to make RRSP 
contributions will be allowed to receive investment income 
directly, subject to an appropriate charge. This charge will ensure 
that assistance is not provided to those who might use RESPs for 
tax 
<P>
<HR>

<P>
shelter purposes which are unrelated to either education or 
retirement savings.
<P>
	The government is proposing the creation of the Canada 
foundation for innovation. I would suggest that this is perhaps the 
crown jewel in terms of educational opportunities in this country. 
This new independent body operating at arm's length from the 
government is designed to help renew facilities and equipment, 
research infrastructure if you will, at Canadian post-secondary 
institutions associated with research institutions and hospitals.
<P>
	Through this foundation we are saying to our young students that 
we want them to pursue their research career here in Canada. It is 
important for us to have a workforce with the capacity to put new 
technologies into practice. People who understand developments in 
science and technology are indispensable.
<P>
	The foundation will help support innovative capital projects in 
the areas of health, the environment, science and engineering. 
Funded through an up front investment of $800 million by the 
federal government, it will provide an annual average of $180 
million over the next five years. It will operate on the basis of 
partnerships with the private sector, universities and colleges, 
volunteer organizations and provinces to the extent they wish to 
participate.
<P>
	In closing, I quote the hon. Minister of Finance who in his 
speech said: ``What government does with scarce resources shows 
what its values are-''
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member 
but his time has expired. Questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the words of the hon. member from 
Manitoba. I have enjoyed listening to him over the past three years. 
He has made great commitments on behalf of the people he 
represents. Therefore, I am a bit surprised that he has so gullibly 
jumped into the rhetoric of the finance minister on the budget.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	The member comes from a constituency that relies on the rural 
sector for its own buoyant economy. This budget had very little to 
offer to people who live in rural Canada, particularly those areas 
that were affected by cutbacks to the western grain transportation 
program of previous budgets of this government.
<P>
	In previous budgets there was $720 million a year cut from 
farmers' pockets for transporting grain to port so that Canada can 
sell it into the lucrative export market. In those previous budgets 
which took that $720 million from transportation and ultimately 
from farmers' pockets, we were told at the time that value added  
production would return benefits to rural Canada and would 
therefore create jobs.
<P>
	Value added production since that time has not increased 
dramatically. While there have been some gains made in Winnipeg, 
Saskatoon and Regina, there have been virtually no gains made in 
small town western Canada. This budget should have 
acknowledged the greater need for value added production in rural 
Canada giving the opportunity for a number of the young 
unemployed individuals throughout Canada, many of whom the 
member talked about in his remarks, the opportunity to gain some 
income to proceed with their post-secondary education.
<P>
	My question to the member for Brandon-Souris is quite simple: 
Will he work to assist young people in rural Canada to generate the 
type of economic activity that is necessary in the Cut Knifes, the 
North Battlefords, the Kindersleys and Brandons of the world and 
ensure that the government supports their efforts through a value 
added production type of programming?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. It is relevant to a member from southwestern Manitoba.
<P>
	We have had a number of initiatives under way in Manitoba 
since the WGTA changes took place. We have probably had the 
most diversified investments occurring throughout the prairies in 
terms of our region and in terms of crop diversification.
<P>
	We had numerous investments put in place of technologies that 
are going to lead to an increased economy. Working through our 
rural caucus colleagues here in Ottawa we have been able to spur 
debate, discussion and interest in investment. Might I comment 
that Manitoba has had more investment money coming in since the 
WGTA changes than any other region of the country. As it pertains 
to post-secondary education which was the essence of my 
discussion, it is going to allow more young Manitobans to stay in 
our region, live in our region, invest in our region and make a 
substantial contribution to the nation.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is only 49 seconds left. Sharing 49 
seconds gets a little difficult.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> I should have spoken a little longer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very happy to speak on the budget today. It is an 
excellent budget. There are a couple of very important ingredients 
in the budget. Generally it is a balanced budget, it is a responsible 
budget and it is a compassionate budget. Let me state why those 
three things are very important for us on the government side.
<P>
	The budget had to be balanced because we want to ensure that 
the actions we have taken on the deficit do not take away from the 
future. I know some people have said that they want to get rid of the 
deficit in three years  but we have said right from the beginning that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8376"> 8376 </A></B>
<P>
our approach in dealing with the deficit would be balanced and 
reasonable and that we would deal with it in a compassionate and 
responsible way.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	When we became the government there was a $42 billion deficit, 
a problem which many said was very difficult to deal with. During 
the first radio show I did after the election Bill Good asked me if 
my government was really going to deal with the deficit. I said that 
absolutely, we were going to deal with it because it was important 
for the future of the country, but that we were going to do it in a 
responsible way.
<P>
	In the last election campaign we set specific targets and said that 
we were going to meet those targets. In the last four budgets we 
have met all the targets; in fact, we have done better than meeting 
the targets. It was very important to meet every one of our targets 
because it sent the very strong message to the international 
financial community that we were serious about dealing with the 
deficit.
<P>
	Some of the Reform members are trying to take credit for our 
actions on the deficit but during election time we set specific 
targets, not because of the Reform Party but because we felt it was 
important to deal with it. Those targets have been met and as the 
minister stated in the last budget, we will be at least $5 billion 
below our target of $24 billion.
<P>
	It was very important to meet our targets for a number of 
reasons. Because of the confidence we have established in the 
international community, our dollar has stabilized. Interest rates 
are unprecedented; I cannot remember the last time Canadian 
interest rates were below American interest rates. Our interest rates 
are presently more than two and a half per cent below the American 
interest rates. In the past it has always been the reverse, where the 
American interest rates were two to two and a half per cent below 
the Canadian interest rates.
<P>
	This is what will create jobs. Opposition members have asked, 
what about jobs? Low interest rates create jobs, investment and 
confidence. Interest rates play a major role in the investment 
decisions of small and medium size businesses. If someone wants 
to construct a new building, for example, a new hotel or a new 
factory, interest rates will play a very important role in determining 
if that investment will go ahead. Canadians buying homes have to 
look at what the interest rates are. Interest rates can affect their 
choice of a home because of their influence on monthly mortgage 
payments. When Canadians buy cars, the interest rate is an 
important factor which determines whether or not they can afford 
to buy a car.
<P>
	We have one of the lowest inflation rates of the G-7 countries. 
This will ensure the maintenance of our low interest rates.
<P>
	All these things, dealing with the deficit, meeting our targets, 
having credibility in the financial markets, have led to lower 
interest rates, lower inflation rates and a greater confidence in the 
economy. It is so much so that economists are predicting Canada 
will have the best growth figures in the next medium term 
compared to other G-7 countries. It was not any easy task and all 
Canadians know that. It was a difficult task to achieve what we 
have today.
<P>
	The attitude of this government and the finance minister was to 
look at government from the bottom up. We did not just say that to 
deal with the deficit we were going to cut everybody by a certain 
percentage. As a government we said that we wanted to review all 
programs starting from the bottom up. We said that we wanted to 
get rid of those programs that were no longer relevant to 
Canadians. We said that we wanted to get rid of those crown 
corporations that were no longer relevant to Canadians. We looked 
at how we could turn those services that could be provided more 
efficiently and effectively by private industry, municipal 
governments and provincial governments over to them.
<P>
	Canadians have said to us that they want a government that is 
efficient, that they want less duplication and less waste. That is 
another area we looked at in terms of saving money and dealing 
with the deficit. We asked: Where is there waste in government? 
Where are there inefficiencies? How can we do it better? This was 
the basic view we took in trying to deal with the deficit and in 
trying to re-engineer government to meet the 21st century, to move 
forward into the next century where we could have a government 
structure that could be with us for a long time. It was not an easy 
task. It was a difficult task, but that is what we have done.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	We also understood that there are investments to be made in this 
country so that we could be competitive in the rest of the world, 
that Canadian products could be sold. The reality is there is 
globalization. We have to compete on the international market. 
Canada is a trading nation.
<P>
	We understood, for example, that infrastructure is very 
important to be competitive around the world. If we have road 
systems, ports, airports that are efficient we will be more 
competitive. If we have a communications system that is efficient 
and responsive we will be able to be more competitive in the rest of 
the world. If we have ports that can ship products very efficiently it 
helps the business community because it is more efficient and 
much more cost effective. We understood that. That is why we had 
an infrastructure program to ensure that we maintain the 
infrastructure and improve it for the coming century.
<P>
	We also recognized that research and development is very 
important. Any country that does not do research and development 
falls behind. So in this budget we have  said that there will be $800 
million in the Canada Foundation for Innovation, $800 million 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8377"> 8377 </A></B>
<P>
toward research and development which, by the way, will be 
administered by the private sector. It will determine where it is 
most advantageous for Canadians to spend that money.
<P>
	We also understand how important trade is for Canada. That is 
why we have the Prime Minister's Team Canada missions where he 
has travelled to the Asia-Pacific, to South America and other 
regions to tell other countries that Canada is ready for business. 
Canada has the expertise. It has the skills. It has the products to 
deliver to people around the world.
<P>
	I can say having the opportunity to travel and meet many leaders 
around the world that other countries want to do business with 
Canada. They know the type of products that we can provide. They 
know the skills, the efficiencies and the quality of the products 
which Canada provides in goods and services. They have all said 
``We want to see Canada at the table. We want them to be there 
because we are confident in the services and products they 
provide''.
<P>
	We understand how education is so very important for 
Canadians. That is why we have made it easier for students to pay 
back their loans, to give them more time and not to have to pay 
back their loans in the first six months but over 30 months to give 
students that leeway.
<P>
	As well, we have said we want to encourage people to invest in 
education. That is why the registered education savings plan has 
been doubled from $2,000 a year to $4,000 a year to encourage 
Canadians to invest in education and invest in their children.
<P>
	We recognize that truly children are our future. I am proud of 
this government's work on child poverty where we have invested in 
children. We are making sure that we help those children of the 
working poor. That is the recognition of a country with true 
compassion that cares for those people who are less fortunate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as you might know, I will not be seeking office in the 
upcoming election. Therefore today I am definitely giving my last 
speech as an MP in this House in reaction to a government budget.
<P>
	Let me start my comments with a brief assessment of the 
budgetary policy of this government during the last three years.
<P>
	The $42 billion deficit in 1993 required urgent and decisive 
action. This view was shared by most Canadians and it produced 
the historic electoral success of the Reform Party which ran on the 
platform of fiscal responsibility. There are a number of indications 
suggesting that in 1993 neither the Liberal Party nor the finance 
minister fully appreciated the severity of the country's fiscal crisis. 
For this reason the first budget in  1994 reflected the belief that 
Canada would grow out of the crisis if we just reined in the growth 
in spending.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The 1995 budget showed that reality had finally mugged the 
minister and his party. I take pride in my and my colleagues' 
contribution to driving home the fundamental truth about the 
effects of compounding interest and the risks associated with 
threats to the value of Canadian bonds caused by growing debt to 
GDP ratios.
<P>
	Pressed in addition by high interest rates, warnings by Moody's 
about the downgrading of the debt and slow economic growth, the 
government bit the bullet and announced substantial cuts to 
program spending and some relatively small but still substantial 
tax increases.
<P>
	The minister deserved the positive reaction to his historic budget 
given by the financial markets and the Canadian public. I praised 
the minister for having lowered program spending in absolute 
dollar values for the first time in post-war history.
<P>
	I still believe that this praise was deserved. The 1996 budget 
contained no substantial further cuts or tax changes. All the 
politically difficult decisions had been made and embedded in the 
1995 budget.
<P>
	During the last two years, economic development largely outside 
the control of government favoured the Liberals and their 
budgetary goals. Economic growth remained moderately high 
simply because the country enjoyed a cyclical upturn.
<P>
	The growth was driven largely by strong exports to the United 
States, which were fed in turn by a strong U.S. expansion and a low 
dollar. Most important, interest rates in the U.S. trended 
downward.
<P>
	These fortunate exogenous developments produced better than 
expected increases in revenue, along with decreases in interest 
costs. As a result, the interest rate spread on short to medium term 
bonds between Canada and the United States moved in favour of 
Canada and resulted in even more moderate, positive effects on the 
fiscal balance.
<P>
	In light of the much better than expected and very fortuitous 
improvements in the deficit, a large and vocal faction of the Liberal 
caucus began agitating for a resumption of the party's traditional 
policy of spending to buy votes for the next election, though of 
course they always describe these spending programs as providing 
compassionate aid to the unemployed and needy.
<P>
	When the 1997 budget was revealed this week I, the financial 
community and in my view most Canadians were pleased to find 
out that the Minister of Finance increased spending and reduced 
taxes only by a relatively small $1 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8378"> 8378 </A></B>
<P>
	With most of the big increases coming a year or two in the 
future, he has stayed the course of fiscal restraint in this election 
year and stared down his spend thrift colleagues in the party.
<P>
	Moreover, the spending increases he made were not of the 
traditional make work, pork barrel variety but, with some 
exception, involved projects that have a high probability of 
bringing good social and economic returns.
<P>
	Ironically, the basic pattern of the Liberal budgetary policy is 
almost identical to what Reform had promised to do in its zero in 
three election platform in 1993. However, there are several major 
differences.
<P>
	First, the cuts have not been fast and incisive enough. As a result, 
in the 1997-98 fiscal year the deficit will still be $16 billion or 
nearly $1.5 billion a month. This level of deficit may seem low by 
historic and some international standards but by any other 
standards it is still outrageously large. I repeat, we are adding to the 
debt $1.5 billion every month. Divide this by 30 and you get $50 
million a day.
<P>
	An important consequence of this continued deficit is that it 
exposes Canada to the risk of backslide should there be a 
turnaround in economic fortunes like a rise in interest rates and 
lower economic growth. Both these events are certain to take place 
in the future.
<P>
	For the sake of Canadians, let us hope that the economic 
environment remains benign for several more years.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	Also, because improvements in the fiscal balance have been so 
slow, the debt is well over $600 billion and there are no plans for 
paying it down. Very soon Canada's problem will not be the deficit 
but the debt, if it is not already so.
<P>
	Interest payments on the debt of $46 billion nearly equal what 
the government spends on elderly benefits, OAS and others, 
employment insurance, formerly known as unemployment 
insurance, and social transfers to the provinces combined. Let me 
repeat this. The sins of the past decade, including the last three 
years, have resulted in an outcome whereby the cost of servicing 
the result of those sins takes up the same amount of money as our 
very generous and expensive program of old age security benefits, 
now called the elderly program, unemployment insurance and the 
social transfers for health, higher education and welfare. This is 
truly an astounding number.
<P>
	When interest rates go up again, the problem will be even worse. 
Only debt repayment can end this regretful state of affairs.
<P>
	The media has finally picked up on one of my main themes in 
past comments on the budget. Two-thirds of the improvement in 
the fiscal balance was achieved by increased tax revenues mostly 
through bracket creep,  partly through tax rate increases and some 
through the growth of population and wealth. Only one-third of the 
fiscal improvement has been due to cuts in program spending.
<P>
	Unfortunately half of these cuts involved downloading of the 
adjustment burden on the provinces which in turn have cut funds 
for health care, higher education and welfare. Only a meagre 35 per 
cent of the reduction on program spending involved cuts to the size 
of the federal government, the departments which provide 
subsidies to business, regions and special interest groups which 
offer services which duplicate and overlap those delivered by the 
provinces.
<P>
	Finally, I was very disappointed that the budget did not start the 
most fundamental debate that Canadians will have to face in the 
future. Assuming that economic conditions continue favourably 
and that the deficit will be eliminated in the year 2000 or so, the 
debate will be over the use of future dividends.
<P>
	Canada faces three choices. The fiscal dividend can be used to 
lower taxes and gradually produce a smaller government. 
Alternatively, it can be used to pay down the debt and start a 
virtuous cycle of growing fiscal surpluses which in turn can be used 
for further debt and tax reductions. The third possible use of the 
fiscal surplus is increased spending and a larger and more intrusive 
government.
<P>
	The next election should involve the discussion of these different 
paths for the development of Canada. Any government elected in 
1997 or 1998 will face the need to decide on this matter. There are 
obviously no best choices. Each of the three alternatives has 
advantages and disadvantages. However, in the light of post-war 
experiences, in my view bigger government does not appear to 
promise many benefits for society at large.
<P>
	Surely there are always beneficiaries from government largesse 
and they always tell good stories on why they deserve the goodies 
from the state. However, as we look back on the decades since the 
1960s it is difficult to find evidence that the massive expansion of 
governments has produced a significant improvement in the lot of 
the average Canadian above that due to general and largely 
exogenously determined economic growth.
<P>
	If we believe the government's statistics and read the public 
opinion surveys, poverty, educational attainment, health care, 
crime and unemployment are worse than they were before the 
massive growth in spending after the 1960s. In my view it defies 
logic to argue that because past spending has produced the 
deterioration of these standards we therefore should have spent 
more.
<P>
	I know I am running out of time but I have just one last page. I 
assure the House that I know the arguments on the other side. Some 
are good but most involve rhetoric and wishful thinking.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8379"> 8379 </A></B>
<P>
	I admit that I may be wrong about the merit of large 
government. It is for this reason that I think we need a national 
debate on this issue. What a shame that the 1997 budget did not 
set the framework for such a debate during the upcoming election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have worked with the member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound over three years now, as both of us are 
members of the finance committee. We may not agree on 
everything. However, the member for Capilano-Howe Sound 
always has been fair and always has been prepared to give credit 
where credit is due. He has done so consistently through the last 
three budgets, in which I know he took a great interest and. He 
spent a great deal of time sharing his views with us about what the 
government should do and responding to what it had done on each 
occasion.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	His colleagues talk a great deal about doing politics differently. 
As he prepares to leave the House, on behalf of the Minister of 
Finance, myself and many of my colleagues, I want to say the 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound is truly one who has done 
politics differently in the House. I compliment him for it. He will 
be missed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is getting me into a lot of 
trouble with my party, which is not a very nice thing to do. 
However, you will have noticed that when I presented the summary 
of my experiences over the last four years I did come down very 
hard on the shortcomings of the policies. There is a clear difference 
in vision between the Liberal Party, the Reform Party and other 
parties on the right.
<P>
	This should be emphasized and made clear in discussion and 
should be on the level of historic tax experience and not just hand 
waving.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I hate to get involved in this lovefest between the Liberals 
and the Reform Party. However, the parliamentary secretary is 
correct that the member for Capilano-Howe Sound has done 
things differently in the House and that is certainly to his credit.
<P>
	One thing he said in his opening remarks bears repeating. I 
would ask him to shuffle his notes a little bit and share with us 
again his comments about how basically the Reform Party policy 
of a few years ago has been implemented by the government. It is 
worth noting from the point of view of most Canadians that the 
government is a party of the right and does share a number of the 
viewpoints of the Reform Party. It is incumbent on all of us to get it 
right.
<P>
	If the member would care to share with us again his comment 
about the government implementing Reform policy, we would all 
appreciate it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the division was quite clear 
during the election campaign and the people spoke clearly. One 
party said that it could not go on adding to the debt the way it had 
happened in the preceding 15 years. Two governments and two 
different parties had engaged in this spendthrift policy. In effect, 
the government has cut program spending, as Reform had 
proposed. We had proposed reducing interprovincial transfers. 
Instead it cut transfers for health, education and welfare which we 
had not proposed.
<P>
	There are a large number of parallels but also some significant 
differences. The point I am trying to emphasize, which came out 
clearly in the numbers I gave, is that the deficit had to be brought 
under control. That was done. The government should be given 
credit for it. It did not do it right and I outlined why it was not done 
right and what the consequences of it were.
<P>
	I believe my statement is basically correct. I am proud that 
because we had this agenda, we have helped prepare the way for the 
Liberal government to do what is right for Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am most anxious to participate in the debate on the 
Liberal budget.
<P>
	I must say at the outset that the Liberal budget can best be 
described as an example of sleight of hand at its finest. The budget 
is sprinkled full of little goodies, but it is simply an attempt to 
conceal the Liberals' real record. And what a record it is.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Unemployment and bankruptcies are at record levels. Taxes are 
at record levels. Funding for health care and education has been 
slashed to record lows. We are approaching a record national debt 
level of $600 billion, with debt servicing costs reaching a record 
$50 billion a year.
<P>
	The Liberals like to congratulate themselves on lowering the 
deficit, but it was done on the backs of Canadian taxpayers, 
students trying to get an education and Canadians who have 
suffered under health care cutbacks. That is the record of this 
Liberal government.
<P>
	Let us not forget how Liberal taxation policies have affected the 
pensions of seniors and will continue to affect the retirement plans 
of seniors.
<P>
	The Liberals have brought in 36 new tax measures and raised tax 
revenues by a record $24 billion. The deficit has fallen by $33 
billion since 1993 and, therefore, a full 92 per cent of the reduction 
in the deficit is a result of Liberal higher taxation revenues. That is 
nothing to be proud of. Anyone can pull that golden handle and 
wrench more dollars out of Canadian taxpayers. Even this Liberal 
government can do that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8380"> 8380 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has not reduced its spending significantly. It 
has not made government more efficient, as the Reform Party has 
cited. It has battled the deficit by squeezing Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	This is not the only thing Liberals are good at. They are good at 
cutting transfer payments in support of health care and education to 
achieve a reduction in the deficit. That is not what the Reform Party 
wants to do. Reformers want to give Canadians a tax break. We 
want to restore funding to education and health care. At the same 
time, we want to cut $15 billion from the operation of government. 
That is where the big blood is.
<P>
	The Liberals have battled the deficit by squeezing Canadian 
taxpayers. That is the only thing they are good at, shaking the 
money tree known as the Canadian taxpayer. The taxpayer is the 
Liberals' magic cash register. When they need more money for 
bigger government, bigger bureaucracy, bigger payments and 
bigger programs they dip into their cash register, the pockets of 
hard working Canadians.
<P>
	The average Canadian family has seen its disposable household 
income shrink by $3,000 under the Liberal government. Every 
reputable economist in the country will testify to that, but the 
Liberals are in denial. Canadian families will testify that they have 
$3,000 less to spend to put food on the table, to put clothes on their 
kids' backs, to pay their medicare premiums and to provide the 
necessities of life. What kind of a record is that?
<P>
	Do we know who does not have to worry about getting a job 
when the Liberals are in power? Liberal party fundraisers, former 
candidates, former Liberal provincial leaders and past party 
presidents. They do not have to worry about what the government 
is doing because they are getting jobs, while 1.5 million Canadians 
who do not hold Liberal memberships are looking for jobs.
<P>
	The government has appointed hundreds of party faithful to 
various boards, agencies and commissions; appointments which 
come with obscene paycheques and obscene perks. That is being 
done despite the fact that the Liberal red ink book talks about 
making appointments based on merit. It seems that the only merit 
which is required is the $10 for a Liberal membership.
<P>
	Why am I even referring to this flawed Liberal election 
document? Nobody believes it any more, not even the Liberals. 
They have stopped quoting from it because they were caught so 
badly in the big GST lie. There are so many broken promises in it 
they do not even dare use it any more. It is too bad, I would love to 
see the Liberals bring that out when they go to the election that is 
coming soon. They can bring out that red book and talk about all 
the promises they have kept and we will talk about the promises 
they have not kept.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals red book has proved one thing only. It is not worth 
the paper it is written on. This red book will continue to give the 
Liberals headaches in the 1997 election as they twist, turn, flip and 
flop their policies when the policy winds change. And, Mr. 
Speaker, in case you did not know, Liberal philosophy and policy 
do change. They say ``these are my policies, if you don't like them 
give me a little while and I'll come up with some new ones''.
<P>
	I would like to return to the chronic problem of the 1.5 million 
Canadians who are unemployed. The Liberals do not believe us 
when we say tax cuts create jobs. Maybe they will believe evidence 
from some non-partisan sources. The Cato Institute in Washington 
studied 10 tax cutting states and 10 tax hiking states between 1990 
and 1995. These are figures that they will not want to listen to but, 
Mr. Speaker, I know you will want to hear this.
<P>
	This study discovered that the tax cutting states created nearly 
two million net new jobs. The 10 tax hiking states created zero net 
new jobs. Furthermore, the economies of the tax cutting states grew 
22 per cent faster than those of states which continued to raise 
taxes. Michigan was one of the states in that study that cut 
taxes-maybe the Liberals should know this-15 times since 1991 
and brought the state back from economic ruin. Now it has an 
unemployment rate that is at its lowest since the 1960s.
<P>
	In the Reform's fresh start program we argue that taxes kill jobs. 
We argue that tax relief creates jobs. Every single economic think 
tank in the country, perhaps in the world, knows and agrees that 
taxes kill jobs. Taxation kills jobs.
<P>
	Yet this government has just imposed a $10 billion payroll tax on 
Canadian businesses and Canadian workers. That defies logic. 
When every economic think tank in the country agrees that taxes 
kill jobs except for the socialist economic think tanks that the 
Liberals call on from time to time for their policies, and the NDP as 
well. And every same thinking economic think tank knows and 
confirms that taxes kill jobs.
<P>
	It is because of these taxation policies that we have 1.5 million 
people unemployed. It has killed the jobs and it has ripped the heart 
out of our social programs of which these Liberals are so proud. 
They have cut $7.5 billion from health care and education. No 
matter what little crumbs they through out in this budget, let us not 
forget that they are the ones who have cut the $7.5 billion from 
health care and education.
<P>
	Reform Party policies in the fresh start program make sense to 
Canadians because they come from Canadians. We listen to 
Canadians, not like the Liberals who listen to their well-heeled 
back room advisers. This budget is smoke and mirrors. It is sleight 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8381"> 8381 </A></B>
<P>
of hand at its finest. There is no way that our party and average 
Canadians will accept it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to enter into the debate on what the individual who has just spoken 
and represents the third party said.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	In the next election there is going to be a significant amount of 
discussion as to what we do as country in the new millennium. Part 
of that discussion is factually correct, as the previous speaker from 
the Reform Party suggested, as to what we do with this major 
surplus that will be achieved because of the good fiscal 
management of the government.
<P>
	In that discussion there are going to be a number of items. One is 
Reformers in their platform have suggested that they are going to 
make government smaller. They are suggesting some $15 billion in 
cuts to the present government apparatus. My understanding in that 
scenario is the Reform Party will have to cut some 80,000 to 85,000 
public service jobs in order to achieve what it perceives as small, 
efficient government.
<P>
	We all know and the polls have showed continuously that 
Canadians feel very strongly about their social programs, feel very 
strongly about the ability to deliver those programs. I would like to 
ask the member if he would comment on that particular item, and 
while he is at it I would like to have him answer this for me.
<P>
	Does the hon. member believe it is good economics for 
governments to give across the board tax cuts, like Ontario has, to 
the tune of so far 15 per cent in personal income tax, going up to 30 
per cent of income tax reduction, which is a reduction in revenue of 
$4.9 billion when they are running a $10 billion deficit? That 
analysis is pretty easy if we picture the fact that this year they have 
had to cut $6 billion worth of services in Ontario. That is $6 billion 
of services that relate to education, relate to health, relate to 
transfers to municipalities, which of course have turned things 
upside down in the province of Ontario.
<P>
	Would the member explain to me the whole issue of tax cuts 
when we need those revenues and when we still have a major 
deficit and whether he agrees or disagrees, and with his numbers as 
they relate to the 80,000 cuts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it would be hard to get the 
message on tax cuts across to this Liberal member in the next five 
minutes. They have not learned anything in three and a half years 
from us, so five minutes is not going to solve that problem.
<P>
	The hon. member did talk about cutting the size of government. 
The Liberals of course believe that big is better. There is no doubt 
about that. They have displayed that.
<P>
	Reformers, on the other hand, would prefer to work with a lean 
and mean government, no waste. The problem with this Liberal 
Party is it believes in this big bureaucracy. We want to be lean.
<P>
	The fact is we want to cut spending. We want to cut the 
government waste. There is about $15 billion a year in government 
waste because of this big government policy that the Liberals are so 
proud of.
<P>
	The hon. member did not read our fresh start. We are going to 
put $4 billion back into health care and education. The Liberals 
ripped the heart out of those programs to the tune of $7.5 billion.
<P>
	How could the hon. member have the audacity to stand up and 
say that it is the Reformers who are going to hurt health care and 
education when his very government has ripped $7.5 billion out of 
health care and education? How does he explain that to people in 
my town who go to the hospital and find a third of the beds closed 
and line-ups for operations? How does he explain that to students 
who cannot afford tuitions because of the cutbacks that this Liberal 
government has made in education?
<P>
	That is hypocritical. That is hypocrisy at its finest, absolute 
hypocrisy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this motion and in support of the 
1997-98 federal budget. This budget continues the course set on 
October 25, 1993 when Canadians voted for change in the last 
federal election. It provides the tools necessary to help keep 
Canada the best country in the world.
<P>
	When the Liberal government was elected in 1993 we had three 
choices. Two were easy. The third was difficult.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The first choice we had was to continue spending without any 
concern for the future, as the past Conservative government did. In 
nine years the Conservatives nearly tripled the debt and left us with 
a deficit of nearly $45 billion.
<P>
	It would have been easy in the short term to give everyone all 
they wanted, to add to the deficit and debt and to let someone else 
deal with the problem, just as the Reform Party now is proposing 
on the CPP issue. That would have been irresponsible and it would 
have placed Canada's future and our sovereignty at risk.
<P>
	The second easy choice would have been to make deficit 
elimination our only goal, as it used to be the Reform Party's. In 
doing so we could have easily abandoned the sick, the elderly, 
those most vulnerable and possibly eliminated the deficit much 
faster.
<P>
	It would have also been irresponsible because it would have 
caused pain by ignoring the millions of Canadians who rely on the 
federal government for their pensions, for health care, for post-sec-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8382"> 8382 </A></B>
<P>
ondary education and for the countless government services 
provided each and every day.
<P>
	Instead, Liberals opted for a third choice, one that was 
challenging, difficult and required imagination, innovation and 
responsibility. This third choice was to reduce the deficit while 
preserving social programs.
<P>
	We know that the efforts initiated by the Liberal government 
have been difficult. They have meant fewer public servant 
positions. They have required new ways of doing business in 
government and they have called for sacrifice.
<P>
	In doing so, we are admired around the world for the way we 
have turned our federal budget around and for ensuring that those 
most vulnerable are cared for which is, after all, the reason we are 
the best country in the world.
<P>
	The finance minister visited Guelph on November 12, 1996. In 
doing so, he participated in a call-in program on our local radio 
station, CJOY. He met with reporters from the Guelph <I>Mercury</I> and 
the Guelph <I>Tribune</I> and his visit to Guelph must have had 
enormous impact on him because this is truly a 
Guelph-Wellington budget.
<P>
	When the minister announced $800 million for the new Canada 
Foundation for Innovation, he was speaking directly to the 
researchers and administration of the University of Guelph.
<P>
	He spoke directly to President Mordechai Rozanski, Larry 
Milligan and others who asked me to help them in their work. Our 
commitment to fund research infrastructure will ensure that the 
place of the University of Guelph as the finest post-secondary 
education facility in Canada will not be challenged.
<P>
	When the budget promotes donations to charitable organizations 
it speaks directly to Morris Twist of the United Way social planning 
council, to Lindsay Kennedy of the Wellington County literacy 
council and to Jassy Narayan of Onward Willow.
<P>
	It encourages the thousands of volunteers who help make 
Guelph-Wellington the best community in Canada and it makes 
the responsibility of the professionals who run social service 
agencies, clubs and foundations a little easier.
<P>
	When the budget provides more funding for infrastructure, it 
responds to a resolution passed on February 3, 1997 by Guelph city 
council asking for the continuation of this important initiative.
<P>
	In providing more assistance for people with disabilities, it is in 
direct response to the recommendations and suggestions offered by 
groups and individuals in Guelph-Wellington to the task force 
chaired by our colleague from Fredericton-York-Sunbury.
<P>
	In promoting trade, this federal budget has said to business 
leaders in Guelph-Wellinton like James Watson  of Armtec, Wolf 
Haessler of Skyjack and Hock Choong of Semex that others will be 
allowed to benefit from Team Canada as they have.
<P>
	I have been allowed a number of opportunities, especially as 
chair of the national Liberal caucus committee on economic 
development, to speak to the finance minister on priorities for the 
people of Guelph-Wellington.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	In response to a survey I sent out in December 1994, my 
constituents identified three areas of importance for federal 
spending: health, social services and youth. When the finance 
minister presented his budget on February 18 he spoke to those 
priorities.
<P>
	We have encouraged our young people through initiatives like 
the youth employment strategy and in helping parents and students 
to cope with the rising costs of post-secondary education to obtain 
the experience and education necessary in today's changing 
workforce. By assisting young people to obtain a post-secondary 
degree we are also helping the people of Guelph-Wellington 
whose jobs are dependent upon a growing student population.
<P>
	In providing $300 million over three years to assist efforts to 
find new and better ways to meet Canada's health care needs we are 
acknowledging the many people in Guelph-Wellington who have 
asked us to make health care a priority. I am pleased that a health 
transition fund will provide funding for projects that could include 
home care services. If this fund means that people can stay in their 
homes longer then it will mean much for the elderly and the sick in 
Guelph-Wellington and all across Canada.
<P>
	In developing the new Canada child tax benefit, we are not 
abandoning the social safety net for those children and their parents 
who need our help the most. These are exactly the kinds of federal 
spending priorities that have been demanded by the people of 
Guelph-Wellington; all of this while never wavering from our 
deficit reduction targets.
<P>
	There are those who are critical of this budget. They spoke 
earlier. Let them come to Guelph-Wellington to address our 
university researchers and tell them that they are opposed to the 
Canada Foundation for Innovation. Let them visit our charities and 
tell our volunteers that they are opposed to support for charitable 
giving and let them respond to the thousands of 
Guelph-Wellington residents who told me that health care is 
important. Let them say to those people that they are opposed to 
improving Canada's health care system. Let them meet our 
students and their parents and say that they are opposed to 
investing in post secondary education, and let them tell our citizens 
with disabilities that they are opposed to our help.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8383"> 8383 </A></B>
<P>
	This budget does stay the course. In doing so it says that the 
hard work, the sacrifices and the reductions that Canadians have 
made since October 1993 were not lost. In fact, this is a budget 
of hope and it is a budget for a stronger and brighter future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I accept the invitation of my colleague for 
Guelph-Wellington.
<P>
	If she really wants us to, we will go to her riding to meet the 
people, the researchers, the people affected by poverty or 
unemployment, and we will explain to them as follows: in the past 
three years and a half, the Liberal government has cut $4.5 billion 
in transfer payments to the provinces to assist with their welfare, 
education and health programs. Her government has also 
jeopardized the income security system in Canada, the health 
system, and part of the research activities.
<P>
	Yes, we accept her invitation, and we will go and tell her 
constituents in Guelph-Wellington the truth, no offence meant to 
my colleague, as I do respect her abilities.
<P>
	I would also like to challenge what she has said about the $800 
million foundation. Let them stop treating us like imbeciles. The 
$800 million is $800 million for the foundation, but new R &amp; D 
investments represent $180 million yearly, and $180 million is 
very little in damage control by the federal government, after it has 
made hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts, $500 million in R &amp; D 
alone. Part of the $4.5 billion in the Canada social transfer went for 
funding research activities and infrastructures.
<P>
	They have made cuts here, and now they are offering a little 
treat, a little band-aid, a little ointment on the huge gaping wound 
they themselves have caused. And they are patting themselves on 
the back for it.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Yes, we will go to your riding to explain that to your fellow 
citizens, as we have been explaining it ever since you brought down 
this clown's budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to have the 
opportunity to respond.
<P>
	I will welcome my colleague into my riding. He needs to come 
to my riding to tell the people of Guelph-Wellington and the rest 
of Canada why he as a Bloc member wants to break up Canada. He 
needs to explain why he has plunged Quebec into instability. He 
needs to tell the people of Guelph-Wellington why we have lost 
jobs in Canada. It is because of the instability and fear the Bloc has 
put into the Canadian and Quebec people.
<P>
	I would welcome this member into my area, let me tell you, Mr. 
Speaker. Furthermore when his past leader, Mr. Bouchard, 
travelled on taxpayers' money to promote separatism, my 
community of Guelph-Wellington wrote petitions and stopped 
Mr. Bouchard from travelling on taxpayers' money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an interesting debate but unfortunately it does not 
help the young people of Canada attend university and other 
post-secondary educational institutions.
<P>
	The member for Guelph-Wellington talked about the 
innovation funding going to Guelph. I certainly support that 
funding just as I would support it to the University of 
Saskatchewan or to other institutions.
<P>
	Like the member from the Bloc who spoke earlier and like many 
people in Canada, I too am aware that on the one hand billions of 
dollars have been taken out of education and health care funding by 
the government. As a result the provincial governments and the 
institutions have had to raise tuition fees and have changed the 
student loans program to the extent that only the wealthy are able to 
attend school.
<P>
	The member talked about the innovation funding at the 
university yet she is allowing the government to remove the 
funding that caused the Government of Ontario to raise tuition fees 
again this year by up to 20 per cent. If the students cannot go to the 
universities, what good is the funding for research?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first like to point out 
to my hon. colleague, whom I like very much, that his own premier 
in Saskatchewan who is also a member of the NDP, has had to get 
Saskatchewan's finances in order. It seems to me all provinces have 
finally realized that Canadians really do understand that we do 
have to live within our means but we also have to choose priorities 
with vision. Clearly in this budget that is exactly what has 
happened.
<P>
	Finally, after being elected in 1993 and hitting a financial wall 
because of where we were brought to, we are now only seeing a 
little bit of movement. We are able to begin putting money into 
health care which this budget is doing, into post-secondary 
education which this budget is doing, and into mechanisms like the 
RESPs. Parents can use those and then transfer them back into their 
RRSPs if they wish. There are a number of mechanisms in the 
budget.
<P>
	I know my hon. colleague being the fine gentleman that he is and 
the caring spirit that he has would be appreciative of-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate, the hon. member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course as Liberals we would have much  preferred not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8384"> 8384 </A></B>
<P>
to tackle the deficit and concentrate on social programs. Of course 
as Liberals we would have much preferred to keep the research 
budget as it was. Of course as Liberals we would have preferred to 
beef up social programs. However, we were faced with a deficit of 
over $44 billion that was crippling the country and making it 
bankrupt.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	All Canadians regardless of their political stripe, regardless of 
their ideology recognized that something had to be done. This is 
why today people have so much respect for the Minister of Finance 
and the Prime Minister for having set the direction toward 
balancing our finances and for having reduced the deficit of $44 
billion by 57 per cent over the last three years. Today we can see 
daylight. Our finances are getting back into shape and we are now 
getting back to our roots as Liberals and we are looking at social 
programs again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to concentrate on two programs especially dear to 
my heart. First, I would like to talk about persons with disabilities. 
With my colleague Andy Scott, whom I congratulate sincerely on 
his extraordinary work, I had the privilege of participating in a 
working group on persons with disabilities. Because of this group, 
we based our approach on a broader perspective in society for 
persons with disabilities, in terms of independent living and access 
to work. Of the measures tabled by the Minister of Finance, some 
seem pretty basic to us, but to people with disabilities, they are 
vital to their independence.
<P>
	There are tax credits of 20 per cent for vehicle conversion, and 
50 per cent for the installation of an air conditioning unit vital to a 
person's ability to breathe and carry on his or her life. There are 
also the costs of adapting a residence, of assistants for those with 
severe handicaps, of customs duties, which are now eliminated for 
goods sent for people with handicaps really needing them.
<P>
	These measures include an opportunities fund of $30 million 
annually to ensure that the disabled are entitled to financial and 
personal freedom and to full citizenship.
<P>
	I know our detractors will say that $30 million annually is 
peanuts. It is, however, a big step forward, a beginning. It is a new 
start given that, in the past, we could not afford this luxury. Now, as 
we see some balance in our finances, our thoughts turn first to 
people with disabilities, children in poverty, research, innovation 
and students-all needing our support.
<P>
	The second measure I wish to talk about is our research and 
development program. There is no reason to hide the fact, Canada 
has fallen far behind the other countries in the OECD in terms of 
research and development. If we look at the statistics, it is no secret  
that Germany, England, France, the United States and Japan are far 
ahead of us in this area.
<P>
	This budget at least gives us a start. It shows the way the 
government wants to go in the future. It is all very well for the 
opposition to say that $180 million a year is nothing. However, the 
$180 million will be spent in partnership with private enterprise, 
with universities and research institutions so that it will be doubled 
each year.
<P>
	It has been said that we will be able to set up a research fund of 
$2 billion in five years. They say this research fund is paltry. 
However, according to Dr. Simard, the rector of the University of 
Montreal, it is the response they were waiting for. According to Dr. 
Shapiro, the president of McGill University, it will be of significant 
help in the area of university research.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A few weeks ago I had the privilege of spending some hours at 
the Montreal Neurological Institute, the famous institute founded 
by Dr. Wilder Penfield. There I could sit with Dr. Murphy and Dr. 
McPherson and Dr. Baxter and find out how much they crave for 
research funds. Our research funding has been cut. We had no 
choice. Now we must restore it. We must give the young scientists 
who crave funding for grants a chance to shine again. We have in 
Canada among our young research scientists the most brilliant in 
the world.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	I visited the Montreal Neurological Institute and found that what 
they are working on today is at the very forefront of progress in 
medical research. They want to continue their work, to perfect it. 
The only way they will perfect it, because funding is always a 
problem, is to seek partnerships.
<P>
	In the past, in their traditional sense, universities never sought 
out private enterprise but today the university system is joining 
with private enterprise. The Montreal Neurological Institute is 
going to the Royal Bank for a partnership.
<P>
	The funds which the government is extending will give a sense 
of direction, a sense of leadership that we want to restore our 
funding in research. We want to restore our funding in medical 
research, in environmental research, in research in high 
technology.
<P>
	I salute the government for having taken this very forward step. I 
know we need more research grants, more funding, but it will only 
happen if we restore our finances first. Within the next few years, 
once we have a budget deficit of $9 billion or less, we will be able 
to fund research even more.
<P>
	The budget will restore the faith of many people, many small <I>l</I> 
liberals who want government to go back to its roots and fund 
social programs. I am extremely proud that the government has 
taken that route. Henceforth, all  the funding that we will be able to 
spare will be geared toward programs to help those who are most in 
need.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8385"> 8385 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is a Liberal budget. One that points the way to the future for 
those who need us most. I am very proud of this budget, and I 
strongly support the direction taken by the Minister of Finance. My 
colleagues and I will push for continued movement in this 
direction, for a return to our Liberal roots and for remembrance of 
those who need us most.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MATHIEUDACOSTAAWARD">MATHIEU DA COSTA AWARD</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to a constituent in my riding of Kitchener, Ontario, 
Marie France Paré.
<P>
	Miss Paré, from École Cardinal-Léger, had the honour of 
receiving the Mathieu Da Costa award for elementary French 
writing. This award is relatively new and honours young people 
who have illustrated through the arts the cultural diversity in our 
society.
<P>
	Miss Paré was recognized for her essay on Harriet Tubman. Her 
essay brings to light this heroic individual and her contributions to 
society. It also identifies the many cultures that are part of our 
Canadian history.
<P>
	Her writing skill coupled with her insightfulness brings to our 
attention the diverse beginnings of Canadian society.
<P>
	Like Mathieu Da Costa, Miss Paré illustrates the significant 
impact people from all cultures have had and will have on this 
country. I commend her and all the award recipients for bringing to 
light the contributions of all cultures to our nation.
<P>
	I wish to congratulate Miss Paré for this special award and wish 
her all the best in her future endeavours.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is health care platform progress note number two on 
the state of our health care.
<P>
	In my hometown of Victoria 160 people are on waiting lists for 
radiation therapy. Of those people, 60 per cent are there for breast 
cancer, 40 per cent are there for prostate cancer. The wait with 
respect to breast cancer can be as long as 14 weeks. The response of 
the provincial government has been to close down the  expansion of 
the cancer clinic. As well it is sending people to the United States.
<P>
	In British Columbia waiting lists for cardiac surgery went from 
385 in March to 500 in December.
<P>
	This government has just put $300 million into health care after 
ripping out and eviscerating $7 billion in transfer payments to the 
provinces.
<P>

	It is this political party that continues to label itself the white

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENT">UNEMPLOYMENT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance yesterday stated that he no longer 
believed that the so-called natural rate of unemployment in Canada 
was as high as 8 per cent. This is a dramatic change for the Liberal 
government which has repeatedly stated that it would not reduce 
unemployment below 8 per cent because of the dangers of 
inflation.
<P>
	In doing so, the Liberals had attached themselves to the 
anti-inflationary policies followed by the Bank of Canada which 
the Liberals had attacked while in opposition. Those policies are 
responsible for the size of Canada's public debt and the fact that 
unemployment has remained above 9 per cent since the so-called 
end of the last recession.
<P>
	As the election approaches the Liberals want to wash their hands 
of this terrible record on jobs by disowning the theory of the natural 
rate of unemployment. But the 1.5 million unemployed Canadians 
want to see in writing from the Minister of Finance that he will not 
let the Bank of Canada stand in the way of job creation.

Meredith Doyle Junior Ladies Curling Team from Truro, Nova 
Scotia which became the national champions of junior ladies 
curling last Sunday in Manitoba.
<P>
	I salute Meredith Doyle, Beth Roach, Candace MacLean and 
Tara Hamer for a terrific win against the Quebec team in the 
nationally televised games. Their competitive spirit, determination 
and commitment to excellence demonstrated their worthiness to 
advance to the world junior championships. They will be great

	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Moncton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Thursday movers and shakers in the international music industry 
flocked to Moncton to take in some of Canada's most vibrant 
music. For four days Moncton whooped it up. Blues, pops, fiddle 
music, it was all there at the East Coast Music Awards.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We celebrated our down home music, in both official languages. 
It was just great.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Demonstrating its cutting edge flare, organizers put the 
extravaganza on the Internet. Between 10,000 and 12,000 people 
visited the site every hour.
<P>
	As we are all aware, Monctonians are held in high esteem for 
their honesty. In all honesty I can say that the music awards were 
superb.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My congratulations to all those who worked so hard to make this 
event a huge success.

	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the 
Minister of Finance for presenting this House and this nation once 
again with a sound and responsible federal budget.
<P>
	Coming from a large, predominately rural constituency, the 
budget measures that will help rural Canada are of particular 
interest to me, for example the expansion of the community access 
program by about $30 million, the $50 million equity infusion into 
the BDC which will lever up to $250 million in new loans for 
tourism, and the Farm Credit Corporation will be provided with an 
additional $50 million.
<P>
	Rural areas will also benefit from the funds provided in this 
budget through the extension of the infrastructure program, youth 
employment initiatives, small business enhancements and 
innovation.
<P>
	The minister recognizes that strength in rural Canada is vital to 
our national well-being.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf 
of the Bloc Quebecois, I want to note the passing, yesterday, at the 
age of 92, of one the most prominent figures of modern China: 
Deng Xiaoping.
<P>
	This political figure ruled a country with a population of more 
than one billion for some 15 years. Deng Xiaoping's achievements 
include the decollectivization of rural communities, one of the 
most painful legacies of communism. He also took on the 
challenge of introducing a degree of economic liberalization, 
without any political liberalization however.
<P>
	Sadly, Deng Xiaoping leaves behind him the memory of the 
Tiananmen Square massacre and systemic repression.
<P>
	On behalf of our caucus, I would like to extend our condolences 
to his family, and express the hope that, one day, the Chinese 
people will achieve democracy.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister of agriculture has concocted a strange 
brew known as the barley plebiscite soup.
<P>
	His recipe for democracy goes something like this. Take secret 
polls and manipulate vigorously. Mix the debate that has been 
simmering for over three years and then bring to a boil. Blend with 
a fundamentally flawed question that ignores the wishes of a 
majority of farmers. Add a trace of number coded mail-in ballots. 
Cover up for two weeks and serve with a healthy dose of cynicism.
<P>
	Clearly the minister's recipe serves only one, himself.
<P>
	Farmers in western Canada believe they are being denied 
scrutineers who would ensure the accuracy and integrity of the vote 
and avoid the perception of bias.
<P>
	If the Liberals try to deny farmers one of the most basic 
fundamental rights of democracy by not allowing a proper 
scrutineering process it will be the minister and his fellow Liberals 
who will be roasted in the next election.

	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 1997 
budget announced the increase of the current child  tax benefit to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8387"> 8387 </A></B>
<P>
$6.1 billion. Over 1.4 million low Canadian families, about 2.5 
million children, will see an increase in federal child benefit 
payments by July 1998.
<P>
	Through the national child benefit system we can ensure that 
children in Canada live a healthy and happy life.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The provinces can now provide more efficient services and 
programs to low income families by investing more in child care as 
well as dental care and drug benefits for children.
<P>
	The 1997 budget affirms our government's commitment to 
children. Canadian values and priorities require us to invest in our 
children. Our work will be done only when all children go to bed 
with a smile on their face.

Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues from Parry 
Sound-Muskoka, Vancouver East and Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis 
for their contribution to the government's task force on disability 
issues. I would also like to thank the observers, the working groups 
and the more than 2,000 Canadians who put their faith in the task 
force. Their confidence inspired our work.
<P>
	Tuesday's budget demonstrated this government's renewed 
commitment to Canadians with disabilities. The measures dealing 
with the cost of disability and taxation as well as the new 
opportunities fund are a first step in recognizing persons with 
disabilities as equal citizens who aspire to the same quality of life 
as all Canadians.
<P>
	We are witnessing a new role for the federal government in this 
area and I am pleased that the work of the task has made a 
difference. We are in a better position than we were a year ago and I 
want to encourage the government to continue to offer Canadians 
with disabilities confidence, peace of mind and opportunities for 
their future.

Labour has just announced, on behalf of his colleague, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development, that $850,000 has been 
awarded to the new MDF board plant in the Saguenay town of La 
Baie.
<P>
	Following the opening of the plant, this financial assistance 
drawn directly from the transition job fund will create 98 
permanent full time jobs as well as 245 indirect jobs in the region. 
In addition, construction of the plant itself will generate 
employment for 145 workers. This project, viewed as a priority for 
the economic development of the region, will be carried out in 
partnership with Uniboard Canada, which will provide the funding 
required to complete this $128 million project.
<P>
	We are proud to be directly associated with this project, which 
will create permanent jobs in this high growth sector in the

December 1982, Vietnam became one of the 127 countries that 
signed the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. By signing this covenant, Vietnam agreed to comply with 
certain international standards. However, that country is violating, 
with full impunity, the rights of Tran Trieu Quan, as guaranteed 
under that treaty.
<P>
	Since the representations made by the government did not secure 
Mr. Tran's freedom on humanitarian grounds, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs must now show political courage and confront the 
Vietnamese government, by invoking international law.
<P>
	Given that the Vietnamese courts seriously violated the 
international standards outlined in the 1966 covenant, Canada has a 
right to stand up for Mr. Tran.
<P>
	Why has the Canadian government not yet lodged an official 
protest, and what is it waiting for?

Klaus, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic.
<P>
	Vaclav Klaus deserves the highest praise for three outstanding 
achievements in his life. First, when his native country was ruled 
with an iron fist by a communist regime, he had the courage to 
advocate a democratic free society and economy for his country. 
Second, he persuaded the people of his country of the merit of his 
ideological vision and to elect him prime minister. Third, against 
strong opposition from special interests he enacted free market 
reforms, set free the creative energies of the Czech people and 
made his country the most prosperous of the former Soviet Bloc.

	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
government is firmly committed to the Canada Health Act. The 
budget reaffirmed this commitment. It introduced targeted 
measures to ensure that Canadians will continue to enjoy the best 
health care system in the world.
<P>
	We announced the creation of the health transition fund to help 
provinces assess new and better ways to provide health services. 
One hundred and fifty million dollars will be allocated to provinces 
on a per capita basis over a three year period.
<P>
	The budget also provided $50 million for a Canada health 
information system. This is a co-ordinated national information 
system that will save many lives because health care workers 
across the country will have the right information at the right time.
<P>
	Finally, we increased funding to two existing programs, the 
community action program for children and the Canada prenatal 
nutrition program. By taking quick and decisive action on the 
report of the national forum on health, this government has once 
again demonstrated its ongoing commitment to Canada's health 
care system, one of the pillars of Canadian society.

	<B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Quebec Minister of Finance just gave an eloquent 
demonstration of his inability to give priority to the public interest 
over his separatist obsession.
<P>
	Let me explain a few things about the budget. The fact is that 
Quebec receives 31 per cent of all federal transfers, while 
accounting for only 25 per cent of Canada's population. It also 
receives 46 per cent of equalization payments, through 
government-to-government transfers.
<P>
	Let us set the record straight. The $1.2 billion reduction in 
transfer payments to Quebec will not have to be absorbed this year 
alone; rather, it will be spread over a five-year period.
<P>
	Separatists should stop looking for scapegoats and make a 
commitment, as we did, to regain control over public finances and 
get the economy back on track.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
fall, the Minister of Foreign Affairs sent a memo to  diplomatic 
missions accredited with Canada, demanding that diplomats 
inform the department of any meeting with provincial ministers or 
officials, here and abroad.
<P>
	In a democratic country such as Canada, it is totally 
unacceptable for the federal government to monitor contacts 
between officials representing foreign countries and those 
representing Quebec. Indeed, while our province is not named in 
the memo, it is obviously the one that is targeted.
<P>
	How can the federal government justify such behaviour? Would 
the Liberals go so far as to take sanctions against countries that 
would not comply with their directive?
<P>
	This form of intimidation is not to Canada's credit. Does Ottawa 
really believe that it will curb the legitimate aspirations of the 
people of Quebec and disturb the lucidity of the international 
community regarding the Quebec issue? If so, it is mistaken.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on February 7 this House demonstrated its wisdom and 
compassion when it unanimously adopted Motion No. 78.
<P>
	This motion calls on the government to strengthen the impaired 
driving sections of the Criminal Code in order to more 
appropriately punish drunk drivers and to deter others who may 
consider getting behind the wheel while impaired.
<P>
	I brought this motion forward after a tragic driving accident that 
claimed the lives of three family members in my community. 
Impaired driving is the number one criminal cause of death and 
injury in Canada.
<P>
	My research and involvement with anti-drunk driving groups has 
opened my eyes to the impaired driving epidemic in this country. 
On average four people per day are killed by drunk drivers and over 
three hundred are injured. This must stop. It is time the government 
stopped treating impaired driving as simply another social ill.
<P>
	I urge this House and the government to respect the wishes of 
this House and act quickly on the principles of Motion No. 78 so 
we can make our roadways and neighbourhoods safe again.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister explained to the media his 
concept of federalism, a very unusual concept that is quite at odds 
with last year's speech from the throne.
<P>
	He told us that, if the federal government spends its time 
invading provincial areas of jurisdiction, it is for their own good. 
The Canadian government, he said, has always helped set up new 
initiatives. It helps the provinces prepare programs, and then it 
withdraws. The Prime Minister even added, and I quote: ``We 
negotiate with standards. Sometimes, we move ahead, then there 
are adjustments, but social progress must be achieved''. This is a 
fine example of paternalistic federalism.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Finance whether he realizes that the budget 
he has brought down reflects the policy denounced by the 
provinces that allows the federal government to interfere in areas 
of provincial jurisdiction. The federal government contributes a bit 
of money, it sets national standards, imposes its priorities, forces 
the provinces to comply and then withdraws, leaving the provinces 
with responsibility for coming up with the money to finance its big 
projects and the unpleasant task of making cuts.
<P>
	Is this the Minister of Finance's new federalism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I read with interest the 
statement made yesterday by the Prime Minister, who was 
commenting on the budget brought down by the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	What we saw, and I would like to confirm this today in the 
House, should there be any ambiguity whatsoever, is the 
government's commitment to the national child benefit, which is 
an ongoing benefit. It is an ongoing benefit from our government to 
assist children in low income families.
<P>
	This is not a program one starts up and then pulls out of. It is a 
program we have developed in partnership with the provinces that 
is perfectly compatible with the Government of Quebec's family 
policy.
<P>
	As far as the national child benefit is concerned, I can reassure 
you that this is an ongoing commitment on the part of the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we feel better already with such a promise. We have never 
heard this in the past. It is quite new.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Is it the same as the GST?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> The Minister of Finance claims that the federal 
government is the source of progress. He and the Prime Minister 
should admit that, last year and this year again, their government 
cut $4.5 billion in social, health, and post-secondary education 
programs, which represents $1.3 billion for Quebec alone.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance boast about putting only $50 
million this year into a program to fight child poverty, after such 
cuts? Is that progress, $1.3 billion in cuts and $50 million in its 
place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that Quebec's 
Minister of Finance, Mr. Landry, will put his 31 per cent of federal 
transfer payments to the provinces to good use in his next budget. 
Although we represent only 25 per cent of the population, 31 per 
cent of federal transfer payments, and 46 per cent of equalization 
payments, is not bad.
<P>
	I think the Government of Quebec is not doing too badly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the minister talks about 31 per cent, he is including 
tax points, as well as the money they are borrowing with our credit 
card, in our name, that we are obliged to pay later on.
<P>
	When he talks about equalization payments and the fact that we 
receive more in UI, he should be ashamed. If Quebec receives more 
in UI, it is perhaps because there is higher unemployment in 
Quebec. He seems to be proud of this. It is hard to believe.
<P>
	Getting back to the Prime Minister, who has been saying some 
very interesting things lately. He was explaining to the French 
Prime Minister, Jacques Chirac, that it is much easier in Canada 
than in France to cut social and health services, because the 
decisions are made in Ottawa and the provinces are stuck with the 
actual dirty work. Federalism is so wonderful.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Is the Minister of Finance aware that it is irresponsible of the 
federal government to place the provinces in an unstable position 
by forcing them to cut direct public services? Is he aware of that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has 
cut some of its own programs. We have carried out two program 
reviews and made cuts to federal government programs. We have 
also reduced the number of federal public servants by 50,000.
<P>
	It is easy to whine all the time and pretend to be the victim, the 
worst off of all the victims of the Canadian federation. I would like 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8390"> 8390 </A></B>
<P>
to draw the attention of the opposition and of the Government of 
Quebec to the fact that Quebec still receives the largest federal 
transfer payment of any Canadian province relative to its budget.
<P>
	Quebec derives considerable benefit from being in the Canadian 
federation, and we have no problem with that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
Minister of Human Resources Development were more familiar 
with his history, he would not ask the questions he just has, for 
poverty has its historical and political causes.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has decided that the children of Quebec 
and Canada would remain poor. Yet, he managed to squeeze out a 
tear during his budget speech. He has, however, forgotten that he 
and his government had done a good deal to impoverish families. 
He has added a mere $50 million to the pot.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance boast of his compassion, which 
I would have been glad to see him show toward poor children, 
when his so-called $50 million effort means only another $33 per 
year per child living in poverty in Quebec and in Canada?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> They can always be considered crumbs, but if

	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> It is outrageous, 500,000 more poor children 
since you have been in power.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew: </B>-we have added $70 million to the $195 
million we had already committed in this fiscal year. The amount 
we have committed, one that is permanent and will be repeated 
yearly for many years, the most important national social project 
for decades, a project in partnership with the provinces, which will 
add $850 million yearly for the benefit of children in low income 
families, is a magnificent commitment on the part of the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there was 
more money in 1984, in today's dollars, in assistance to children, 
for the number of children there were at that time, than there is in 
this budget.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Finance want to be at the top of the 
G-7 when it comes to deficit reduction, while he does not mind 
being at the bottom of the OECD countries when it comes to 
helping children living in poverty?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this is like comparing apples 
and oranges. In 1984, there was a family allowance system which 
went to all households. It was a universal program, one which 
many governments before us had questioned.
<P>
	If, however, we look at the situation and the way it has developed 
in recent years, I think that our government's commitment to 
children of low income families is one that is solid, significant, and 
aimed at low income families, unlike the family allowance, a 
universal program from another era, which we revised when we did 
a general tidying up of Canada's public finances to the benefit, 
incidentally, of all the administrations and all the companies in this 
country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday I pointed out that over the past five years the finance 
minister's tax revenues have gone up by 30 per cent, while the take 
home pay of Canadians has gone down by 10 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	``Not to worry,'' he said, ``those increased tax revenues were a 
result of the incredible economic growth''. Could it be that all the 
great economic growth explains why Canadians are $3,000 poorer, 
why 1.5 million Canadians are unemployed and why one in four 
Canadians are worried about losing their jobs?
<P>
	I ask the finance minister this. Can he explain why all this 
supposed economic growth has made the government 30 per cent 
richer and Canadian families 10 per cent poorer? How does it add 
up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member will know that at the time we took office, there 
was an enormous amount of insecurity in the country. Canada had 
come through the deepest and longest recession since the 
depression of the 1930s. Taxes were going up, interest rates were 
skyrocketing and there was an enormous loss of confidence among 
business and consumers.
<P>
	Three years later, 798,000 more jobs were created in the private 
sector, consumer confidence is on the way up, business confidence 
is on the way up and every international organization in the world, 
the OECD, the IMF and the World Bank, are saying that this is 
where the economic miracle of the world is taking place.
<P>
	Canadians are very proud of what is going on here. They really 
do not like to see people knock the country.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, right 
now the people who are upset are those who have existing 
bankruptcies, which are up 60 per cent. I am not sure they would be 
bragging about the budget.
<P>
	In the finance minister's world, a $3,000 pay cut for families is 
defined as economic growth and a 70 per cent pay hike in payroll 
taxes is considered an investment.
<P>
	In April 1995 the minister's department released a study-I will 
table it if he would like me to-which concluded that a 40 per cent 
increase in CPP premiums between 1986 and 1993 had killed 
26,000 jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8391"> 8391 </A></B>
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Has his department 
figured out the negative impact that this 70 per cent increase in 
CPP premiums will have on jobs? It was 40 per cent before, and 
now it will be a 70 per cent increase in these pay hikes. How many 
jobs will that lose, not create?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
obviously it takes a great deal to explain to the Reform Party the 
difference between a tax and pension contribution.
<P>
	Yesterday I pointed out that what the Reform Party was 
recommending in its changes to pension contributions was the 
Chilean model which was 13 per cent, some $500 more than the 
federal government and provinces have come together on.
<P>
	I wanted to be fair to the Reform Party. Therefore I went back to 
see if I could find out whether they had made a lower 
recommendation. Remember that the provinces and the federal 
government have agreed to 9.9 per cent. The lowest 
recommendation I could find from Reform was 10 per cent.
<P>
	Let me quote from Reform's minority report from Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development social security 
review. It says that in Chile the local version of CPP has been 
phased out and replaced by mandatory RRSPs, financed by a 
payroll deduction of 10 per cent. That is the lowest that they have 
come up with-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
Canadians being able to put into their expanded RRSP program, 
they will get exactly double what the government offers in any 
pension scheme.
<P>
	The same study that was done by Joe Italiano in the minister's 
department also examined the impact that payroll taxes had on 
wages. It is one thing for the minister to say that this is an 
investment. For the employers who are kicking out another 70 per 
cent of taxes on premiums for their workers, this is what his 
department came up with, not some Reformer, regarding wages.
<P>
	``Employers, that is the people who hire and pay the employees, 
try to pass the increased cost of higher payroll taxes on to 
employees through lower wages''. Somehow that does not sound 
like a great investment.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Since Canadians have already suffered a $3,000 pay cut under 
this Liberal government, how much more than $3,000 will they 
lose now that the finance minister has increased payroll taxes by 70 
per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is very difficult to understand how members of the Reform Party 
can stand up day after day, swallow themselves whole and bring 
forward positions that are in total contradiction to what they have 
stated consistently in House of Commons committees or in this 
House.
<P>
	I made a reference to the 10 per cent increase. That was the 
lowest number that I could see.
<P>
	Let us look at what Reform has actually recommended. This is a 
quote from the Reform Party's social security review and the 
option which it recommends: ``The schedule of planned increases 
to the CPP payroll tax'', which they called it, ``could be maintained 
or somewhat accelerated with the excess funds being diverted into 
contributors' personal super RRSP funds''.
<P>
	What Reform is recommending on paper is the acceleration of 
the contributions up to a level of 14.2 per cent.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In his budget, the minister announced the creation of the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation to invest in R &amp; D infrastructures. 
However, as in the case of most of the measures announced in this 
budget, on the eve of an election the minister is putting money back 
into an area where he previously made massive cuts, as in the case 
of the Tokamak reactor in Varennes.
<P>
	How can the minister create a federal foundation when he has 
already cut more than $3.3 billion in transfer payments to the 
provinces for health and post-secondary education and more than 
$100 million in funding for research councils? These are radical 
cuts that have already seriously undermined research in 
universities and hospitals.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the position taken today by the hon. member for the Bloc 
Quebecois is a rather interesting one.
<P>
	I can quote some comments by Denis Gagnon, vice rector of 
Laval University. He said: ``I think it was very good news 
yesterday for universities and teaching hospitals that do research. 
Excellent news at last that we may be entitled to assistance in 
developing our research infrastructures''.
<P>
	He also said: ``The federal government is involved, but it is 
looking for what it calls a partner in any commitment it will make, 
and it will be up to us to work with these partners''.

<P>
	Does the minister, who has cut at least one half billion annually 
from research and development budgets, not realize that $180 
million is peanuts compared with the promise in the red book 
which would add $1 billion annually for science and technology?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, the hon. member is quite wrong. Apparently 
she cannot read. Perhaps she should go back to the red book. She 
would see that our commitment was to invest $1 billion in science 
and technology during our mandate. By creating the Foundation for 
Innovation we have already invested $800 million.
<P>
	We also created Technology Partnerships Canada, whose budget, 
starting next year, will be $250 million annually, and this is stable 
funding.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, any 
reform of CPP must reflect fairness for all Canadians. If a 20 year 
old person invested CPP contributions in an RRSP at an average 
return of about 7 per cent he or she would have an nest egg of over a 
million dollars. That would give an annual retirement income over 
double what is being offered under the Liberal CPP plan.
<P>
	How can the minister justify forcing young people to contribute 
to a plan that would have to rank as one of the worst investment 
schemes on the planet?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the projections that have been made by the federal government and 
the provinces are quite prudent. Again I point out that all 10 
provinces are joint stewards in the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	If the Canada pension plan was to earn higher rates, and there is 
no reason why it should not given the fact that it will be subject 
exactly to the same investment criteria as any private sector 
pension plan, then clearly the returns will be higher.
<P>
	Let us point out some of the fundamental differences the super 
RRSP will not have. CPP benefits are fully indexed. They are 
secure. They provide disability benefits. If somebody has an 
accident under the Canada pension plan they will be protected.
<P>
	What Reform would do is throw those who have bad luck, who 
have accidents, on to the market with no help. Let us understand 
what it means. Under the Canada pension plan survivor benefits 
will be provided. As well, under the Canada pension plan women 
having children who have to retire from the workforce for a period 
of time are protected. Under the Reform plan there is no such 
protection.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
finance minister is making lyin' Brian look good.

these words ``lyin' Brian'' and to put his question directly, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I withdraw. The Liberal record is a 17 
per cent jobless rate for Canada's youth and now under the guise of 
CPP reform-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Put the question, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the one hand why is the 
government breaking its jobs promise to Canada's youth and on the 
other hand if they ever do get a job forcing them to pay higher and 
higher taxes for ever diminishing benefits?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
us put the debate over the Canada pension plan in perspective.
<P>
	We have already seen that the difference of opinion between 
ourselves and the Reform Party has nothing to do with the CPP 
premiums. We have already seen that on the three basic options put 
forward by the Reform Party, one of 10 per cent, one of 13 per cent 
and one of 14.2 per cent, in all cases Reform are recommending 
higher CPP premiums than the federal government and the 
provinces. We understand that.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	Therefore what we must deal with is what is the fundamental 
difference of opinion between ourselves and the Reform. It has to 
do with the values of this country. It has to do with do you believe 
that Canadians feel a collective responsibility one for the other? Do 
you believe that Canadians do not think this is a country only for 
the rich? Do you believe that what this country is all about is 
providing for Canadians on disability, providing for single 
mothers, providing for survivors? We do.

the Acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	Despite his attempts to exert pressure, the secretary of state 
responsible for regional development in Quebec has failed. The 
Minister of Health this week tabled a number of minor 
amendments to his tobacco bill, which simply put the problem off 
until after the election. All the organizers of sporting and cultural 
events are angry and disappointed at the work done by the secretary 
of state in the matter of sponsorships.
<P>
	Will the Acting Prime Minister acknowledge that, despite the 
fine words of the secretary of state for Quebec, the government has 
found no other way to ensure the viability of sporting and cultural 
events in Quebec and Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is completely off base.
<P>
	The minister has responded to committee recommendations, a 
committee of which the hon. member was a participant. The 
minister has said: ``All right, I will consider what the 
recommendations of the committee are, first of all, that the 
legislation passed as it was and second, I will take into 
consideration some of the concerns with respect to a transitional 
period in order to accommodate the concerns of all of those who 
depended on advertising''. He has done that.
<P>
	The minister has also taken into consideration the overwhelming 
opinion of the Canadian public that this is a health bill and that as a 
health bill it shall pass unchanged. The minister has also said: ``I 
will be reasonable. I will receive further representations''. He has 
received them and he has presented amendments that reflect 
weighing those recommendations in the balance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know 
how the parliamentary secretary can say that, when the minister 
refused to meet representatives of the sponsors.
<P>
	On October 22, the Prime Minister said before the Chamber of 
Commerce in Montreal, and I quote: ``By working in a spirit of 
co-operation, we can put Montreal back on its feet. We have no 
choice, we must succeed''.
<P>
	Are we to understand that his work on behalf of Montreal is 
limited to adopting a bill that threatens more than 2,000 jobs and 
over $90 million in economic benefits there?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure it is very constructive to 
engage in these kinds of scare tactics. The legislation, and the hon. 
member has read it well, does not prohibit advertising. There are 
restrictions to the application of advertising, restrictions to which 
the advertising agencies around the world and especially in North 
America agree should be in place.
<P>
	The member also knows there are even more severe restrictions 
in the United States. In fact, as of next year there will be an outright 
ban. No such thing is happening in Canada.
<P>
	For the edification of the hon. member and for the information of 
this House I would like to draw to the member's attention what the

too loudly of Reform ideas because it usually takes about a year for 
a Reform idea to end up being Liberal policy, as we all know.
<P>
	Catherine Swift, the president of the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, wrote a letter to the Canada pension plan 
review committee. In it she wrote: ``Increases in CPP premiums to 
as high as 10 per cent would be massively disruptive to small 
business finances and employment levels''. The premium increase 
announced by the Minister of Finance to 9.9 per cent will cost a 
company with 100 employees $130,000.
<P>
	Where will that money come from to pay this increase in taxes? 
Why will the government not link an increase in CPP premiums to 
a decrease in the UI premiums?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
us simply contrast in terms of the CPP premiums with differing 
tracks between what the Liberals and the provinces have said 
together versus what the Reform plan is.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8394"> 8394 </A></B>
<P>
	Instead of it going up to 14 per cent and then continuing, under 
the federal government and the provincial plan, the premiums are 
going to go up to 9.9 per cent and then they are going to level 
off. We will then have a fuller funded plan. What Reform is 
suggesting under what appears to be the most real of its options 
is that there would be an acceleration of those premiums up to 
14.2 per cent.
<P>
	How the hon. member can stand in this House and try to 
convince people that 14.2 per cent is less than 9.9 per cent can only 
be done in that weird little corner of the world where Reformers do 
their arithmetic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of Canadians, what we are trying to do is to link 
the very real damage done to employment by payroll taxes and the 
fact that payroll taxes have to come down.
<P>
	We all understand that the Canada pension plan is a basket case. 
Everybody knows that. The problem is that for new people coming 
into the plan it must be fair. For businesses that now have to try to 
maintain a payroll we have to keep them from going broke. For the 
vast majority of businesses there is only one place the money can 
come from. According to the same CFIB survey, 49 per cent of 
small businesses with five employees are operating at break even 
or loss positions which means that the last person hired will be the 
first person fired.
<P>
	How many small businesses will be forced to close as a direct 
result of this payroll tax increase? That is the problem.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has just referred to the Canada pension plan as a 
basket case. One must understand what he is saying. The federal 
government along with eight of the provinces, provinces which 
reflect the vast range of the political spectrum in this country, 
provinces which reflect all of the regions of this country have come 
together with the federal government to protect the Canada pension 
plan so that it will be there for young Canadians.
<P>
	To refer to the Canada pension plan as a basket case could only 
come if one adopts an extremist view. We understand that is exactly 
what we are dealing with. The basic difference here is not between 
Reform and the government. It is between a balanced view of what 
Canadian society is all about and about a band of extremists who 
would destroy the values of the country.

Affairs.
<P>
	This week, Quebec's Liberal Party leader Daniel Johnson said he 
would not support the amendment to section 93 of the Constitution 
sought by the Quebec government, because, in his opinion, the fact 
that up to four other provinces could be involved increases the 
likelihood of failure.
<P>

section 93 could be amended bilaterally on the basis of the proposal 
made by the Quebec government.

of the Liberal Party in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will have to repeat the three basic points made from 
the very beginning by the Government of Canada in this matter.
<P>
	First, on the face of it, what the Government of Quebec is 
proposing appears to be feasible, bilaterally, under section 43 of the 
Constitution Act of 1982 amending formula.
<P>
	Second, the Government of Quebec must build a consensus 
around its proposal. Incidentally, my Quebec counterpart, Jacques 
Brassard, is now saying the exact same thing as I am, thereby 
contradicting the opposition in this respect.
<P>
	Third, this is a matter that must be debated by the provincial 
legislature before being referred to the Parliament of Canada. That 
was what happened in each of the four previous bilateral 
amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in light of the 180 degree turnabout and the glaring 
inconsistency of his friend and ally, Daniel Johnson, is the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs telling us that, until the leader of the 
Liberal Party in Quebec sees the light and stops putting 
partisanship before the interests of Quebec as a whole, he will 
consider that there is no consensus in Quebec to proceed 
bilaterally?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the leader of the official opposition made another 
suggestion that may well reduce the likelihood of a court challenge. 
It is up to the Quebec government to determine whether this is the 
best solution and to discuss the matter with the leader of the official 
opposition.
<P>
	I think that the official opposition in the House of Commons now 
realizes that a consensus is required. So far, it had always 
maintained that all we had to do was to accept a proposal put 
forward by the Government of Quebec.

certain products are or are not allowed in and is there an appeal

<P>

traditional herbal remedies and vitamin and mineral supplements. 
We have also dealt with a series of other items that have been less 
than safe. I cite as an example remedies containing ephedrine 
which were responsible for a number of serious illnesses in 
Canada. As a result a ban was imposed on the use of Ephedra in 
certain products.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us look 
at the new seniors benefit that he is so proud of. If a senior only has 
a seniors benefit and the Canada pension plan, if that is all the 
senior has, the Minister of Finance would take back half the 
Canada pension plan. Let him tell us why that is fair.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is simply not true.
<P>
	The main issue we should really address is why, with all of the 
problems and the opportunities this country has, the Reform Party 
has taken up all of question period with one goal in mind: to 
destroy the help that will be given to low income seniors and to 
destroy the Canada pension plan. What is it deep in the hearts of 
Reformers that would destroy the social security programs upon 
which Canadians rely? Why? It has been an hour of basic-

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Minister of National Defence finally admitted 
that he and his colleague in External Affairs had received a report 
concerning the allegations that a Quebec diplomat in Washington 
was spied upon by Canadian military attachés.
<P>
	Out of a concern for transparency and in order to get to the 
bottom of this matter, is the minister prepared to make that report 
public?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would simply refer the hon. member to the reports that 
appeared this morning where the lawyer for Mr. Keener who had 
made that allegation said that the allegation was simply false. That 
should clear up the point which we made in the House, that this 
whole allegation was absurd. Now the lawyer of the person who 
said it in the first place has said that it simply is absurd.

according to the defence minister, everybody knows what

whether Bob Fowler really did blackmail Kim Campbell and 
whether generals interfered with an investigation.

what they are? If not, why is he so determined to avoid learning the 
truth?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and

elements that are raised by my hon. friend are important. That is 
why the Somalia commission of inquiry has been working now for 
nearly two years. By the end of June, after three extensions, it will 
have caused some $25 million to have been spent.
<P>
	With respect to the specific incidents that occurred in Somalia 
which the hon. member refers to, I hope that after all of this work 
the conclusions and the recommendations of the Somalia 
commission of inquiry will be useful to all Canadians, including 
the hon. member and the government.

	Some people wished to be transferred from a per family to a per 
child situation. One child families will still receive more money, 
not as much as we had hoped and was promised in the earlier

is a matter of fairness to go to a per child situation instead of per

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government; the 
amendment, and the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. When the 
debate concluded prior to question period an hon. member had just 
finished speaking and there had not been time for questions and 
comments. I am wondering if you are about to call questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member is absolutely correct. The hon. 
member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis had five minutes for 
questions and comments. I was about to call for that before we 
proceed with debate.
<P>
	Are there questions or comments?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to direct a question to the hon. 
member from Quebec, with whom I have served on the 
environment committee and for whom I have a great deal of 
respect.
<P>
	The hon. member spoke at great length about funding for 
research and development, for technologies and for other things. I 
am greatly disappointed that the federal budget did not announce 
additional funding for green plan moneys that have expired. Green 
plan moneys previously funded a lot of projects on the prairies for 
land preservation and conservation, and water and air conservation. 
Many rural residents, farmers in particular, benefited a great deal 
from the funds which were available for research and conservation 
projects.
<P>
	My first question of two is: Does the member believe that at 
some point we should see a return of this kind of funding? Second, 
about 16 per cent of agricultural research and development money 
over the past three years has been withdrawn. I wonder if the 
member, who is committed to research and development, would 
not like to see the replacement of that 16 per cent to research and 
development in agriculture.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, naturally all of us want to see 
restoration of previous funding in the areas of environment and 
agriculture. At the same time, we face realities. We have had to cut 
substantially in government expenses. When government 
expenses, the deficit, are cut by 57 per cent over three years, the 
cutbacks are significant.
<P>
	The budget sets a sense of direction. One government priority is 
innovation, research. It has earmarked the research foundation for 
the next five years even though it is subject to partnership with 
private enterprise, with the economic world so that hopefully it will 
produce $2 billion over five years.
<P>
	Naturally, when finances are restored to the government, I hope 
there will be much more funding for the environment, whether it is 
in the form of the previous green plan which was criticized as being 
too unfocused. We need something focused, something that 
addresses the issue of scientific research in the environment 
especially. Yes, I would be all for this. The Minister of Finance 
shares this goal as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a budget, 
particularly one which we know is a pre-election budget, indicates 
a party's profound sense of attachment to its ideals. Now, what 
does this budget really present us with? This budget tells all those 
people who have paid dearly to reduce the deficit-generally, those 
people and those regions and provinces which can least afford 
it-``You are going to have to keep on paying''.
<P>
	The budget speech is full of praise and self-congratulation for 
the new economic indicators which ought supposedly to create jobs 
on their own, without the government having to put anything into 
employment.
<P>
	Now the same people who have had to bear the brunt of the 
deficit reduction are the ones cruelly deprived of jobs, which would 
put an end to their needing the various social programs. But what 
does the government do in this connection? It announces a new 
infrastructure program, it announces a project for investing in 
research and development, but these measures are not in the least 
sufficient to deal with the problems involved.
<P>
	The budget also shows a certain degree of cynicism, since there 
is no indication whatsoever that the unemployment insurance fund 
surplus is liable to stop growing.
<P>
	Finally, after having shed a tear over child poverty, the budget 
says that, this year, the government will invest $50 million.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	I will expand on these points. There are more. My colleagues 
talked about federal intrusion. I want to emphasize these particular 
points because they affect ordinary people. I wish there were a 
better word, but I have yet to find one.
<P>
	Ordinary people are those who need social programs, average 
citizens. We are all ordinary people but when we use this expres-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8398"> 8398 </A></B>
<P>
sion, I think of those who know they have no power, no wealth, no 
RRSP and often no house. These  are the people who need the 
government, who need social programs.
<P>
	So what do these people see nowadays? They see that instead of 
improving their lives, instead of being able to count on the 
programs they urgently need, this budget announces that they will 
continue to experience severe cuts in funding. I am referring to the 
people of Quebec. They will continue to experience severe cuts in 
funding for health care, education and social programs.
<P>
	And they will continue to experience the full impact of 
employment insurance reform, a shameful misnomer. In fact, they 
will not be able to count on any help at all. This is outrageous, 
when we consider the employment insurance fund. Since the 
Liberals came to power, the employment insurance fund has 
annually collected $4 billion or $5 billion more than it distributed 
in benefits.
<P>
	This year, the surplus is expected to be $5.8 billion. These 
figures are shocking because they tell us that although the 
government expects to spend $13.5 billion on benefits, it will 
collect $19.3 billion, and $5.8 billion over $13.5 is something like 
43 per cent. This is outrageous. This is highway robbery and 
misappropriation of funds. It is intolerable that only workers and 
the businesses that employ them should pay this special premium 
to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	However, the minister is delighted. Did you hear that? The 
minister is delighted because he managed to reduce unemployment 
insurance premiums. He is delighted with the fact that he reduced 
costs. He is delighted with the fact he reduced the deficit. He did 
not say that this deficit reduction was largely paid for by workers 
earning up to $39,000, no more. People who work overtime and 
earn really big salaries do not pay a cent. Businesses that employ 
people and pay them up to $39,000 are the people who, since 
Liberals came to power, have paid for most of the reduction of the 
deficit.
<P>
	There are really no words to express how unproductive this is 
from the economic point of view and how unfair it is to the people 
themselves. In fact, it would make any citizen indignant. I have no 
hesitation in showing my indignation, because I see it everywhere 
in my riding as do all hon. members in this House, who can testify 
to the general indignation of the public.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	The Conservative government's withdrawal of the $2 billion 
paid by the main budget for job training from the unemployment 
insurance fund had major consequences. Three years later, there 
was a $6 billion deficit in the fund-three times $2 billion. Because 
the government was no longer responsible for this area, the 
unemployment insurance had to pay. Workers and businesses had 
to pay for job training.
<P>
	However, since the Liberals came to power, things have been 
quite incredible. Now, the consolidated fund, the main budget, has 
little to do with job training, help  and active measures, everything 
comes out of the unemployment insurance fund. In fact, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development's reform had the effect 
of having the unemployment insurance fund pay for what 
previously came out of the consolidated fund.
<P>
	In other words, this is so twisted that the scandal rages on while 
all the members on the government side gloat. However, it makes 
no sense that the deficit reduction effort is not better distributed, 
including among businesses.
<P>
	Which businesses pay their employees the most unemployment 
insurance? The labour intensive ones and the small and medium 
size businesses. The big ones rarely do. So the businesses 
providing the most jobs pay the most. Not just for the plan, but for 
the surplus in the fund, which is used only for the deficit.
<P>
	When the minister decided to reduce the portion of salary from 
which unemployment insurance contributions are collected, we in 
the opposition tried to point out how unreasonable this was. Instead 
of spreading the costs of unemployment insurance to a population 
better able to afford it-the higher income earners-the level of 
earnings not subject to unemployment insurance premiums was 
reduced to $39,000. This is crazy.
<P>
	The minister says: ``This will continue. There was a $5 billion 
surplus in 1996; there will be at least $5 billion more at the end of 
1997''. About 1998-he is telling us what a good job he has done to 
get re-elected-he is saying nothing. He is saying nothing about 
reducing it, so there will be another $5 billion. It is turning into a 
tax, and not a hidden one. Much of unemployment insurance 
contributions goes to reducing the debt for society as a whole, yet it 
is workers who earn up to $39,000 who pay.
<P>
	Those who can, who pay from their first hour of work, the first 
dollar they earn, they are the ones who are paying down the deficit. 
Those who earn over $39,000 are not.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	I also want to discuss child poverty. This issue also makes me 
really upset. The Liberal government got elected after stressing 
how caring it was, how big a heart it had, and how it was going to 
tackle the issue of child poverty. Back in 1993, one of the 
initiatives the government promised to take to fight child 
poverty-I know because I was the critic on that issue and I 
debated it with the Liberal leading lights of the time-was a 
national daycare service. Not one penny was ever allocated to that 
project. Zero. The minister argued that the provinces would refuse 
to go along, which was true in some, but not in all cases. Be that as 
it may, not one penny was spent on that initiative. That 
commitment was going to cost $720 million.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8399"> 8399 </A></B>
<P>
	I was astonished when I saw in the budget, that the minister 
was recycling that promise. The finance minister may not like the 
comparison, but he is doing with tax benefits what Mr. Duplessis 
used to do with his promise to build a bridge. Mr. Duplessis would 
run at least two elections on a promise to build a bridge. The 
Liberal Party is in the process of running two elections, perhaps 
three-we will see after the next election-with the same promise 
to tackle the real causes of child poverty.
<P>
	This time, the instrument being used is not a national daycare 
service, but a chid tax benefit. However, what guarantee do we 
have that the government will fulfil this promise? This year, it will 
invest $50 million.
<P>
	There are 1.5 million children in Quebec and in Canada who live 
in poverty. In its generous spirit, the government says: ``We will 
invest $50 million'', which means $33 more per year for each poor 
child in Quebec and in Canada. When children live in poverty it is 
because their parents live in poverty, because they do not have a 
job, because they were cut off employment insurance, because they 
have problems getting welfare, because they are not in good health. 
As you know, the causes of poverty are cumulative: one cause 
triggers another, and so on. Can the government seriously claim to 
be doing something about child poverty by giving $33 more per 
year per child? This is the firm part of its commitment.
<P>
	The other is a promise, said to be carved in stone, a commitment. 
If this were my first election, I would say: ``Let us give credit to the 
government. After all, there have been some Liberal traditions in 
the past''. But now I do not give credit to the government this time. 
I have no confidence left in the government and, worse, I am 
outraged. And I am going to tell you why.
<P>
	In his budget, the finance minister says that he is proud because, 
since the government is in office, in terms of deficit reduction, 
Canada has gone from being the worst country in the G7 to being 
the best, which means that Canada is the leader in deficit reduction.
<P>
	Members are aware that international figures always take some 
time to adjust, but the latest OECD data-what better source can 
you ask for-show that Canada is the worst not only among the G7 
nations, but also among the OECD countries in terms of assistance 
to poor children.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	In what some say is the best country in the world, how can we 
accept to be the best in deficit reduction, at the expense of the 
future and the health of our children, given the social impact this 
will have, because we tried to go about it faster than other countries 
who were already doing much better that Canada was, at a time 
when Canada's programs were also doing much better?
<P>
	I could quote it at length, but I will just point out that, in Europe, 
when they calculate poverty before transfers  and taxes, in France, 
for instance, in 1984, it was 24.7 per cent before and 5.7 per cent 
after. In Canada, in 1987, the poverty rate was 18.4 and 12.6 per 
cent after taxes.
<P>
	Since then, social programs in Canada have deteriorated. To my 
knowledge at least, a global evaluation has not been made but it 
must be made, since future generations are the ones that will pay. 
We talk a lot about the budget deficit; when will we talk about the 
health deficit, the intellectual development deficit, the social 
development deficit that will result from these often drastic cuts? 
These will be the social costs of the decisions this government is so 
proud of.
<P>
	I would have liked the Bloc Quebecois not to be the only party in 
this House to speak up on this. My colleagues may make as much 
noise as they want, I know what I am talking about and they know 
it. They should be happy to have us here, since we are now the only 
ones to speak for the future of young people in Quebec and Canada 
in our role as the official opposition.
<P>
	This is not a good budget for ordinary Canadians. This is a sad 
budget. All those who have already put enough money aside will 
benefit from the economic indicators, but everybody else will be 
hard-pressed to find hope where there is not much hope.

<P>
member opposite. Yes, we have  talked a great deal about the G-7 in 
comparisons with Canada but not just on deficit reduction.
<P>
	She conveniently left out these comparisons. According to the 
OECD, according to the IMF, Canada in the year that is beginning 
April 1 will lead the G-7 in growth. Canada will lead the G-7 in job 
creation. According to an IMF report reported widely in the press 
yesterday, Canada is well ahead of other nations in the G-7, indeed 
throughout the OECD, in dealing with the problems of an aging 
population. Does she want to comment on that?
<P>
	Second, in her focus on merely $50 million for children, she is 
leaving out for some reason the budget announcement of over $600 
million in new money available for children, une prestation fiscale 
pour enfants bonifier.
<P>
	It is going to raise the amount of support that the federal 
government provides to children under the child tax system as it 
currently is moving to a new system from $5.1 billion to $6 billion. 
She leaves that out for some reason and talks only about $50 
million. It will be $850 million added to the existing program, $600 
million of which is new money.
<P>
	For some reason she leaves out entirely le Programme visant à 
améliorer la santé de nos enfants, an extra $100 million for prenatal 
nutrition and for the vital CAPC program. Is she aware of that or 
has she just forgotten?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary 
certainly knows that I am usually very well informed and that I 
have not forgotten that. I would like to remind him that the OECD 
statistics to which I was referring have to do with social policies.
<P>
	It is predicted that Canada will be the leader in growth, in jobs, 
just as you said, and in dealing with the problems of an aging 
population.
<P>
	In the area of jobs, changes that are occurring on the labour 
market have to be taken into account. Some people are saying that 
not much is being done. Last year, 125,000 of the 170,000 net jobs 
that were created were independent jobs. The only longitudinal 
studies available on this subject show that independent jobs, a 
number of which were probably created by public service 
employees who have received their separation incentive and have 
decided to start a small business of some sort-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Is it not a good thing?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> I am not saying that it is not a good thing. Mr. 
Speaker, you should tell him to address the Chair and to stop 
provoking me.
<P>
	Independent jobs are interesting for those who hold them. 
However, when almost all net jobs created in a country are 
independent jobs, it is a sign that a revolution is taking place on the 
labour market. All our social programs, all our systems are not 
designed to meet that need. Definitely not. For example, the 
unemployment insurance program is not designed for those people. 
These jobs are far from being permanent, and they often generate 
less revenue. This issue needs to be given serious consideration.
<P>
	As for growth, you are well aware that growth may not mean 
much sharing. Growth and improving the lot of the average citizen 
are two separate things. What I was talking about was improving 
the lot of the average citizen.
<P>
	I would like the secretary of state to listen to me when he 
suggests that I omitted, for a reason he no doubt finds suspect, the 
$600 million the government has promised for the child tax benefit. 
I did not omit this amount. I said that the government had set aside 
only $50 million this year. I am not entitled to table a book. There 
will be $470 million after the election and the figure will not reach 
$600 million until 1999-2000.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. secretary of state to consult his own papers, 
or I will provide him with copies.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	So, what people will have before them during the election will be 
$50 million. The rest will come after the election. Last time, during 
the election, $720 million was promised for a national child care 
system. We never saw a cent. So, before I believe there will be 
$470 million for the child tax benefit the following year and $600 
million the year after that, I will have to wait for the bill. Before 
then, there will be an election and another opportunity for the 
government to do what it wants.
<P>
	Finally, there is health. As far as health is concerned, in Quebec 
anyway, the federal government has outdone itself: It has cut social 
transfers, it has cut assistance for health and, here, the government, 
using part of this money, instead of giving it to the province that 
has come up with a drug insurance plan, will provide $150 million 
in assistance to provinces for drug insurance plans. Maybe Quebec 
has a good idea. Let us help the others. Quebec did not ask for 
subsidies to implement its plan. It did it despite the cuts, without 
seeking any assistance. In its generosity, the federal government is 
going to look after research projects to be developed in other 
provinces.
<P>
	The federal government will develop a health information 
system. The provinces are unable to exchange such information. 
And this brings me to the third point, the best of all. This too goes 
back to 1993. In Quebec we have a special program. This program 
was developed by a community group which found that 
underweight and disadvantaged women gave birth to small babies 
with all sorts of health problems. Gradually, those groups 
convinced CLSCs and others to give those women who claimed 
unemployment insurance benefits one egg, milk and an orange 
every day. The program yielded tremendous results.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8401"> 8401 </A></B>
<P>
	I can still remember an major television program in which the 
Liberals promised to take care of small babies. This was in 1993. 
Now I know how the last $100 million will be used: a Canadian 
prenatal nutrition program will be established. Just imagine. The 
government will send civil servants all across Canada to help 
community groups to distribute one egg, milk and oranges to 
babies who are still in their mother's womb and who will not have 
much hope in life.
<P>
	I hope the parliamentary secretary realizes there are major flaws 
in his minister's budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell: </B>Mr. Speaker, this temporary change will add 
$195 million in July 1997 to the budget for the working income 
supplement, which means $70 million more than the increase 
proposed on the same date in the 1996 budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	And the other $600 million will come in by July 1998. So that is 
real, new money.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the budget it was $250 million, 
announced last year. So honestly-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity before 
speaking to the budget to respond to some of the things that have 
been said by some members opposite.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party has been critical of a number of things. First is 
the child tax benefit which will raise federal spending for children 
once fully implemented to $6 billion a year. Incredibly, the leader 
of the Reform Party or, as someone referred to him yesterday, the 
leader who aspires to be the leader of the fifth party in this House, 
said yesterday that commitment is totally negated by the cuts in 
transfers since 1993. That is an incredible statement from the 
Reform Party, the party that wants to cut faster, including transfers, 
so that it can give a tax break to its friends. It is really astounding. 
Its budget plan would decimate education and health.
<P>
	Reformers cannot have it both ways. They cannot criticize us for 
not doing enough out of one side of their mouth and out of the other 
side of their mouth say ``but if it were our way, we would cut 
faster''. When it comes to protecting medicare, education and 
children, Canadians do not look to the members opposite but to this 
side of the House.
<P>
	Then incredibly Reformers in their debate over the last days 
have been critical of deficit reduction, arguing that some of the 
relief comes from growth in the economy. I will just stop there. 
What are they saying? Are they against growth in the economy? 
They are right, the economy is growing because of the steps we 
have taken in our three prior budgets. Corporate profits are up, tax 
revenues are up as a result of that and somehow that is a bad thing. 
It is really quite something to behold and extremely difficult to 
understand.
<P>
	Then there is the Bloc, members of the official opposition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Last night, I read the speech made yesterday by the hon. member 
for St. Hyacinthe-Bagot regarding the budget. Unfortunately, it 
was pretty confused and his logic was way off.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On taxes they attack us on a lack of action. They allege we are 
lazy. I would say that if anyone is lazy in this debate it is the 
members of the official opposition because they did not read the 
document entitled ``L'équité fiscale'', one of the budget 
documents.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If they had read it, they would have found examples of measures 
adopted since 1993 to enhance tax fairness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I could cite from that just three examples of steps we have taken 
to address the very concern they raise.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For example: eliminating the $100,000 lifetime capital gains 
exemption, extending the base for the alternative minimum tax, 
eliminating tax advantages available through trusts, restricting the 
use of tax shelters.
<P>
	The opposition is opposed to all those measures. They voted 
against our budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They were opposed to these measures and yet they stand here 
and say that we have not done anything in the tax fairness area. We 
have done it but we have done it without their help.
<P>
	Again on the point of a total lack of logic in the speeches by the 
members from the official opposition, incredibly they allege that 
the deficit has come down because tax revenues have gone up. 
Then a page later, in the speech I read last night, the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot said that it was because of cuts. Which is 
it?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One cannot talk from both sides of one's mouth at the same time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me turn to the budget itself. When we came to office in the 
fall of 1993 our country faced a number of daunting political policy 
challenges about the economic and fiscal fronts. We were not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8402"> 8402 </A></B>
<P>
alone. Indeed our problems were shared by most industrialized 
countries.
<P>
	Where Canada is unique perhaps is in the straight ahead 
approach we have taken to implement lasting structural reforms. 
We went beyond hopeful talk to hard action and tough choices and 
that is delivering accelerating results and growing benefits to 
Canadians. The evidence is clear and concrete. The opposition 
merely has to put aside their partisan glasses and read this year's 
budget with open eyes. That is what financial markets have done; 
that is what Canadians have done.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I need not remind this House why we took these vigourous and 
disciplined measures to put our financial house in order. Large 
deficits and a huge public sector debt made interest rates soar, 
undermined confidence, drained domestic savings and caused a 
considerable increase in the country's foreign debt.
<P>
	That illustrates our philosophy in financial matters. Dealing with 
the problem of public finances is not go a goal in itself-we see the 
reform of public finances as a prerequisite for national growth, job 
creation, security and economic and social independence. We are 
starting to see the results.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the economic arena, forecasters concur. As I said earlier, 
Canada will be a growth and job creation leader in the G-7 this 
year. One of the key engines for this growth is interest rates. 
Currently short term rates are near a 35-year low. In fact, they are 
lower than comparable U.S. rates for maturities of up to 10 years. 
That is no accident. Our fiscal plan combined with our 
commitment to low inflation has created the conditions and the 
credibility needed to bring down interest rates.
<P>
	In today's debate I want to continue to focus on our fiscal record. 
That is not to ignore important investments that the budget 
announced in job creation and in vital social action for low income 
children, for health care, for the disabled and to assist charities. 
This is in the historic tradition of nation building and support for 
those in need that has been the heart blood of our party and 
distinguishes us from others in this House.
<P>
	These investments would not have been possible without 
jeopardizing jobs and growth, without our sustained progress in 
deficit reduction. It is jobs and economic growth that are 
themselves key components in helping eliminate poverty and 
hardship.
<P>
	The budget announced this week shows that our consistent 
cohesive fiscal plan is working. It confirms that our federal deficit 
this year will be no higher than $19 billion. I want to highlight 
some points about that.
<P>
	First, that result is over $5 billion below the target we set out. 
This is the third year in a row that we have bettered our targets.
<P>
	Second, when we took office the deficit that year, 1993-94, was 
$42 billion or 5.9 per cent of GDP. This year as I said the deficit 
will be under $20 billion, closer to $19 billion or lower, or less than 
3 per cent of GDP. We have cut the deficit in half in three years.
<P>
	Third, our 1996-97 results will also be more than $9.5 billion 
below our deficit a year ago. That is the largest year over year 
decline ever in the history of this country.
<P>
	Fourth, how we are achieving this dramatic progress is just as 
important as the results themselves. The vast bulk of our fiscal 
action has been on the expenditure side, cutting spending rather 
than raising taxes. In fact this is also our third budget in a row with 
no increase in personal income tax rates.
<P>
	There are a number of factors contributing to the success of 
Canada's deficit diet.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First, our budget planning was based on cautious economic 
assumptions. These included the assumption that the interest rates 
would be higher than what all of the forecasters in the private 
sector had predicted. However, interest rates were lower than 
forecast, because of the credibility we re-established on the 
financial level. Lower rates meant lower costs of servicing a much 
smaller public debt.
<P>
	Then there was the contingency fund, included in our plan in 
order to prevent our finances from going off course, in the event we 
ended up with a crisis like that of the Mexican peso and the 
volatility it caused in the international markets and in interest rates.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	However, we also made it very clear, from the outset, that, if this 
reserve were not needed it would not be spent, it would go directly 
to reducing the deficit. And this is what happened again this year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	But budgets are about tomorrow, not just today. Here again our 
fiscal story is a good one and I am afraid it drives the members 
opposite nuts.
<P>
	The 1997 budget reaffirms that we are clearly on track to meet 
our deficit targets of 2 per cent of GDP in 1997-98 and 1 per cent in 
1998-99. That 1 per cent mark will represent a historic turning 
point for our country. It is a point where our financial requirements, 
that is, the need to borrow net new money on financial markets to 
pay for our programs and debt charges, will be eliminated.
<P>
	While there will still be a deficit, it will be managed through the 
federal government's own internal resources. That means that 1998 
will mark the first time in 28 years we will not have to go to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8403"> 8403 </A></B>
<P>
markets for new money. It will put the Canadian federal 
government in an enviable position internationally.
<P>
	Financial requirements of course is the way most other major 
countries measure their deficits. By eliminating them in 1998, 
Canada will have the best financial record of any G-7 country 
based on current national budget plans.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It must be clear that the turnaround of Canada's public finances 
is not the work of the federal government alone-it is a national 
accomplishment. The provinces and territories significantly 
improved their financial situation too and continue to do so. This is 
why the total deficit in the government sector should improve 
considerably in Canada, compared to the other countries in the G7.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to return to a key point. Our federal deficit improvement 
has been overwhelmingly achieved through cuts in program 
spending instead of boosting the tax burden.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Higher taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> The member opposite talks about higher 
revenues. He is against a growing economy.
<P>
	In 1998-99, federal program spending will have fallen for six 
consecutive years in absolute terms. Look at the figures. As a 
percentage of GDP, government revenues have been outstripped by 
cuts in spending by government. In fact in 1998-99, federal 
program spending will have fallen for six consecutive years in 
absolute terms and it will be almost 14 per cent below its level in 
1993-94.
<P>
	This progress on the deficit front has a vital carryover to our 
federal debt. It will translate into the first significant decline in the 
federal debt to GDP ratio since the mid-1970s by over three full 
percentage points over the next two years.
<P>
	This is being achieved by cuts that are reasonable, that the 
Canadian people are able to absorb and that they are supportive of. 
They are cuts that are not gutting the vital social programs of this 
country and they are not gutting this country in the process. Our 
approach has emphasized action inside government. There were no 
increases in personal income tax rates. In the 1997 budget there are 
no tax increases whatsoever.
<P>
	There is another way to underscore this point. Of the cumulative 
fiscal actions we will have taken in the last three years, almost 90 
per cent have been expenditure savings.
<P>
	The bottom line is that we have reformed the entire structure of 
program spending. Our approach has been balanced and one that 
recognizes two critical interrelated  goals. It is not good enough 
just to get our fiscal house in order in a way that is sustainable. We 
also have to make sure that our approach advances our economic 
growth and job creation objectives and strengthens social 
well-being.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance said in his budget speech: ``The 
responsibility of government is to do more than just balance the 
books''. That is why, in line with our financial improvement, the 
1997 budget announced targeted initiatives to further advance our 
economic and social priorities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In economic terms, we are investing in tourism, small business 
and rural development. Each of these sectors offers significant job 
creation possibilities.
<P>
	In a world where economic and technological change moves 
exponentially, we must build the foundations of tomorrow's jobs 
and competitive advantages. This is why we are also investing in 
higher education and innovation-through a foundation with $800 
million in funding to support projects in the areas of the science, 
engineering, health and the environment.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Further, our government remains committed to the fact that a 
strong economy is built on a strong society and a strong society is 
one that cares for those in need. Surely this is a fundamental raison 
d'être for government itself.
<P>
	Our deficit reduction plan has not been a smoke screen for 
government withdrawing but for continuing to be able to stand 
alongside Canadians. We are providing new support to strengthen 
the health care system. We are moving with the provinces toward a 
more effective national system of assistance to low income 
families with children. We want to put an end to the welfare trap 
where families can end up worse off by returning to work.
<P>
	These investments have been carefully designed so that our 
fiscal targets are not in any jeopardy. Nearly 80 per cent of these 
initiatives take the form of targeted tax relief rather than increased 
spending.
<P>
	Even with our new measures, the level of program spending in 
1997-98 and 1998-99 will still be lower than what was projected in 
last year's budget. The members opposite must be sitting there 
asking: ``How do they do it?'' We do it with reasoned and prudent 
action in the interests of Canadians.
<P>
	I focused most of my remarks on our fiscal success. Let me 
repeat that financial turnaround is itself an investment in some-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8404"> 8404 </A></B>
<P>
thing bigger: the economic future of our country and its ability to 
provide Canadians with jobs and growth and preserve valuable 
social assistance.
<P>
	Because time is short, I am going to conclude. There has been a 
repetitive mantra through my remarks, that results are or will be the 
best ever. That only reflects the magnitude of the fiscal and 
economic turnaround that hard work by Canadians and tough 
choices by government has won us.
<P>
	It is easy to forget how dismal the prospects were when we came 
to office in the fall of 1993 and how concerned all members of the 
House were about where we would be three years hence. The 
economic challenges were formidable, but our resolve has been 
firm, our plan consistent and concrete. As a result our economic 
and fiscal fundamentals are strong and are improving. We will not 
let that progress falter because it has not been a goal in itself but a 
means to ensure that Canadians have a strong and vibrant economy 
that provides long term jobs and a society we can be proud of 
because it does not deliberately leave anyone behind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am dismayed to hear the parliamentary secretary speak about a 
government budget defended by building strawmen to hack down. 
Is that all this budget is about?
<P>
	He talks about what Reform has done. It is the Liberals who have 
hacked billions out of our social programs, out of our health care 
system and then before an election gives back a few thousand. That 
is the nature of this budget and that is why we are so disappointed.
<P>
	In terms of health care there is not going to be any improvement 
from this budget in the six hospitals in my constituency nor in the 
hospitals in the outlying areas. This is a shadow budget.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary spoke about the friends of Reform 
and that Reformers want to reduce spending for their friends. That 
is true. But let me tell the House who our friends are.
<P>
	Our friends are the ordinary Canadian people who want jobs, 
who want medical care when they need it, who want the freedom 
and opportunity to earn their living and to enjoy the fruits of their 
labour. Our friends are the Canadian people who reject the Liberal 
determination that the government can care for them, can take care 
of capable people better than those same capable people can take 
care of themselves. These are our friends. It is true that we want to 
reduce spending on their behalf.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	Why does the government continue to promote the philosophical 
idea with the budget that Canadians must continually sacrifice and 
serve the needs of government when what they need is a 
government that will simply and unobtrusively serve the Canadian 
people?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, talk about rhetoric. It is really 
incredible. My copy of the taxpayers' budget in brief is getting sort 
of dog eared. It is interesting reading. When I look through it, it is 
really incredible.
<P>
	Reformers suggest they have a better way. Let me explain their 
better way. Their better way has been called slash and burn. Their 
better way would gut the very programs we are saving and 
preserving for Canadians, for instance the CPP, support for seniors, 
the employment insurance program. Their broad and dramatic cuts 
would have kicked in by now if their budget had governed the 
country over the last three years. Instead we have had a reasoned, 
prudent and balanced approach and this country has survived 
enormous sacrifices.
<P>
	I would like the member opposite to come to my riding and talk 
to people who have shared the pain with other Canadians of the cuts 
we have made and tell them that they should be cut deeper and 
longer to make the same achievement faster than we are making 
prudently in a reasoned and measured way which Canadians 
support because it supports their values.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I enjoy 
debating the budget with my colleagues from the other side. There 
seems to be a great deal of misconception by them about what they 
are actually saying and about what Canadians actually want to hear.
<P>
	The member talked about how we would gut programs. But look 
at the estimates that were tabled this morning. This very morning 
we learned that the Liberal plan for the Canada health and social 
transfer to the provinces involves a decline from $14.9 billion to 
$12.5 billion, a reduction of $2.4 billion. That is about 18 per cent 
that they will gut out of health care. They will throw a few peanuts 
back and think they are doing everybody a service.
<P>
	We listened to the parliamentary secretary tell us about his 
deficit targets: 2 per cent this year, 1 per cent next year, zero per 
cent the following year. When I take a look at ``Getting 
Government Right: A Progress Report'', page four, table one, they 
are talking about a balanced budget next year. Mr. Speaker, I know 
you are rather sensitive about these comparisons but there is a clear 
contradiction between what the parliamentary secretary is saying 
and what their publication from this morning is saying.
<P>
	I can hear it now. At election time they are going to say: 
``Hallelujah brother, we've got a balanced budget coming down the 
pipe. Vote for us''. The smoke and mirrors and the spin doctors are 
at it already.
<P>
	Let us find out how they are gutting business. Their figures from 
the estimates tabled this morning show a surplus of $6 billion in the 
employment insurance fund last year. The projected surplus next 
year is $5.6 billion.
<P>
	The infrastructure program, which was going to create all those 
jobs, jobs, jobs was a $6 billion municipal  infrastructure program 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8405"> 8405 </A></B>
<P>
that put new canopies on town halls and built boccie courts and so 
on. They have quietly sucked out of business-that great sucking 
noise of jobs disappearing down the drain-$5 billion next year 
and $6 billion last year. That is gutting business.
<P>
	I have a final point on the hypocrisy of this government. I 
remember December 11, 1995 when the Prime Minister stood up in 
the House and said that we are going to pass a motion in this House 
that says that ``we recognize that Quebec's distinct society includes 
its French-speaking majority, unique culture and civil law 
traditions, and we undertake to be guided by this reality. We 
encourage all components of the legislative branches to take note 
and be guided in their conduct accordingly''.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	My question for the parliamentary secretary is this. Can he tell 
us how the motion passed by an order of the House is reflected in 
the budget and in the estimates tabled this morning?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me take the last part first 
because it is easy. The hon. member opposite asks about the 
motion. This budget is in the interest of all Canadians.
<P>
	Let me come to the substance of what he was saying. I have 
many numbers in front of me from their budget which, not 
surprisingly, do not add up.
<P>
	I guess I cannot comment on who is here and who is not, but I 
wish the member could hear this. On March 1, 1995, the member 
who just spoke but who is not here to listen supported a 
subamendment to the budget that asked that the budget be defeated 
because it failed to eliminate the deficit quickly and decisively 
enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We have a 
rule in this House that says that members cannot note the absence 
or presence of others. The parliamentary secretary made reference 
to my not being here. I am here.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> You weren't here.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member will know that the Speaker 
and I were discussing something very important no doubt. I did not 
realize that the member was not here. I would ask members not to 
refer to the absence of any other of their colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, where I come from we have a 
courtesy that we do not turn our backs on each other when we have 
asked somebody a question. On March 1, 1995, the member 
opposite voted in support of a subamendment on the budget saying 
that it should be defeated for its failure to eliminate the deficit 
quickly and decisively. In other words, more cuts, deeper cuts than 
the ones he is criticizing right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak on Tuesday's budget. I rate the finance minister's 
performance an F.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Yes, an F, not for everything that is in the budget but 
more for what is not in the budget. Some of the members opposite 
will chuckle and laugh at this but yes, he rates an F. I know he 
thinks the whole world is in love with him and he can walk on 
water but he only deserves an F.
<P>
	He gets an F for failing to recognize the real problem: the debt 
and the interest costs to service that debt. We are headed in the right 
direction by reducing the deficit but the finance minister gets an F 
for the inconsistent application of fundamentals, for not acting 
quicker on spending cuts like doing them in his first year, and for 
not making spending cuts in other areas, not just in the Canada 
health and social transfer and defence.
<P>
	He took $7.5 billion out of direct aid to health, education and 
welfare. Yet he brags about the Liberals' philosophy of caring and 
sharing with Canadian society is the be all and the end all to the 
Canadian public. Only Liberals know how to serve the Canadian 
public. None of the opposition parties know. The Liberals have 
knifed, slashed, scorched, burned $7.5 billion out of health, 
education and welfare. That is too much.
<P>
	We say in our fresh start program that we need to reinfuse, 
reinject $4 billion into health and education. Where do we get this 
money? We get it from reallocation of the existing budget and by 
reducing spending in the area of direct grants and subsidies to 
business by $2 billion. The elimination of regional development 
grants are close to a billion dollars. Also, savings through 
priorization could generate another billion dollars.
<P>
	Do we really need another infrastructure program? All 
provinces, including our so-called ideological cousins of Alberta 
and Ontario, the Conservatives, have been duped. I say to Mr. Klein 
and to Mr. Harris: ``Wake up''. What the infrastructure 
development is all about is fighting over budgets: one-third, 
one-third, one-third. The federal government has convinced the 
provinces that they are paying for one-third and that the other 
levels of government get two-thirds leverage. Whichever they are, 
the other two levels pay the two-thirds.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The premiers should wake up. They are forgetting there is only 
one taxpayer, whose high level of taxation will remain high if 
politicians keep spending on untimely and unnecessary projects.
<P>
	I am not against infrastructure. It is important. That is why taxes 
are paid. Alberta has a surplus. It should apply the surplus to the 
infrastructure and the social services that are needed without 
adding to the debt, without borrowing from the federal 
government, which in turn borrows from taxpayers, which keeps 
our taxes too high.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8406"> 8406 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government is simply buying votes and the premiers 
and mayors of the country who participate are willing 
accomplices.
<P>
	This good but not great finance minister has raised tax revenues 
by $24 billion. He has not done that by raising the personal tax rate 
but by broadening the personal and corporate tax base and not 
lowering the rate. Yes, he gets an F for not coming clean with the 
Canadian public. He has raised tax revenues. He gets an F for 
saying he has not raised taxes.
<P>
	He has reduced overall spending by $14.2 billion. By next year it 
will be $16.5 billion. However, he has increased spending by 
adding $100 billion to the debt, thereby adding an extra $8 billion 
per year to the annual interest cost to service the debt which will 
now stand at $46 billion. The government came in four years ago at 
$38 billion. The finance minister gets an F for not telling 
Canadians that this interest cost could jeopardize their future 
needs.
<P>
	The interest cost is the cancer that is killing and shrinking the 
money which is available for our social safety net. The finance 
minister gets an F in finance for misdirecting, for three years, the 
public's attention solely to the deficit and creating the very false 
illusion or impression that once the deficit is under control we will 
have greater flexibility and prosperity will be around the corner. 
For heaven's sake, the finance minister has concentrated on the 
deficit for too long and used strong rhetoric for so long that the 
editorial board of the Toronto <I>Star</I>, that wonderful paper, asked: 
``What is the finance minister going to do with this windfall of $7 
billion that he is ahead on his deficit target?'' They want him to 
spend that $7 billion.
<P>
	This government came in with a $38 billion deficit, inflated it to 
$42 billion, blamed the Conservatives, and has now reduced it to 
$19 billion. A $42 billion deficit is awful. It is bad. But a $19 
billion deficit is awful. It is just as bad. The whole point of the 
matter is that we have to start to create a surplus.
<P>
	If we do not reduce the debt, what will happen? What if the 
interest rate was 9 per cent today instead of the 4.5 to 5 per cent we 
are paying? What would our interest payment be? I shudder to 
think of it. That interest payment would be much higher than $46 
billion. It would force Canadians to sacrifice much more than they 
are now. The finance minister gets an F for not sharing these 
possibilities with Canadians.
<P>
	The debt to GDP ratio is important. It is more important than the 
deficit, yet we have spent four years arguing about the size of the 
deficit. What a shame.
<P>
	If the debt is not reduced, interest costs could skyrocket and 
really blow a hole in our economy. So we continue to live in fear 
and uncertainty, which is why our economy stumbles along at a 1.5 
per cent to 2.5 per cent  growth rate per year. Now the Liberals are 
trying to tell Canadians that is a great growth rate, it is fantastic.
<P>
	If we created surpluses in the budget we could service some of 
the debt, the economy could grow at 4 per cent or 5 per cent. That is 
growth. That is when opportunities would create jobs.
<P>
	He gets an F because he has not created or developed a business 
plan like the province of Alberta. That business plan should be 
published with the budget estimates, which would justify each and 
every program expenditure. It would not just say, ``here is what we 
spent''. It would be a business plan which justifies why the 
government is spending on infrastructure, why it is spending so 
much on health, why it is spending so much on agriculture, and for 
what purpose, and why it is supporting the wheat board and what 
the wheat board is doing. It would be a business plan.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Then we will find out that maybe we should not be involved in 
these areas and leave it to the provinces. Then the provinces can do 
the same thing. Maybe they should not be involved. They can leave 
it to municipalities and stay out of those jurisdictions. That is 
another big, huge saving.
<P>
	He gets an <I>F</I> for not apply this financial acumen to his budget. 
He gets a huge <I>F</I> for his failure to recognize that if on the one hand 
we cannot lower personal tax rates during a deficit period, even 
though he claims to have broken the back of the deficit, how is it 
that we can increase spending, as he just did in Tuesday's budget by 
a couple of billion dollars? How is that? Are they not one and the 
same? One is when we spend there is a possibility of a return that 
would flow through the economy, but so does a tax break.
<P>
	Finally, he gets an <I>F</I> for the contradictions and inconsistencies in 
applying his financial values. CPP has problems. CPP has to be 
corrected. There is no question. But he has changed it, he has 
panicked, he has over reacted. A 70 per cent increase is too much. 
There is a $39 billion surplus in that fund and yes, we take out more 
than we bring in on a pay as you go basis, but there are some other 
solutions.
<P>
	He has an EI surplus of $5 billion, soon to be $9 billion, which 
belongs to the provinces, but the government only pays the 
provinces once a year. On the backs of the unemployed he is 
lowering that deficit and that is not right. He gets an <I>F</I>.
<P>
	There is another <I>F</I> for going against generally accepted 
accounting principles. He did it last year with that billion dollar 
bribe-I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, with that billion dollar payment to 
the provinces on a plan for the harmonization which comes into 
effect April 1 of this year. There was only a letter of intent signed 
prior to March 31 of this past year. According to the auditor general 
that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8407"> 8407 </A></B>
<P>
was borderline. This year he is doing it again on investing in the 
Canada Foundation for Innovation.
<P>
	He is charging off $800 million to year ending 1997. Is their a 
contract? Did the provinces sign? Do they know how to spend the 
money? Who gets the money? How can he do that? Against 
generally accepted accounting principles he is setting a bad 
precedent. He is playing ``Monopoly'' with the accounts of this 
nation and it is not right. He gets an <I>F</I> for going against generally 
accepted accounting principles.
<P>
	He says he did a great job of cutting. Of the $14 billion to date he 
gets an <I>F</I> because over half of it has just been downloading on the 
provinces and he has not looked at his own programs.
<P>
	The department of defence has been the best run department. It 
has done the best job of analysing, doing a business plan, making 
the cuts, privatizing and then what is left is to serve the Canadian 
public. Why can we not do that in Revenue Canada, that over 
bloated, over intrusive department of $2.2 billion in costs and 
40,000 plus civil servants? It is away too big. Why can we not cut 
that down? But no. The finance minister gets an F on this budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to make comments on my friend's comments. I 
remember one of the first times I stood in this House I was sitting 
in the rump. I said to the hon. member that it seems like some of the 
most reasonable people come from Calgary. Of course, I excluded 
from those comments the leader of the third party. It seems to me 
when we get to the next election-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> On a point of order, the member for St. 
Albert.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is making 
disparaging remarks against the leader of the Reform Party and I 
would ask him to withdraw.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The language used was not 
unparliamentary. Unfortunately a great deal of what is said in this 
House is criticizing other members and unfortunately that is still 
allowed. The hon. member for Waterloo has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am amazed that the member 
opposite cannot even accept a compliment given to a previous 
speaker and would stand up and complain. I am quite surprised.
<P>
	Be that as it may, I did make a comment that there were those 
three reasonable members and unfortunately none of them will be 
running in the next election.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Let me raise some points with regard to the speech. The member 
mentioned, for instance, that somehow Ralph Klein and Mike 
Harris were being conned into the infrastructure program and it 
was a waste of money. The member knows I come from the federal 
riding of Waterloo and I have two excellent universities in my 
riding.
<P>
	I would like to tell the member that when we invested in 
infrastructure, and part of the investment in infrastructure went to 
the universities, we invested in the future of our young, in our 
future work force, so we can compete worldwide and win. Instead 
of saying that the Minister of Finance gets an <I>F</I> on that, the 
Minister of Finance gets an <I>A</I>.
<P>
	Let me further tell the hon. member that at the present time in 
Waterloo, the University of Waterloo supplies the greatest number 
of workers for Microsoft in the United States. Surely the member 
would understand that having Canadian graduates go through 
taxpayer funded universities in Canada and ending up working in a 
high tech job in the United States-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if I heard a question in 
there but I think I have a general idea of where the member was 
going.
<P>
	I do believe infrastructure is very important. I did not say it is not 
important. It is one of the first areas we should spend the Canadian 
tax dollars we collect but it is when you spend it and how you spend 
it. It is an admission of failure by the three levels of government 
when all of a sudden because the federal government announces a 
plan they say that they have bridges to fix and roads to pave. For 
example, the mayor of Ottawa wants as much as she can get out of 
this infrastructure to build a hotel here. That is not what 
infrastructure money is for. It is more in the private sector.
<P>
	The same for Calgary when they spent $9 million on the 
Saddledome. That was not what the infrastructure should have been 
for. That should have been done by private sector. What happened 
to the private sector? What happened to the risk reward 
relationship? As politicians if we get embedded with the private 
sector there is going to become a conflict of interest. They are not 
going to be able to say no. Which companies do you help? Then the 
marketplace is distorted.
<P>
	The $800 million plan for the Canada foundation of the Network 
of Centres of Excellence is a good way to spend that expenditure 
money. It will be spread out over time, it will not all be in the 1997 
budget but yet it is included in here. That is why I say it is against 
generally accepted accounting principles. Unless there are signed 
agreements with everybody on the $800 million, and I hope there is 
and I am sure the auditor general will let us know whether there is 
or not. Fudging deficit numbers just for the sake of the deficit is 
creating an illusion that we have money to spend. We do not. A 
deficit is a minus, albeit a $19 billion minus is a lot less than a $42 
billion minus and it is a big improvement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8408"> 8408 </A></B>
<P>
	I compliment the government for reducing the deficit but I 
criticize the government and give it an <I>F</I> for not doing it sooner 
and faster when it knows the real problem is the debt. The finance 
minister gets an <I>F</I> because his rhetoric does not match the reality. 
The reality is that he took $7.5 billion from the poor for education 
and hospitals.
<P>
	Look at what Ontario finance minister Ernie Eaves said. He said 
``they took away $2 billion and now they are going to give us back 
$200 million''. He is mistaken if he thinks that $200 million that 
this government is giving back, both for infrastructure and on the 
social services, is coming soon and without strings attached, 
without rules as to how he has to spend that money. This fight is not 
over. He said he wants to help the disabled, the students and he lays 
out a big program but it is spread out over three years. Two-thirds 
of the money if not more is after the next election.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	The biggest scam of all and the one I am going to predict right 
now is the one which will happen in the next federal election to be 
called for June. After the election has been called for June and after 
we hit the year ending March 1997 we will have a projected $19 
billion deficit. It is not a $19 billion deficit. He knows it is not a 
$19 billion deficit. He could have said that as of today it is only $17 
billion but he is not going to. He is actually going to announce a 
$16 billion deficit. He can now do a tax relief and he can promise 
this and that.
<P>
	This finance minister gets an <I>F</I> for not matching the rhetoric 
with the reality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to present my views on the budget that was 
presented by the Minister of Finance the other day.
<P>
	Perhaps I will widen the debate to include some remarks about 
the Canada pension plan. I know the Minister of Finance will say 
that is not in the budget figures, therefore it really does not matter. 
We all know that last week he announced an increase of 70 per cent 
on CPP premiums. That is going to take $10 billion a year out of 
business.
<P>
	I remember in the last election how the Liberals ran around 
trying to drum up votes by saying ``we will create jobs, jobs, jobs 
through a $6 billion infrastructure program''. Well, good-bye 
infrastructure, good-bye a $6 billion incentive for business because 
now they are going to suck $10 billion out of the business world.
<P>
	That is why I think we should be using Ross Perot's words, the 
great sucking sound of jobs disappearing, not down to Mexico as in 
the case of Mr. Perot, but sucking out of our economy because the 
Minister of Finance is sucking this money out of the pockets of 
business.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the seniors benefit. Let us take a look at 
what Minister of Finance is actually talking about  for seniors. Not 
only is he going to kill these jobs with the 70 per cent increase in 
premiums, but, as I said earlier today, the old age security is going 
to be gone. It is going to be killed, finished and gone forever.
<P>
	Guaranteed income supplements that many people have relied 
upon in this country will be gone. In the year 2001 they will be 
finished and gone forever.
<P>
	Seniors have been given a $3,500 tax free allowance on top of 
the basic exemption. That is gone courtesy of this finance minister; 
gone, killed, finished forever.
<P>
	Seniors have been entitled to the first $1,000 of pension income 
tax free. Let me tell this House that tax free exemption is going to 
be gone, absolutely finished courtesy of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	He has the gall to stand up in this House to say he is going to 
replace it with a seniors benefit that is going to make everybody 
happy. Let me tell this House about the seniors benefit that he 
thinks is going to make everybody happy.
<P>
	If a person has any income besides the seniors benefit, and let us 
talk about a senior who only has the seniors benefit and Canada 
pension, nothing else in the world, the Minister of Finance is going 
to take back half of the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	It has to be a national disgrace that he can stand here and say this 
is good for seniors when he is going to take back half the Canada 
pension plan and all they have is a seniors benefit and Canada 
pension plan.
<P>
	Then he has the gall to stand up and say Canada pension plan 
premiums are an investment, when no one will even be able to 
collect the Canada pension plan when they retire. That is the way 
this government is trying to balance the budget. It is through 
deception and through misleading senior citizens into thinking 
everything is going to be okay, but it is not.
<P>
	Universality that was brought in by the finance minister's father 
is going to be destroyed by finance minister junior. That is the way 
it is. There is no universality any more. It is gone courtesy of this 
Minister of Finance. That is the legacy that he is giving to 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	I look at the flowery words in the budget speech and I refer to the 
bottom of page 17 where it states: ``Reforms to both the Canada 
pension plan and the seniors benefit fully protect all current 
seniors''. If we read it fast it sounds pretty good but I draw 
attention to the word current, all current seniors. There is no word 
about seniors to be, no word about the working people who have to 
pay more to collect less. With a little sleight of hand a little word is 
slipped in. It is grammatically correct but when we look at the real 
meaning behind it we will find that seniors, the people who will 
retire in the future will get a lot less after having paid a lot more.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8409"> 8409 </A></B>
<P>
	I talked also about the employment insurance and the scandal 
that is being perpetrated on the business world of this country. 
This morning the estimates were tabled. In part III under Human 
Resources Development Canada at the bottom of page 52 I see 
for 1996-97 a $6 billion surplus and the projected surplus for next 
year is $5.656 billion.
<P>
	That is a travesty because the employment insurance fund is 
supposed to be self-sustaining to help people who lose their jobs 
when the business cycle is down. It is not an extra tax trough for the 
Minister of Finance. The minister said: ``I am not raising taxes''. 
Of course he is. He should not under any circumstances whatsoever 
maintain the EI premium where it is because of the huge surplus he 
is squeezing out of business.
<P>
	The minister came out with a little sum for the young people, the 
university graduates saying: ``I am going to spend a couple of 
hundred million dollars to try and get you a job''. At the same time 
he is taking $6 billion out of the business world so that they cannot 
get a job. Note the numbers.
<P>
	I look at pages 10 and 11 of the budget and how the numbers are 
glossed over. On page 11, payroll taxes, the minister said: ``When 
we came to office, we acted immediately to stop EI premium rates 
from rising''. Well maybe he did, but he certainly did not bring 
them down as he should have. While he says he is going to bring 
them down, it will not be for another year so that he can squeeze 
this money out of business and stand in the House again to say: 
``Boy, I am doing a great job''. Business bankruptcies are at a 
record high; personal bankruptcies are at a record high; 1.5 million 
people are out of a job; and one in four working Canadians fear for 
their jobs because he is sucking $6 billion a year out of the business 
economy.
<P>
	What about the health and social transfer? Government members 
stand in the House and say: ``We will protect medicare''. Protect 
medicare, my foot. Compare the figures for this year to those for 
last year and again the figures are taken right out of the estimates. 
The transfer for 1996-97 is $14.9 billion. That is a lot of money. 
Not as much as the government used to give, but it is still a lot of 
money. However, next year it will be $12.5 billion, a drop of $2.4 
billion.
<P>
	That affects a lot of hospitals. That is a lot for medicare. That is a 
lot of nurses and doctors who could be looking after the people in 
this country who need help. For the elective surgery that does not 
get done, $2.4 billion buys a lot. It is not being bought and it is not 
being provided. People are doing without because the government 
is keeping back $2.4 billion so the Minister of Finance can say: 
``Boy, am I doing a great job''.
<P>
	Perhaps the deficit is coming down, but he could bring it down 
even more. However the Liberal tendency is to spend every nickel 
they can find. The minister cannot keep his fingers off any money 
that might be available. I look at page 16 of his budget speech 
where he said that he intends to spend 25 per cent of any excess 
over projections so that he can blow it away on little Liberal 
programs that are going to buy votes in the next election.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	Let us remember that the excess over the budget predictions, the 
deficit having come down faster than he predicted, was 
accomplished strictly on the backs of businesses and taxpayers. 
Now that he has squeezed more money out of them than he had 
originally anticipated, he is going to take 25 per cent of it to buy 
votes at the next election. It is despicable.
<P>
	My friend for Calgary Centre gave the finance minister an F for 
failing to deliver a budget with integrity; for failing to deliver the 
kind of budget which Canadians deserve; for failing to deliver jobs; 
for failing to deliver health care; for failing to deliver education; 
and for failing to look after our seniors.
<P>
	That is how I feel about this budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have been listening intently to the member for St. Albert. He made 
some rather negative comments about the Canada pension plan. I 
would invite the member to come to one of the several senior 
citizens homes in my riding and say the denigrating things that he 
has said about the Canada pension plan. I am wondering how long 
he would last in a senior citizens home.
<P>
	Elderly men and women worked hard to build this country. They 
worked hard to support the Canada pension plan. They contributed 
a considerable amount of their own wealth to the Canada pension 
plan. The very last thing they want is for some government to 
abandon their hopes and the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	The word from the senior citizens of this country to the 
government has been very clear: ``We want you to secure the 
Canada pension plan. We want you to secure the future of the 
Canada pension plan. We dare you to destroy the Canada pension 
plan. We dare you to weaken the Canada pension plan''.
<P>
	Government members have listened to those people and we have 
responded. We have done exactly that. We have secured the future 
of the Canada pension plan. We have done that because Canadians 
have told us that we must show that we have a social conscience 
and that we have a collective responsibility to each other, which is 
totally unlike the Reform Party of Canada. That party believes in a 
kind of pernicious individualism; everybody for themselves; the 
law of the jungle, that we do not care for each other.
<P>
	Those are not our values. They are not the values of Canadians. 
They are certainly not the values of the elderly citizens of this 
country. We support the Canada pension plan.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8410"> 8410 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course the Reform Party neglects to say that the 
contributions to the CPP will be increased over a period of six 
years. The premiums have been increased because we want to 
secure the future of the CPP. That is exactly what we have done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me say to the hon. member that I 
would be more than glad to visit the seniors in his riding. However, 
if I went to explain the Liberal policy, I feel that I would not last too 
long in that senior citizens home.
<P>
	This is the Liberal plan which was announced by the Minister of 
Finance a year ago. This is not a Reform plan. It is not my plan and 
it is not the plan of the parliamentary secretary. This plan was 
announced by the Minister of Finance. Let me go over it again.
<P>
	Old age security is completely gone. The guaranteed income 
supplement is gone. The $3,500 tax free for seniors is gone. The 
first $1,000 of pension income for seniors is gone. These four 
things are gone completely. In their place will be a seniors benefit.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I explained it before but in case the parliamentary secretary did 
not get it quite clear, let me say it again. If the retired people in the 
seniors home in his riding only have the seniors benefit and Canada 
pension plan, the Minister of Finance will take half the Canada 
pension plan. That is the Liberal proposal. That is why I would get 
run out of that seniors citizens home if I started to explain Liberal 
policy.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary stands and says: ``We secured the 
CPP''. Let me also say that he secured the MPPP, the MPs pension 
plan that he participates in and which he has secured for himself. It 
will pay tens of thousands of dollars to him each and every year 
while the government will pay a mere pittance to other seniors 
which it will tax back if it ever thinks they are going to make any 
money. But there is no clawback and no tax back on the MP 
pension plan. Oh, no. We would not want that would we?
<P>
	The member stands and says that he has secured the pension 
plan. He has secured a better one for himself, a lot better for 
himself, a great deal better for himself. We have heard of the tens 
of thousands of dollars that some MPs are going to collect. That is 
the hypocrisy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Mississauga West.
<P>
	It is a great pleasure to rise in my place today to speak in support 
of our government's 1997 budget. This budget reflects the very 
values and institutions that we cherish as Canadians. It highlights 
our commitment to health care, to improved access to education 
and training opportunities, and to working to improve the 
well-being of children and our young people.
<P>
	It is a budget that underscores the principles of fairness and 
putting people first. It contains important measures that will give 
more Canadians the opportunity to participate fully and actively in 
the life of our country. This is not just a Liberal budget, it is a 
budget that we as Canadians can be proud of.
<P>
	When our government took office in 1993, the nation's finances 
were in disarray. The deficit stood at $42 billion, unemployment 
was at 11.4 per cent and the very future of our social programs was 
under threat. What a difference four years have made. This year our 
deficit will be no higher than $19 billion and in 1998-99 our 
government will no longer need to borrow new money from our 
financial markets. In short, we are regaining our financial 
sovereignty.
<P>
	The people of my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants have made 
sacrifices over the last few years in the name of deficit reduction. 
All Canadians have been made to do with less in terms of federal 
programs and services. Many of my constituents have reminded me 
that deficit reduction does have a human face. They have said: ``If 
you cut programs indiscriminately, real people and families will 
suffer''. That is why I am proud of our government's approach to 
deficit reduction. By moving at a responsible pace, we have 
dramatically reduced our deficit while preserving Canada's social 
safety net.
<P>
	I have always seen our deficit reduction efforts as a means to a 
greater end. While we must continue to follow a path of fiscal 
prudence and responsibility, we can now see a light at the end of the 
tunnel. We now have a certain amount of flexibility to invest in the 
future of our people and in the future of Canada.
<P>
	Let us take a moment to look at the troubling level of child 
poverty and how this impacts upon Canada. Last December I had 
the opportunity to participate in a prebudget debate in this House. 
At that time I joined with colleagues from all sides of the House in 
stating unequivocally that the rate of child poverty in Canada was 
unacceptably high.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	Too many Canadian children are not getting the start they need to 
become healthy, happy and productive adults. This is not only a 
personal tragedy but is a loss for a nation as a whole. Our 
government is taking important steps to address these problems.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance announced in his remarks on 
Tuesday, our government is committed along with our provincial 
counterparts to a new cross-Canada child benefit system. We will 
increase federal spending on children by $850 million by July 
1998. This includes $600 million of new money on top of the $250 
million announced in last year's budget.
<P>
	Under the new approach the new Canada child tax benefit will go 
to all eligible families, those working and those on welfare. That 
will allow provincial governments  to take some of the money they 
currently spend on welfare and redirect it into the services and 
programs for working poor families, such as in the area of child

<P>
care. As the Minister of Finance also said in his budget speech, 
there can be no more worthy effort that a new partnership on behalf 
of Canada's children.
<P>
	I also want to endorse our government's hundred million dollar 
commitment to two important programs. I am referring of course to 
the community action program for children and the prenatal 
nutritional program. I have seen firsthand the benefits of proactive 
early childhood health programs. I can say unequivocally that these 
programs are truly making a difference for children and families 
across Canada.
<P>
	In the months leading up to the budget I worked closely with the 
Nova Scotia Association of Family Resource Projects in its effort 
to create greater awareness and understanding of the benefits of 
this type of programming. I brought its concerns to Ottawa and to 
this House. I am pleased that the government is responding to the 
needs of Canada's children.
<P>
	I want to take the opportunity to thank all of those front line 
workers and volunteers who work so diligently to make these 
programs successful both in Annapolis Valley-Hants and in the 
communities across this country.
<P>
	Our commitment to health care does not stop there. Our 
government will also provide $150 million over the next three 
years to help the provinces put in place projects that will enable 
them to test new ways in which our health system can be improved. 
Projects could include new approaches to home care, drug 
coverage and other innovations.
<P>
	Prior to entering the field of politics my entire working life was 
spent in the health field. I know that health care ingenuity has 
excelled in my riding. I also know that when it comes to new ideas 
and better ways to deliver health care services the professionals and 
the citizens living and working in Annapolis Valley-Hants will 
rise to the forefront.
<P>
	I would like now to turn for a moment to discuss the important 
topics of jobs and growth and particularly our efforts in rural 
Canada. Annapolis Valley-Hants, as the House knows, is 
predominately a rural riding. Those of us who live in rural 
communities face unique challenges as we work to preserve and 
enhance economic opportunities.
<P>
	I was pleased therefore to listen to the Minister of Finance as he 
committed our government to ensure that rural Canada has every 
opportunity to fully participate in everything this government has 
to offer. Let me show some of the facts.
<P>
	Our government is making a $50 million investment in the Farm 
Credit Corporation. We are investing $45 million over three years 
in the Canadian Tourism Commission. We are contributing an 
additional $30 million to the community access program. Our 
government is raising the ceiling under the Small Business Loans 
Act from $12 billion to $14 billion and we are reducing the paper 
burden for small businesses by allowing many of them to file 
quarterly reports rather than monthly reports.
<P>
	This will greatly reduce their costs, their time burden and they 
will be able to hold their money longer.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	All of these measures, combined with the initiatives such as the 
extension of the infrastructure program, the $350 million youth 
employment program and the extension of the residential 
rehabilitation assistance program, will effectively respond to the 
challenges facing rural Canada and allow for more innovation and 
growth, both in my riding and in communities and businesses 
across this country.
<P>
	Knowledge and education are the key to long term economic 
success for any nation. This is again part of the infrastructure that 
we are investing into as government. Our government recognizes 
that by investing in education and innovation now we will see a 
tremendous payback over the long term.
<P>
	Last November I attended a student rally at Acadia university in 
my riding. At this event many students told me that one of the 
greatest problems they faced was a growing personal debt burden. I 
brought these concerns back to Ottawa and joined with many of my 
colleagues here in addressing the question how to help students and 
families cope with the costs.
<P>
	Our government has taken a number of important measures and 
as a result of this budget federal support for post-secondary 
education will increase by $137 million in 1997. We are doubling 
the annual contribution limits for the registered education savings 
plan. We have introduced provisions to allow students to carry 
forward unused education credits indefinitely. We are doubling the 
educational tax credit and we have extended interest relief on 
student loans for those who are unable to make their payments 
from 18 to 30 months.
<P>
	As well, our government is establishing the Canada Foundation 
for Innovation. I belief this program is tailor made for Nova 
Scotians and institutions such as Acadia University, 
pharmaceutical companies and health institutions, all of which are 
in my riding. This program will help Canada's research 
infrastructure.
<P>
	This budget builds on our previous efforts and sets a clear course 
for a brighter future. A course that will-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the comments of the member for Annapolis  
Valley-Hants. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8412"> 8412 </A></B>
<P>
Naturally, since he is on the government side, he is trying very hard 
to sell that budget to Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to ask if he feels comfortable knowing that the 
Minister of Finance's deficit reduction, his great accomplishment, 
has been achieved thanks to the $5 billion cuts in unemployment 
insurance and the $4.5 billion cuts in transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	He speaks about the measures implemented by the government, 
but we say they are a mere pittance, nothing but election goodies. 
He speaks about farm credit, but I must remind the House that farm 
credit does not mean grants; it means credit and therefore, debt. 
The figures represent loans and not costs for the government. The 
government simply makes the money available, but the amounts 
have to be paid back.
<P>
	As far as students are concerned, I was in charge of the youth 
portfolio until a few months ago and I can tell the House the 
situation for young people is appalling; they are loaded down with 
debts. What measures is the government taking? It is giving the 
students more time before they have to start paying back their 
loans. That will not solve the problem of student debt, it will not 
help reduce the high number of student bankruptcies in Canada. 
There is something missing and that something is job creation.
<P>
	I wonder if the member is comfortable with that idea. He comes 
from a rural area and he must realize that, in the end, most of the 
cuts were made at the expense of the provinces and the needy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
question.
<P>
	He talks about the deficit. We need to get that deficit down. If we 
did not get that deficit down more we would have had to do more 
cutting in our transfer payments. That is a given.
<P>
	We have started to get it down. Because we have it down, we can 
now use our efforts of deficit cutting as a spring board to begin 
creating more opportunities for people, applying the budget more 
to the needs of people. We have done this.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	He raises the question of the Farm Credit Corporation and $50 
million. It would be nice if we could have done more, but it is a 
beginning, a reinvestment, a turning around of some of the savings 
that people have struggled with to help the Canadian government to 
bring down the deficit.
<P>
	Our farmers are very innovative. I do not know about the farmers 
in his area, but the farmers in my area are very innovative and they 
will be able to use the money to create more opportunities to build 
their businesses and hire more people. As an end result there will 
be more growth and more people will pay income tax.
<P>
	We have a number of examples. In our budget we have tried to 
put in place spring board opportunities for people to get on with 
developing the economy.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to take a look at those initiatives in 
a positive fashion.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka, rural development; the hon. member for 
London-Middlesex, housing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure today to speak in favour of the Liberal 
government's 1997 budget.
<P>
	This budget, the fourth of the Liberal government, is likely the 
one that defines the true nature of the Liberal government, 
balancing the needs of fiscal health with the concerns about key 
social issues.
<P>
	Over the past three and a half years it is clear that the economic 
priority of the government is deficit reduction. We are the first 
government in history to have seriously attacked the deficit and 
wrestled this country's finances under control.
<P>
	Previous governments talked about deficits while continuing to 
overspend. We acted. In 1993 our finances rivalled those of third 
world countries. We spent fully $42 billion more than we took in, 6 
per cent of gross domestic product. In fact, throughout its stay in 
office the previous Tory government was overspending its budget 
by approximately 30 per cent every year.
<P>
	This year the deficit will be no higher than $19 billion and by 
1998-99 it is projected to stand at $9 billion or about 1 per cent of 
gross domestic product. In four short years a balanced budget is 
finally within our grasp.
<P>
	How did we work this magic, a magic that eluded the best Tory 
minds? We have stopped spending more than we earned. We cut 
government spending and began to live within our means. Canada 
is now on a clear path toward fiscal health and is the envy of most 
of the world's industrialized nations.
<P>
	Renewed confidence in the Canadian economy has also helped to 
keep interest rates down, 19 reductions over the last 20 months. In 
the last year alone short term interest rates fell 5 percentage points. 
The prime rate is at its lowest since 1956. For the first time in more 
than decade interest rates are lower in Canada than they are in the 
United States.
<P>
	Our current deficit reduction course has increased investor 
confidence, allowing interest rates to decline. Lower interest rates 
make it easier for consumers to buy homes and durable goods and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8413"> 8413 </A></B>
<P>
for businesses to invest in new facilities, equipment and 
employees.
<P>
	The economy as a whole is benefiting. Exports are at record 
highs, successive Team Canada missions have attracted $22 billion 
in deals for Canadian business. Exports account for 37 per cent of 
our GDP. The importance of trade to this country's economy is 
more than obvious. It is estimated that for every $1 billion in 
exports we have 11,000 to 12,000 quality jobs in Canada. In 1997 
Canada's economy will grow faster and have a higher job creation 
rate than any other G-7 country, including the U.S. A sustained and 
successive attack on the deficit inspires world confidence, world 
trade and world envy.
<P>
	Many have urged the government over the recent months to ease 
the purse strings and to announce major increases in expenditure. 
Some see the light at the end of the tunnel and want to start 
spending. I do not agree with these people. I believe that major 
spending increases at this time would send the wrong message to 
the international community and to the Canadian public. It would 
tell Canadians that the hard work we have invested into reducing 
the size of government can all be negated, that past efforts should 
be undone. It also threatens to undermine our deficit reduction 
strategy prematurely, quitting in the last hours of a long and 
tiresome job, a job that is not quite done. It would also cause many 
old Tory wags to nod sagely: ``There goes those tax and spend 
Liberals again buying the next election''.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The deficit battle has inevitably affected some more than others. 
It is our responsibility as good government and as good Liberals to 
respond to those affected. To this end, the government has targeted 
key areas for investment. It is this type of targeted funding that 
leads to real impact, real changes and real solutions to social 
problems.
<P>
	Among the announced initiatives are increased tax assistance to 
students, the creation of a foundation to support research 
infrastructure, investment to aid in the reform of Canadian health 
care, an increase in the child tax benefit and an increase in 
incentives for charitable giving.
<P>
	The time has ended for throwing money at problems. This fourth 
in a series of responsible budgets shows us government spending 
must be clear, concise, planned and focused.
<P>
	From 1985 to 1991, I served as a trustee on the appeal board of 
education, several years as chair. At that time, budgetary pressures 
were beginning to set in and it was clear that new strategies would 
have to be adopted. During my stay, along with some other 
colleagues, I suggested the administration implement rolling 
budget targets, setting spending goals at least two years in  
advance, not only as a constraint on board spending but as a 
realistic monitor of financial progress. We were unsuccessful at 
that time.
<P>
	We have only to look at the current difficulties of school boards 
in Ontario to see where the lack of long term planning and 
preventive action have taken them. They have learned painfully 
that one can no longer live for today. One must continually plan for 
tomorrow, as the Minister of Finance has done.
<P>
	Our current level of unemployment is still unacceptable. We 
should be doing better. But if there is anything we have learned in 
the last decade it is that throwing money into random job creation 
programs is not a long term solution. Governments cannot create 
jobs. They can create, foster and maintain the conditions necessary 
for a healthy economy in which the private sector can create jobs. 
In fact, our successful fiscal management has done just that.
<P>
	Economists are predicting the economy will grow over 3 per cent 
in 1997 and 1998 creating between 600,000 and 700,000 new jobs 
over that period. In fact, since the government took office and put 
this country's finances back on track, the Canadian economy has 
created 715,000 new, primarily full time jobs.
<P>
	Earlier I spoke of Canada as a model of modern economic 
change. Canada is making the most headway in deficit reduction 
and, at the same time, realizing the best job creation record in the 
G7 this year. Government overspending leads to economic ruin. 
Fiscal management leads to economic growth.
<P>
	There are other alternatives in this budget that I would like to 
talk about a bit more specifically. I have been supporting for some 
time now the idea of targeted tax reductions to benefit children. I 
was an active supporter of the recent private member's bills 
initiated by the member for Mississauga South both on increasing 
the child care expense deduction and creating a tax credit for stay at 
home caregivers.
<P>
	Children need proper resources and proper care in order to 
flourish in this society. Any level of child poverty is intolerable. 
We must do all we can to improve assistance to children of low 
income families. This budget has proposed a spending increase in 
the child tax benefit of $600 million annually in addition to the 
$250 million announced in the 1996 budget. The budget will also 
enrich the working income supplement by $195 million.
<P>
	These measures are all specifically targeted to low income 
families to improve living conditions for Canadian children and 
give low income families the support they need to stay in the 
workforce rather than rely on continued public assistance.
<P>
	The second area of particular interest is the voluntary and 
charitable sector in Canada. In 1995, I chaired a caucus 
subcommittee looking at government grants and contributions, 
primarily to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8414"> 8414 </A></B>
<P>
the volunteer sector. Our committee met with many charitable 
groups, including the National Volunteer Organization and the 
Canadian Centre for Philanthropy. They realized that reductions in 
government grants and contributions were both necessary and 
inevitable as governments scale down across the board.
<P>
	The committee agreed that scarce government funds should also 
be more specifically targeted and that reform of granting process 
was needed. The government should consider ways to stimulate 
private charitable giving while it continues to reduce direct 
funding.
<P>
	This budget recognizes that the charitable and voluntary sectors 
in Canada are extremely valuable to our social well-being. While 
we cannot continue to provide increased direct funding to these 
organizations, we must make every effort to ensure this sector does 
not die.
<P>
	The 1997 budget increases the amount of donations for which a 
person can claim a tax credit from 50 per cent to 75 per cent of 
income. Further, this budget has facilitated larger charitable 
donations, putting the Canadian system on par with the U.S.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	We have also reduced the rate at which capital gains on 
charitable donations are calculated from 75 per cent to 37.5 per 
cent. These measures will encourage private charitable giving and 
ensure that the charitable and voluntary sectors in Canada have 
access to the funds they need to remain in operation.
<P>
	Additional measures announced in the budget will address the 
question of accountability in Canada's third sector by giving 
Revenue Canada additional resources to ensure charities comply 
with the Income Tax Act and by increasing the availability of 
information filed by charities. These are measures which many of 
us have been calling for for some time.
<P>
	For the benefit of my constituents, I would like to address the 
GST question. Over the past year I have proposed that the 
government should use the savings generated by its beating 
successive deficit targets-about $5 billion-to reduce the GST by 
two points or 30 per cent. In fact, I have been saying that the 
government should make this reduction since the summer of 1995. 
I believe reducing the GST by one-third would stimulate retail 
spending and provide some relief to Canadians without undoing all 
of the hard work we have accomplished since we took office. 
However, the Minister of Finance took the time to personally 
explain to me why this will not work.
<P>
	While we may be able to afford to do it in year one and year two, 
by year three we would not have the money to continue. In short, 
we cannot absorb the revenue loss. I accept his explanation.
<P>
	I have always maintained that we should remain on our present 
course of deficit reduction. In fact, we have not saved $5 billion. 
We are still paying off horrendous national debts.
<P>
	As my responsibility to the constituents of Mississauga West I 
brought this proposal to caucus, I fought for it and I learned about 
its deficiencies. That is the essence of dialogue.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Minister of 
Finance on yet another outstanding budget. I am pleased to have 
the opportunity to speak on its merits.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps I will 
give the hon. member an opportunity to complete what she meant 
to say by asking my questions.
<P>
	Listening to her, I felt she had great concern for the family and 
for children, which is laudable. I also heard her talk about her 
attempts to have the finance minister soften his position about the 
GST. I have some questions in this respect.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament, is she sensitive to the requests of 
Bloc members who want to obtain for Quebec the same 
compensation, which would amount to $2 billion, as that granted to 
the maritime provinces with regard to the GST? That was my first 
question.
<P>
	My other question deals with the amounts provided for children. 
Does the hon. member think that another $33 for every child living 
in poverty is enough? Will this really improve the situation of 
children?
<P>
	It is all very well to talk about millions of dollars, but we know 
that 1.5 million children are living below the poverty level in 
Canada. That is a lot of people. We may sometimes talk about 
amounts like $200 million, but when this amount is divided among 
all recipients, it does not look so impressive.
<P>
	Therefore, I would ask the hon. member whether she is really 
satisfied and whether she really thinks that this will improve the 
situation of poor children in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his 
question.
<P>
	As a parent, as a responsible Canadian and as a former teacher, 
any form of child poverty is intolerable. The Minister of Finance 
mentioned that when he presented his budget.
<P>
	The 1.5 million Canadian children that live in poverty are a 
blight on all of us. However, the situation was not created overnight 
and it cannot be repaired overnight. The minister has made it very 
clear that it is a serious concern of the government. However, 
unless we get the deficit under control, unless we get the economy 
back in shape and get everything in order, there will be more than 
1.5 million children in poverty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8415"> 8415 </A></B>
<P>
	We are trying to do what good government does. It is a 
balancing act. It is repairing the deficit damage which will hurt 
more children, while slowly turning the corner to help as many 
children as we can.
<P>
	It is a start and we will do much better as the economy gets 
stronger and stronger.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the member for Mississauga West. She has often 
commented on the GST. Could she comment on the Ontario 
provincial government's attitude and her own attitude toward the 
question of the GST?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
comment on the GST and Ontario's attitude toward it.
<P>
	The government is working very hard to come up with a proper 
harmonization position with Ontario. I recall that the premier in 
Ontario said when he was running for election that the first order of 
business would be to come up with a harmonized tax with the 
federal government. He seems to have forgotten that promise so I 
am going to do all I can to encourage him to harmonize, as he 
should do so all the residents of Ontario can benefit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate on the 
budget speech. As some of my colleagues might expect, I have a 
number of comments to make on the budget measures that impact 
specifically on persons with disabilities.
<P>
	The budget tabled in the House by the Minister of Finance this 
week contains a number of measures aimed specifically at persons 
with disabilities. The Bloc Quebecois will look at these measures 
to determine whether or not, in our opinion, the proposed measures 
meet the expectations of the organizations representing persons 
with disabilities and address to a reasonable extent the problems 
faced by persons with disabilities in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	Let me preface my speech on persons with disabilities by a few 
more general remarks. All observers agree that the budget tabled 
by the Minister of Finance this week is nothing but smoke and 
mirrors. The primary purpose of this budget is to be used as an 
election platform in the next campaign, to show all our fellow 
citizens across Canada and Quebec that this government did fulfil 
its commitments, so that it can, in all good faith, ask the voters to 
put their faith in it again and get re-elected.
<P>
	In fact, the finance minister's budget is part of an advertising 
campaign launched by the government. Unfortunately, on closer 
scrutiny, we realize that it is misleading advertising. If the Minister 
of Finance, and his budget in particular, were subject to the Quebec  
consumer protection act, charges could be laid for misleading 
advertising.
<P>
	What we must realize about this budget is that, what is important 
in this budget is not what it says, what it does not say or anything 
that was said previously. We know that the budget before us is 
nothing but a good news budget, aimed at convincing our fellow 
citizens that the problems are solved and that the deficit will be 
eliminated within a few years, thanks to the government's efforts 
within its own administration.
<P>
	The reality is that the cuts made to social programs in the past 
three budgets, the cuts made to transfer payments to the provinces, 
will limit the provinces' ability to meet the needs of the most 
disadvantaged and, as a result, make our fellow citizens poorer than 
they were when this government assumed power in 1993.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	That is the reality. That is not what the budget says, but it is the 
reality. The government acknowledges this, because it 
acknowledges that today there are 1.5 million children living in 
poverty, 500,000 more than when it came to power in 1993. The 
measures announced, moreover, do nothing to solve this problem in 
any way. We shall return to this point.
<P>
	Essentially, this is a smoke-and-mirrors budget, which has only 
one objective: to convince our fellow citizens on the eve of an 
electoral campaign that all of the problems are settled and that we 
are now entering an era of prosperity. Two days after the tabling of 
the budget, nobody has been taken in.
<P>
	We saw the reaction of most analysts, and I am convinced that 
the public's reaction will be similar. These people realized that, 
even though the finance minister tears his hair out every day during 
oral question period, even though he whines a lot, the plight of our 
fellow citizens is not getting any better.
<P>
	Think about the disabled and take a look at the impact of the 
decisions made in that budget. Requests tmade for years by just 
about every organization representing people with disabilities were 
behind the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Human 
Rights and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, in a unanimous 
report tabled in this House in December 1995. In other words, the 
official opposition and the Reform Party essentially supported the 
recommendations contained in that report.
<P>
	It is worth taking a look at these recommendations, to see 
whether the government delivered. These recommendations 
provided, among other things, that the Government of Canada 
should designate a minister or a secretary of state to be responsible 
for the status of persons with disabilities. What was the 
government's response to that request? The Minister of Human 
Resources Development was designated as the person responsible 
for this issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8416"> 8416 </A></B>
<P>
	Given the decisions made by that minister, and particularly the 
conception he has of his department's role, we can only conclude 
that people with disabilities are even worse off than they were 
when there was no one to speak for them.
<P>
	Another recommendation provided that, each year, a report 
should be tabled in the House to review the status of requests made 
by people with disabilities. We are waiting for that report. I 
certainly hope that in the coming months we will see a document 
from the government explaining what has actually been done.
<P>
	We also requested that a more liberal, in the good sense of the 
word, interpretation be allowed in the application of the tax credit 
so that the disabled could truly benefit. What we saw, and 
unfortunately continue to see, is a somewhat restrictive 
application, with the result that a good number of the disabled are 
not able to take advantage of the tax credits offered by the 
government.
<P>
	It is one thing to say: ``We are going to propose new tax credits, 
to improve existing credits''. It is quite another to see how these 
measures are applied. In other words, how many people can take 
advantage of them? And, more to the point, how many people 
cannot take advantage of them, despite the fact that they are 
recognized as disabled.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Then, there are other recommendations concerning, for example, 
grants to disabled persons organizations; I will come back to this. 
The recommendations we made were partially taken into account.
<P>
	Following this report, the then Minister of Human Resources 
Development, now Minister of National Defence, who must have 
been getting ready for his new role, literally threw the human rights 
committee's recommendations out the window. Not only did he not 
take them into account, but he literally gave them the axe. And 
since he is now the defence minister, I should say he used a 
bazooka to completely eliminate any grants to disabled persons 
organizations. This was the decision taken by the former Minister 
of Human Resources Development, now the defence minister, over 
a year ago. The disabled community was utterly dismayed.
<P>
	Following protests by representatives of organizations and by 
the official opposition, which hounded the government in this 
House, a committee was formed. This committee tabled its report 
last fall and recommendations are also contained in the present 
budget.
<P>
	Unfortunately, although the hon. member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury, who headed this committee, worked 
in good faith, and showed considerable openness to organizations 
of disabled persons, we in the official opposition spoke out against 
the committee because it included no representation from either the 
official opposition or the Reform Party. In our opinion, therefore, it 
was a partisan committee to which, fortunately, representatives of 
organizations for the disabled were added, and this has made it 
possible for it to come up with some recommendations which 
reflect reality.
<P>
	Today, then, we find ourselves faced with a certain number of 
measures I would like, if I may, to comment on one by one, since 
that is the main purpose of my speech.
<P>
	First of all, it is stated that the tax credits of the past will 
continue unchanged. They will continue, and the disabled will be 
able to take advantage of them, as in the past. But, as I have just 
said, if the Minister of Revenue and her officials continue to apply 
the various tax credits in a restrictive way, the net result will be that 
the disabled will be as badly off as they were in the past.
<P>
	What we want from this government-and the Minister of 
Finance has not given us any reassurance in this area-is for 
someone to tell us how the tax credits referred to in this budget will 
be applied. This was recommended by both the human rights 
committee and the Liberal committee set up later. It had been 
decided to improve the tax credit for medical expenses.
<P>
	Naturally, four or five measures are referred to. They speak of 
adapting vehicles, where expenses will be exempt up to a ceiling of 
$5,000, and the purchase of an air conditioner, to a ceiling of 
$1,000. By the way, the recommendation made by the committee 
chaired by the hon. member for Fredericton-York-Sunbury 
wanted this tax credit to apply to any kind of material assistance 
and not just to air conditioners, for instance. Surprisingly, the 
Minister of Finance took the example used in the recommendation 
and included it in his speech or his budget, without considering all 
the other equipment that is absolutely indispensable for people 
with disabilities.
<P>
	I do not know whether this was an oversight or ignorance of the 
needs of people with disabilities, but air conditioners are fine, 
except that right now air conditioners are not terribly useful. There 
are a lot of other material aids that are just as important.
<P>
	There is also a reference to access ramps. The purpose is, of 
course, to help people with disabilities when they have to leave 
their homes to go about their usual business like anyone else. If 
they have to go to class or to go work, they have to be able to do so.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	There is also a reference to those who care for people with 
disabilities. These measures will be an improvement for all 
Canadians, with the exception of persons with disabilities in 
Quebec. Why do I say this? Because I know Liberal members will 
say the Bloc Quebecois is complaining again, that it thinks 
Quebecers are being mistreated by the federal government. Well, it 
is true. Today, during question period, I heard the Minister of  
Human Resources Development say that Quebec was getting more 
than its share of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8417"> 8417 </A></B>
<P>
federal funding, that Quebecers were cry babies and spent most of 
their time complaining with a full stomach.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> It is true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> I hear our 
Liberal colleagues say that is true. I hope they repeat that during 
the election campaign.
<P>
	I said, regarding the tax credits given for adapting vehicles, 
building access ramps and the purchase of specialized equipment, 
that a program already exists in Quebec, a universal program that 
applies to all citizens of Quebec, irrespective of their income, and 
covers the total cost of these special needs. This means Quebecers 
are going to pay twice: they will pay 100 per cent of the cost for 
residents of Quebec and part of the cost for people living outside 
Quebec, through the tax credit.
<P>
	I hope that my colleague from Fredericton-York-Sunbury 
will respond to this request when it is his time to speak on the 
budget. I hope that the federal government will compensate Quebec 
for this measure, which, I repeat, will penalize Quebec taxpayers, 
since services will be paid for twice, and people with disabilities in 
Quebec are already totally covered for these needs.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you say I have three minutes left. I want to use 
them to talk of the opportunities fund. There will no doubt be 
questions allowing me the opportunity to talk more about it. One of 
the things requested by groups of persons with disabilities was the 
retention of national standards on work adjustment programs and 
measures giving them greater access to the job market.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois objected to this measure because it 
considers that manpower training, workplace adjustment and 
material assistance to people with disabilities are provincial 
matters from which the federal government should withdraw, as it 
says it wants to, instead of creating new funds to intervene in areas 
of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Even if we see that this fund could help people with disabilities 
return to work, its application is very limited. Let me explain.
<P>
	First we must obtain the support of the groups representing the 
handicapped, the private sector and the provincial governments. 
Immediately it is clear that this fund could take months or years to 
see the light of day, if it ever does. So it is easy to set an amount 
when it will certainly never be spent. However, if it did get spent 
one day, it would be in areas of provincial jurisdiction and it would 
be an experiment. That is essentially what they are saying.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Apparently, the fund will be used to finance the development of 
strategies to eliminate barriers preventing Canadians from getting 
back onto the job market. Developing strategies will not resolve the 
unemployment problem, with a rate of unemployment of more than 
40 per cent among persons with disabilities. These are not the kind 
of measures that will help them.
<P>
	What the government should do, first of all and as soon as 
possible, is transfer manpower to Quebec and other interested 
provinces and put in place real training programs for persons with 
disabilities, programs that take their limitations into account by 
adapting work stations and, more importantly, ensuring that they 
can get jobs matching their abilities. That is what is required. 
Unfortunately, that is not what we find in this budget.
<P>
	I realize that my time is up. I will conclude on this, but I would 
like to add that I hope to get a few questions to give me an 
opportunity to elaborate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to comment on the comments 
made by my friend from the Bloc and I recognize immediately his 
genuine commitment in this area. We are co-members of the 
parliamentary committee and I admire his genuine dedication to 
the cause of this community. Having said that, we do disagree on 
some things.
<P>
	I would bring to his attention the fact that when he asks about 
what more there may be to come I would go directly to the budget 
speech where the Minister of Finance said: ``These measures are a 
step on the way to a better life for many thousands of our fellow 
citizens''. I am sure the Minister of Finance is quite prepared to be 
reminded that this is just a step as we move into subsequent 
budgets that I am sure this government will be around to present.
<P>
	One of the questions that was put by my friend had to do with the 
fact that perhaps the opportunities fund was speaking to a matter of 
provincial jurisdiction. The way that the fund has been designed is 
to be very collaborative with the provincial governments, to share 
information between provincial governments, to work with 
provincial governments because clearly this is a challenge to all 
levels of government. It is very important that the member realize 
to what extent this is a collaborative effort and not one imposed by 
the federal government.
<P>
	On the question of real costs and the complaints that have been 
placed against the tax credits in the past, that the interpretation of 
their application has been too rigid, there are two points. First, the 
minister responsible, my colleague will remember when she 
appeared before the parliamentary committee, made a commitment 
that she has made to me many times that the department would 
exercise maximum compassion in interpreting theses. She has 
appeared before our group since that time to repeat that 
commitment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8418"> 8418 </A></B>
<P>
	I would also suggest that the member be aware that the changes 
to the tax system that were announced in the budget and that were 
recommended by the task force for the most part are very 
measurable. The are real costs under the medical services expense 
credit and therefore the vagueness of more definitional kinds of 
credits does not apply.
<P>
	The member referred to the parliamentary committee report and 
what it asked for as against the government's task force that I 
chaired. The fact is most of the people who were critical of the task 
force report were critical on the grounds that obviously the 
government was not going to act on it because it was pretty much 
the same material as was contained in the parliamentary report that 
the government had not acted on so therefore what is the point?
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	The reality is that the government, in this case, has acted on our 
report and many of the measures it did act on were measures the 
parliamentary committee had recommended last year. The 
government made a mistake by not acting on that report. We 
acknowledged that and that is why the task force was struck and 
most of those things have been restored.
<P>
	Very specifically, the funding for organizations, for enhanced 
citizenship in the communities and for integration were all 
restored. VRDP, vocational rehabilitation of disabled persons, was 
extended for another year. These are all things that the member had 
been pushing for in the many questions to the former minister of 
human resources development.
<P>
	I am getting to a question for my colleague. I sincerely hope that 
my colleague could tell me which of the recommendations of the 
task force or the parliamentary committee he would priorize as the 
one that we should go after next.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before answering the question from the hon. member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury, I want to comment briefly on his 
remarks. First, the hon. member acknowledges that the government 
and the human resources minister at the time, the current Minister 
of National Defence, made monumental mistakes which, 
unfortunately, were endorsed by the government.
<P>
	Thanks to representations made by organizations looking after 
people with disabilities, and also by the official opposition, the 
government finally realized the enormity of these errors, and some 
changes were made in the funding provided to these organizations. 
I recognize it in the budget. In fact, it was announced last January. 
Corrective measures were taken to restore the situation to what it 
was before 1996, to restore grants to what they were in 1995.
<P>
	It is difficult to take for granted that improvements such as these 
augur well for the future, that we should rest easy and assume that 
the federal government will propose other measures to improve the 
lot of the disabled, such as the integration fund, when we know that 
the government not only has a tendency to interfere in provincial 
jurisdictions, but that it is still actively doing so.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Prime Minister willingly admitted to 
journalists-as can be seen in nearly all of today's daily 
newspapers-that the federal government was getting involved in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, but only temporarily, and would 
withdraw within a few years. That is really thumbing their noses at 
people. They are telling us that the federal government is putting 
money into this just to bug the provincial governments and then, 
once they have created a need and people come back for more, they 
will take pull out and take their money with them. What a hateful 
thing to admit to.
<P>
	In response to my colleague's question as to which priorities 
with respect to the disabled the federal government was to be 
responsible for, a commitment has been made, and it was made 
several times by the Minister of Justice, for instance, to amend 
human rights legislation to provide that employers would be 
obliged to adapt work stations.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice said that once the government had dealt 
with the matter of same sex couples or sexual orientation and 
employment equity, it would introduce amendments to help people 
with disabilities enter the labour market. That was one of the 
proposals.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	We, and this includes persons with disabilities, are still waiting 
for the legislation, because this is a very practical measure. In fact 
any measure, not just experiments, but any measure that will help 
people with disabilities get into the labour market will be welcome.
<P>
	People with disabilities do not want to be treated like people who 
cannot participate in the economy and their community. They want 
the means to do so. This includes transportation that is adapted to 
their needs, which means adapting vehicles and adapting 
accommodation, but it also means special training programs.
<P>
	So the federal government should reach an agreement as soon as 
possible with Quebec, as far as the Bloc Quebecois is concerned, 
but in fact with all provinces that want to patriate manpower 
training and labour market entry assistance, in order to come up 
with practical solutions and not just spend money on experiments 
or creating task forces.
<P>
	``We do not want a lot of discussion''. This was the message we 
got from people with disabilities, time and time again when my 
colleague from Fredericton and his colleagues travelled across 
Canada. They said: ``We want no more reports, no more talk, we 
want action''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8419"> 8419 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what they expect from this government, and I hope we 
will see further measures in the months to come.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Winnipeg South.
<P>
	It is an honour for me to address the House today on the occasion 
of the debate on this historic document, the 1997 federal budget. 
There is a light at the end of the tunnel when one reads this budget 
and it is not the light of a freight train barrelling toward us. It is the 
light of hope which is shining for the future of our country which 
includes our young people.
<P>
	It is interesting to note, especially for our critics on the other 
side-it is their job to criticize-that during this whole exercise of 
the past three years of deficit cutting, cutting of programs, of 
cutting back fairly deeply through the fat and into the bone in our 
expenditures on the federal side, the United Nations has 
consistently named Canada the number one country in the world. 
That is something we should all dwell upon for a few minutes 
before we start criticizing the work that our finance minister and 
our Prime Minister have done over the past three years.
<P>
	I will quote from some of the press comments from my province 
of Prince Edward Island that the budget has received. The 
editorialist from the <I>General Pioneer</I> in Summerside said ``With 
our lower than expected deficit, Mr. Martin resisted the pressure to 
institute a widespread tax cut. For that he is to be commended. The 
cuts that are still working their way through the system have been 
hard on all Canadians. A tax cut, although it would be appreciated 
at tax time, would simply drive the deficit back up and wipe out 
what has been accomplished''.
<P>
	The editorialist went on to say that there is little doubt this is a 
pre-election budget. However, a key qualifier to be added is a 
pre-election budget for the 1990s: ``Prime Minister Chrétien and 
his finance minister have concluded, and rightly so we suggest, that 
Canadians are in no mood for big spending promises that can't 
realistically be kept''.
<P>
	When the editorialist mentioned the pre-election budget for the 
1990s, I am sure he was comparing that with pre-election budgets 
of the past where governments were tempted to come in with big 
spending programs in an effort to buy people's votes with their own 
money. Our finance minister in this regard in this election year has 
resisted the temptation to buy votes with the people's own money.
<P>
	This government has accomplished quite a record over the past 
number of years. It inherited a $42 billion annual deficit. It 
inherited a legacy of high interest rates. It inherited a reputation 
among the G7, the western  developed countries, and indeed among 
other less fortunate countries as being Mexico north.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	In a short, record setting period of time we have decreased the 
deficit 34 per cent in one year. That is probably the biggest deficit 
reduction in the shortest time in the history of the world. We are 
getting the deficit under control.
<P>
	We are a stone's throw away from a balanced budget. In the next 
couple of years we will see for the first time in many decades a 
balanced budget.
<P>
	The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> led off its editorial after the budget by 
saying: ``The finance minister, Paul Martin, deserves real credit, if 
not necessarily for yesterday's budget, then for his four years of 
fiscal tutelage. His is a record of historic achievement''. I think we 
can all agree with what the finance minister has done over the past 
four years to earn those accolades.
<P>
	Let us take a look at some of the budget measures which have 
generated a positive response. First I would like to address jobs.
<P>
	In this budget $2 billion more are being dedicated for small 
business to begin, to grow and to create more jobs. In addition, if 
businesses use the new hiring program and expand their workforce, 
they will have a holiday from paying EI premiums. They will not 
have to pay any EI premiums for the first year and they will have a 
25 per cent reduction in the second year.
<P>
	As far as Prince Edward Island is concerned, this measure could 
not have come at a better time. There will be $95 million available 
for the tourism sector. The new Confederation bridge will be 
opening on June 1 and I am sure that every member of the House 
will be there.
<P>
	Normally 700,000 to 800,000 tourist visitors coming to our 
province each year. This year we are expecting one million visitors. 
A lot of islanders are not yet prepared for the influx of people who 
will be visiting our province after the bridge opens. Therefore, 
these tourism dollars will come in very handy for a lot of our tourist 
operators. They will be able to expand and to begin new tourist 
operations to facilitate one million visitors this year.
<P>
	The infrastructure program will help to create jobs. Some critics 
have been very hard on the infrastructure program. They wonder 
why we have extended it for another year and why we put another 
$425 million into it.
<P>
	In my riding some of the small communities would not have 
been financially able to develop some of their projects if it was not 
for federal and provincial money. For example, in the town of 
Alberton, in the western end of my riding, $365,000 was generated 
to replace sewer lines, sidewalks, paving and ditching. Without the 
dollars of the federal initiative, the other two-thirds would not  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8420"> 8420 </A></B>
<P>
have been spent. It is certainly a relief for the taxpayers of that 
town.
<P>
	In the village of O'Leary, half a million dollars went into 
renovating an old hospital that had been closed. The village needed 
a new village office and a new fire station. They were able to access 
the infrastructure program and right now they have a beautiful 
building.
<P>
	Also there were small projects in very small districts like St. 
Felix, St. Nicholas and St. Louis where anywhere from $8,000 to 
$15,000 was spent in much needed community improvement.
<P>
	In the town of Summerside, which is the largest town in my 
riding, there is now a new city of Summerside because of the 
amalgamation that took place with Wilmot and St. Eleanors. All 
the new money has been added to their share of the infrastructure 
program. Well over $2.5 million has been spent there.
<P>
	A total of 200 jobs have been created in my riding. If anyone 
thinks 200 jobs are not needed, then they are sadly mistaken in 
criticizing this program.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	I want to commend the government on its initiative on the 
disabled. This initiative was caucus driven, led by the member 
from Fredericton who has been working very hard on it. There was 
full caucus support for his efforts.
<P>
	Many of our disabled are helped by expanded tax deductions for 
medical expenses. These include increased deductions for part time 
attendants, increased deductions for vans used for wheelchair 
transportation as well as for medically required air conditioners 
and altered driveways. Individuals who come under the umbrella of 
the organizations for the disabled in Summerside-Tignish and area 
will benefit by the initiatives found in Tuesday's budget.
<P>
	It is our record of staying the course, of remaining consistent and 
focused that has brought us to the point where we can initiate some 
selective spending programs. We have turned the corner. The time 
of announcing new cuts is over.
<P>
	We are about to reap the rewards of the sacrifices of the past four 
years. The tax cuts that we all want are now possible without 
jeopardizing our recovery.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
begin my comments on the budget, I would like to take a moment 
to correct the record.
<P>
	Last Thursday Reform had an opposition day on transportation. 
During the debate, the Reform critic for transportation made a 
comment that some information he was provided was covered with 
marginal notes written by one Moya Greene. He was making the 
comment that this was a tragic leak of information, implying 
complicity on the part of Ms. Greene. I want to state that, at no 
time, was Moya Green ever involved in the preparation of the draft 
report.
<P>
	The marginal notes he got on the draft sent to him were those of 
the researcher. For him to slander Ms. Green, who is a very 
valuable member of the finance community and who made a very 
strong contribution to the work of the round table, is quite 
inexcusable. I do not know why the Reform Party has chosen to 
take this tack and I am rather saddened by it.
<P>
	There is not enough time in the few minutes I have to do justice 
to the budget, so I want to focus on three or four points. The first is 
just a pick-up on the remarks of the previous speaker from the 
Bloc.
<P>
	One of the things that has given me real delight in the work 
leading up to this budget has been the involvement of a great many 
members from all sides of the House. The Minister of Finance and 
cabinet have allowed members to get involved in a variety of 
committees that have spent a great deal of time working on specific 
problems that ended up as policies.
<P>
	The clearest example of that is the work by the member from 
Fredericton. I served with that member on the first HIV committee, 
when we looked at the changes to the Canada assistance plan. At 
that time, a concern was raised about what would happen to people 
with disabilities. The result was the establishment of the committee 
he chaired. He undertook, as is his personal style, to consult and 
consult. He worked with people in his community and across 
Canada in order to formulate policy that truly represents the wishes 
of people. This is a stellar example of that.
<P>
	He was in my riding. We had a little meeting in my office where 
we brought together people from the community. I know this 
community well as I have worked with it over the years. Canadians 
with disabilities were strongly supportive of the work done by that 
committee and are delighted with the announcement in the budget. 
They look forward to seeing what the member from Fredericton 
will do next on their behalf.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	Another area that underlies this attitude on the part of the 
government of collaboration and involvement is the work done by 
the member for Peterborough, who co-chaired a committee that 
worked on support for post-secondary education.
<P>
	We have a terrible problem with our universities which have 
been the recipients to all sorts of offloading by provincial 
governments and diversion of federal government support to the 
point where many of our great institutions are in serious trouble. 
Their infrastructure is crumbling. They have difficulty providing 
the kind of labs and support to students to give them a quality 
education. For organizations that are such major economic engines, 
as a country we have allowed them to fall into a rather sorry state.
<P>
	During the last election the Liberals made the second largest 
financial commitment to provide over the course  of four years $1 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8421"> 8421 </A></B>
<P>
billion in new money for research and development. I am delighted 
to see with this announcement that the Minister of Industry, who 
has long advocated this, and the secretary of state for science and 
research have finally been able to deliver not just what was 
committed but well in excess of that. For the first time we will be 
able to offer to universities and labs across the country a strong 
infusion of new capital to help them do the work that in the end is 
will support all of us. It is going to provide jobs and the intellectual 
property that will fuel growth in the next few decades.
<P>
	One of the problems that arose with universities was the 
tendency on the part of provincial governments to divert funds that 
the federal government was providing in support of post-secondary 
education to other uses. In fact the only province in the country that 
can argue that it provided 100 per cent flow through of those funds 
from the federal government to the universities is the province of 
Quebec. In all other cases those funds were diverted to other uses 
and the resultant shortfall offloaded on to students.
<P>
	In fact one of the most shameful acts of the provincial 
government in my province is the way that it has disguised its 
withdrawal of support from universities and handed over 
responsibility to students.
<P>
	We made some changes to the student loan program a few years 
ago designed to raise the limits and give students a bit more 
flexibility in the management of their debt, only to have the 
provincial government immediately cancel its grant program and 
transfer much of its responsibility for supporting students on to the 
federal government. The net result was to put students even further 
in debt and give them fewer options for managing that debt.
<P>
	I am delighted the Minister of Human Resources Development 
has taken strong steps to provide direct support to students and 
some greater flexibility in the management of their debt load to 
right what has been a fairly serious problem that has been created 
by provincial governments across the country.
<P>
	I am a little saddened that we have not yet been able to move to 
an income contingent form of repayment. I trust we will continue 
to look at that. I know the student associations, certainly in western 
Canada, strongly support that and see it as a way of helping 
students manage what are to be very large debts on leaving school.
<P>
	The announcements on child poverty and health are very 
welcome. They are important additions and reflect an important 
shift in philosophy, from a social service network that many have 
challenged as being excessively paternalistic to one that is more 
empowering. By putting resources directly in the hands of families 
and expecting them to act in the best interests of their children, we 
are giving people who are working and trying to get ahead and 
build a future for their children some real tools with which to work.
<P>
	Finally, I want to thank the Minister of Finance for his assistance 
with the work of the committee that I chair, the committee on 
transport, in dealing with another form of deficit. This is perhaps 
best described as the infrastructure deficit.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	This country has a national highway system some 25,000 
kilometres long comprised of the Trans-Canada Highway and a 
number of major routes that carry goods between the provinces and 
between Canada and the U.S. and to the major ports. It carries 45 
per cent of our exports south to the U.S. It carries almost 80 per 
cent of tourism which is predicted to grow to be the third largest 
industry in Canada by the turn of the century, an industry that runs 
on rubber tires.
<P>
	The highway system is in desperate shape. The entire network 
has been studied and studied and studied, to the point that the 
provincial auditor in Ontario got involved in looking at the 
desperate condition of our major trade routes. In the last year that 
we have been working on this topic, every single person who came 
to the table said that we needed to do something about that network 
of roads. But in a time of restraint the costs are enormous, some 
$18 billion to $20 billion to bring the entire system up to standard.
<P>
	I have been very encouraged by the Minister of Finance and the 
President of the Treasury Board. They have worked with the 
committee to help us examine some alternative ways in which to 
fund infrastructure renewal.
<P>
	Our infrastructure program has been an enormous success. This 
was brought home to me when I met with the Trans-Canada West 
Association, a group of mayors from small communities all along 
the Trans-Canada Highway in the prairies. They made the point 
that when mayors and reeves from across the country gather 
together, one thing they talk about is how they spend their little 
portion of the infrastructure program in their communities. It is an 
activity which has the benefit of putting people to work and also 
bringing us together.
<P>
	That is the same kind of effect we will see when we get to the 
work of twinning the Trans-Canada Highway across the country, of 
renewing the 25,000 kilometres of roads that tie every community 
in the country together. It is work that needs to be done. I was 
pleased to see recognition of this by the Minister of Finance in the 
budget.
<P>
	The committee has proposed some innovative ways in which we 
could use public and private partnerships to fund the renewal of the 
highway system and that we could do it within the existing levels of 
expenditure. However, it requires some important changes in the 
way in which government does business. That is one of the odd 
benefits which can come out of a deficit. Sometimes when there is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8422"> 8422 </A></B>
<P>
such enormous fiscal pressure, we are forced to look at innovative 
ways to get the work done.
<P>
	We cannot allow this infrastructure deficit to continue. We have 
to begin to solve the problem. These highways are important. The 
highway in Newfoundland and through New Brunswick is 
important to the economy of Manitoba. The highway in 
Saskatchewan is important to the economy of Ontario. The entire 
network is important to the country.
<P>
	It is estimated that in addition to the work that would be created 
by rebuilding this network of roads, there would be over 200,000 
new permanent, long term jobs created in Canada by the existence 
of a more efficient system of delivery.
<P>
	I know the Minister of Finance believes as I do that this is an 
important issue. I expect in a future budget we will see a creative 
solution to the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us point out to the hon. member for Winnipeg South 
the incredible fuel taxes that the Canadian public and the 
commercial users of the highway pay. Of that fuel tax, less than 5 
per cent actually gets spent on rebuilding the highway system in 
this country.
<P>
	There has been a massive request for some dedicated money 
from fuel taxes to go to fix the highway system. The Liberals have 
refused to do that despite cries from the travelling public, 
commercial users of the highway and others who use the highway 
system. The Liberals have refused to listen to them. They are the 
ones who are paying the bills by their fuel taxes and the Liberals 
are not using the money to keep the roadways up.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	I listened to the member for Winnipeg South talk about how the 
provinces are offloading their problems for funding education on to 
the backs of the students. Let me remind the member for Winnipeg 
South that since the Liberal government took office it has cut back 
transfer payments to education and health care by $7.5 billion. The 
Liberals have taken out of health care and education transfers and 
they have the nerve to stand up and blame the provinces for the 
problem. That audacity is beyond belief.
<P>
	The member for Winnipeg South also talked about how they are 
going to extend the payment schedules for the students. I am sure 
the students are going to appreciate that a lot. But what they would 
appreciate more would be to be able to get a job when they finish 
their education, to go out to work and earn some money to pay back 
the loans within the time period allowed to them. The fact is there 
are 1.5 million Canadians without jobs which is comical 
considering that in 1993 this Liberal government ran on jobs, jobs, 
jobs and there is about a net zero change in the unemployment rate 
in this country.
<P>
	Instead of offering the students extended terms for paying back 
their loans, would it not be wonderful and would the students not 
appreciate far more the opportunity to go to work after they finish 
their education and pay back the loans like they want to? The 
students do not want handouts when they finish their education. 
They want jobs. This government has failed miserably in its 
responsibility to ensure that an environment is created so that 
students can get jobs.
<P>
	Let me also talk about child poverty. People living below the 
poverty line do not want more welfare. They want jobs so that they 
can get themselves out of that situation. This extra payment to 
combat child poverty is only a drop in the bucket per family, per 
child, for those who live in poverty.
<P>
	It would be far better if the Liberal government did one of two 
things. One, it could create better paying jobs for those people so 
they could get themselves out of that situation. Two, like the 
Reform Party would do, it could take those low income people off 
the tax rolls completely. That would be a better solution than the 
handouts the Liberal government is talking about here.
<P>
	The member for Winnipeg South continues with the sleight of 
hand deception that this budget represents. It has no credibility. 
The member should be standing and defending the Liberal record 
on employment and the tax increases that have been created by this 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, the only thing that lacks credibility in 
this House is the platform of the Reform Party. For every complex 
problem there is a simple answer and it is usually wrong. I am 
reminded of that when I look at the Reform response to these 
problems.
<P>
	We just heard the member say that he would take the punitive $5 
billion-it is actually $3.6 billion-and divert it from its current 
use which is helping us to try to meet the budget deficit that we 
have and put it all into roads. Sure I would love to see those roads 
built but I ask the member: What tax would he then dedicate for 
hospitals? What tax would he dedicate for jails? Would we not end 
up as the state of California did, so bound up in our own rigid 
application of tax policy that we would no longer have any 
flexibility? We would have no ability to move as a House and 
represent the people of this country.
<P>
	The fact is we have a problem with our road system and we need 
to solve that problem. The fact is there has been some very 
important work done. What is interesting is that those same people, 
the Canadian Automobile Association, the Canadian Trucking 
Association, the Canadian Tourism Association, the people who 
build the roads and the people who finance the roads were all at that 
round table. They sat at that table and they did not say the only 
solution to this was to dedicate taxes. They did not adopt the 
Reform position. They were not that simplistic. They actually got 
down to work-

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired. 
Debate, the hon. member for Kootenay East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
Canadians ever had any question in their mind about the truth of the 
saying Liberal, Tory, same old story, it has been put totally to rest 
with this budget.
<P>
	For the longest time in Canada, unfortunately Canadians have 
been subjected to very deceptive political practices, particularly as 
we approach an election. We have seen historically where 
governments have attempted to make things appear to be what they 
are not and particularly to try to buy the votes of the Canadian 
public. Canadians are far too intelligent to continue to put up with 
that kind of deceptive political practice.
<P>
	Let me tie the Liberals and Tories together inextricably right 
from the word go. We are talking about a bracket creep, and that is 
not my opinion of some of the members opposite. In bracket creep 
we are talking about something that was actually brought into 
effect by the Tories in a budget of theirs in 1988. They basically 
deindexed the amount of the basic personal exemption and also 
deindexed any increases, unless inflation was over 3 per cent, that 
would occur in the tax brackets.
<P>
	If we were to assume that an individual had a $3,000 job five 
years ago, it is quite feasible that the person today, for doing the 
same work, in order to have the same buying power that he had five 
years ago at $3,000 would have to have $3,600 in income. 
Unfortunately, his basic personal exemption of $6,453 in that 
period of time has not increased. If his basic personal exemption 
had increased, it should be around $7,900. So in fact, this 
individual with no change in his buying power from five years ago 
to today is now paying tax on an additional $1,450. That was 
originated by the Tories in 1988 and was continued by the Liberals 
in 1993 which is why I say Liberal, Tory, same old story.
<P>
	Additionally that individual will find himself suddenly bouncing 
up into the next tax bracket. The problem is actually magnified or 
doubled because he is not only paying tax on the additional $1,450 
but he is paying the tax at a higher rate. Liberal, Tory, same old 
story, the same kind of deceptive political practices.
<P>
	What we are looking at here is not only the continuation of the 
Tory practices by this Liberal government, but it has taken this 
deception in this whole process to an even higher level. This 
government did not even have the intestinal fortitude to bring in the 
additional amount of money that is going to be taken off of 
Canadians' pay slips every month. It did not have the intestinal 
fortitude to include that announcement in this budget.
<P>
	We are going to be talking about the fact that there have been tax 
increases later in my discussion. However the point I am driving at 
is that suddenly Canadians are  going to be paying 70 per cent more 
on their Canada pension plan premium that is being extracted from 
their paycheque every month. At the higher level that is an 
additional $1,300 a year for which Canadians will receive nothing, 
nada, zippo. They will receive absolutely zero in additional 
benefits for paying out an additional $1,300 a year. If that is not bad 
enough, the problem is that if the Canadian happens to be 
self-employed, guess what? They get to pay the employer's portion 
of that amount.
<P>
	This afternoon I was speaking to a newspaper reporter and I 
asked how many people were involved in the company overall. The 
reporter told me there were about 250. Let us think about this for a 
second. That company is now faced with an additional $1,300 a 
year it has to contribute to the Canada pension plan times 250 
employees. It is going to be paying out an additional $32,500 a year 
for absolutely no benefit.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	More important, that company will now have to make a decision 
to reduce the bottom line of the company by $32,500 or fire 
somebody. Unfortunately the company will probably end up 
making the worst of the judgments, which is to let somebody go.
<P>
	This is what is going on here. The young people of Canada on 
this CPP issue are getting it in the ear two ways. First they are 
getting it in the ear by virtue of the fact that they will be paying our 
$1,300 a year more for absolutely no increase. The second 
difficulty is that their jobs will be jeopardized because companies 
have no way to attract more income in order to come up with the 
money for the government in this so-called CPP contribution.
<P>
	Even for people who are in a lower income bracket, and I mean a 
very low income bracket, CPP will still be deducted from their 
cheques. They should know that the amount currently being 
deducted from their cheques will be increased by 70 per cent. That 
means they will have less money to spend.
<P>
	There is a basic tax grab going on in addition to the CPP, which 
this government will never admit to. How can government 
members explain that the gross domestic product in Canada, the 
sum total of all of the goods and services produced in Canada, in 
the past three years, which is the three years this government has 
been in this Chamber, has increased by nine and a half per cent? 
The total goods and services, everything that can be taxed, has 
increased by nine and a half per cent, but guess what? Government 
total revenue has increased by twelve and a half per cent. And those 
members have the audacity to to try to tell us that this government 
has not been taking more money out of the economy. They cannot 
refute those numbers.
<P>
	Taxes cost jobs, and we know that. Take a look. For over 70 
consecutive months our unemployment rate in Canada has been 
over 9 per cent; it is now at 9.7 per cent.  In comparison, our trading 
partners have the following unemployment rates: the United 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8424"> 8424 </A></B>
<P>
Kingdom is at 6.7 per cent; the United States is at 5.3 per cent; 
Japan is at 3.3 per cent. The Liberals cannot walk away from it.
<P>
	They gave Kim Campbell a rough time in the last election. They 
tried to say that she did not know what she was talking about when 
she said that the unemployment rate would probably hover around 
the 10 per cent level. I recall the current Prime Minister was in 
absolute glee when Kim Campbell said that. And what have they 
accomplished? They are still at 9.7 per cent, and with no hope 
because in the future they will be taking even more money from the 
economy.
<P>
	In terms of deception it does not just stop in the area of taxes. I 
cannot imagine the chutzpah of a finance minister who would 
actually put out a pamphlet saying that they will be sustaining and 
improving health care. They will be putting $300 million back in to 
a place where they took $7 billion out. Let us put this into 
perspective. Seven billion dollars is seven thousand million 
dollars. They took seven thousand million dollars out of the health 
care transfers to the provinces; they are putting three hundred of 
that seven thousand back, and they say that they are going to 
sustain and improve health care. Is this a joke or what? The 
chutzpah of this government is absolutely immense.
<P>
	The government has downloaded this entire problem to the 
provinces from the word go. I believe Canadians are intelligent 
people. Canadians are not going to be taken in by this. When 
Canadians take the time to realize what a chicanery has been 
perpetrated on them by the people in government, they will treat it 
accordingly in the next election.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we are talking about chutzpah, let 
us talk about March 1, 1995 when Reform's subamendment asked 
members of this House to vote against the Liberal budget because it 
did not cut fast enough. They were opposed to the budget because it 
did not cut fast enough.
<P>
	I would like the member to tell this House, to share with us how 
it is that he can stand there and criticize the cuts as he just did when 
he voted in opposition to the budget because it did not cut fast 
enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I really appreciated that question 
because it is so simple. The government cut in all the wrong places.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if people 
were students of history they would recall that we have had right 
wing parties in this House before. I recall reading about the debates 
that the right wing was talking about when we brought in medicare, 
that medicare was going to be a total drain on society,  that it would 
hurt the economy and that it would take people out of work.
<P>
	Now we know that the economy quite frankly is considered by 
other countries in the world to be one of the best situations because 
of medicare in that it helps employers with their bottom lines and it 
helps employees.
<P>
	Also, when we brought in social assistance or welfare as a 
national program in this country we had the right wing say the same 
thing.
<P>
	Now we have these people across the way who are suggesting 
that because we have improved and made sure and secured because 
of the values of the nation our pension plan for future 
generations-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Your pension plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Yes, that is absolutely right, my pension plan. I will 
get the Canada pension plan just like everybody else when I retire 
and the children of these members here hopefully will get a Canada 
pension plan as well.
<P>
	That is why that particular party is at 11 per cent in the polls and 
sliding fast.
<P>
	If what was said here just a few minutes ago was even close to 
being believable, and I want to ask the member this specific 
question, why is it that they keeping dropping in the polls? Is it that 
we are so good at deceiving Canadians that people do not realize 
that we are not doing a good job?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am so happy this member brought up 
his pension plan and the pension plan of all of the other people who 
are in this disgusting MP pension plan. They have looked after 
themselves all right. They have taken care of themselves and then 
they are shafting the Canadian public with this 70 per cent increase.
<P>
	What I would like to know from any of those members that are 
on this fat pension plan is are any of them going to be doing a 70 
per cent increase in the premiums they are paying.
<P>
	The Canadian public right now is paying $4 for every $1 that 
these people put in. Right now what is going on is with this increase 
of $1,300 a year Canadians are going to be getting less out than 
what they are putting in. These people are absolutely disgusting 
that they would even bring up their pension plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, he can go on and bluster all he likes but 
I just want him to answer a very simple question. If his party's 
policies were so believable, why is it that he cannot seem to get 
over the 10 per cent mark in popularity with the rest of Canadians? 
In Ontario it is 6 per cent and dropping. It does not even go on the 
Richter scale.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8425"> 8425 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very happy to see that 
member or any other Liberal in my riding. I am not even the 
slightest bit concerned, but he should be.
<P>
	I come back to the medicare issue. He is talking about the fact 
that the Liberals brought in medicare. When the Liberals brought in 
medicare the federal government promised 50-50 funding to the 
provinces. What happened to the 50-50 funding to the provinces? It 
slashed, hacked, downloaded to the provinces, still asked the 
provinces to do exactly the same things while giving them a 20 cent 
dollar instead of a 50 cent dollar.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just 
for the Liberals over there, I had a wonderful speech all ready to go 
and now I have to talk about the MP pension plan.
<P>
	Is it any wonder people have lost confidence in governments in 
this country? The fact is the average Canadian will now have to 
work about 30 years and contribute to the Canada pension plan to 
get about $9,000 at the end of it. They may even have to work 40 
years or more to get about $9,000 at the end. The Liberals say this 
is good, that it will help Canadians to live down the road. By that 
time $9,000 will mean next to nothing.
<P>
	Let us have a look to see what the Liberal MPs have done for 
themselves. Inside of ten years they qualify for the richest pension 
plan in the world. Every one of these people across the way is 
gouging the Canadian public with the richest pension plan in the 
world.
<P>
	How much did their premiums go up? Not a red cent. They 
expect young people to contribute another $650 every year when 
those members are not taking anything out of their pockets. It is 
disgusting. How can they call themselves leaders when they are 
sucking off the trough? Let us look at how things have changed in 
Canada since the Liberals have formed the government.
<P>
	I must say, for those who are listening, that there is a lot of 
rattling going on here. We have touched a nerve. We have touched a 
big nerve. It is hard for them to stand and face anybody in this 
country, gorging off the trough like they do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, there have been a 
number of accusations in this House in the last number of years 
since this new party came into being, which was going to-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. parliamentary 
secretary to get to the point very quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> The point is, Mr. Speaker, I would like to suggest to 
the member that he not use the kind of language in the House which 
he has just used. That is the reason the situation-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Fraser Valley West 
has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have touched 
a raw nerve. They are upset because we are saying that they are 
gorging off the trough. They do not like it. That is too darned bad. I 
will tell you who does not like the big issues. It is the guy working 
in this country who is contributing another $650 out of his pocket. 
These MPs are contributing nothing more. They are getting three 
times as much in less than one-third of the time. If they do not like 
it, that is just too darned bad. We will see you all in the next 
election. Come to my riding.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, they are being noisy again. I like to see how we 
touch off nerves, especially when it comes out of their pockets.
<P>
	Let us look at where Canada has come from and where it is today 
as a result of these people being in power. I can remember in 1993 
when the debt was around $450 billion. Have they improved the 
country since then?
<P>
	The debt is now bordering on $600 billion. One of the members 
over there had the unmitigated gall to stand up and say there is a 
light at the end of the tunnel because of the Liberals. The light at 
the end of the tunnel is $600 billion, $150 billion more.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	They got a standing ovation here the other day when the finance 
minister said ``we are only borrowing $19 billion this year''. How 
does anybody get a standing ovation when they are saying that they 
are overspending and borrowing on the backs of Canadians 
nineteen thousand million dollars? How on earth do these members 
give a finance minister a standing ovation on that? It is sickening.
<P>
	Where is crime today? Much worse than in 1993. What has this 
government done? Virtually nothing.
<P>
	This country is not better off after three and a half years of 
Liberals. I will say who is better off. All the Liberal MPs and the 
separatists over here who are gorging off the MP pension plan. 
They are better off.
<P>
	They say that we have cut to the bone. This is a common saying 
among these folks. Let us look at some of the money they gave 
away last year which is still sitting in the budget.
<P>
	They gave $987,000 to the National Action Committee on the 
Status of Women. That was given out last year, but is still in the 
budget this year. Could they not have taken that out this year?
<P>
	They gave $138,000 to the Canadian conference of teamsters. 
Will they repeat that next year? Could they not have said ``there is 
your money this year and we will cut that out of the budget next 
year''? No. They said that they cut to the bone.
<P>

<P>
	From 1993 to 1996 ACOA handed out a staggering $975 
million. People only have to look and read the papers in Atlantic 
Canada to understand what happens with ACOA money. Most of 
it is a waste.
<P>
	They give this money year after year. Is there no such thing as 
zero based budgeting in this government? What does this 
government know about youth and unemployment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member 
is giving false information by suggesting that ACOA is wasting 
money.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As the member knows, that is debate. 
That will not come out of the member's time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Is it not interesting, when we 
strike nerves with this group, how they whine about it?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Enjoy it, Randy, it may be one of your last 
speeches the way you guys are going in the polls.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of these 
Liberals here is trying to say that this is my last speech because I 
may get defeated in an election.
<P>
	These people better learn how the west feels, how my riding 
feels about what I am talking about. We had one and a half million 
people unemployed in 1993. Why do they not stand up and tell us 
how many we got unemployed today? Are we better off with this 
government? We got one and a half million people unemployed 
today.
<P>
	To stand up and tell us they created <I>x</I> number of jobs, they still 
have one and a half million people unemployed.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	There is one heck of a lot of young people who are 
underemployed. In the event that you do not know what that 
means-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. member to refer to the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry. I get 
carried away.
<P>
	I just want to go back to one other thing that is going to tell the 
country whether we should elect Liberals again. How much are 
they taking out of the pockets of Canadians and how much is every 
one of these people getting while living off the trough of the MP 
pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, so far we 
have noticed that the member has alienated women, also Atlantic 
Canadians. I am surprised he has not alienated aboriginal people. 
But we did not give him enough time. Maybe we will give him the 
next opportunity to talk about his party's aboriginal policy.
<P>
	I would like to know exactly where he stands on aboriginal 
policy since I represent 51 First Nations. I would like to know his 
views on funding to First Nations.
<P>
	The last thing I would like to ask the member is if he could 
explain to us why we would be in favour of his particular old age 
pension plan which is going to increase to individuals some 14.2 
per cent, as the Minister of Finance has suggested. Could he tell me 
if that is true or if Reformers have changed their position again and 
maybe gone back down to some other number? We would certainly 
like to know so we would know his position for the next election 
campaign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
interesting. The last point is wrong, so I will just dispense with that.
<P>
	Where we stand on aboriginal affairs in the country is for more 
accountability within the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development. We certainly did not get that from this 
group here.
<P>
	One more thing about alienation. These members, of course, do 
not understand what I was getting at. If they are doling out millions 
and millions of dollars in one year to a group, why does the money 
stay in the budget regardless of what group it is, year after year 
after year. Why are these expenditures not going down? Why are 
those expenditures staying in the same budget they always have? 
What this government does not have are people who have one clue 
about zero based budgeting.
<P>
	They basically say if it was in the budget last year, leave it there. 
There is all kinds of room in this budget to make reductions. They 
only reason the Liberals are not reducing these budgets is to try to 
buy votes from Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say 
that in listening to that speech I find it amazing that the Reform 
members have managed to attack all the interest groups in the 
country. What they do not realize is that Canadians collectively are 
different interest groups.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Talk about your MP pension plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Let me say on the public record that I will trade my 
pension for the pension of the leader of the Reform Party that gets 
subsidized by all sorts of goodies.
<P>
	The taxpayers budget, which they cannot run from and they will 
be held accountable for and which will be put to Canadians time 
and time again, states that they would slash equalization payments 
by 35 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	They would slash the Canada assistance plan by 34 per cent. 
They would slash the aboriginal program by 24 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8427"> 8427 </A></B>
<P>
	When we you go through what they were going to do there 
would have been no budget left and there would not be a Canada 
left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, meanwhile 
they slash $7 billion from health but say nothing about it.
<P>
	It is interesting that the member opposite says we should be 
funding. They want to fund all special interest groups.
<P>
	I have negotiated against the Canadian conference of teamsters 
for many years. I fail to see why that interest group gets it year after 
year, I believe it is $137,912.
<P>
	The trouble is all this money they have taken from the Canadian 
taxpayer is used in many cases to buy votes. It is not used as a zero 
based budgeting concept to see how important it is to the 
productivity of this nation. It is to buy votes. That is what they do 
not understand about budgets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, the hon. 
member said we are using money to buy votes. First of all, that is 
illegal. Second, that is not allowed in the Chamber. Mr. Speaker, I 
would ask you to ask him to withdraw immediately.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Oxford on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my 
time with my colleague for Hillsborough, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to Minister of Labour.
<P>
	I had a prepared speech but things have been so interesting with 
the last three or four speakers that I am going to leave it for a 
minute. I am going back to the member for Kootenay East. My 
colleague talked about Liberal-Tory, same old story.
<P>
	I am going back, and it may be too far for the hon. gentleman, to 
nine years of Conservative majority governments in this place. 
When the Tories started in 1984 the debt was something around 
$200 billion. After nine years of Michael Wilson, bless his heart, 
struggling with the deficit, they never met their targets, never got 
the deficit under $38 billion in a year and they more than doubled 
to $500 plus billion.
<P>
	That is not the story of this budget or of this government. The 
deficit is now less than $19 billion. That is not the same story. The 
deficit to GDP ratio has been cut in half. That is not the same story. 
There is more than one way of achieving anything. We have chosen 
a fairly direct way. I would suggest to the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley West that this budget may well buy a few votes.
<P>
	When I was on the hustings in 1993 people wanted deficit 
control. The Canadian people are not stupid and they knew that if 
we continued to spend more than we earned we were going to be in 
a position of no return. We are going to hit the wall is the 
expression. A lot of people across the way do not seem to 
understand that. We do not hit the wall.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	I want to compliment the Minister of Finance. I want to 
compliment the cabinet. I want to compliment all the cabinet 
ministers. I want to compliment all the departments because if the 
ministers and their departments had not taken seriously the 
program review and had not cut their budgets we would not be in 
the enviable position we find ourselves in today.
<P>
	I want to compliment the members of caucus because they have 
contributed to the budget and to previous budgets. They have 
helped keep the Minister of Finance on course to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	I also want to thank a few other people we never do thank and 
one is the public servants who have not had an increase in six years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> But you have on your 
pension. It's indexed every darn year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Fraser Valley West 
talks about my pension. I have not earned an MP's pension yet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Yet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> I pay so much income tax on what I earn that I 
cannot survive without my teacher's pension. Let us not worry 
about that.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Another double dipper.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> I earned it.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Take it out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> I earned it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Let's talk more about those pensions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Mr. Speaker, we need to congratulate another large 
group and that is the citizens of this country who have gone along 
consistently with the government and the successive budgets that 
the Minister of Finance has brought forward. They are now reaping 
the benefits of that support. We are now able to say: ``Here is some 
money for this and here is some money for that''. We are going to 
meet our goals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Let's talk about the $10 billion payroll tax grab.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Let's talk about you shutting down the hospitals. 
Let's talk about that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> What government, with scarce resources, shows 
what its values are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> The social conscience of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Our values are jobs, health care, education and our 
children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8428"> 8428 </A></B>
<P>
	I listened much more quietly to the hon. members opposite than 
they care to listen to me. However, you really have to repeat things 
over and over again, don't you?
<P>
	In 1998-99, for the first time in 28 years, the government will not 
have to borrow any new money. We will be in the best position 
among the G7 nations. The rapid turnaround of our finances has 
boosted confidence in the economy. This confidence encourages 
investment. It keeps interest rates low and helps to create jobs. 
Employment has grown by 91,000 jobs in the last four months 
alone. Private sector forecasters expect 300,000 to 350,000 new 
jobs this year.
<P>
	There is an old saw that says ``figures don't lie, but liars can 
figure''. I am not calling anyone a liar, in case somebody rises. I 
will change the saw ``figures don't lie, but politicians often fool 
around with figures''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Especially Reform because they cannot get it 
straight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> That is right, especially the Reform Party. My 
friend from Kootenay East used figures very constructively a little 
earlier. He talked about the GDP increasing 9.5 per cent and the 
revenue increasing 12.5 per cent. This was some sort of sleight of 
hand, some sort of disaster-
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> It's a tax increase.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Mr. Speaker, if our workforce were at the same level 
now in 1997 as it was in 1993, unemployment would be at 6.4. per 
cent, not 9.7 per cent. Revenues are up because more people are 
working and more people are paying taxes. If they were not up 
more than the GDP then how could we reduce the deficit? It cannot 
be both ways. Revenue cannot be kept at this point and reduce the 
deficit. It is not possible, and all Canadians understand that.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member for Hillsborough wants to get started 
so I will cease here.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is a minute and 39 seconds. The 
hon. member for Beaver River.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
pretty simple question. I will quote the hon. member from part of 
his speech. He said: ``I haven't earned my MP pension'' and we are 
going to do all we can to make sure he never does, but then he said 
further, ``my taxes are so high that I can't afford to live without my 
teacher's pension''.
<P>
	How many Canadians have the luxury of a teacher's pension to 
subsidize their small wage of $64,400? If he says that his taxes are 
too high-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Oxford has the 
remaining 40 seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have nothing to hide. I worked for 36 
years in education. I have a teacher's pension. I pay taxes like every 
other Canadian on the money I earn. It is considerable and I pay 
considerable taxes. That is my only point.
<P>
	When I say I have not earned my MP pension I mean that I have 
paid for it but I have not earned it yet. I have to get elected again. It 
is not granted on one term. I certainly hope that I am back here after 
the next election and that some of my colleagues across the way are 
not. They do not want the pension anyway.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 6.52 p.m., it is my duty to 
interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question 
necessary to dispose of the subamendment now before the House. 
The question is on the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment to the 
amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the amendment to 
the amendment will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Call in the members.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RURALDEVELOPMENT">RURAL DEVELOPMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, further to my question to the minister of agriculture, rural 
Canada's concerns must be kept in the forefront and must remain a 
priority for this federal government. This week's budget takes great 
strides down that road.
<P>
	I was very pleased to see the finance minister's emphasis on 
programs and investments that will work for rural Canadians. 
These budget measures will directly impact my riding of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka and will help businesses in my riding to create 
jobs.
<P>
<B>(1920 )</B>
<P>
	In addition to the renewed commitment to a federal 
infrastructure job creation program which has been very beneficial 
in my riding, I point to the $15 million annual increase over three 
years for the Canadian Tourism Commission, and the $50 million 
investment in the Business Development Bank of Canada. This will 
lever another $250 million in loans for the creation of tourism 
infrastructure in rural areas.
<P>
	I single out the $50 million investment to the Farm Credit 
Corporation to be used for rural development and the $30 million 
to expand the community access program to ensure that virtually 
all rural communities are linked to the Internet.
<P>
	This is support upon which we can build. This is support that is 
right in line with what constituents across Canada were asking for 
when we took testimony as part of the natural resources 
committee's rural development study.
<P>
	Those of us from rural areas have identified several priorities 
that need to be addressed in order to enhance economic 
development in the rural areas of our country. Some of these the 
budget has dealt with. I am sure the constituents in rural Canada 
will applaud the government's initiatives on these rural issues.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8430"> 8430 </A></B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister himself made a firm commitment to tackle 
the unique needs of rural Canadians on behalf of all of us who 
live in rural areas. Four ministers were charged with the rural 
development portfolio and my committee has helped lead the way.
<P>
	We set about detailing the challenges of rural Canada, the lack of 
formal education for some of those or the lack of access to 
education in high technology fields where the jobs are for others.
<P>
	We looked at partnerships between the public and private sectors 
to better meet the needs of business operators in rural areas so that 
they would be better able to overcome the disadvantages of 
distance, geography, low population densities and so that we could 
enhance investment opportunities and expand our information 
base.
<P>
	We looked at ways to enhance the benefits of value adding in our 
natural resources sector. We looked at restrictive regulatory 
regimes and how they could be eliminated. We looked at how to 
eliminate duplication and the need to have increased tax incentives 
for investment.
<P>
	Investment in innovative technologies and initiatives that will 
ensure that virtually all rural communities have access to the 
Internet and that build upon our efforts to date will go a long way to 
giving those of us who live in rural Canada the support we need to 
compete in an urban oriented world.
<P>
	Further elaboration on planned or existing initiatives will help 
constituents in my riding understand and therefore benefit from 
federal commitments today.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
the speech from the throne and the commitment to rural economic 
renewal, federal departments have been working together to focus 
efforts.
<P>
	A great variety of programs and services currently can assist 
rural development, yet these are not widely known. The first step 
has been to ensure that rural Canadians are made aware of what is 
already available. Communications activities are under way to 
provide concrete details of programs and service information to 
rural Canadians.
<P>
	Among the many programs, the Canadian adaptation and rural 
development fund, noted in the House on February 6, is putting 
more than $100 million over the next four years into the hands of 
local adaptation councils across Canada.
<P>
	A further $50 million capital infusion to the FCC announced in 
the budget will assist growth and diversification in the farm sector. 
The government is also pursuing further opportunities to improve 
the range of financial products and services available to rural 
Canadians.
<P>
	The community access program is helping rural and remote 
communities access the information highway. In January a further 
429 projects were funded, making a total of over 700 rural 
communities across Canada now being assisted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the 1996 budget speech, the government provided for a fund 
to assist 1,500 communities by 1998. In this year's budget, it sets 
aside another $30 million over the next three years to help some 
5,000 rural communities gain access to the Internet. These 
community access points-

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HOUSING">HOUSING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
one week ago, on February 13, I had the opportunity in the House 
to ask the Minister of Public Works and Government Services a 
question on the issue of co-op housing in Canada.
<P>
	The question flowed from a number of concerns that have been 
brought to my attention as the member of Parliament for 
London-Middlesex.
<P>
	Before directing these comments to my colleague, the 
parliamentary secretary, I would like to refresh members' minds 
because I think they all have had representations made to them that 
there are three primary concerns of people who live in co-op 
housing now.
<P>
	First is the maintenance of national standards. Quite frankly, 
people in Ontario have a very real concern that where there is a 
right wing slashing type of government in power, as they feel the 
current government is, such a government cannot be relied on 
without definitive national standards to protect co-op housing as it 
currently exists.
<P>
	They have a very real fear that the government will put it on 
chopping block one way or another, either by passing it on to the 
municipalities or simply by refusing to protect current 
arrangements.
<P>
	Second is the whole issue of the protection of current agreements 
which exist for people living in co-op housing, particularly the 
protection of current mortgage agreements.
<P>
	Third is the necessity for full public consultation between the 
federal government, the people who live in co-op housing and their 
spokespeople across the country.
<P>
	A option has been put forward by these people that they would 
like the opportunity to run co-op housing themselves in 
co-operation with the federal government, which they have much 
more trust in, as was expressed to me, than they have in certain 
provincial governments in the country.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8431"> 8431 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder if the parliamentary secretary could elaborate on the 
assurances that the minister gave me. I will quote part of her 
answer very briefly: ``As a condition, before provinces get to sign 
an agreement, they will have to agree to respect national 
principles''.
<P>
	My question on that point to the parliamentary secretary is how 
would we insist that these national principles be enforced. If 
governments refused to live up to them, what then would be the 
course of the federal government?
<P>
	The minister went on to say: ``More important, they will have to 
adhere to a strict accountability framework in order to ensure that 
those dollars continue to be spent to help those in need of 
housing''.
<P>
	I wonder if the parliamentary secretary might elaborate on 
exactly what strict accountability the minister had in mind when 
she gave that answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to respond further to the question raised by my 
colleague regarding the important negotiations between the federal 
government and the provinces concerning housing.
<P>
	The federal government has offered to the provinces and 
territories the opportunity to take over the management of the 
existing federal social housing resources, with the exception of 
housing on Indian reserves, provided federal subsidies continue to 
be used for housing and are targeted to low income households.
<P>
	These negotiations are aimed at simplifying the administration 
of social housing by eliminating overlap and duplication and 
providing clients with one stop shopping.
<P>
	Let me assure my colleague that national principles and a 
rigorous accountability framework will govern the agreement and 
provinces will have to agree and respect those agreements. Once 
new social housing agreements are in place, any future cost savings 
that may be realized will be used for social housing purposes, 
either to assist in the management and/or renovation of the older 
existing social housing portfolio or to create new social housing

<P>
	The federal government is not withdrawing the financial support 
it provides to low income Canadians with housing needs. We will 
continue to meet our financial obligations related to the existing 
social housing portfolio currently at about $1.9 billion a year.
<P>
	With regard to the protection of existing rights of people living 
in co-operative housing, let me further assure my colleague that 
since individual sponsors own and operate most of the federally 
assisted non-profit and co-operative housing, CMHC agreements 
with individual co-operatives will continue to be legally binding. I 
can assure my hon. colleague of that.

the House is deemed to have been adopted. The House stands 
adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow.
<P>
