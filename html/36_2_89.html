</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Northumberland, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of all Canadians I wish to offer my 
condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Bob Homme, Canada's 
Friendly Giant, who passed away yesterday at his home in Grafton, 
Ontario in my constituency of Northumberland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For almost 30 years, beginning in 1958 and extending into the 
mid-1980s, the <I>Friendly Giant</I> was a fixture on CBC 
television.  Mr. Homme was not only the star of the show but also 
its creative force. Over this period, during which more than 
3,000 episodes were produced, Mr. Homme's character along with 
his trusty companions, Jerome the Giraffe and Rusty the Rooster, 
established an enduring bond with generations of Canadian 
children. Enchanting them with the wonder of books and music, my 
own three children, Doug, John and Cathy, like so many others, 
considered the <I>Friendly Giant</I> their favourite TV 
entertainment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the Order of Canada was awarded to Mr. Homme in 
recognition of these unique and significant accomplishments.  He 
will be sadly missed but always fondly remembered.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, over the years billions—that is 
right, billions—of taxpayers' dollars have been wasted 
subsidizing VIA Rail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given these billions squandered by VIA, let me ask this not of 
the minister but of the taxpayers:  What benefit have they, their 
families, their towns or their regions ever received from these 
billions of dollars in spending, or more important, how could 
this money have been better spent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims that the private sector is not interested in 
VIA so the subsidies are necessary.  I believe the private sector 
is interested and I offer this challenge to the minister. If I 
can get expressions of interest from the private sector operators 
to take over VIA Rail without taxpayer subsidies, will he commit 
to direct the transport committee to review the potential of 
their interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of Canadians who have just sent in their tax returns 
want to know if the government is spending their money 
responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister continues to subsidize VIA by almost $750,000 a 
day when it can be run by the private sector without cost to the 
taxpayer, Canadians will have their answer.

it is with great sadness and regret that I inform the members of 
the House that Walter F. Cook of New Hamburg, Ontario passed away 
suddenly at his residence on April 27, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A community leader, Mr. Cook devoted himself to his local 
business, his church and his government.  He owned and operated 
Cook's Pharmacy in New Hamburg and Wellesley.  He committed 
himself to the Trinity Lutheran Church and represented New 
Hamburg on the Wilmot Township Council.  Mr. Cook was also a 
veteran serving Canada in World War II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Cook is remembered by his beloved wife, Audrey E. Cook, his 
children and his grandchildren and will be dearly missed by all 
members of our community.

I rise today to pay tribute to our country's devoted reservists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, reservists across Canada are setting aside their usual 
cover of anonymity and wearing their uniform to work or school 
in order to show their pride in serving their country.  Their 
employers, their teachers and the public will also have an 
opportunity to show their support in return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These men and women are essential to the vitality of these 
illustrious Canadian units. 
They have served and continue to serve their country with 
distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Primary Reserve, who wear the uniform of the 
army, the navy and the air force, can be proud of the services 
they have rendered, both in Canada and abroad, as well as in 
relief operations in disaster areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to pay tribute to the 20 Corrections Canada teachers from 
British Columbia who are visiting the House this afternoon. These 
teachers play a vital role in the important work being done by 
Corrections Canada every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These dedicated professionals are here in Ottawa for the 
Literacy 2000 conference which is co-sponsored by Corrections 
Canada and U.S. Corrections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success of literacy programs is best illustrated by the 
success of learners.  The many people who have taken advantage of 
the opportunities provided to improve their reading, writing and 
numeracy skills have taken advantage of an opportunity to 
dramatically change their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ability to read and write is essential in our own personal 
development. I applaud these Corrections Canada teachers and 
their efforts to meet the needs of undereducated adults and to 
encourage them to strive to meet their goals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am in favour of inmates learning a trade but the 
learning at William Head Institute in Victoria has been taken a 
little too far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inmates at the facility are encouraged to learn carving, 
woodworking and even a little welding.  However, some inmates 
have decided to combine these activities and become boat 
builders.  This would not be a bad thing if it were a prairie 
prison surrounded by only seas of blowing wheat but the institute 
is surrounded on three sides by water.  This makes a boat 
building enterprise a very practical decision for an inmate with 
a little ingenuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I am no Mark Twain and this is not the story of Huck Finn, 
but believe it or not, it is true.  A career criminal went on a 
crime spree after sailing away from William Head Institute.  Even 
the court judge who sentenced the recaptured inmate to an 
additional 10 years was curious how an inmate could be allowed to 
build a raft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fair to the warden, I believe him when he says they do not 
have a boat building program at the institute.  That would be 
foolhardy and we all know that Corrections Canada would never do 
anything that is foolhardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the warden should take a walk down to the shop to make 
sure the inmates are not making speedboats for an even faster 
getaway.

Speaker, I rise today to celebrate constitution day with the 
people of Poland and Polish Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May 3 marks the 209th anniversary of Poland's constitution.  The 
constitution of 1791 was the first liberal constitution in Europe 
and the second in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The philosophies of humanitarianism and tolerance are present 
throughout the constitution.  These include the right to rule by 
majority, secret ballots at all elections, as well as religious 
freedom and liberty for all people.  This constitution founded a 
government called the guardian of laws, established a 
constitutional monarchy and introduced the principle of 
ministerial responsibility to the parliament. In terms of 
democratic precepts, this constitution is a landmark in the 
history of central and eastern Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solidarity honoured the memory of the bill on government 
following the parliamentary elections of June 1989. On April 6, 
1990, the parliament re-established the May 3rd constitution day 
which is celebrated today around the world.

Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise in the House

man who meant so much to the lives of young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bob Homme created the <I>Friendly Giant</I> in 1953 for American

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who could forget the characters that meshed with the Friendly

crucial importance of this fundamental freedom for the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The freedom of the press is an essential rampart against abuse

vital source of information that influences society's choices. 
Therefore, no one can question the freedom of the press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the Bloc Quebecois wants to acknowledge the work of the 
members of the press gallery who report daily on what goes on in

given day, their schedule may be disrupted one, twice or even 
three times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the complexity of their role and deadlines that are seldom 
conducive to producing the rigorous work that is required of

Canadian Journalists for Free Expression is celebrating World 
Press Freedom Day.  One of the hallmarks of a civilized society 
is the encouragement of public debate.  As we all know and 
sometimes take for granted, an essential agent in this democratic

press is most needed many journalists are forced to put their 
lives in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To mark World Press Freedom Day, the first National Press Club 
press freedom award will be presented to a journalist who has 
contributed to the cause of press freedom.  Also today 
Journalists in Exile, a group of journalists from Burundi, Iran, 
Serbia, Sierra Leone and Sri Lanka, is gathering at Ryerson 
University to share its experiences and promote this worthy 
cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of members of the House I offer my gratitude as well

maintain freedom of the press, especially where it is most 
threatened.  We owe them a great debt.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

discovered over at HRD the minister crowed about how her little 
six point plan would save the day.  It turns out that her plan 
went six points to no place according to her own independent 
appraisers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deloitte & Touche reviewed that plan and gave it a failing

was told by the experts that it would fail? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

least a day late.  If she had been her yesterday, as we made 
clear, Deloitte & Touche received the audit plan in the first 
draft.  We paid them to look at it, to make recommendations, and 
they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If she had been here or maybe at the committee yesterday, she 
would have heard what they actually said, which was and I quote— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  We should not mention 
whether a member was here or is here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

Deloitte & Touche made a recommendation on February 2 and there 
were no substantive changes in the minister's six point plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report was dated February 2.  They said they had serious 
concerns about it.  On February 8 she stood in the House after no 
substantive changes to the six point plan and said “I am going 
to save the day”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That simply is not true and I would like to repeat my question 
to the minister.  Why did she brag about this when the very 
company she hired showed that it had serious concerns? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I bragged about it because indeed we took 
the recommendations of this company and implemented them. 
Yesterday in committee, and I quote, Deloitte & Touche stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—subsequent to our report...my understanding is the department 
has taken our advice, the advice of others and revised the action 
plan. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again let us remember that the auditor general said this was an 
extraordinary response to an extraordinary circumstance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>   Mr. Speaker, this minister knows she created 
those extraordinary circumstances.  She just said that Deloitte & 
Touche said “my understanding is that the minister has taken the 
recommendation”.  She never even gave them the decency of giving 
it back to them to read and make any recommendations on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just great to sit there and laugh it off, but this was $1 
billion that Canadian taxpayers are pretty darned concerned 
about.  The minister has had the gall to stand in the House and 
say that everything is fine. 
How can she stand here and tell the House that the plan is 
working when people across the country know that it is a doomed 
failure?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

Touche said that we had a good short term plan and Deloitte & 
Touche gave us recommendations on how to make it better for the 
longer term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We implemented those plans.  We have added aspects of training 
and we have added aspects focusing on accountability.  We have 
ensured that senior management know what their roles are and what 
accountable role they will have to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a plan that will work.  Men and women across the country

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

the minister was caught in a billion dollar boondoggle.  Instead 
of resigning, she waved around a six point plan that was supposed 
to fix everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She used words in the House to imply that Deloitte & Touche had 
endorsed her plan.  Now we find out that Deloitte & Touche 
actually gave the minister's plan a failing grade.  Why did the 
minister hide the fact that Deloitte & Touche had advised her 
that her plan was inadequate? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Slowly, slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Very slowly, as my colleague suggests. 
We put together a plan.  What we felt was appropriate to do was 
to test this plan with outside experts, the auditor general, 
Deloitte & Touche, and the advisory committee to treasury board. 
They all gave us recommendations and we implemented those 
recommendations to tighten our plan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, right from day one in January the 
minister pretended that her plan was the right plan, a good plan, 
no problems with her plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She never once told Canadians or the House “oops, this plan 
wasn't so good.  We actually had to come up with a better one 
later”.  She has never ever said that.  Instead she chose to 
hide the Deloitte & Touche report and maintain all along that her 
plan was just great from day one.  Why was safeguarding her own 
image more important to her than really safeguarding taxpayer 
money? 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

six point plan back in February.  I suggested to all members if 
they had advice to give us to strengthen that plan that they do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not had one recommendation from that party to strengthen 
the plan because it is amended and it is working.  We are making 
and taking corrective action in my department.

Placeteco is a good example of everything that ought not to be 
done in a case when public funds are invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says that the mistakes made were honest ones. I am 
willing to believe her, and the proof that the funds were really 
awarded properly and in accordance with the rules is that she 
has the invoices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking her this: Why will she not make the invoices public? 
It would be easy and we might then understand. Can she make 
public the invoices establishing that the funds were really 
awarded properly and in accordance with the rules?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the documents the day before yesterday. We have the

she should know, with the numbers and the vouchers but there are 
no invoices in it. We submitted another request asking

bring that forward we will look at it more, but I can tell him 
that there has been no information on this particular file that 
has gone out through access to information yesterday or the day 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear about access to information.  This is an act of 
this House, as is the Privacy Act.  I make no decisions on the 
information that is conveyed to requesters.  The hon. member

is right.  Perhaps she should ask her officials to get down to 
work like everyone else.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I say that when we are talking about information on 
companies here in the country or on individuals in the country, 
the responsible and appropriate way to make that information

the case of Placeteco, and yet they appear in other files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will chose my words carefully, Mr. Speaker, but I would ask 
that she not select the invoices.  She should give us the ones 
for Placeteco, not the ones for Globax or Technipaint.  What we 
want from her are the ones from Placeteco, because Placeteco got 
a grant.  That seems clear to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is being discussed everywhere.  If she is still not aware

bungled in the first place precisely because of a lack of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

was an internal audit that identified the problems.

Mr. Speaker, here is a section of the Deloitte & Touche report 
which fell short of endorsing that six point plan.  I think this 
should frighten taxpayers.  It says “The draft plan does not 
clearly assign leadership and responsibility, does not clearly 
assign to specific individuals the actions they are responsible 
for, does not establish time lines, deliverables and milestones, 
does not identify the systems and practices needed to monitor 
progress”.  In other words, the six point plan does exactly the 
same thing as what bungled the $1 billion in the first place.  If 
she cannot convince Deloitte & Touche, how can she—

seems that the military generals are taking a position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has now come to light that military officials knew about the 
harmful effects of depleted uranium before the gulf war.  Why 
then does the government still try to suggest that DU is safe? 
The defence minister has made it clear that he supports testing 
those suffering from exposure to DU.  Why has he not taken action 
on an insulting and intimidating force's memo distributed to 
those Canadians suffering, basically telling them that the 
problem may be all in their heads? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, recently Canadians in the Halifax area suffering from 
exposure to this toxin have been told there is no directive for 
the forces to provide testing for depleted uranium.  What does 
the minister have to say about this? 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the scientific studies to this point in 
time do not indicate that any Canadians have suffered from 
depleted uranium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding that, I have offered veterans of the gulf war an 
opportunity for independent testing, and a number of them have 
taken us up on that offer.  I want to make sure, because this is 
the bottom line:  if any of our troops went over to the gulf or 
anywhere else in the world for Canada, and if they went over well 
and came back sick, we will look after them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, we think some amendments are required not to 
change the bill's thrust but rather to improve the bill. It is 
in that spirit of co-operation and with a view to improving the 
legislation that we participated in all the various stages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention that the time allocated to us between the end 
of the testimonies at the Standing Committee on Finance and the 
beginning of the review, particularly the clause by clause 
review, was much too short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that this House and all its committees ensure that, next 
time, more time be provided between the end of the testimonies 
and the beginning of the clause by clause review of a bill. 
Otherwise, what is the use of these testimonies, of all the 
efforts, money and time expended by witnesses to come and 
express their views, if we do not have time afterwards to digest 
this new information? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to explain what Motion No. 1 is all about. Bill C-22 
imposes new obligations to various organizations and entities, 
such as banks, casinos and caisses populaires. We know that bank 
charges for most Quebec and Canadian consumers are already very 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill imposes new obligations to these entities to help fight 
money laundering. 
The purpose of Motion No. 1 is to ensure that the costs resulting 
from the new obligations imposed by Bill C-22 on these various 
institutions are not passed on to clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fight against money laundering, this amendment obliges 
these institutions to be good corporate citizens.  In the battle 
that all elements of society must wage against money laundering, 
we want to ensure that financial institutions become good 
corporate citizens and do not transfer to their clients the 
costs incurred in carrying out these new obligations. Finally, 
they must do their part so that everyone helps carry the load in 
the fight against money laundering; these institutions will have 
to absorb these costs, which are minor for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the banks make profits in the billions.  The idea 
is to prevent them from passing on the costs of these 
obligations to their clients.  In my view, this would be a big 
improvement to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People say “Another obligation for the banks.  They will pass on 
the bill to us.  Our fees will go up again.  This is crazy, we 
are already paying plenty”.  The purpose of this amendment is to 
avoid all this and ensure that clients do not suffer because of 
these obligations.

laundering bill which went straight to committee on division.  We 
are trying to see if we can agree on some arrangements with 
respect to one of the motions that the member from the Bloc has 
submitted.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak very briefly about the process. Members 
know the way standing committees work.  Many of them have set up 
a separate steering committee or planning committee. That 
committee meets and charts out the plan of the committee for a 
period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say in the case of the House of Commons finance 
committee there is a steering committee.  It met and there was a 
work plan established.  Within that work plan there were two or 
three days of hearings and consultations with respect to the 
money laundering bill.  Also within the plan there was a period 
the next day or the following day when there would be a clause by 
clause debate of the money laundering bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Admittedly it was tight program, but given the importance of the 
money laundering bill and the support in principle for the bill 
that schedule was agreed to by all parties on the steering 
committee and presented to the full committee for approval where 
it was approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we make these commitments we know that the schedule is 
tight but we all try within our very busy schedules to deal with 
that timetable the very best way we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn to Motion No. 1 by the Bloc.  In principle 
we can understand why the hon. member might propose motion. 
Basically the proposition is that financial institutions will be 
required to report suspicious transactions.  If they are required 
to report certain amounts to the centre that will be defined by 
regulation and through the guidelines, this will put some burden 
on financial institutions to report these transactions to the 
centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that there is already a voluntary regime in 
place.  Many of the financial institutions are already complying. 
Not as many as we would like, and in fact that is why the bill 
calls for mandatory reporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for the government to regulate the prices that 
institutions and professionals charge for their services.  That 
is the bottom line.  If a financial institution is burdened with 
some additional costs of reporting then the hon. member is saying 
that those costs should be borne by the financial institution or 
the financial intermediary and not by Canadian consumers.  That 
is a laudable goal, but generally the government does not 
regulate the prices that federally regulated financial 
institutions charge for their services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion would have to go beyond these institutions by 
regulating the prices of provincially regulated institutions, 
unregulated companies, casinos, and professionals covered by the 
bill.  Even if we thought that it would be a good idea to 
regulate these prices, the task of monitoring compliance would be 
monumental, if not impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government indicated at committee, the provisions in the 
bill will be implemented after close consultation with the 
institutions and professionals affected.  Every attempt will be 
made to minimize the cost of complying with the bill.  I do not 
think the compliance costs will be that significant.   It will be 
up to every business and profession to determine how best to deal 
with the modest compliance costs that may result.  I cannot 
support the motion and I would encourage hon. members not to 
support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will be the third speaker to mention the whole 
issue of the compression of time.  As I pointed out at second 
reading, the bill is long overdue.  The government has been 
dragging its feet on it, and all of a sudden we are going at warp 
speed to try to get it through the procedure of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resent that very 
deeply on behalf of Canadian people because it is a vitally 
important bill.  It has the potential to impact many 
hundreds of thousands if not millions of people in their 
financial transactions not only with respect to costs but also 
with respect to privacy issues and with respect to enforcement 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I have to concur with the hon. member 
from the Bloc Quebecois, although I do acknowledge on the part of 
the Liberal speaker before me that there had been an all party 
agreement to a work schedule 
When the work schedule became unworkable it was incumbent in my 
judgment on the government to revisit that work schedule.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be raising this issue in some depth when we get to third 
reading.  Even as we speak there are ongoing negotiations on a 
bill and on clauses to a bill that have international 
ramifications, if not individual and national ramifications.  I 
find the process to be completely unacceptable.  It is a bill 
that is vital.  Because of the urgency to get the bill through, 
in part because of the delay of the Liberals in bringing it to 
the House of Commons, we will support it.  However I want the 
people of Canada to know that this is a seriously flawed process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 1, as has been noted by the 
government there is a problem which very simply is how in the 
world would we ever get institutions, individuals, professionals 
or casinos to comply with the particular bill.  I believe it is 
in Never-Never Land.  It is kind of a fairy tale, something like 
the tooth fairy, that the costs to institutions or individuals 
providing services to people will not somehow find their way into 
the service charges.  Of course they will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To try to regulate something that is totally unregulatable is 
pie in the sky.  As a consequence, although I have the greatest 
respect for the mover of the motion, I could never recommend to 
my colleagues that we support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as we mentioned earlier and as the other members have said, 
money laundering is a worldwide problem and, because of its 
nature, is difficult to quantify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the federal government, some $7 billion to $10 
billion is laundered in Canada.  John Walker, an Australian 
criminologist and mathematician, has developed a global model at 
the request of the Australian government to determine the scope 
of money laundering worldwide.  The United States and the UN are 
interested in his model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Australian estimates the money laundering worldwide to be 
worth about $3 trillion annually.  He does not paint a glowing 
picture of Canada.  According to his model, Canada ranks ninth 
worldwide as a country generating illicit money and eighth 
worldwide as a favoured destination for money laundering. 
According to this study, $64 billion in illicit funds from 
outside the country are laundered in Canada and $21 billion in 
criminal profits are generated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a clearing house for the laundering of money and this 
news is not good.  Canada is the only G-7 country that does not 
have legislation to fight money laundering.  This is why Bill 
C-22 is welcomed favourably by the Bloc Quebecois.  It is another 
step in the fight against organized crime.  The fight against 
this international scourge must begin at home first. 
For this reason, the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are in Canada measures against money laundering.  For 
example, there are provisions in the criminal code that make it 
a criminal offence to launder money and provide for the 
confiscation—

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, since I was interrupted right 
in the middle of a sentence, I will repeat it so that all those 
who are listening to us can understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, there are in Canada measures against money 
laundering.  For example, there are provisions in the criminal 
code that make it a criminal offence to launder money and provide 
for the confiscation of the proceeds and property derived from 
various organized crime drug trafficking activities. Under these 
provisions, the burden of proof is heavy for crown attorneys. 
They must prove beyond any reasonable doubt that a crime was 
committed and then that the seized goods were bought with dirty 
money. These investigations are extremely lengthy and few lead to 
prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 Canada passed the Proceeds of Crime (Monetary 
Laundering) Act, which requires several institutions to keep 
records. Indeed, financial institutions, foreign exchange 
offices, stockbrokers, life insurance companies and casinos are 
required to keep a record of transactions over $10,000. However, 
there is no accountability requirement. This reduces the 
possibility of investigating and laying charges, since the 
information collected is not in the hands of the police. If it 
is passed, Bill C-22 will replace the Proceeds of Crime (Money 
Laundering) Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures are clearly inadequate and do not seem to be 
effective enough.  That is why the Bloc Quebecois views Bill C-22 
as an improvement on the existing money laundering legislation. 
However, Bill C-22 provides for the gathering of information 
about the movement of money. This will now be obligatory.  A 
number of institutions and individuals will be required to make 
certain reports on the movement of money, as we mentioned. In 
addition, this information will be collected and analyzed in 
order to determine whether investigations or charges are 
warranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial institutions, exchange offices, casinos, life 
insurance companies and stockbrokers, among others, will now be 
required to report financial transactions that they suspect may 
be linked to an offence having to do with the laundering of the 
proceeds of crime. 
In addition, these institutions will be required to report 
certain categories of financial transactions described in the 
regulations and valued at more than C$10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons importing or exporting cash or goods valued at more than 
$10,000 and those crossing the Canadian border with such items 
will be required to report these amounts to a Canada Customs 
official. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That concludes my remarks on Bill C-22 for now.  We will 
certainly have an opportunity to continue the debate with the 
amendments that will be introduced in the course of the 
afternoon.

hard for his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would add to a new clause to the bill.  It would 
read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.1  The persons and entities to which this Act applies shall not 
transfer to their clients, either directly or indirectly, any 
costs incurred by them in carrying out their obligations under 
this Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very positive, common sense amendment and one that the 
Progressive Conservative Party of Canada will be supporting 
wholeheartedly.  The main purpose of the amendment is obvious. 
It would protect the average citizen from the various 
organizations concerned effectively passing the buck on to them, 
that is, using citizens very much as a dupe for some organized 
crime unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the banking sector consumers are already faced 
with relatively high service charges and further increases would 
not be desirable.  As we all know, money laundering is a process 
by which revenues derived from criminal activity are converted 
into assets that cannot easily be traced back to their origins. 
It is something that is happening at an alarming rate in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 would bring Canada up to date with the standards of 
our G-7 trading partners.  It does not take us beyond the minimum 
standard, but it does take us at least to the standard that G-7 
countries have set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States I had the pleasure recently of visiting 
with an organized crime unit in the state of Massachusetts where 
they are doing a great deal to address this problem, and they are 
putting resources into it.  That is the number one problem facing 
this government and this country.  We are not arming our policing 
agencies, our internal security agencies, with sufficient 
resources to combat what is a very sophisticated and very well 
armed organized crime syndicate operating in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The saying that crime does not pay could not be further from the 
truth with regard to money laundering.  It is estimated that 
between $5 billion and $17 billion in criminal proceeds are 
laundered in Canada each year.  It has become a very lucrative 
and profitable business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has long had a reputation of being one of the easiest 
jurisdictions in which to legitimize the proceeds of illegal 
pursuits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest report of the Crime Intelligence Service of Canada 
indicates that money laundering has allowed, for example, the 
Sicilian mafia to continue to infiltrate legitimate business. 
Asian based groups are heavily involved in Canadian heroin and 
drug trafficking.  We also know that the Russian mafia has become 
very prevalent inside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been discussion in the Chamber recently about the 
situation, particularly on the west coast, of the smuggling of 
humans.  We know that the sidewinder project has received a great 
deal of attention in the media of late.  This again demonstrates, 
sadly, our lack of resources when it comes to law enforcement, 
our internal security services, and their ability to combat 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering is but one aspect of this growing concern we 
have about protecting the integrity of our citizens and our money 
system.  Money laundering poses to law enforcement personnel one 
of their greatest challenges in the battle against organized 
crime.  To fight organized crime effectively, law enforcement 
agencies and we, as legislators, must address the challenges 
posed by current trends in money laundering and adopt a strategy 
to respond to those challenges.  This bill moves in that 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, several months ago United States officials 
uncovered the biggest money laundering operation ever inside 
their country.  Federal investigators believe that Russian 
gangsters had channelled up to $10 billion through the Bank of 
New York, the 15th largest bank in the United States. 
This news sent shock waves throughout the entire financial 
services sector and proved that money laundering can affect even 
the biggest banks, those big commercial banks who would have us 
believe they are impenetrable.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has moved ahead very quickly with its own 
tough, new money laundering legislation.  It is very concerned, 
and we have seen it time and again, because the American economy 
and law enforcement agencies are very much tied, and therefore 
vulnerable, to our weaker internal security services.  The U.S. 
has expressed concern repeatedly about the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberals took power in 1993 our internal security has 
diminished and has continued to be weakened.  The Liberal 
government has given the United States much evidence to validate 
its concerns.  In December 1999 U.S. customs officers discovered 
an Algerian Canadian, with Algerian terrorist connections, 
attempting to enter the United States through Seattle with a 
carload of explosives.  This touched off a very serious concern 
within the United States and it continues to this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 25, 2000 the U.S. government suspended firearm and 
ammunition sales to Canada, which was done at the request of the 
Canadian government, and legal import licences were being used to 
import large quantities of handguns, rifles and ammunition. 
Firearms were then smuggled back into other countries.  Many of 
them went back to the United States.  This was very much an 
embarrassment for Canada.  The soft approach on crime is 
highlighted by these inadequacies.  It was another blow to our 
good relationship with the United States, because of our open, 
undefended border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the Liberals have talked repeatedly about increasing 
penalties for money laundering in a manner that would be 
consistent with public safety, yet the RCMP still lacks the 
proper budget to deal with today's very sophisticated crime.  For 
example, we saw that only $810 million had been set aside over 
the next three years.  Much of that has been earmarked to fight 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the usual sleight of hand has to be uncovered, 
and that is that 62% of this new money will not be available 
until the year 2001-02.  This will be added to the RCMP base 
budget of about $2.1 million.  That is still not enough, given 
the level of the problem and the years that the RCMP, CSIS and 
other services have been underfunded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mounties have already had to curtail their activities with 
respect to undercover operations which targeted organized crime. 
Reduction in training and the inability to conduct fraud 
investigations in British Columbia and undercover operations 
seriously jeopardizes the RCMP's ability to effectively do its 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To correct these problems it is proposed that 5,000 new RCMP 
officers would be needed.  Also lacking is staff at the forensic 
laboratory, the need for DNA databanks and the need to update the 
CPIC system.  Police forces need this type of technology, and yet 
the government cannot even afford and will not commit the money 
that is needed to deal with these very serious inadequacies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government gave $115 million to the CPIC program when it was 
stated quite clearly that what was needed was $283 million.  Once 
again, a pittance.  It is an insult to our brave men and women 
who are in the mounties and in the secret service to have to work 
under these conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia mounties alone may shift away from organized 
crime to deal with more pressing needs of fulfilling police 
vacancies and paying their officers.  Basic policing needs have 
to be attended to and, therefore, organized crime needs are being 
neglected.  In rural areas there is a very serious problem of 
losing RCMP documents and losing municipal police forces in small 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Shefford, represented by the Progressive 
Conservative member from Granby, is dealing with the very serious 
threat of losing its detachment.  Biker gangs are terrorizing 
farmers and forcing them to grow marijuana in their fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a Bloc member who is currently being threatened by 
members of biker gangs and organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada supports the broad 
purpose and principles of this bill, that is, to remedy the 
shortcomings in Canada's anti-money laundering legislation as 
identified by the G-7 financial action task force on money 
laundering.  We support this amendment and we will be very 
supportive of this bill as it proceeds through the House and the 
various committee stages.

the privacy commissioner and the information access commissioner

their co-operation in trying to reach some conclusion to these 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 would impose a legal requirement on customs 
officers to do what in certain circumstances is done as a matter 
of good administrative practice. My concern with the motion is 
that it would create a procedural burden for routine actions, 
such as a request of a customs officer to look inside the trunk 
of a car which is crossing the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedures proposed in Bill C-22 to deal with cross-border 
movements of large amounts of currency and monetary instruments 
are intended to dovetail with similar procedures dealing with the 
movement of goods. Introducing a requirement to create a written 
record for routine actions by customs officers at the border 
would add bureaucracy and cause unnecessary delays for the 
travelling public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore would like to propose the suggestion that officers 
be required to record in writing their reasons for decisions 
under this bill not apply to routine actions but be limited 
instead to the exercise of the powers under subsection 18(1) 
which deal with the seizure of currency or monetary instruments. 
Therefore the amended motion would read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-22 be amended by adding after line 47 on page 10 the 
following new clause:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Normally in a speech an amendment is moved just once. 
There were several amendments created during the speech.  I would 
like to know what the protocol is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The protocol is when 
it is a report stage motion it is the responsibility of the 
Chair, where there is a recognition between parties that they are 
working toward resolving a bill, not to stand in the way of that. 
The Chair's responsibility is to make sure that what is being 
done is being done in a parliamentary sound fashion.  That is why 
we are taking the time now to make sure that what is being done 
is being done appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think behind the hon. member's question is the fact that 
generally if an amendment to a motion is moved, it is done at the 
end of an intervention and that terminates the intervention. In 
this case I recognized the hon. parliamentary secretary on a 
different motion within the context of that group recognizing 
that there had been negotiations between opposition and 
government members on this particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again it was not my intention to involve the Chair in the 
debate, but it is the responsibility of the Chair to ensure that 
if opposition and government are working toward resolution of 
differences on a bill, to facilitate the ability of members to 
work together in common cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, they cannot through amendment change a bill. 
All they can do is amend something that is already there; they 
cannot change the format or the intent.  This is what is being 
considered by the clerks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As this is the first time this has come before me, I will need 
the attention of all members present to make sure that it is done 
correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments as presented by the hon. parliamentary secretary 
are not in order because they are amendments to change the bill. 
What is before the House now are the amendments.  For an 
amendment to be in order it must amend a motion.  Therefore, the 
amendments as presented by the parliamentary secretary are not in 
order. This leaves the Chair in the position of saying that if 
there is the will for the motion to be amended it is not up to 
the Chair to negotiate this.  It must be done by the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way we could do this is to continue with the debate on the 
motions that are before the House. If there is no further debate 
on motions before the House, with the indulgence and with the 
unanimous consent of the House, we could move to Group No. 3 and 
then come back again to Group No. 2.  However, that would require 
the unanimous consent of the House.  Other than that, we will 
stay on the motions in Group No. 2 as they are presented.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to begin by saying that if the government had listened to 
the Canadian Alliance member who was sitting on the 
parliamentary committee at the time, if it had agreed to allow 
more time between the end of evidence and the beginning of the 
clause by clause review in committee, we would not find 
ourselves in this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only deplore it. I think the Canadian Alliance member will 
agree with me. This is deplorable, because normally this 
exercise should be done in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I want to make sure I clearly understood what 
you said. 
I proposed Motions Nos. 2 and 3, which were amended by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance. These are 
amendments to my motions with which I can live. I wonder if we 
could go the unanimous consent route. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The third option 
would be to ask for the unanimous consent of the House to receive 
the amendments as presented by the parliamentary secretary. 
If a member would like to make that motion, we will get on with 
it.  That is a good way to do it.

Mr. Speaker, the process that we are currently involved in is

Conservative Party and also my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois 
in debate this afternoon, we are talking about the core of 
international crime and the way in which we can track it.  The 
member for Charlevoix, another member and myself have all pointed 
out that the haste with which this is going through the House is 
to treat the House with disrespect and as a rubber stamp.

discussion in good faith between the Liberals and the Bloc

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate.  I thank 
again and recognize the efforts of the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg who moved Motions Nos. 2 to 7.  These motions 
highlight a concern which I think we all have.  Certainly we in 
the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada share the concerns 
with respect to this new agency passing on unrelated information 
that it might have about Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if the agency had reasonable grounds to pursue an 
individual case of money laundering, that much is fine, but money 
laundering has become a very serious issue and one that should be 
considered a threat to national security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globally experts estimate that between $300 billion and $500 
billion in United States currency is criminally derived from 
international capital markets or funds that are derived from 
outside our borders.  In Canada the federal government estimates 
that between $5 billion and $17 billion in criminal proceeds are 
laundered in this country each year.  If this new agency does not 
have enough power and enough evidence to pursue the case of money 
laundering, it could determine that there is not enough evidence 
to get the person on tax evasion and could conceivably release 
information to Revenue Canada. 
It is crucial that we ensure on behalf of Canadian taxpayers that 
this new agency is not swallowed up by the Godzilla tax collector 
out there, also known as the department of revenue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we saw happen in the House just a short time ago epitomizes 
how the government is flying by the seat of its pants.  We saw a 
member on the government side try to amend an amendment.  What 
was intended was to amend the act itself, which the Chair quite 
properly ruled out of order.  The member rose and we had to delay 
the debate because of the fact that the government did not know 
what it was doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows there is no plan.  The Liberals have lost the plot 
again with respect to a very important piece of legislation on 
which they should have taken the time to do their homework and 
prepare what they wanted to do instead of simply trying to 
hoodwink everybody that was in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party supports the broad principles 
of the bill before us on debate.  It is one of the most important 
efforts that we can all make with respect to law enforcement, 
with respect to the integrity of our country and with respect to 
the efforts of our law enforcement agencies to curtail and 
control a growing money laundering problem and criminal activity 
within our borders.  The Conservative Party supports the broad 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members of the RCMP call this legislation long overdue and 
say that it will make a significant difference, we have to take 
them at their word.  The Canadian Bankers Association has spoken 
very favourably about the legislation.  It similarly says that 
the legislation is long overdue and that organized crime will be 
much deterred by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International money capital markets annually are very much 
affected.  We know that the bill is aimed at addressing fiscal 
problems that occur when money is funnelled through legitimate 
organizations like banks.  We know as well that the amendments 
which have been introduced very much ameliorate and prop up some 
of the intended passages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel the legislation will be an improvement upon the current 
situation in the country, but we have to hearken back to where 
some of the real problems lie.  Where do the real problems stem 
from in terms of the ability of our law enforcement agencies to 
somehow control the situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a bill that is aimed at tightening up some of the 
legislative framework, but what we really need to do to improve 
the situation is to prop up the RCMP and CSIS by giving these law 
enforcement agencies the backup and resources they need to combat 
a very sophisticated organized crime syndicate in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the government has a reputation for being laid back and 
very non-supportive of our law enforcement agencies when it comes 
to their ongoing uphill battle with existing crime syndicates, 
not only motorcycle gangs but the increasing presence of Asian 
gangs, Russian gangs and the traditional Mafia within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compared to countries like the United States we pale in 
comparison in terms of the support that we give law enforcement 
agencies.  The other message that should be coming out in this 
debate is that it is not enough simply to put a legislative 
framework in place.  We have to pony up to the bar and put 
dollars on the table so that the men and women who are very much 
dedicated to our law enforcement services are not only seen to be 
given support but are given actual support.  We need to do this 
right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Party of Canada has always been very much 
supportive of agencies in the country that are tasked with this 
very important task.  They are the thin blue line between the 
Canadian public and those who choose a life of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is one of which our party is supportive.  The 
amendments as well are supported by our party.  The reaction from 
the community, from the banking community and from agencies 
across the land, seems to be one that has embraced the intention 
of the bill.  One would hope that there will be rapid passage of 
the legislation when it reaches the committee and when it comes 
back to the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering is but one part of the equation when it comes 
to organized crime.  We know that drug enforcement has been a 
huge problem from our law enforcement perspective.  We know that 
guns and other contraband material are coming across our 
undefended borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as well that child pornography and people smuggling are 
very much a problem.  We do not have impenetrable borders, and 
that will never happen.  The dismantling of the ports police 
which the government orchestrated by having weak border patrols 
was highlighted recently by the fact that we had an international 
terrorist cross into Seattle from Canada.  This alarmed American 
law enforcement officials.  They have called upon Canada to 
tighten up, to try to pick up the slack, because they are feeling 
very vulnerable as a result of Canada letting down the side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the indicators are there.  All the signs are speaking out to 
Canada to do something about it.  The legislation at least 
indicates that we are moving in the right direction, but sadly as 
we have come to expect from the government it is a baby step as 
opposed to a giant step or even a significant step in doing the 
right thing by propping up the men and women who are tasked with 
protecting the country's integrity, not only with respect to 
illegal funds but with respect to the whole gamut of illegal 
activity that is taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that gangs are very much rearing their ugly heads not 
only in cities like Montreal, Toronto and Calgary.  They are now 
making their presence known in rural communities across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the huge boundaries of water we have and because of 
the lack of resources that we have for the coast guard and the 
lack of resources that we have for the RCMP to actually partake 
in patrols on docks and in major ports, once again we are being 
very much left open to contraband materials entering the country. 
Money laundering is very much the focus of the bill, but we know 
that there are other very significant tasks, other very 
significant problems that are faced by law enforcement agents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is letting down the side.  It has not lived up to 
the billing.  It has not responded to requests from the RCMP.  It 
has not responded to requests to renew and bring back the ports 
police in this country.  It is not listening, and we know it is 
not listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more we are getting the indicators that this is a 
tired, arrogant government.  When the Prime Minister goes abroad 
and sticks his foot firmly in his mouth, it proves that time and 
time again.  We knew that long before he went to the Middle East. 
He was doing the same thing in this country, but now he has 
demonstrated it to the whole world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to hear is that the government is listening. 
Canadians want to hear that the government is actually listening 
to them.  This is an opportunity for the government to do so, but 
I do not think it is listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  I hear hon. members opposite becoming a 
little alarmed by the fact that we are pointing this out, but 
Canadians know what is happening and those members can say what 
they want.  The indicators are there.  The ears are closed.  The 
message is going out but they are not listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see a byelection in Newfoundland which will indicate 
that Canadians have had it with the Liberal government.  When 
that happens, maybe that message will start to penetrate those 
ears. The Liberals have big earmuffs on when it comes to 
listening to what Canadians have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With money laundering legislation that is aimed at a specific 
problem perhaps finally we will be able to get the attention of 
the government.  We hear about things like this happening in the 
country.  Unfortunately the national media are not always the 
most responsible in reporting exactly how it is, but we know that 
the particular problem has been broadcast across the country.  It 
has been broadcast clearly as an issue that has to be addressed 
and addressed now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that side of the House will continue to support 
initiatives like this one.  Unfortunately more and more the 
initiatives that matter most to Canadians, whether it be tax 
reduction, health care, something to do with student debt or 
initiatives to help our law enforcement agents, are coming from 
the opposition side because the Liberals are bankrupt on ideas. 
We know that when it comes to principle there is another party in 
here that can be very bankrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for its indulgence and for the time to speak 
to the legislation.  I look forward to seeing it passed through 
the various stages and becoming law.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF CANADA ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK192">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph—Wellington, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-451, an act to establish an oath of allegiance to the 
flag of Canada, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to 
debate my private member's bill, Bill C-451, an act to establish 
an oath of allegiance to the flag of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been working on this bill for a very long time.  It was 
originally introduced in 1996 but died on the order paper when 
the election was called the following year.  I was not able to 
reintroduce it until this spring and was very happy when it was 
drawn in the draw for Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea for this bill comes from a discussion I had with my 
constituent, Joyce Hammond.  When we realized that there were 
several oaths of allegiance in use, but no one official oath, we 
both agreed that an official oath should be adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An official oath of allegiance to the Canadian flag and all that 
it represents would be a wonderful gift now, at the dawn of a new 
millennium.  The 19th century gave us nationhood.  The 20th 
century gave us our flag.  In the 21st century, Canada should 
have an oath of allegiance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have asked me why an oath of allegiance is 
important.  We have a national anthem.  Why would we need 
anything more?  The answer is simple.  An oath would give us an 
opportunity wherever the flag is present to show our commitment 
to and appreciation for Canada and all that our flag represents. 
When we look at the maple leaf, we see Canada, but reciting an 
oath would encourage us to really think about what our flag and 
what our country stand for.  All the values that we as a country 
hold dear are embodied in the maple leaf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you well know, Madam Speaker, our flag is very highly 
respected around the world.  When people see a Canadian flag 
flying atop one of our embassies or sewn on a backpack, they 
immediately think of tolerance, diversity and peacekeeping. These 
are attributes we can and should all be proud of.  An oath would 
reaffirm our commitment to these values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have asked why we should pledge allegiance to a piece of 
cloth.  To that I say that our flag is much more than just a 
piece of cloth.  It represents not only our values but also our 
common history and our traditions.  The flag represents millions 
of people coming to Canada to build a better life for their 
families.  It represents two official languages working together. 
It represents democracy and freedom.  Of course, to many it 
represents Mounties, beavers and snow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that if someone looks at the flag and only sees the 
flag, they are missing the point.  This oath would help to make 
it clear that our flag means so much more to us as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people are concerned that an oath of allegiance to the flag 
of Canada is somehow too American.  I would like to point out 
that the United States is not the only country to have an oath of 
allegiance.  Besides, if our neighbour to the south has a good 
idea, why should we not steal it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians think that an oath of allegiance is a wonderful 
idea.  This bill has been endorsed by 500 municipalities across 
Canada and by Canadians from more than 700 different communities. 
The letters, e-mails and phone calls of support continue to 
arrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I received a letter from Les Peate, national secretary 
of the Korean Veterans Association of Canada.  Mr. Peate wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the time has come for us to stand up and be counted, and 
have an officially-approved standard “Pledge of Allegiance”, 
which need not be mandatory but should be available for schools, 
veterans' groups, service organizations and any other gatherings 
where we can still show pride in being Canadian. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with Mr. Peate.  I am not proposing a mandatory oath. 
Forcing patriotism tends to lead to dangerous consequences. 
However, I do feel strongly that Canadians should have an 
official oath as a means of showing their patriotism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Peate also tells a story about a fellow veteran who visited 
an American legion post.  After the American veterans recited 
their pledge of allegiance, the Canadians were invited to do the 
same.  Mr. Peate's colleagues were embarrassed to admit that we 
do not have an official oath.  This is an embarrassment that 
could easily be alleviated with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many veterans have written in support of Bill C-451.  Whether 
they fought to defend the values that our flag represents or 
served on peacekeeping missions to uphold those same values, an 
official oath of allegiance holds a special significance for 
them. They are not alone in believing that they need to pay 
tribute to our flag and all that it represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young Canadians have also shown a strong interest in this 
legislation.  Either through the encouragement of their teachers 
or on their own, I have received sample oaths from students 
across Canada.  Leanne Rutledge of Iron Bridge, Ontario 
suggested: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pledge my loyalty to my country as the greatest country in the 
world to me. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given Canada's number one ranking by the United Nations for 
quality of life six years running, an oath like this is 
especially relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jocelyn Smid, a student from Cochrane, Alberta wrote the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada and its people.  I will 
try to keep our country free, peaceful and beautiful.  I will 
obey the laws of the land and will protect our environment.  I 
will respect all of Canada's people, regardless of race, colour 
or religion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Canadians from all walks of life have provided 
suggestions for the oath of allegiance.  Howard Scrimgeour, a 
veterinarian in my riding of Guelph—Wellington, has proposed the 
oath currently taken by members of the Canadians forces. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to 
Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second, her heirs and 
successors, according to law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, different people have different ideas as to 
what the oath should say.  That is why I am proposing that the 
oath be drafted by a parliamentary committee in consultation with 
Canadians.  It is not only important that we have an official 
oath of allegiance, but that the oath is our oath.  It is 
extremely important that Canadians be able to identify with the 
oath and that the oath is a source of inspiration to all of us. 
What better way to ensure the oath's relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, as Canadians, have so very much to be proud of and even more 
to be thankful for:  freedom, equality, clean water and air, vast 
expanses, access to quality health care and education, all things 
that we may take for granted but that many people around the 
world are still fighting to achieve.  An official oath of 
allegiance to our flag would serve as a reminder that we are 
among the privileged few.  We fought to make Canada the best 
country in the world and we won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An oath of allegiance would also serve as a reminder of all that 
it took to get to where we are today.  It would give us time to 
reflect on the duties we all share as citizens of this great 
nation.  The swearing of an oath is done solemnly and 
respectfully.  It is not something done lightly and would 
encourage greater understanding of what it takes to ensure that 
Canada remains the best country in the world in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to what my hon. colleagues have to say about Bill 
C-451.  I want to thank them for taking part in this debate and 
sincerely hope that we can work together to make this bill a 
reality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I applaud the member for Guelph—Wellington on her 
private member's bill, Bill C-451, an act to establish an oath of 
allegiance to the flag of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by saying that I do support the bill.  As Canadians 
we are all proud to live in this great country, a place where 
everyone from around the globe wants to come. 
Our flag is a national symbol, as are our institutions. The very 
parliament buildings that we are in today rival any in the world. 
Canadians who visit Ottawa always return home feeling more 
patriotic than when they first came.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>National symbols are very important.  Our national flag is 
respected around the world.  As members of parliament, the lapel 
flag pins are in great demand by our constituents, especially to 
those Canadians who wish to travel abroad.  They come back with 
stories telling us that wherever they travel this little flag 
gives them an identity.  They are welcomed and very well treated 
when they are away from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our exercise of patriotism in my opinion has certainly declined 
over the years.  As a former school teacher for 26 years, I have 
seen many of these changes, certainly in the classroom.  The 
House sings O Canada once a week.  It is unfortunate that this 
practice has not been around very long.  It is also sad that 
Canadians do not take more pride in the singing of our national 
anthem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even more amazing that we do not begin each day in the 
House, the House that belongs to the people of Canada, by the 
singing of O Canada.  Yes, we in the House are the model for this 
country.  If we expect Canadians to be more expressive in their 
nationalism, we can certainly lead by example. If we do not wish 
to sing the anthem, perhaps we could invite Canadians from across 
the country to come here and sing our national anthem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are talking about an oath of allegiance to our flag.  I 
find it rather ironic that since I have been here we have had a 
debate about displaying flags in this very room which was voted 
down.  Again, this House is a model of behaviour for Canadians to 
follow.  I believe Canadians want to show allegiance to this 
country by both song and word.  That is why I support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that needs to be addressed is the desecration of 
our national flag.  At this time the criminal code does not 
protect our flag.  I know that the Canadian Legion is leading the 
charge to put more teeth into the law on the desecration of our 
national symbol, our flag.  Government officials at this time, 
however, state that such legislation would contravene the charter 
of rights and freedoms and, in particular, section 2 which 
guarantees freedom of expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research completed by the Library of Parliament indicates that 
the United States is the only country that has an oath of 
allegiance to the flag.  Although its oath is official in law, 
the United States supreme court ruled that the oath is voluntary 
only.  Countries like Japan, Germany, Italy, Russia, Great 
Britain and the European union do not have oaths of allegiance to 
the flag.  Many have other oaths of allegiance, such as the oath 
of citizenship.  In Canada, we also have such oaths for members 
of parliament upon taking office, privy councillors, senators and 
Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By definition, an oath of allegiance is a declaration of loyalty 
to a country that a citizen makes to safeguard the country's 
interest.  There is a bond, whether it be emotional, coercive or 
legal, that binds the subject to the nation's sovereignty.  Bill 
C-451 calls on the parliamentary committee to draft an oath to 
the flag of Canada.  Oaths are not pious statements of goodwill. 
They are legally binding commitments with punishment for failure 
to live up to them.  As a critic for the Canadian Alliance, I 
will support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, our flag is a symbol of our great country.  An oath 
of allegiance to the flag is just another way of showing our 
respect for our great country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-451 
introduced by the member for Guelph—Wellington proposes to 
establish an oath of allegiance to the Canadian flag.  The Bloc 
Quebecois opposes this bill.  I will explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not misunderstand me.  I am not questioning the relevance of 
national symbols.  All countries in the world have distinctive 
symbols, such as coats of arms, an emblem in the form of a 
flower or an animal.  The flag has always been an important 
symbol flown proudly by the various countries of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the flag of a nation is part of all official 
ceremonies, is flown from the flagstaffs of institutions, 
accompanies delegations and identifies the nationality of 
whomever is flying it.  Indeed, a country's flag is a powerful 
symbol identifying the country, reflecting its values and 
affirming its culture, and I have a profound respect for the flag 
of all nations since each flag is being borne by a people. This 
is true of the Quebec flag and of the Canadian flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing and respecting a national flag is one thing.  Making 
it the object of patriotic devotion is another. 
Yet, this is unfortunately what the hon. member for 
Guelph—Wellington seeks to do with her bill, which begins by 
saying that it is desirable to establish an oath of allegiance 
that would allow Canadian citizens to display their patriotism, 
and continues by saying that an oath of allegiance to the flag 
of Canada would recognize the importance of our flag in our 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not right. No one has yet demonstrated the desirability 
of an oath of allegiance that would allow Canadian citizens to 
display their patriotism, and I am not talking about Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Patriotism is love for one's country and devotion to it. 
Patriotism is not about taking an oath. My motherland, which I 
love and for which I work hard, is Quebec. I work for it in a 
totally legitimate, legal and respectful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Guelph—Wellington also contends that an oath of 
allegiance would recognize the importance of the Canadian flag 
in our lives. That seems to me to be not only exaggerated, but 
also completely foreign to Quebecers' feelings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To respect the flag of a nation is one thing, but it is totally 
inappropriate to say that the Canadian flag deserves to be 
recognized in our daily lives through an oath. Indeed, in the 
daily lives of ordinary people, what is important is not to 
adore a flag, regardless of which one it is, but to earn a 
living, raise children, fulfil ambitions and look after one's 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this House and its members have more 
pressing things to do than to spend time, energy and money to 
draft an oath of allegiance to the flag of Canada and to 
encourage and promote the taking of such an oath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes right down to it, what purpose would this oath of 
allegiance serve?  When would it be used?  Who would be 
authorized or encouraged to take it?  And what exactly is the 
meaning of clause 5 of the bill, which reads “The Minister shall 
encourage and promote the giving of the oath”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see how, for too many years, the federal government has 
used Canada's flag and Canada Day for its own propaganda agenda, 
at a cost of tens of millions of dollars, in an attempt to 
destroy the identity of the Quebec people, I have the very 
strong feeling that, if ever this bill were to be passed, it 
too, unfortunately, would be used for the same base propaganda 
purposes in order to wipe out our identity as Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I know, Canada is not handicapped by the lack of an 
oath of allegiance to the flag.  Many countries in the world do 
not have such an oath and they are none the worse off.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>France is a good example.  The absence of an oath of allegiance 
to the flag of France has never prevented the French, through 
numerous trying events, from demonstrating their vibrant 
patriotism when circumstances required it.  The Americans, for 
their part, have chosen to have such an oath.  That is their 
choice and it goes along with their mentality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we are neither the French nor the Americans.  We are 
Canadians and Quebecers, and that is that.  Although we share 
some values, there are others that set us apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A flag is the symbol of a nation's values. 
The bill of the member for Guelph—Wellington recognizes this by 
providing that a committee be struck to ensure that the wording 
of the oath of allegiance contains a statement of the principal 
values symbolized by the flag of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are these values?  Is it true that all Canadian and Quebec 
citizens share exactly the same values and accord them exactly 
the same importance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it is true that the people of British Columbia share the 
same values as the people of Newfoundland.  Perhaps.  But 
Quebecers attach far greater importance to community values, 
whereas the people in western Canada attach greater importance 
to values of individualism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally irreconcilable, as we can see in the handling of 
the Young Offenders Act, a bill everyone in Quebec opposes, and 
the Minister of Justice of Canada does not seem to care a whit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in the House of Commons, we in the Bloc Quebecois respect 
the great democratic value of 50% plus one, whereas it means 
nothing to the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is not appearing in isolation at this point.  In fact, 
just last week, the Conservative government of Ontario announced 
that the national anthem of Canada and the oath of citizenship 
would be part of the daily routine of Ontario school children. 
The totalitarian regimes of the 20th century could not do 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, asking children in this the beginning of the 21st 
century to swear their loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II seems 
totally anachronistic to me.  And to say that all this commotion 
serves to ensure better security—that is right, security—in the 
schools of Ontario.  The outcry this announcement raised last 
week was not surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill of the member for Guelph—Wellington is cut from the same 
cloth.  It is a bill that, in the guise of patriotic virtue, 
attempts to force people to express their belief in moral values 
to be decided by a committee.  This has nothing to do with 
patriotism, not even with the freedoms of thought and expression 
guaranteed by the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Quebecer, I cannot swear allegiance when the values and 
patriotism expressed are not part of my own convictions, which I 
share with my fellow citizens of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have this freedom, we have the freedom to think as Quebecers 
and to act as Quebecers.  This freedom can never be denied us by 
law.  The Bloc Quebecois opposes this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The hon. member for

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to participate in the debate over the possible 
establishment of an oath of allegiance to the flag of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate my hon. colleague from Guelph—Wellington for 
having introduced this private member's bill.   It is a credit to 
her that she has persisted in her attempts to instil a greater 
sense of patriotism within this country by drawing attention to 
the significance of the Canadian flag and the symbolism it 
represents. 
I do not think enough Canadians, or at least enough young 
Canadians, recognize or appreciate the significance of the 
Canadian flag.  It has been stated repeatedly through a number of 
studies that Canadians do not know enough about their own 
history.  We must ask ourselves why this is the case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance we immediately point the finger at our 
educational system.  Our education system is not focusing enough 
attention on teaching our young people about their own history. 
As a result they fail to develop proper appreciation for the 
struggles of their ancestors. Our education system must certainly 
bear some of the responsibility.  However I think the problem 
goes much further than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For whatever reason, we Canadians do not believe in beating our 
own drum.  Unlike our neighbours to the south who never miss an 
opportunity for self-promotion, we Canadians are much more 
reserved in displaying our own patriotism. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, most Canadians might find it easier to identify great 
names in American history than our very own Canadian heroes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, we do have a number of heroes in Canada. Our Canadian 
history is full of great people who gave a part of lives to 
build the best country in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a proud history of very distinguished Canadians whose 
exploits not only helped change the face of this country but also 
had a positive influence on the history of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could begin with our fathers of confederation who shared a 
vision for a strong and united country, a country that could 
compete not only with our southern neighbours but also with the 
rest of the world.  Their legacy continues today as Canadians 
take on a leading role in developing new partnerships with other 
foreign countries which ultimately help strengthen our 
competitive edge here at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are perhaps no other events in our history that help 
define us as a country than our participation in the first world 
war.  Canada came of age as the exploits of our brave soldiers 
drew the respect, admiration and appreciation of all peoples 
throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our victory at Vimy Ridge to this day continues to instil pride 
in all Canadians. Against unbelievable odds, our brave Canadian 
soldiers confronted the forces of evil in a battle that would 
forever change the course of the first world war. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many of our young people know nothing about the exploits of 
our Canadian soldiers during the first and the second world 
wars. I believe the federal government is to be blamed for such 
ignorance. It is a pity our veterans are only recognized once a 
year on Remembrance Day. Thanks to their suffering, today we can 
enjoy this symbol of our freedom, our very own Canadian flag 
which freely flaps in the wind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only 35 years ago that our government adopted the 
Canadian flag as we know it today. It is here, in the city of 
Ottawa, in 1965, that the maple leaf was seen flying atop the 
parliament buildings for the first time. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Canadian flag is a symbol of a strong and compassionate 
society.  It represents the struggle of millions of Canadians 
throughout our history who have devoted their lives toward making 
this a better country.  It is more than just a flag; it is a 
reflection of who we are and what we stand for as a people and as 
a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian flag is one of the most recognized and appreciated 
symbols in the world.  Our citizens can go anywhere throughout 
the world wearing the Canadian insignia and be recognized and 
greeted warmly by their hosts.  We can do that because we have 
distinguished ourselves throughout the world as a peaceful and 
humane society. People throughout the world recognize Canada's 
flag as a symbol of a kind and gentle society where human rights 
are respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important that as a country we begin focusing 
greater attention on recognizing the many achievements of our 
great Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year from May 19 to June 19 the Dominion Institute and the 
Council for Canadian Unity conducted a survey asking Canadians to 
identify our top Canadian heroes.  Among those selected were our 
fathers of confederation; our first prime minister, Sir John A. 
Macdonald; the architect of Canadian medicare, Mr. Tommy Douglas; 
World War I flying ace Mr. Billy Bishop; Laura Secord, who was 
credited with saving the British and Canadian forces at the 
battle of Beaver Dams during the war of 1812; and Nellie McClung, 
one of the famous five women who fought to have women recognized 
as persons under the law.

influenced the growth of our great nation.  The list goes on:  Sir 
Frederick Banting, Dr. Norman Bethune, Lester B. Pearson, 
Tecumseh, Alexander Graham Bell and many others.  The point I am 
trying to make is that our flag represents the tremendous 
accomplishments of all those Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Swearing allegiance to the Canadian flag is more than simply a 
case of symbolism; it is a patriotic gesture in recognition of a 
great country and of the great Canadians who have had the courage 
to stand for what they believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somewhere along the line we Canadians have lost the sense of 
patriotism.  I think it is time we worked together to bring it 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember as a young student standing at attention every 
morning at my desk to sing the national anthem.  Today when I 
have the opportunity to sing the national anthem in the House of 
Commons it reminds me of those days as a little boy in class and 
the same patriotism flows through me.  We are missing that and it 
should be brought back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attempt by the member for Guelph—Wellington to instil a 
sense of patriotism in all Canadians should be commended. 
Supporting an act to establish an oath of allegiance to the flag 
of Canada will go a long way toward promoting Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, it is important that Canadians have an 
opportunity to voice their opinions as to the proper wording of 
this oath so that the oath itself is representative of all 
Canadians from coast to coast. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to stand in reply to my bill.  I want 
to thank the hon. member from the Reform Party for agreeing and 
for wanting this bill also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that symbols are important.  I agree.  I want to point 
out to the hon. member that we do display flags in this Chamber, 
because he mentioned in his speech that we do not.  There are two 
large Canadian flags right beside the Speaker's chair.  I think 
it is important to point that out.  In the seven years I have 
been here the flags have always been displayed in this honourable 
room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, members of the Bloc are against this bill.  I am 
not surprised, but I am sorry that is the way they feel.  The 
Bloc member who spoke stated that the flag is a powerful symbol 
and that he has profound respect for it, but he does not see it 
as necessary.  He felt that this perhaps would be propaganda 
against Quebec.  That is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the hon. member that Quebec is a province of 
Canada. Quebecers are proud Canadians.  I have had a number of 
them write to me on the flag issue.  A number of councils in the 
province of Quebec have written to me to say that they endorse 
this bill.  It is very important that we as Canadians be able to 
stand and be proud of who we are.  Quebecers certainly are proud 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked what we would do with such an oath.  I am proposing 
that it would not be mandatory, but that at places like scout 
meetings, Rotarian meetings, or wherever a flag would be present, 
there would be the opportunity to say an official oath.

bill.  He talked about the significance of the flag for 
patriotism.  He talked about our heroes, who we are as a country, 
our vision of a strong and united country.  Our flag is 
recognized all over the world.  We are looked at as a kind and 
gentle society, peaceful and caring.  These are all things that 
the Conservative member recognizes.  He also said that we should 
work together to bring patriotism back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any time that we as Canadians can show our love for our country 
it is very important to do so.  I think the reason that some 
things have gone off track in Quebec is because that has not been 
allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Mulroney ordered that the Canadian flag be taken down on 
federal buildings in the province of Quebec to appease some 
Quebecers.  He thought that would be a good thing.  This federal 
Liberal government decided that it would not be a good thing.  We 
ordered all those Canadians flags to be put back up on those 
federal buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we know in our heart of hearts that it is important to 
know who we are as a nation, what we stand for, what we care 
about and the pride that we feel from coast to coast to coast.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, in January a damning internal audit of the 
Department of Human Resources Development was released.  Despite 
the best efforts by the government to play down the issues, the 
concerns over misuse of funds surrounding the department continue 
to multiply daily, with related RCMP investigations and further 
audits revealing some of the government's deepest and darkest 
secrets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since December of last year I have been trying to get 
information on a company in my riding which applied for further 
TJF funding just months before it went into receivership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This company, Scotia Rainbow, has received almost $20 million in 
public loans and grants, yet the government has been incapable of 
answering questions about the financial position of the company 
and the proof for how many jobs Scotia Rainbow actually created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the amount of public and private funding it received this 
company should have created many more jobs than it did, but why 
is there no proof being offered to Canadian taxpayers as to how 
many jobs were actually created with their money?  There is no 
doubt in my mind that most Canadians share our opinion in the New 
Democratic Party that good job creation initiatives are an 
essential part of government operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does Scotia Rainbow represent a good return in the number of 
jobs proportionate to how much funding it received?  Is Scotia 
Rainbow just another one of the government's deep, dark secrets? 
Why is it at a time when there appears to be no money for our 
health care system that is in crisis, no money to reduce the debt 
load for students, that money can be still found to finance a 
company to the tune of $20 million in an approximate 18 month 
period which is now in receivership?  We may never be repaid.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the government explain why neither it nor the company have 
any financial documents to back up their claims for the number of 
jobs created at Scotia Rainbow?  If the government has the 
documentation, why will it not show it to Canadian taxpayers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member 
opposite is throwing numbers around, which is leaving an 
inaccurate impression in the minds of those who are listening to 
or who will later read this debate.  The $20 million she referred 
to is the sum total of all the investment in this project.  It is 
investment that came from this government, from the provincial 
government, from private investors and from a chartered bank. 
Our share was by far a minority share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I must say that our priority is to help 
Canadians get back to work.  That is why we supported the 
creation of about 291 jobs in an area with a 20% unemployment 
rate.  We did that along with the Government of Nova Scotia. 
This was a good use of taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously it is very unfortunate that the company ran into 
financial difficulties and had to declare bankruptcy, despite 
nearly everyone's best efforts and best will.  One has to ask why 
this company ended up going bankrupt when it was off to such a 
good start.  Is it perhaps because the member opposite has spoken 
so negatively about this project on many occasions in this House 
that some investor pulled his investment, or is it because a bank 
closed down a line of credit?  Could that be it?  Surely not.  Or, 
could it be that the member spoke negatively about this project 
because the ideology of her party is against aquaculture which 
this project represented?  I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do know what the local paper said about it.  On February 22 
the Port Hawkesbury <I>Reporter</I> observed:  “When our elected 
representative—”, that being the member opposite, “—openly 
condemns federal aid in this area, then it is time to ask that 
representative to step down.  The families of those former 
fishermen are just as important as the families of miners.  They 
do not deserve to have their representative trying to jeopardize 
their employment”.   Their representative was successful in that 
attempt because that company is closed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is crucial on many levels that Canada's forces reflect the ethnic 
diversity that makes up our country.  That is why I am 
disheartened by the response of the Minister of National Defence 
to my question on April 13, which I asked in the House.  I 
pointed out to the minister at that time that there were too few 
visible minorities and aboriginals in the senior ranks of 
Canada's land forces and regular navy to even register as a blip 
on the radar screen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as bad are the targets, with a visible minority target of 
less than 10% for army and regular forces and less than 5% for 
aboriginals in the same category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister to commit to targets and dates to increase 
representation in all senior ranks, including using fast-tracking 
where appropriate and committing to fostering an environment 
promoting diversity, as recommended by his own advisory board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responded with vague motherhood generalities about 
ensuring that people from all parts of Canada can participate in 
the forces.  The minister said that his own advisory board on 
this issue has made worthwhile recommendations.  Which 
recommendations does he see as worthwhile?  Which ones will he 
implement and in what timeframe? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada deserve specific and concrete details and 
not just vague generalizations.  As a Canadian of colour I have 
heard good words all too often and seen good action all too 
seldom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March of this year the minister's own advisory board on 
Canadian Forces Gender Integration and Employment Equity 
submitted its report to the minister.  Women and aboriginals were 
determined to be less than half of their minimum potential 
representation in the forces and visible minorities were at less 
than one-quarter of the minimum potential.  That is appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that targets have been set to increase the 
representation of visible minorities from 2% to 7% of the total 
army over 10 years.  Why only 7%, and what specifically is being 
done to meet this target? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians of colour are so scarce at the officer and 
non-commissioned member level to not even register in the 
advisory board's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this Liberal government expect to increase 
representation of visible minorities and aboriginal Canadians 
when role models from their communities are so scarce? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's advisory board heard comments expressed by land 
forces personnel, such as:  “We are not doing aboriginals and 
visible minorities a favour by allowing them to look so different 
by wearing turbans or braids.  How can they possibly integrate 
when they stick out like a sore thumb?”  A sore thumb indeed. 
How does the government seriously expect to foster diversity with 
an attitude like that?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's advisory board noted the need to increase 
representation in the senior ranks of women, aboriginals and 
visible minorities.  What is the minister's position on fast 
tracking qualified individuals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the changes that occur only at the top tend to be 
short-lived.  It is essential that the Liberal government learn 
that change must be throughout the ranks.  Superficial treatment 
of this crisis will breed superficial results.  Women, visible 
minorities and aboriginals deserve to know the government's plan 
in detail.  We deserve to know that there is a comprehensive plan 
and to be able to see this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendations were also made in a similar vein to the same 
minister last year arising out of the Canadian forces debacle in 
Somalia.  The Minister of National Defence agreed in 1999 to 
establish regular liaison with anti-racist groups to “obtain 
assistance in the conduct of appropriate cultural sensitivity 
training and to assist supervisors and commanders in identifying 
signs of racism and involvement with hate groups”.  Has this 
happened and if so, who was consulted and what were the results 
of these liaisons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the Canadian Human Rights Commission gave the Canadian 
forces a failing grade for its efforts to reflect Canada's 
cultural makeup.  So far the pupil does not seem to be doing much 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust the government will respond to my comments with a 
specific plan including dates, targets and measures to be taken 
at all levels within the forces.  Anything less would be an 
insult. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the Canadian forces 
is an important national institution that does far more than 
defend Canada's territorial integrity.  It also defends and 
reflects the values and principles that we as Canadians believe 
are important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Achieving diversity in a large organization like the CF is a 
complex task but it is one that the minister and his department 
are committed to doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces must reflect the mosaic that is Canada. That 
is why the Canadian forces is actively recruiting aboriginal 
people and other visible minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military is also fully complying with the federal 
government's employment equity legislation.  Through a formal 
plan authorized by the chief of defence staff, CDS, the Canadian 
forces is actively identifying possible barriers to advancement 
that visible minorities and aboriginal people sometimes face. 
However, promotions are based on merit and will continue to be 
based on merit.  Unlike civilian organizations, the Canadian 
forces cannot simply recruit people into senior positions.  Its 
leaders must be grown within the organization and this takes 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military has taken many steps to address barriers to 
aboriginal people and other visible minorities including measures 
to accommodate religious and cultural differences that permit for 
example aboriginal people to wear braids; the integration of 
diversity training at all levels of core CF leadership training; 
where possible, the identification of qualified aboriginal and 
visible minority Canadian forces members to serve as course 
instructors; and the establishment of community contacts to 
support the cultural needs of Canadian forces members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a diverse society and the Canadian forces must reflect 
the society it serves.  Diversity within the Canadian forces is 
something that we truly value.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT

<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on February 18, I asked a question to the 
Minister of Human Resources Development regarding the scandal at 
Human Resources Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question—this is rather paradoxical today—was about the fact 
that the minister kept hiding behind her six point action plan. 
On February 18, we did not know that a professional opinion 
provided by a well known firm of chartered accountants, Deloitte 
& Touche, said that the six point plan is a good approach to 
settle short term issues, but it does not in any way respond to 
the in depth problems at Human Resources Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, we learned that the Deloitte & Touche report 
strongly criticized the government. We did not find, in the six 
point plan, adjustments that reflect these observations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department's website tells us that advice was received from 
the Treasury Board on the six point plan and that the 
recommendations were followed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government received the recommendations of the auditor 
general on the immediate changes required to the plan and 
followed them, but in the case of Deloitte & Touche, whose 
recommendations were that the plan would not resolve the 
substantial problems, the government does not indicate that it 
has followed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore looking at a situation where the question I 
asked on April 18 is even more relevant today. 
Faced with this situation, we can only wonder why HRDC continues 
to defend this six point plan, why it refuses that an 
independent public inquiry be held and why it does not make the 
connection between the deplorable situation, the lax approach 
and the scandal at HRDC and the use of public funds for partisan 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is there a major administrative problem but, if we look 
at the three years of the transitional job fund, during the 1997 
electoral period, 54% of the money available during this period 
was spent in Quebec, and in ridings represented by Bloc 
Quebecois members the figure even rose to 63%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These important clues are telling us that the program was used 
for the Liberal Party of Canada's own benefit instead of helping 
citizens in Quebec and Canada who should be able to avail 
themselves of these programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite sad because job creation programs per se are a good 
thing. The Bloc has always maintained that the government should 
use this money to level out discrepancies between areas with a 
low unemployment rate and the others. But the current behaviour 
of the government has harmed the operation of these programs to 
such a degree that they are now discredited and that their 
opponents are gathering support. In my view, this is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current government is to be blamed entirely for this sad 
state of affairs. It is the Prime Minister who masterminded this 
system whereby public money is used for partisan purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Human Resources Development why, three months after the HRDC 
scandal came to light, corrective measures are yet to be taken 
to remedy the situation and cure the cancer that is destroying 
HRDC. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I must say 
that if the member opposite questions why we are still talking 
about it, we are still talking about it because the opposition 
members seem to be obsessed with it.  That is why we are still 
talking about it.  In addition to their wanting to talk about it, 
their motivation is probably because the newspapers are covering 
what they are saying about it.  That is why we are still talking 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One journalist in particular has talked about the trivialization 
of the House of Commons with the persistence in talking about 
this single subject which the member insists on calling a 
scandal. Is it a scandal when in one of our programs we had 
10,000 projects which probably interacted with about 100,000 
people when we consider the boards of directors and other 
investors?  In that particular project a year after the start-up 
of these businesses, 95% of them were still going ahead.  That is 
a better rate than a bank.  When a bank comes in with capital for 
a new business or an expansion, its success rate one year later 
is usually that only 77% of its projects are still alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not call it a scandal when the Government of Canada 
sponsors projects that have a better success rate than those 
sponsored by a bank.  I think that is a darn good record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the Deloitte & Touche comment on the minister's six 
point plan to fix the problems at HRDC, one has to think about 
the order in which things happened.  Officials of the department 
developed a plan and they presented it to Deloitte & Touche. 
Deloitte & Touche was hired to comment on the first draft of the 
plan, as was the auditor general.  All the various players made 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deloitte & Touche has not seen the revised plan because it was 
not hired to come back and comment on it.  The hon. member is 
quoting from the first set of comments and neither he nor 
Deloitte & Touche really know whether in fact those suggestions 
were incorporated or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order, please. I must
