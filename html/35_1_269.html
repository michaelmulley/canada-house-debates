<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the motion carried.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CONSIDERATIONOFSECONDREADING">CONSIDERATION OF SECOND READING</A></H4>
	The House resumed from November 30 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-110, an act respecting constitutional 
amendments, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
country is what citizens make it. Therefore we can take collective 
pride that Canada has been deemed by the United Nations as the 
number one country in the world in which to live.
<P>
	Today we are challenged once more to reaffirm our faith in our 
country. We are asked to reaffirm our trust in each other. We are 
called to creative leadership. Either we are for Canada or we are 
not.
<P>
	It is with great pride that I rise today during this historic debate 
to offer my full support of the unity package unveiled by the 
government and now before the House.
<P>
	A key component of this package is Bill C-110, an act respecting 
constitutional amendments. The bill commits the Government of 
Canada to obtain the approval of all four regions of the country, 
namely, the western region comprising Manitoba, Saskatchewan, 
Alberta and British Columbia, the Atlantic region comprising Nova 
Scotia, Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, 
and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec as two separate regions.
<P>
	Ottawa commits itself, before constitutional amendments can be 
proposed to Parliament, to first obtain the consent of at least six 
provinces, namely, Quebec, Ontario and two provinces from the 
Atlantic region representing more than 50 per cent of the region's 
population and two provinces from the western region representing 
more than 50 per cent of the west's population.
<P>
	When Bill C-110 becomes law, the federal government could not 
proceed to table a constitutional amendment if any one of the four 
regions refused to give its consent, even if seven provinces 
representing 50 per cent of Canada's population pass resolutions in 
favour of such a constitutional amendment.
<P>
	Although the present bill does not amend the Canadian 
Constitution which stipulates four legal amending processes as 
provided for in sections 38 to 44 of part V, it is as an act of the 
federal Parliament binding on current and succeeding 
governments.
<P>
	The western region makes up nearly 30 per cent of Canada's 
population, larger than Quebec's and smaller than Ontario's. 
Taking into account the population of each of the four western 
provinces, the bill affects the western region in this fashion: first, 
Alberta would require either British Columbia or a combination of 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba to exercise the veto; second,  Manito-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17077"> 17077 </A></B>
<P>
ba and Saskatchewan would require British Columbia or each other 
and Alberta to exercise the veto; third, British Columbia would 
require only one other western province to exercise its right to say 
no.
<P>
	The regional veto envisioned in this bill gives greater strength to 
each of the western provinces than can be obtained under the 
existing amending formula.
<P>
	It is a significant step forward. It illustrates the flexibility of 
federalism to which the government is committed. It is this sort of 
political creativity and ingenuity that should summon in us a sense 
of pride in our Canadian citizenship, which should be a forum for 
transcending differences and considering the common good of all.
<P>
	Most Canadians became citizens by birth. For me, becoming 
Canadian was a conscious choice, a choice informed by a strong 
commitment to the values, goals and vision Canada has for herself 
in the world community.
<P>
	In January 1968 I braved my first Canadian winter in Winnipeg 
as a new immigrant. Coming from the tropical climes of the 
Philippines, the country of my birth, the cold winds and bitter frost 
of the North American prairie seemed particularly harsh. But the 
chill of the winter was quickly offset by the warmth of the welcome 
I received from the people of Manitoba. Winnipeg was my 
Canadian city of entry, a friendly place where I felt at home 
instantly. But Canada is the country I adopted.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	My four sons were born on Canadian soil. Many of my dreams 
for my family and my career have been realized in Canada. My 
future goals, if they are achieved, will be achieved in this country.
<P>
	This is a country which accommodates the dreams of individuals 
from all cultures, from all walks of life. This is a country that 
promotes and supports a fully integrated citizenship which takes 
these differences into account.
<P>
	My constituency of Winnipeg North is a microcosm of Canada. 
People of aboriginal ancestry and people of Ukrainian, Jewish, 
Polish, Indian, Portuguese and Filipino origins, along with 
anglophone and francophones and many others, have made 
Winnipeg North their home. They are proud of their heritage and 
they are proud of their Canadian citizenship. These define our 
shared identity.
<P>
	Beyond our shared identity, beyond our diversity there is a 
stronger force that socially binds us. It is a set of shared political 
values. Canadians share a belief in equality and fairness. They 
believe in consultation and dialogue. They share in the importance 
of accommodation and tolerance. They share compassion, 
generosity and an attachment to the natural environment. Together 
they support diversity. As a people we share a commitment to 
freedom, peace and non-violent change.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast to coast told us four years ago that 
we share these seven values. It is certainly true that we in different 
regions, provinces, cities, communities and households may feel 
like a minority with different priorities and goals. Sometimes those 
differences can make us feel alienated from the majority.
<P>
	I know that feeling. As a Filipino Canadian, I know that being a 
member of a visible minority makes me sometimes feel like an 
outsider. Occasionally I feel a sense of aloneness. But those feeling 
pass whenever one stops to consider the policies which inform the 
real discourse of this country.
<P>
	Nearly a quarter of a century ago in this House, then Prime 
Minister Trudeau introduced a ground breaking policy which 
formalized the very values of which I spoke earlier. One of the 
chief aims of that policy was to enhance every Canadian's sense of 
belonging, in the process fostering the ties that bind us all together.
<P>
	The policy has showcased, in a very real sense, the creativity, the 
ingenuity of the Canadian people. It sent a clear message to me as a 
Canadian of Filipino origin that I was as welcome in Canada as 
anyone else. It confirmed my initial impressions of Canada formed 
that first winter a few years earlier. It made me understand that, 
yes, I am different from some, but I am equal to all.
<P>
	The bill before us today is the fulfilment of a promise, part of the 
promise that includes recognizing Quebec as a distinct society 
within Canada. We all know and have known since Confederation 
that Quebec is a distinct society within Canada, a distinctiveness 
defined by her unique culture, French speaking majority and civil 
law tradition.
<P>
	As I mentioned before, differences can lead one to a sense of 
alienation. With this motion introduced by the Prime Minister, 
Canadians are sending the clear message to Quebecers that we not 
only respect the differences in their traditions, history, language 
and culture, we celebrate and value them. They make Canada 
whole.
<P>
	We are reawakened to the spirit of partnership and collaboration 
which brought us together more than a century and a quarter ago. 
We want Quebecers to know that by working together, we can 
develop a national vision to confront with resolute confidence the 
challenges of today and tomorrow just as we triumphed when we 
faced the challenges of the past.
<P>
	Our historical achievements in building this nation rightly give 
us a sense of national pride.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	Our shared identity, our shared values, our collective sense of 
pride in the midst of our deep diversity, are the tools that shall 
preserve Canada as a nation, that shall propel us to prosperity. 
These are the tools that will translate our hope into reality.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17078"> 17078 </A></B>
<P>
	The challenge before us today is whether we have the will to 
accommodate, the will to make sacrifices for our common national 
good, the goodwill to see us build on the partnership of the past 
128 years. We cannot allow history to judge us harshly. We cannot 
allow the moment for national unity to pass. I therefore ask all 
colleagues to shed political partisanship for Canadian partnership. 
Long live Canada. Vive le Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wonder if rather than begin a speech, then break 
it up in the middle-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-we might perhaps proceed directly to members' statements. I 
think that is what we shall do.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WORLDAIDSDAY">WORLD AIDS DAY</A></H3>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
number one cause of death in men aged 19 to 44 in the major 
metropolitan areas of Canada is AIDS.
<P>
	Today is World AIDS Day. The World Health Organization's 
theme this year is shared rights and responsibilities. This theme 
highlights the need for equality and solidarity in global responses 
to AIDS. Its message is clear. Everyone has the right to 
information, preventive skills and tools, to avoid infection. 
Everyone has the right to access to appropriate care free from the 
burden of discrimination.
<P>
	The World Health Organization message balances these rights 
with the responsibility of the individual to protect self and others 
from infection, the responsibilities of families and communities to 
educate the public about HIV prevention and to care for those 
infected with AIDS.
<P>
	Themes are usually rhetoric unless followed by action. Let us in 
the House commit ourselves to actively ensure those rights and 
responsibilities become reality. AIDS creates too much tragic 
waste of human life and potential to do otherwise.

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday in the House the Minister of Indian Affairs was 
unable to reply to questions concerning certain highly paternalistic 
and disdainful comments about aboriginal people made by his 
ADM. His reason: the memorandum in question was not addressed 
to the minister himself. What a lame excuse.
<P>
	The contents of this memo were released by the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. 
In addition to expressing doubts about the  professionalism of the 
reporters on this respected daily newspaper, and to describing his 
ADM's comments as ``pretty silly'', the minister has insulted the 
intelligence of the members of this House and of his constituents 
by refusing to answer questions on his departmental policy for 
ridiculous reasons.
<P>
	It does not matter to whom the memo was addressed; he was at 
the very least clearly remiss in his duties.

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, violent home invasions 
are becoming a serious problem in Canada. The Liberals say that 
they want a safer society, but by protecting criminals from decent 
citizens they make life more dangerous for us all.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has on various occasions stated that it is 
somehow un-Canadian to possess firearms for home protection. 
That is easy to say when one is protected by armed guards. 
However a few weeks ago when the system broke down, the Prime 
Minister discovered that even the mighty are vulnerable.
<P>
	I have this vision of the Prime Minister shivering in his 
nightshirt, clutching his soapstone carving. I wonder if as the long 
minutes dragged by he would not have felt more comfortable if he 
had been holding a .38.

	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to draw attention on this first day of December to World 
AIDS Day. This day brings to mind the significant numbers of 
individuals affected by this disease, one for which to this day there 
is still no cure. In North America it is a dramatic fact that AIDS is 
the top ranking cause of death for people between the ages of 25 
and 44.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Health Canada reports that last year alone almost 3,000 
Canadians were reported as having contracted the AIDS virus. That 
is about eight Canadians per day. It is indeed a shocking amount, 
but what is more shocking is that we are not doing enough to find a 
cure.
<P>
	The federal government must strengthen its national AIDS 
strategy and do more to help researchers across the country who are 
working to develop an AIDS vaccine,  researchers like Dr. Christos 
<P>

	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka, as well as in 
many other areas of the country, constituents depend on tourism. 
The weather this week has reminded us that tourism is not just a 
summer business but a year round business.
<P>
	Tourism is a very important industry in the country. It 
contributes about $26 billion to our gross domestic product. It is 
estimated that every new $1 million of tourism expenditure results 
in 39 person years of employment. In my riding almost one of 
every two jobs is dependent on this industry.
<P>
	When it snows, and has it ever snowed, the small businessmen 
and women in my riding look forward to a good winter season. We 
have some of the best trail systems in Canada. We attract those who 
cross-country ski, snowshoe or snowmobile.
<P>
	If November's record snowfall is any indication, it will be a 
great season for all winter activities. I invite all Canadians to share 
in the experience of the great Canadian winter in my riding and 
across the country.

	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Wednesday the people of Ontario finally learned that Mike Harris 
and his Conservative government do not know the meaning of the 
words common sense.
<P>
	Ontarians will now have to wait longer for hospital services, if 
they can find an open hospital; pay up to 22 per cent more for a 
university education; and learn to live with fewer locally provided 
services.
<P>
	The Waterloo region, which takes in my riding of Cambridge, 
will be faced with $9 million in hospital cuts. Those cuts will mean 
a reduction and possible elimination of services from three 
hospitals in the area.
<P>
	The area will also see a cut of approximately $10 million to 
schools. Libraries in Cambridge will lose $120,000 and transit 
fares will go up.
<P>
	While all Ontarians want to get their fiscal house in order, why is 
it that the sick, the elderly and children trying to get an education 
will be most hurt by the cuts? The premier's friends who have been 
promised a 30 per cent tax break will not.

permitting free votes without fear of reprisal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The hon. member for Malpeque seems to have forgotten what he 
did prior to being elected to the House. Let me think. Could it be 
the president of the National Farmers Union?
<P>
	It appears as though there has been a change of mind for the hon. 
member for Malpeque since arriving in Ottawa. Instead of 
representing the wishes of his constituents, the member has 
decided to become a traditional politician, toe the Liberal Party line 
and become part of the Prime Minister's ``Yes, whatever you say''

	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is World 
AIDS Day. Sadly thousands of Canadians are all too personally 
familiar with the tragedy of AIDS and HIV.
<P>
	The human cost of AIDS is immeasurable. Each day our 
communities lose valuable and talented members to this disease. 
Right now AIDS is one of the primary causes of premature death of 
Canadian men. We must devote greater resources to its control and 
elimination.
<P>
	AIDS has preyed particularly severely on Canada's artistic 
community and this impoverishes every Canadian. Museums, 
galleries and art shops across the country will be closed today in 
commemoration of a day without art to honour artists lost to AIDS.

	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso,

funeral of John Angus Rankin to say goodbye to this beloved parish 
priest and fiddler.
<P>
	Born in Inverness, Reverend Rankin was ordained to the 
priesthood in 1946. In 1959 he became pastor of Saint Mary of the 
Angels Parish in Glendale and Holy Trinity Mission in Waycobah, 
where he stayed until his retirement in 1994.
<P>
	During these years Reverend Rankin sparked a renaissance in 
Cape Breton fiddling and helped revive the Gaelic language. He 
combined an ear for fiddling with a genuine love for people, in 
particular the Micmac community of Cape Breton among whom he 
finally chose to lay at rest.

Canadians.
<P>
	More than 500 veterans and Kent's Dutch community paid 
tribute to the Canadian soldiers who fought and died to liberate 
Holland 50 years ago.
<P>
	We can never take our freedom for granted. It is important that 
future generations realize how fortunate we are in Canada. Our 
soldiers gave their lives, the supreme sacrifice, so each of us could 
speak and live freely.
<P>
	Thanks to the efforts of the Dutch in my riding who raised 
$12,000 to build the memorial, we have a permanent reminder of 
our soldiers' struggles. They did not die for a region or a province; 
they fought for Canada.

	Canadians from coast to coast are calling for the government to 
deal with the issues that are truly important. At the top of the list in 
every region of the country are balanced budgets and tax relief.
<P>
	The provincial governments are answering the call. Nine have 
balanced their budgets or plan to do so. A number have developed 
debt repayment schedules just as Canadian families would pay off a 
mortgage. By doing so these governments are also putting 
themselves in a position to offer tax relief in the near future.
<P>
	The message is clear. Canadians are now holding their elected 
officials to higher fiscal standards than ever before and the litmus 
test they are applying is a balanced budget plan. It is telling that 
there are only two governments in all Canada which fail this test: 
the separatist government in Quebec and the Liberal government in 
Ottawa.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
is World AIDS Day. As part of the national strategy, the national 
health research and development program budgets some $5.5 
million to researchers working outside Health Canada. The 
Medical Research Council contributes another $2 million to this 
research.
<P>
	Normally these programs issue calls for research applications 
twice each year. Because the federal government is not prepared to 
commit to funding AIDS research beyond March 1998, the two 
programs have decided to stop accepting applications. As a result, 
long term research will suffer and some of the best and brightest 
researchers may leave the field.
<P>
	If the Minister of Health and the government are prepared to 
accept responsibility, it is essential that the Minister of Health and 
the Liberal government put their money where their mouth is. It 
takes money to do research. I call on the government to 
immediately introduce a funding base beyond 1998.

<P>
	Since the Liberals came to power, the unemployed have been 
asked to make big sacrifices. The government said that its objective 
was to put people back to work. There again, it has failed. The 
Minister of Human Resources Development will table his second 
set of unemployment insurance reforms today. Like last time, he 
will say they are intended to give Canadians the dignity of work. 
However, the figures are there to tell us that the job done on 
unemployment insurance will not create jobs. The minister is not 
giving Canadians the dignity of work. He is taking it away from the 
unemployed.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INDIANAFFAIRS">INDIAN AFFAIRS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. A memo from Assistant Deputy Minister of Indian 
Affairs, Jack Stagg, recommends that Ottawa offer financial 
compensation to native peoples for supporting the federal system 
in the referendum and subsidies to try to silence the First Nations' 
constitutional claims while the so-called Quebec initiatives are 
announced.
<P>
	When questioned yesterday, the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development avoided the issue by saying that he had not 
read the memo, although the national media were talking about it.
<P>
	How does the minister explain that, yesterday, not only did he 
not know what his own assistant deputy minister was doing, but he 
was unaware of what everyone else was fully aware of from 
reading the paper, namely the content of Mr. Stagg's memo.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I explained yesterday, I have 
3,000 civil servants in my department alone. A lot of them do a lot 
of writing. I did not ask for that note, I did not want that note, and I 
do not agree with that note.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I imagine 
the minister must have watched TV yesterday like everyone else; it 
was on all the networks.
<P>
	Given the memo's unacceptable recommendations and its lack of 
respect for the First Nations, will the minister tell us clearly 
whether he and his government will dissociate themselves from the 
content of the memo by his assistant deputy minister? Let him say 
so clearly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just did.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understood the minister to say earlier that he was dissociating 
himself, and now he is saying it again. If this is true, since the 
memo was not well received by the various native groups and since 
the Department of Indian Affairs is supposed to protect the rights 
of these people, would the minister tell us if he plans to discipline 
his associate deputy minister for his fine memo?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the First Nation vote in Quebec 
does not have to be bought. They are standing up for Canada. When 
the Crees vote 96.3 per cent no against the separatists and the Inuit 
vote 95 per cent no against the separatists and the Montagnais vote 
99 per cent no against the separatists, that should send a clearer 
message to the separatists than to the Liberal government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is highly unlikely that the minister would brag about 
accepting referendums restricted to the Crees and Montagnais, an 
essentially ethnic referendum in which the other people living on 
these lands were not allowed to vote. That is a very interesting 
statement coming from this minister.
<P>
	He was not asked whether or not referendums were held in 
Quebec. Rather, he was asked specifically whether he dissociates 
himself from his assistant deputy minister's memo. We are not 
talking about just anybody, about one of 3,000 public servants, but 
about the assistant deputy minister. Is the minister going to 
summon his ADM and take appropriate action? That is the 
question. We are not asking the minister for his life story. He 
should be responsible and answer the question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will associate myself with any 
civil servant in any department of this government who wants to 
help the aboriginal people of Quebec.
<P>
	While I am on my feet, talking about association, there is a 
person called Pierre Blais who is a member of the separatist 
government in Quebec. He calls the aboriginal people of Quebec 
gypsies and nomads.
<P>
	We are talking about disassociation. When the new leader of 
Quebec takes over as premier, and maybe when some of the A team 
go and leave the B team here, will the A team disassociate itself 
from comments like that?
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we disavowed such comments as soon as they were 
uttered. I do not know any Pierre Blais, but I do know that this 
minister is skirting the issue. Perhaps he needs videotapes to 
understand the reality, just as the defence minister understands 
only when he can see the evidence on videotape.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	I ask him again the same question. His assistant deputy minister 
made unacceptable comments, mostly about native people. Will he 
punish his assistant deputy minister or does he only have a problem 
with the fact that there was a leak? Is this his sense of 
responsibility, that a leak is serious? What he said shows his 
inability to take action. If this minister is incapable of taking action 
against an assistant deputy minister who made such comments 
about Quebec and its native people, he should not be a government 
minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will correct that. Pierre Blais 
is a former minister of justice.
<P>
	We are talking about disassociation. I will be clear. Any 
provincial or federal civil servant or any provincial or federal 
cabinet minister who wants to do the just and honourable thing with 
aboriginal people will be followed and admired by me.
<P>
	While we are on the subject of disassociation, what is this party 
going to do about a former leader who talks about ``ethics''? What 
is this party going to do about a former deputy premier who goes 
into a hotel and says the same thing? What is this party going to do 
about racism in Quebec vis-a-vis the ethnic community? It is 
important to me because I come from ethnic stock, from the 
Italians and the Irish. If I am offended, I wonder how the aboriginal 
people feel, who have to face fivefold what we had to face in this 
country. What is the member going to do about that?

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after a year 
and a half of delays, flying trial balloons, and countless rewrites, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development is finally bringing 
down his watered down UI reform proposals. He has even 
promised job opportunities and more jobs. Unfortunately while he 
has been playing politics a very alarming circumstance has 
occurred. Statistics Canada reports that last month the number of 
working Canadians fell by 44,000. That is five months of job 
growth down the drain. I wonder what is happening here.
<P>
	My question to the minister is as follows. What if anything are 
the minister's UI proposals doing to stimulate job growth in the 
private sector?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is abundantly clear to those individuals who have been active 
participants in the debate about restructuring Canada's social 
security system that the Unemployment Insurance Act as it is today 
does not reflect the reality of the workplace. It is for this reason that 
the government embarked on a very ambitious project to 
modernize Canada's social security system with three major 
objectives.
<P>
	The first objective is to help Canadians find and keep jobs by 
providing them with not only income support but also a set of tools 
that will allow them to get back to work quickly. The second 
objective is to provide protection for the most vulnerable in our 
society. I know how the Reform Party feels about that. The third 
objective is to develop a system that is sustainable.
<P>
	The announcement the minister of human resources will make 
today will be something Canadians have been waiting for and it 
will address those three objectives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, those 
objectives are certainly noble, but the fact of the matter is that job 
growth has not occurred. When we saw the minister preparing his 
proposal, in the last few days he has been making political 
manipulation and changes instead of looking at sound policy.
<P>
	If the minister is really serious about creating jobs and 
improving job opportunities in the country, why did he not slash the 
payroll taxes by more than the token five cents that was announced 
informally yesterday? My question is clear. The Minister of 
Finance has said in the House more than once that payroll taxes kill 
jobs. If that is true, why did the Minister of Human Resources 
Development not announce a slash greater than five cents?
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is becoming abundantly clear that the Reform Party simply does 
not understand even the measures that were taken in the past budget 
by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has already reduced payroll taxes. 
Measures that will be announced later on by the minister will speak 
to the issue of job creation, which is an important and fundamental 
pillar of the jobs and growth agenda. Not only has this government 
created over 500,000 jobs, but we are modernizing the delivery 
services. We are engaging the private sector, working together in 
partnership with the government through things like national 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17084"> 17084 </A></B>
<P>
sectoral councils and youth internship  programs, which have 
created over 30,000 jobs for young people.
<P>
	We are modernizing the system and we are creating the climate 
that will speak to the issue of job creation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development has promised that through the 
UI proposals there will be job opportunity and job growth. But if 
you really look at it, what is the record that is before us?
<P>
	First of all, there is really nothing in there that is going to break 
the cycle of dependency. There is going to be nothing there for 
those 44,000 Canadians who just lost their jobs. There is going to 
be nothing there for the young people who are looking for jobs at 
the present time. There is a lot of politics, but not good, substantial 
policy.
<P>
	My question to the hon. parliamentary secretary is as follows. 
After a year and a half of dithering and political manoeuvring here 
and top down tinkering and made in Ottawa solutions, what is the 
government really going to do through this policy to reduce the 
number of unemployed in this country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member should be asking what the government has 
already done to create jobs in Canada. We have done a great deal. I 
have outlined a number of measures we have taken already.
<P>
	I find it extremely surprising that a member of the Reform Party, 
the same party that does not support the summer job action plan of 
this government, which has created over 44,500 jobs, would get up 
and claim to be the defender of young people in this country.
<P>
	It is abundantly clear to the people of Canada that the Reform 
members of the opposition have abdicated their responsibilities to 
give young people a chance.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Indian Affairs. In his memo, Indian Affairs 
assistant deputy minister Jack Stagg suggested that federal 
subsidies be granted to aboriginal people, first, as compensation for 
supporting the no side in the referendum and, second, as a way to 
silence native constitutional demands while the federal government 
is making pseudo-offers to Quebec.
<P>
	In light of his ADM's memo, will the minister confirm that he 
did not commit and does not intend to commit any federal funds to 
cover the costs incurred by the Crees and the Inuit to hold their own 
referenda in October?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I can guarantee is that in 
Quebec there will be a clear understanding that there is an 1898 
line, that the northern two-thirds of Quebec was transferred to 
Quebec without the knowledge and consent of the aboriginal 
people.
<P>
	What I will guarantee is that the people of Quebec and Canada 
will understand that there is a royal commission report. There is an 
opinion from Daniel Turp, which has been hidden by the Bloc, that 
states that the rights of the aboriginal people in Quebec are 
sovereign, that they are more important than even the rights of 
Europeans who came after they did. That is a fact that the 
separatists know and are hiding. They put a muzzle on their legal 
scholar who advised them of this.
<P>
	What I will guarantee is that the voice of our Minister of Foreign 
Affairs will be heard in Quebec, as will the voices of the thousands 
of Canadians who came forward and said to Matthew Coon-Come 
and Zebedee Nungak and the Mohawk leaders: ``We understand 
finally what you are saying and we are with you''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> In that case, Mr. Speaker,

Ottawa is making its so-called offers to Quebec?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

aboriginal people is not for sale. Matthew Coon-Come said during 
the referendum: ``We are not Canada's Crees; we are not Quebec's 
Crees. We are Crees and we are not cattle to be moved around 
indiscriminately by ideological separatists at will''.

minister has failed to renegotiate these agreements within that 
period.

Are they in place and if not, why are they not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

sharing agreements for young offenders or legal aid? If the hon. 
member would be more specific in his question, I have information 
I would be happy to share with him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week we 
asked the justice minister the same question. Of course the solicitor 
general responded by saying he would get back to us. He has not 
got back to us with the information. At that time we were quite 
specific on what we were referring to.
<P>
	I will ask the justice minister about the alternative measures 
program. The program as defined under Bills C-37 and C-41 will 
place a tremendous financial challenge on the provinces which are 
tasked with the administration of the program. What financial 
agreements if any has the justice minister devised in co-operation 
with the provinces, or is he just going to ignore the cost of this 
legislation to the provinces and force this legislation on them 
together with the financial requirement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is important that the hon. 
member refer specifically to the agreements he is asking about. 
There are many agreements between the federal government and 
the provinces by which we share the cost in the administration of 
justice.
<P>
	The hon. member has now referred to one such program. I am 
proud to say that today happens to be the day when the provisions 
of Bill C-37 are proclaimed in force and come into effect across the 
country. The provisions make extremely important improvements 
to strengthen the Young Offenders Act, particularly in relation to 
violence.
<P>
	As the solicitor general said in the House last week in response 
to the last question put by the hon. member on this subject, we are 
assembling detailed information for the member which we will 
give him in the coming days when it is ready. Many of the 
agreements which expired some 18 months or two years ago have 
since been renewed retroactively to the date of the expiry of the last 
set of agreements.
<P>
	As always, we are continuing our efforts with the provinces to 
work toward a justice system that is properly financed, that works 
in co-ordination at the various levels of government and that serves 
the people of Canada.

<P>
	The Kahnawake band council has passed a resolution to expel 
Peter Jacobs, a resident of the reserve, simply  because he is not of 
Indian blood, discriminating against him on essentially ethnic 
grounds. Mr. Jacobs was adopted when he was three weeks old and 
has been living on the reserve for 40 years.

<P>
	Let me talk about my experience in Kahnawake when I went 
there with Serge Ménard, David Cliche and the solicitor general. 
We could have walked in there in peace to sign a policing 
agreement but because there was so much animosity built up 
between the separatists and people at Kahnawake, the aerials were 
ripped off our cars. They jumped in our cars and tried to choke us. 
This tells me that the federal Liberals understand the aspirations of 
the Mohawk and are able to deal with them and that the path of

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-37 which amended the Young Offenders Act did 
not go far enough. Canadians said it and Reform said it, but the 
justice minister went ahead with it anyway. Bill C-37 just received 
royal assent and the committee is already off on another mission to 
uncover the inadequacies of his improved act.
<P>
	For years Canadians have been telling governments what is 
wrong with the YOA but governments will not listen. The minister 
did not listen to witnesses appearing before the committee last 
time. What assurance can he give them that he will listen this time?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member demonstrates on 
this issue as on so many others his preference for volume over 
analysis and his preference for rhetoric over reality.
<P>
	Bill C-37 is an effective and insightful advance for the youth 
justice system in this country. It helps us to deal far more 
appropriately with violence among young people especially in the 
16 and 17-year old age group.
<P>
	At the time we introduced Bill C-37 we said that it was only a 
beginning and that more was required. We asked the justice 
committee, on which the member's colleagues sit along with 
members of our party, to undertake across Canada a comprehensive 
full analysis of the youth justice system to see how else it could be 
improved. That is the work in which the committee is engaged. It is 
important work and will result in recommendations to which we 
will pay attention.
<P>
	If the hon. member thinks there is some better way to go about it, 
I would like to hear from him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the reason I might resort to volume from time to time is in 
the hope the message might get through to the minister.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has sent the justice committee packing. 
The committee is to cross the country seeking the opinions of 
Canadians on his new and improved Young Offenders Act. Will the 
justice minister commit today to the members of the standing 
committee, to all members of this House and more important, to all 
Canadians, that he will listen and pay attention to the 
recommendations of the committee, or will this be just another 
colossal waste of taxpayers' time and money?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member also demonstrates 
that he is unable to accept yes for an answer.
<P>
	Had he spoken with members of his own party who were at the 
committee hearing when I addressed them two weeks ago, he 
would know that I told the committee that this is an open minded, 
no holds barred, top to bottom review of the youth justice system.
<P>
	I have asked the committee members to speak to police officers, 
to parents, to school principals and to young people themselves. I 
have asked them to speak to the provinces to determine their 
experience with the Young Offenders Act and its administration 
and to return with recommendations for further change. That is the 
way the process works. That is the functioning of democracy. I urge

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. Today is World 
AIDS Day. The epidemic, far from being under control, has 
reached unexpected proportions. From 1982 to 1995, 15,000 cases 
of AIDS were reported in Canada. Over the next five years, another 
15,000 cases will be identified. In the meantime, the minister does 
nothing but make empty speeches and is incapable of pledging to 
maintain the national AIDS strategy.
<P>
	Given the terrible ravages of that disease, how can the minister 
justify that she is contemplating saving $40.7 million per year, at 
the expense of people living with AIDS, by giving up the national 
AIDS strategy? Such a decision would be shameful.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member very well knows the answer to his question which 
is that HIV/AIDS and the battle against it remains a priority for this 
government.
<P>
	Phase two of the strategy is scheduled to end in 1998. In the two 
years we have been here we have made dramatic cuts in every other 
program, but that is one program which has not been touched. We 
continue to spend $40.7 million a year on this strategy. That being 
said, we will continue to think of this as a priority, but we must 
reorganize the financing.
<P>
	At this time we are working out the ways by which we can 
continue financing this very worthwhile initiative. We have at least 
until the next budget to announce exactly how we will reallocate 
funds to continue to support these very worthwhile programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr.

commitment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
every dollar is spent very carefully. As you know, the mere fact that 
we have a dollar in our pocket does not mean that we should waste 
it. This is why the government invests in good programs.

<P>

last Friday I was very pleased to table a bill containing many 
amendments to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, including ones 
that deal particularly with the issue the hon. member has 
mentioned.
<P>
	This is the first time that the bankruptcy act has had provisions 
that have been intended to enable trustees in bankruptcy to take 
possession of assets that pose environmental risks.
<P>
	We have given claims which stem from environmental damage 
priority over those of other creditors, both secured and unsecured, 
so that dealing with contaminated properties and properties that are 
adjacent to the property where the damage occurred and linked to 
the activity that caused the environmental damage will be able to 
be used as a priority claim in order to effect the clean-up. This will 
not only relieve some of the responsibility from local governments,

on some of these very difficult files.

<P>
	Throughout the past months I have been advised by independent 
counsel that I retained to help me with the assessment of this case. 
That independent counsel working with lawyers for the applicant, 
Mr. Kelly, and the witness have participated in interviews. There 
have been three attendances for that purpose.
<P>
	I believe the work with that witness has now been virtually 
completed. I am awaiting a final report and recommendations from 
the independent counsel. I am keenly aware that time has past since 
the application has been brought, but I will publish with the

However, the justice minister has been stalling for two years and 
refuses to provide the files required for Mr. Kelly's defence.
<P>
	There is little reason not to release the files as the information 
being withheld from Mr. Kelly's lawyer was collected at public 
expense by a public agency for use in a public prosecution.

should take place. The files are not the property of the Department 
of Justice. They belong to the metropolitan Toronto police. They 
were made available to us on certain conditions.
<P>

``We will allow you access to what we've been given but on certain

acceptable. He has taken another position. Quite properly he is 
acting for his client diligently. We are discussing the terms under 
which we will release the documents.

department has resulted in a mere 2,500 patients being able to 
benefit from this drug, whereas if 3TC  obtained commercial 
authorization from Health Canada all of the people living with 
AIDS, four times that figure, could have access to it?
<P>

shall repeat what I said. The scientists of Health Canada are doing

right. The companies applied for drug approval in the U.S. first,

he cannot meet his deadlines. Let us see if he can break this habit of 
indecision.
<P>

13,000 hopper cars dedicated to the hauling of prairie grain by the

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

responding to questions from the Reform Party is that its members 
consistently get their facts wrong. Once again the hon. gentleman 
has done exactly that.
<P>
	He refers to a group within the grains industry called the May 
16th group. He also refers to an advisory group of grains industry 
executives called the SEO group. The hon. gentleman should know 
those are two quite separate things. They are not one and the same.
<P>
	The SEO group has come forward with certain recommendations 
about grain car ownership and grain car allocation procedures. 
Those recommendations have been presented for consideration to 
the May 16th group, as well as to some western Canadian farm 
organizations.
<P>
	Those farm organizations are still in the process of considering

industry. He is not listening to those who have been putting input 
into the whole process. Maybe we can give him the benefit of the 
doubt. Maybe he is trying to get a better deal for farmers.
<P>
	Is he proposing that if the railroads buy the cars, worth over $300 
million for the fire sale price of $100 million, that the railroads will 
then agree not to increase the freight rates by the $1 a time which 
they are currently proposing? Is that what he is working for? Why 
is he delaying?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the hon. gentleman fails to 
appreciate is that the set of recommendations put forward by the 
group of senior executive officers in the grains industry is a 
package proposal which involves a number of recommendations 
that move in a variety of different directions.
<P>
	He has spoken, for example, about the recommendation relating 
to the possible sale of hopper cars. What he has not referred to is 
the fact that another recommendation from that very same group of 
senior executive officers proposes that there ought to be some kind 
of maximum ceiling with respect to freight rates extending over a 
period of 10 years.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
petition is from petitioners who are movers or those who are 
involved with that industry.
<P>
	They want the government to examine very carefully its policy 
with regard to household goods removal services. They obviously 
want to ensure that there is a good deal for Canadian taxpayers. At 
the same time, they want a solution that will not be destabilize their 
industry, their involvement, their small businesses.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INCOMETAXACT">INCOME TAX ACT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a petition that has 
been circulating all across Canada. This petition has been signed by 
a number of Canadians from Formosa, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17092"> 17092 </A></B>
<P>
an honourable profession, which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. They  also state that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families that make the choice to provide care 
in the home to preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill 
or the aged.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ALCOHOL">ALCOHOL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a second petition I wish to present, which has also been circulating 
across Canada. This particular petition has been signed by a 
number of Canadians from Sarnia, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the House 
that consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health 
problems or impair one's ability, and specifically that fetal alcohol 
syndrome and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent 
preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers 
and others of the risk associated with alcohol consumption.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERSACT">YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, today I am pleased to 
present two petitions sponsored by Sun Hope in memory of André 
Castet, with over 500 signatures from the residents of British 
Columbia, many in my own riding of Port Moody-Coquitlam.
<P>
	These Canadians express the need for substantial revisions to the 
Young Offenders Act and reject the tinkering and posturing of this 
government in legislation and its inactivity such as we see in Bill 
C-37.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on this World 
AIDS Day I am honoured to present this petition signed by over 
3,200 Canadians from every region of Canada.
<P>
	The petitioners call upon Parliament to consider a program of 
long term stabilized funding of AIDS research proportionate to the 
HIV population in Canada. Canada ranks third among G-7 
countries in its incidence of HIV but ranks last in AIDS research 
funding.
<P>
	I fully concur with the request of these petitioners.

petitions of 1,000 Winnipegers from my constituency of Winnipeg 
North and beyond, who pray that the surety bond be not imposed on 
applicants for immigration and as well to have the landing fee 
collected at the time of the issuance of the visas of applicants.
<P>
	They remind members of the House that immigrants do provide 
a strength for our economic and social fabric.

	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister

would like to bring forward a petition from a great number of 
people in southern Ontario who are opposed to the approval of 
synthetic bovine growth hormone, the drug injected into cows to 
increase milk production.
<P>
	They say there have not been sufficient studies to warrant this 
process, that there is a great risk to the health of people, not to 
mention the damage to the cows themselves. Australia, New 
Zealand, and the European Community have refused to approve 
BGH.
<P>
	The petitioners want Parliament to take steps to keep BGH out of 
Canada through legislating a moratorium or stoppage of BGH use 
and sale until the year 2000 and to examine the outstanding health 
and economic questions through an independent and transparent 
review.

House.
<P>
	These petitioners call upon the government to enact immediate 
legislation for freedom of choice in health care; that is, full 
integration of alternative practitioners, homoeopathic, herbal, 
naturopathic, et cetera, into the Canadian health care system, with 
full and equal coverage for visits and necessary remedies.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise today to speak to the House on Bill C-110.
<P>
	I have heard in recent days the speeches of a number of our 
colleagues in the Liberal Party and the other opposition party. I 
realized that I should perhaps offer a somewhat broader criticism of 
the bill.
<P>
	Those who spoke from the Bloc Quebecois very successfully 
pointed out the extremely limited nature and scope of what is being 
called a sort of veto power, which will be loaned to Quebec and 
certain regions in Canada, so we can say that the Prime Minister 
has begun to fulfil the promise he made to Quebecers in the final 
days of the campaign.
<P>
	I would like to make clear that the issues of the veto, the distinct 
society and the transfers of jurisdiction, do not only involve 
constitutional change. These issues are at the heart of what we 
Quebecers see as Quebec's destiny.
<P>
	This week a paper reported a survey. Canadians in Quebec and 
elsewhere were being asked about their perception of Canada, their 
vision of its future. Basically, they were being asked whether, in 
their opinion, Canada comprised two groups, was the union of two 
equal language groups or was the juxtaposition of 10 provinces 
forming a country. The results differ significantly according to 
whether they come from Quebec, the west, Ontario or the Atlantic 
provinces.
<P>
	I think this survey takes us to the heart of the debate, which 
involves defining Canada What was it in the past? What is it now? 
We see that Canadians are not agreed on how they view their 
country. We see that 64 per cent of Canadians believe basically that 
Canada is the union of 10 provinces. Twenty-four per cent think it 
is the union of two equal language groups: anglophones and 
francophones.
<P>
	These figures are surprising. Yet, when we look at the 
distribution by region and province, we see that the split is quite 
substantial, even dramatic. We see that 70 per cent of Ontarians, 73 
per cent of Maritimers, and 76 per cent of the people in the prairies 
think that Canada is the union of 10 provinces. In Quebec, however, 
42 per cent of the people see Canada as the union of 10 provinces, 
37 per cent as the union of two equal linguistic groups, and 15 per 
cent as neither.
<P>
	These figures-42, 37 and 15 per cent-remind me of the results 
of some polls conducted during the referendum campaign. Some of 
the polls, perhaps those taken at the beginning of the campaign, 
showed that 42 per cent of respondents intended to vote no and 37 
per cent to vote yes, with 15 or 20 per cent undecided.
<P>
	As these figures demonstrate, the heart of the problem with 
Canada and Quebec is that Canadians and Quebecers do not see 
Canada in the same way. That is why we in Quebec talk about a 
veto, why we see this reality as important.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	If we look at the people in the rest of Canada, we realize that they 
do not see all this as important. I have not heard people from B.C., 
Ontario or the Atlantic region say that they should have a veto on 
constitutional changes in Canada. Only Quebec makes this 
demand.
<P>
	Why is Quebec making this demand? Because Quebec is 
basically a people who want to preserve their identity, who want to 
continue to be themselves. That is the reason why they want to have 
a say in any constitutional change. That is what lies at the heart of 
the debate on the right of veto.
<P>
	It does not matter to us if this will be done this way or that way, 
if B.C. will have the same veto power as Ontario, if the Atlantic 
provinces will have a say, if Prince Edward Island will make 
special demands. To us, veto power is a matter of defending our 
distinctive culture, of defending what makes us a people. That is 
why, in the 30 years I have been following politics, Quebec has 
always had problems with respect to the right of veto. Not because 
we want to make trouble for Canada, but because it touches the 
very essence of who we are.
<P>
	As you may recall, in the 1960s, there was the proposed 
constitutional amending formula called the Fulton-Favreau 
formula; there was the Victoria formula; there were the protests by 
certain Quebec movements when the Constitution was patriated. 
We were reminded yesterday that Quebec sovereignists voted 
against the Meech Lake accord. Just as well, since Meech was 
some kind of a reorganization of Canada designed to satisfy the 
very minimal demands put forward by the then Premier of Quebec, 
and those demands did not reflect in any way what I feel Quebec's 
basic needs are.
<P>
	On the one hand, there were those who had a blueprint for 
nationhood and, on the other, there were those with nothing better 
to offer at the time than some vague revamping of the Canadian 
Constitution. In that context, I think that we sovereignists had a 
right-we did not have a choice really-to oppose this 
constitutional revamping.
<P>
	I am puzzled about some of the attacks on us, when I hear people 
say about certain Bloc members: ``So and so, who was sitting at the 
Quebec National Assembly at  the time, voted against the Meech 
Lake accord''. It is a good thing they did, because this accord was a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17094"> 17094 </A></B>
<P>
way for the federalists, who do not recognize Quebec as a people, 
to revamp the Constitution in the hope that, slowly but surely, we 
would all die off and disappear.
<P>
	That is why, when we Quebecers are offered amending formulas, 
our gut reflex is: ``Watch out. Red alert. They are dealing with 
fundamental aspects that make us what we are''. We want to remain 
what we are and, in the future, to develop our own identity that 
makes us a part, as we see it, of the world community.
<P>
	That is why, whenever the concept of a distinct society, a veto or 
administrative transfers are brought up, we consistently oppose 
them, because we believe that our future is in building in North 
America our own sovereign country, in order to be able to establish 
normal state-to-state relations with other peoples: the people of 
Canada, the people of the United States and the people of other 
sovereign countries of the world. That is the crux of the matter.
<P>
	I can understand why many of our colleagues, members of both 
the government party or the third party, are tired of hearing our 
arguments because they take the same view of this issue as the 
other Canadians who tell us that Canada is a juxtaposition of ten 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I can understand that they are tired of our arguments, of listening 
to us. I hope that, in the years to come, an agreement can be 
negotiated on new terms so that, in a spirit of mutual respect, we in 
Quebec can remain who we are and English Canada can continue to 
develop as it pleases, without either of us interfering with each 
other's growth, as the people of Canada and the people of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to address Bill C-110, which I will refer to as the veto 
act. First, let us ask ourselves this basic question: Who speaks for 
whom, in Quebec? Let us look at that question in the context of the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc Quebecois keep saying: ``We are the ones 
speaking for Quebecers''. I am sorry, but there are also Liberal 
members representing Quebec ridings. There are 20 of us here who 
speak for Quebec. Furthermore, an independent member, who sits 
next to me, as well as a Conservative member, also speak for 
Quebec. Therefore, Bloc members are not the only ones 
representing Quebec's interests in this House.
<P>
	Let us not forget that Quebecers voted no in the referendum. 
Consequently, it is the Quebec Liberal members of this House, not 
the Bloc members, who won the referendum, albeit by a narrow 
margin. As member for Brome-Missisquoi, I can certainly speak 
on behalf of the majority of Quebecers who voted no.
<P>
	It is true that those who voted no also expressed a strong desire 
for change. Not a desire to separate, but a desire for change. Even a 
leader of the yes side, Mr. Dumont, says so in today's issue of <I>La 
Presse</I>: ``If Quebecers had said yes, we would be in the process of 
implementing the plan that had been drawn up. However, this is not 
the case. The no side won by pledging to make changes. Let us see 
what they have to offer. This is not my first choice, since I was on 
the opposite side during the referendum campaign''.
<P>
	The Leader of the Action Démocratique does not think that his 
party members will reject his position. He adds: ``Our 
post-referendum strategy is simple. We must look after our 
economy and our public finances. As for Ottawa, it must define the 
changes promised during the campaign. We will let them work and, 
if they make a proposal, we will look at it''. So, the desire for 
change expressed during the referendum campaign is definitely not 
a desire to separate.
<P>
	The changes that people are asking for from their federal elected 
representatives are changes that affect them. They are not changes 
that would make Ottawa or Quebec bigger, but changes that reflect 
people's needs. This is what is important. Those who count are 
those who sent us here. We are accountable to them. But what 
changes do these people expect from us?
<P>
	As I see it, there are two types. One year ago, I was campaigning 
to represent my party in Brome-Missisquoi. Then the by-election 
took place, followed by the referendum. In that one year, I spent 
more time campaigning in Quebec than I did in this House.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	I talked to a lot of people during the past year. What kind of 
changes do people want? There are two kinds. First, a change in the 
way we do things and second, recognition of our way of life.
<P>
	First, the way we do things. When you go out and meet people, 
they tell you: ``We are fed up with taxes. We are being taxed out of 
existence. We are fed up with bureaucracy and red tape. So why not 
let Quebec and Ottawa get together and see whether something can 
be done about getting rid of all this duplication? Why not give a 
little more power to the private citizen?'' People want to be 
involved.
<P>
	As for recognition of our way of life, I think that is what people 
want, along with recognition of Quebec's language, culture, legal 
traditions and institutions.
<P>
	A resolution was presented in this House to recognize the people 
of Quebec as a distinct society. A bill was introduced more or less 
at the same time-the bill we are debating now-that gives veto 
powers to Quebec and other regions in Canada. It is not perfect, but 
is perfection possible in this world? Is it be better to entrench this 
in the Constitution than to have a bill? Yes,  it would be better. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17095"> 17095 </A></B>
<P>
Soon, in 1997, there will be a meeting of provincial premiers. Yes, 
it is better.
<P>
	Would it be better to have more rather than fewer regions? I am 
not sure. But I do think the government has made a very good start 
by putting something on the table quickly after the referendum.
<P>
	So what do we do now? What do we do? After the veto bill we 
are debating now is adopted, we will see if by 1997, we can reach a 
consensus within this country, within Canada. We will see whether 
we can constitutionalize, perhaps by 1997 or whenever, the concept 
of distinct society.
<P>
	But, as I said earlier, the citizen comes first. We will have to 
prepare a package of changes, changes that are crucial and 
thorough, and we will have to do it now, but we should keep it 
simple: look at duplication, decentralize administrations and 
standardize paperwork. I think we should go for solutions that have 
a direct impact on the public.
<P>
	We must also make the citizens of this country proud to be 
Canadians. And part of that is teaching Canadian history in our 
schools. Part of it is young people knowing the words of our 
national anthem. Part of it is flying our flag everywhere. Part of it 
is encouraging Quebecers to meet people and travel in other 
provinces and vice versa.
<P>
	The veto powers we are discussing today are like the oil I put in 
the hydraulic system of my backhoe so I can raise the shovel.
<P>
	It is important that all of us in this House, irrespective of our 
political affiliations, have only the interests of the citizen at heart.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this speech is not directed at the individuals in the House. 
It is directed at the people of Canada. The crisis that we face today 
supersedes politics. It supersedes the gamesmanship that we see in 
the House. It supersedes what goes on in committee. It is an issue 
that affects the very soul of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	Never in the past 50 years has there been such a crisis in our 
midst, a crisis that will change the very face of the country that we 
know and love. Never have we needed leadership more but never 
have we seen such a dearth of leadership. It almost caused our 
country to fracture last October 30.
<P>
	The current proposals in Bill C-110 are ineffective. They are 
meant to appease the separatists within this House and they are 
meant to appease the separatist leaders in Quebec. The fact of the 
matter is that the separatist leadership wants one thing and one 
thing alone: a separate, independent Quebec.
<P>
	Anything the government does is going to be ineffective. 
Therefore the proposals the government makes must not be 
addressed to the separatist leadership, not to the separatist party, 
but to the people of Quebec. That is the intent of what we are trying 
to accomplish here. We are trying to keep this country together, not 
for politicians, not for political parties, but for the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	The fundamental overriding principle of being Canadian is 
equality for everyone. If we do not have equality for all of us then 
we have equality for no one. It is something that Canadians have 
fought for in two world wars, which the brave men and women in 
our armed forces fight for today, peace and equality in far off lands.
<P>
	To the people of Quebec I say you are afraid of losing your 
culture, you are afraid of losing your language. You do not wish to 
become like the French culture in the southern United States. But 
your culture is important to us, your language is important to us. It 
enriches each and every one of us.
<P>
	In the same vein, our culture, our history and the culture and the 
history of the multiple ethnic groups that make up Canada must be 
important to you too. We in the Reform Party have proposed that 
culture and language be given to the provinces, all of the provinces, 
including Quebec. Here you can be the masters of your own 
cultural and linguistic destinies.
<P>
	To the people of Quebec I also say, you are fed up with 
unnecessary duplication, you are fed up with unnecessary 
interventions by Ottawa. But so is the rest of the country. That is 
why in order to reduce waste and save taxpayers' money we have 
submitted proposals to decentralize various areas such as natural 
resources, manpower training, housing, tourism and such.
<P>
	The people of Quebec are fed up with the high federal debt, but 
so is the rest of Canada. Understand one thing. If Quebecers leave 
Canada they must understand very clearly that they will walk away 
with their share of the national debt.
<P>
	To the people of Quebec I say, you are fed up with taxes which 
go to Ottawa and are wasted but understand, so is the rest of 
Canada. The rest of Canada has the same interests that the vast 
majority of the people of Quebec have. It would be a shame to have 
the people of Quebec separate from Canada over an eventuality that 
will come to pass anyway. In most ways the same desires of the 
people of Quebec are shared by people in every province within our 
country. I ask them to work with everybody else in order to 
accomplish this.
<P>
	The separatists want to secede to preserve the Quebec culture but 
they can only do this by preventing non-francophone people from 
coming into Quebec. That is why they want to control immigration. 
That is their intent. They want to create a pure laine population. 
Fantasy? Hardly. Bloc Quebecois members previous to  the refer-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17096"> 17096 </A></B>
<P>
endum said that the only true Quebecer is one that is a member of la 
pure laine.
<P>
	This was confirmed by racist statements made by Mr. Parizeau 
and Mr. Landry that blamed them for the failure of Quebec to 
succeed in the referendum. They put that responsibility on the 
shoulders of hardworking immigrant populations in Quebec. 
Accidental? Not at all. Why? Because they want to drive the 
immigrant population from Quebec to increase, relatively 
speaking, the yes vote for separation.
<P>
	However, the people of Quebec do not want this. The people of 
Quebec are not xenophobes. They are not intolerant. They are not 
racist. Their leaders are but they are not. This is something they 
need remember. They would be embarrassed to know some of the 
things that have been said by some of their leaders.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	I ask the people of Quebec why investors would want go to 
Quebec to start companies and create jobs in a climate of obsolete 
economic ideas, an enormously high debt and intolerance?
<P>
	This brings me to the motivation of the separatist leadership. 
They warp history. They lie about economic facts. They muzzle 
their own people which prevents them from getting the facts. Why 
are they doing this? They are doing it for their own gain and the 
gain is power. It is power for the separatist leadership in Quebec 
and has nothing to do with benefiting the average citizen in 
Quebec.
<P>
	The pursuit of the separatist leadership in Quebec has very little 
to do with the people of Quebec. The leadership knows its actions 
and activities are just going to drag down the average citizen in 
Quebec. Those who will be hurt the most are those who are the 
poorest in that province.
<P>
	We agree with the people of Quebec in wanting to be the masters 
of their own linguistic and cultural destinies for it is their culture 
and their language that enriches us all. We are, after all, a part of a 
multi-ethnic mélange of different groups. French history is a part of 
our history and is a fundamental, important and integral part of 
Canada.
<P>
	Canada needs leadership and it needs it now. It needs leadership 
to put this issue of Canadian unity beyond the realm and the arena 
of politics. If this issue is left to the politicians it will be lethal for 
Canadian unity. All the people of Canada must understand that.
<P>
	I implore and beseech the people of this country to come 
together: francophones, allophones, anglophones, all the ethnic 
groups, all the cultures and all the languages, under the umbrella of 
understanding and tolerance. It is something that all Canadians are 
proud of. From outside Canada it is how we are seen. We are  
looked at as being a country that exhibits the best examples of 
culture and tolerance.
<P>
	However, if ever there was a need for us to demonstrate this to its 
greatest extent it is now. We must all come together. Anglophones 
must travel to Quebec. Quebecers must travel into the rest of 
Canada to see the importance of having our cultures united, not 
separate.
<P>
	There is no reason why the people of Quebec cannot have what 
they asked for in terms of preserving their culture and language in 
North America. The rest of Canada does not want that to be lost, it 
wants it to stay. It wants it to stay in the framework of equality, 
respect and tolerance for all Canadians.
<P>
	Quite frankly, the policies that have been put forward in Bill 
C-110, rather than bringing people together, are actually divisive. 
The people in the rest of Canada see this as a way of making them 
second class citizens. I hope the people of Quebec understand this. 
They want nothing more than to be equal with Canadians and with 
Quebecers. They want nothing more and nothing less.
<P>
	In closing, our country is the greatest country in the world. It is a 
land of tolerance and unity. It is made up of a mélange of different 
ethnic groups of which the French Canadian heritage and culture is 
one of the most important. I ask the people of Quebec, not the 
politicians, to join us in unity to build a stronger, united Canada for 
all people.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on 
the Prime Minister's unity initiative. In particular, I am going to 
address the distinct character of Quebec, the fact that it is different 
which is an obvious and inevitable reality. There are four simple 
and straightforward truths members of Parliament must keep in 
mind during this debate.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	The first truth is very clear and it must remain at the heart of our 
debate: Canada is the best country in the world in which to live. 
Today we are discussing our future. We are discussing evolution. 
Anyone can discuss whatever they want in this land because we 
live in the most free and democratic country in which all of us are 
equal citizens with equal rights.
<P>
	The second truth is that the Prime Minister, the government and 
Parliament have a duty to preserve the unity of Canada as a nation 
indivisible.
<P>
	The third truth must be obvious to every member of Parliament. 
Canadians have called for change and they have called for change 
based upon goodwill, change based upon reaching out, change 
based upon open arms, open minds and open hearts. As a member 
of Parliament from Montreal, I saw this reality with my own eyes, 
particularly during the unity rally in our city.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17097"> 17097 </A></B>
<P>
	The fourth truth is that the Prime Minister of Canada keeps his 
word. The Prime Minister said he would introduce measures to 
declare Quebec a distinct society and to offer a constitutional veto 
and Canadians know that they can count on him to do exactly what 
he promised to do. He is a man of his word and he has done it. 
Now we must move forward to close the gap, to bridge the gulf 
that seemingly divides.
<P>
	This resolution is not about every person or every province or 
every political party demanding to get its own way. This legislation 
is about Canada and Canadians finding a better way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Comme en 1982.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Pendant des années.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> This resolution is about Parliament showing 
leadership by saying we will take another step in finding 
understanding. We will take another step in recognizing the reality 
of Canada. We will demonstrate that we are determined to keep 
faith-
<P>
	<B>An. hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Listen, do you guys want to have a fight?
<P>
	We will demonstrate that we are determined to keep faith with 
both the heritage and the potential of our wonderful country.
<P>
	We recognize that Quebec is a province with a legal system that 
is not based on common law, but on the civil code. It is the home of 
a diverse population of anglophones, allophones, and a majority 
who are French speaking Canadians who are also diverse. We will 
not just talk about good intentions. We are building trust by acting 
on those good intentions. This measure before Parliament is based 
on the reality of Canada.
<P>
	Unfortunately, as all Canadians know, anything proposed by the 
Government of Canada will never go far enough to satisfy the Parti 
Quebecois or for that matter the Bloc Quebecois. Equally 
unfortunate, anything proposed by the Government of Canada will 
never go far enough to satisfy the Reform Party. Those people will 
never be satisfied.
<P>
	Thank goodness this debate is not about keeping those people 
happy. This debate is about keeping Canada together. This debate is 
about satisfying the people inside and outside of Quebec who 
understand that the me generation has passed and the we generation 
has arrived. It is no longer about cutting the best deal for yourself. 
It is about reaching the best solution for the future of our country. It 
is about building the new Canada. It is about standing proud and 
tall for the maple leaf. Canadians from coast to coast to coast must 
rise above their differences and realize that there is so much more 
that unites than that which divides us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have experienced many problems throughout our history but 
have always found a way to resolve them, for we understand that 
compassion is far more humane than conflict.
<P>
	We understand that tolerance is far superior to intransigence. We 
understand that allowing our fellow citizens to reach their full 
potential does nothing to diminish us. Canadians know that we 
cannot build a big country on small minds.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians know that we cannot build a big country on little 
minds.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians are not expecting miracles, nor are they looking for 
heaven here on earth. But they are entitled to expect that the 
Parliament of Canada will do its utmost, will take the right actions, 
will adopt the appropriate principles, in order to recognize the 
modern reality of Canada and to show its true commitment to 
strengthening the ties among the members of Canada's diversified 
population.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I hope that Quebecers and non-Quebecers alike will urge 
members of Parliament from all parties to keep the big picture in 
mind. I hope they will urge members of Parliament to take 
meaningful and realistic steps toward progress.
<P>
	Canadians are people of moderation and modesty. From time to 
time we are also a people of passion. We try always to be people of 
principle, of fairness and of optimism. Throughout their history 
Canadians have overcome their differences and succeeded beyond 
the wildest dreams of the founders of this nation. We did it in the 
end after much reflection by appealing to the better side of our 
nature as human beings and by acting on the better side of our 
nature as citizens.
<P>
	Recognizing Quebec as a distinct society, providing a new 
constitutional veto and bringing government closer to the people 
are the vital and important issues. Those are the proposals which 
the government is moving to turn into reality. What is at stake is 
keeping our word, keeping faith with the dreams of Canadians, 
re-energizing our national unity and revitalizing the very best 
country in the world.
<P>
	When political discourse becomes invective, when rhetoric over 
reality becomes overheated, it begets intolerance, instability and 
fear. When political leaders target identifiable groups-and we 
have had more than enough of that-when they blame specific 
communities, they are offensive and they fuel exclusion, anger and 
resentment. They are a blot on the good name, the  goodwill and the 
respect we have built for our society both here in Canada and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17098"> 17098 </A></B>
<P>
around the world. When bigots like Pierre Bourgault and his ilk 
spew their invective, they show that they have no place in our 
caring society.
<P>
	I know that the vast majority of Quebecers reject those 
exclusionary, racist remarks and recognize that we as 
Quebecers-and that includes some of you on the other side-are 
all welcome, we are all included and we are all equal, with equal 
rights, and that our vote will be respected. We too have contributed 
beyond measure to the growth, development and well-being of all 
Quebecers.
<P>
	I want this understanding of the fair sharing in Quebec to be 
appreciated. I am a Quebecer. I am proud of my difference. I am 
not better, I am not worse, I am just different. That is what makes 
me distinct and that is what makes all of us distinct in Quebec. The 
environment has formed us in many ways.
<P>
	I call on all Canadians to join with us in recognizing that despite 
our diverse geography from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains, 
our many cultures and the aboriginal peoples of our two official 
languages, we are one country. It is by extending our hands of 
welcome to one another, by rejoicing and appreciating our 
differences and our diversity that we grow and prosper. It is 
through our civility and the unity of all Canadians that we ensure a 
bright future for our children, for our community and for our 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to begin my speech-in the hope that the 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, who is my 
deskmate, will do me the honour of going along with my line of 
reasoning-by proposing that we try to imagine what it would be 
like if we had André Laurendeau, Lionel Groulx, Hubert Aquin, 
Robert Bourassa and Claude Ryan sitting in opposition.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	I named these people, because each and every one of them, at 
some time or other, has been involved in the process of 
constitutional review, in different ways of course. I, myself, have 
been very interested in the process of constitutional review. It has 
enabled me to pursue my studies. The process of constitutional 
review arose from the 1960s idea that the Constitution had to be 
reviewed.
<P>
	I would say that, for Quebec, the process of constitutional review 
between the 1960s and now has had two main thrusts. The first, I 
believe, applies to the entire Quebec family. Both the provincial 
Liberals and the slightly more nationalist folks acknowledge that 
reviewing sections 91 and 92 on the devolution of power is what 
counts in the constitutional review.
<P>
	This is particularly true, because, as you will remember, in the 
early 1960s, with Jean Lesage, there was a movement in English 
Canada to patriate the  Constitution and give it an amending 
formula, because the 33 Fathers of Confederation had not thought 
of giving it one. Jean Lesage and Jacques-Yvan Morin, and others 
after them, felt sections 91 and 92 had to be reviewed first, before 
the question of patriating the Constitution was dealt with. This then 
is the first thrust, which remains extremely important today, and, 
obviously, we can see we are a long way from it with Bill C-110.
<P>
	The second and possibly the most important thrust-and that is 
why I referred to the man who, in a way, is like the father of the 
Bloc Quebecois, namely André Laurendeau, who, you may recall, 
was elected to the National Assembly in 1944. André Laurendeau 
took up Prime Minister Pearson's challenge-to whom some 
people do not hesitate to liken our current Prime Minister-and 
quit <I>Le Devoir</I> in the early 1960s to co-chair the 
Laurendeau-Dunton commission.
<P>
	This royal commission is no doubt the true testament to Quebec 
nationalism. For the first time in a constitutional document-and I 
am referring here to the preliminary report tabled in 1965, 
commonly called the white paper-André Laurendeau and his 
fellow members of the commission urged English Canada to 
recognize the co-existence of two nations in Canada. There is a 
sentence in the white paper that is a important as it is short, on 
which I wrote my graduate thesis, and I would like to quote it 
today. André Laurendeau was truly a visionary when he said: ``Out 
of disappointment will come the irreparable''.
<P>
	Of course, the irreparable is Quebec's sovereignty. Around 1965, 
sovereignty was in a latent, embryonic state in Quebec. Now, 30 
years later, 30 years after André Laurendeau tabled his white paper, 
we are debating a bill introduced by a Liberal government who will 
not even recognize Quebec as a nation. That is what is so tragic in 
all this. No constitutional talks can take place without first 
recognizing that, in this country, we have two nations, which are 
equal in fact and in law. We must work to ensure that these two 
nations can start talking.
<P>
	For those who belong the same school of thought as me, the best 
way to open a dialogue is, of course, sovereignty or a 
sovereignty-partnership formula. Those from another school of 
thought, which I respect and who won the October referendum, 
think that something can be worked out within the federal system. 
There is something that I cannot figure out about federal 
strategists. We cannot begrudge the current Minister of Justice. He 
is a rather nice man, a distinguished mind, a rising star in the 
Liberal camp. We cannot hold a grudge against him for not fully 
grasping the finer nuances of the constitutional debate.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister, who has been a member of this 
House since 1967-long before you, Mr. Speaker, became a 
member, if I am not mistaken-who has been a key player and a 
key witness in this constitutional review  process, think that some 
Quebecers will be satisfied with an administrative bill that will not, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17099"> 17099 </A></B>
<P>
of course, be entrenched in the Constitution, and that only offers a 
possible right of veto.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	A veto is, of course, important. We used it when Jean Lesage was 
tempted to accept the Fulton-Favreau formula requiring the 
unanimous consent of the provinces, and when Robert Bourassa 
was also tempted to accept the 1971 Victoria Charter, which is 
different from what we have before us today and which is 
sometimes compared with what is being offered today. As you may 
recall, Victoria would have given back to Quebec all of its powers 
over language, as the Pepin-Robarts Commission did a little later.
<P>
	How can anyone on the side of the government majority think 
that any Quebecer-whether on the Daniel Johnson team, on the 
Jacques Parizeau team, or with any lobby in Quebec-will say yes 
to a proposal like this one?
<P>
	The government has put itself in a very awkward and 
unenlightened position, in my opinion, by forcing the loyal 
opposition, one of the best oppositions this government has ever 
known, to say no. I know that the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell will understand that the minimum 
requirements for reviewing the Constitution cannot be any less than 
what was proposed in the Meech Lake accord.
<P>
	As you know, the Meech Lake accord contained five minimum 
requirements. Personally, I would never have voted for the Meech 
Lake accord, because even though it was a bare minimum, it did 
not provide the essential, namely Quebec's recognition as a nation 
and, more importantly, it did not provide any additional power to 
Quebec, while also being tragically silent on the language issue.
<P>
	But let us presume that everyone is acting in good faith and is 
trying to engage in a dialogue. How can the Prime Minister and his 
team possibly think that Bill C-110 is adequate, considering that 
the five conditions included in Meech were an absolute minimum?
<P>
	Meech also sought to ensure that the Supreme Court played a 
role in a balanced Canadian federation, and therefore, to restore 
that balance, Quebec must be represented by judges who reflect its 
civil law tradition.
<P>
	There was also the idea, which is probably the most important 
one for us but is also important for English Canada, that the federal 
spending power had to be clearly defined, since a number of 
experts agree that there is a direct link between the use of that 
spending power by the federal government and the current deficit.
<P>
	I respectfully submit, out of respect for the past, that if those 
whom I named were here now, including Claude Ryan-and I do 
not know how he is perceived by this  government-none of them, 
who all sought to protect Quebec's interests and future, would 
agree with Bill C-110. I hope the government reviews its position 
and comes up with something more substantial, so as to launch a 
true dialogue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> I am 
pleased to speak this afternoon on this three part initiative of the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	The first is to provide a regional veto to the four regions of the 
country, which is of course in addition to the veto the provinces 
already have. This initiative will also acknowledge Quebec as a 
distinct society and will, of course, be in line with the 
government's indication of its intent to step up efforts to reduce 
duplication. Today we have seen the Minister of Human Resources 
Development take the first step in that direction since the Prime 
Minister's announcement.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Of course, long before the Prime Minister's announcement, our 
government had already begun these initiatives and, since we 
became the government, a number of administrative agreements 
have been signed with all of the provinces, Quebec included, but of 
course there have been very few of those since the separatists came 
into power in Quebec.
<P>
	I would like to start by stating my position for you within this 
debate at this time. As a number of hon. members are aware, I am a 
Quebecer by birth who represents an Ontario riding. I have served 
at the municipal, provincial and federal levels, and have been in 
office at one level or another for over 19 years now. I am one of 
those who voted for the Meech Lake accord and the Charlottetown 
accord. I will vote for Bill C-110 and the recognition of Quebec as 
a distinct society, which is fully justified.
<P>
	We heard certain separatist members complain that the Meech 
Lake accord had not been adopted and denounce the fact. Yet, some 
of them-in particular their House leader-had voted against the 
Meech Lake accord and the Charlottetown accord. Other 
separatists say they have resigned themselves to making do without 
it, often forgetting that they had campaigned and voted against the 
Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	In a few days, if I may make a prediction, if these people do not 
understand more than they do today, they will vote against Bill 
C-110, against distinct society, confirming in so doing they are not 
interested in progress and do not want Quebecers to improve their 
situation. They want no such thing, they simply want to build up an 
empire for themselves and act as emperors, but they will never 
succeed in doing so.
<P>
	Members opposite, the Bloc members and to some extent, I am 
sad to say, certain Reform members-I repeat to some extent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17100"> 17100 </A></B>
<P>
because they do all think like  this-seem to be wanting to put an 
end to our country as we know it.
<P>
	Why is that? We live in a country that, four years out of five, was 
described as the best in the world by the United Nations. Members 
opposite are shaking their head, saying it is not enough. I 
personally heard the opposition leader saying Canada was a kind of 
experiment which had failed from his point of view. According to 
whom? While even the United Nations cannot find a better place in 
the world, members opposite want us to emulate another country. 
Which country will we imitate? Even the UN has not been able to 
find it yet. But the members opposite claim that this is all 
worthless. They say they have a better solution.
<P>
	As I said, I live in Ontario, I am a Franco-Ontarian by adoption, 
even though I was born in Quebec. I am still a French Canadian. I 
must tell you that the way the members opposite refer to the rest of 
Canada which they call ``English Canada''-I heard the member 
for Maisonneuve use this phrase today in his speech-is a real 
insult to my constituents. I have told you repeatedly, this 
expression is insulting.
<P>
	When francophones outside Quebec showed up for a 
demonstration they had dubbed ``Poof, the francophones!'', 
mimicking the member for Rimouski-Témiscouata, it was in part 
to denounce the fact that we, the one million francophones, such as 
the member for Nickel-Belt, myself and all the others who live 
elsewhere in Canada, were called English Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	This is the way the members opposite want to portray Canada: an 
entirely francophone Quebec and the rest of Canada completely 
anglophone. This is the way they look at it and its is wrong.
<P>
	The member for Argenteuil-Papineau, who is in front of me, 
knows full well that when we go to the shopping centre in 
Hawkesbury, the people we can hear speaking English probably 
come from his riding. In our area, anglophones are by definition 
Quebecers from the Harrington and Lost River areas who come to 
shop, and francophones are Ontarians.
<P>
	That is our reality. Does the Bloc tell us about that million of 
Quebecers whose first language is not French? Does it tell us about 
Franco-Ontarians and francophones outside Quebec? Bloc 
members say that we have disappeared. They said: ``Poof, the 
francophones outside Quebec!'' No, the Bloc members will not 
make us disappear. They will not.
<P>
	The worst insult I heard in all my career in this House was the 
day when the leader of the Bloc Quebecois went to Acadia to tell 
Acadians that he would build schools for them when Quebec would 
be a different country. What an insult for Acadians who have 
survived and grown for 200 years in this country. And how 
pretentious of the Leader of the Opposition, who thought he could 
go to  Acadia to tell Acadians a thing or two. Well, they fixed him. 
They told him to go back home. That is what some Acadians said, 
rightly so, and the members opposite know it. And 
Franco-Ontarians told the member for Rimouski-Témiscouata 
and the others: You do not want to have anything to do with us 
francophones outside Quebec and your dialogue proves it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Why is it that the United States has twice as many people of 
francophone origin than Canada and virtually none of them speak it 
any more? Why is that?
<P>
	Could it be that Canada has been a country where the French 
language has been able to develop quite well and that the reverse 
was true in the United States? Could it be as well that we as 
francophones living outside Quebec, and I am one of them, have 
been able to have our language develop because there is a critical 
mass of francophones in my country known as Quebec? Yes, that is 
the reason.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And today, if we were in Louisiana and we were 60 years old and 
more, we would be speaking French to each other. If we were in 
Louisiana and we were 40 years old, we would say a few words in 
French. And if we were 20 years old and someone would talk to us 
in French, we would say: ``What?''
<P>
	That is what happened in Louisiana; the French language 
survived for 200 years only to disappear with the television era. But 
that did not happen in Canada. I still speak French to my children 
and they will speak French to their children. Why? Because we 
stayed in a tolerant country, a country where both languages and 
both cultures were able to develop and a country-

	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-241, an 
act to amend the Income Tax Act (child support payments), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to stand in the House 
today to speak to my private member's Bill C-241, an act to amend 
the Income Tax Act so that child support payments are not taxable 
as income for the recipient. As well, it includes child support 
payments within the meaning of earned income for the purposes of 
child support deductions.
<P>
	It is important to ensure that a tax free child support payment to 
the custodial parent is initiated and that a more appropriate and 
limited tax credit is equitably distributed to child support payers. I 
do not suggest what the specific credit should be. I believe it more 
appropriately falls within the purview of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Bill C-241 is an issue which is very important to me and one 
with which I have been associated for a number of years. It became 
clear to me that the taxation of child support payments was a 
significant concern to many people in the riding of Nepean and to 
individuals across the country. I continue to receive letters from 
many people who are experiencing great difficulty as a result of the 
existing tax laws.
<P>
	On February 23, 1994 my Motion No. 14 was placed on the 
Order Paper, deemed votable, debated and adopted on May 30, 
1994. The motion at that time read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the Income 
Tax Act so that child support payments are no longer considered taxable income 
for recipients.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	However, the government of the day has still not responded to 
the motion.
<P>
	The 1994 budget recognized perceived inequalities in the tax 
treatment of child support and committed itself to exploring ways 
to improve the system to ensure, first and foremost, that the needs 
of children are met. However,  as of this date, as I said, the 
government has still not moved on it.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice indicated his intention to address the 
issue of child support guidelines and enforcement. I will be looking 
forward to hearing from him. Bill C-241 only asks for changes to 
the treatment of income tax for child support which falls under the 
purview of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The current tax treatment of child support payments makes a 
very complicated issue out of one that should be as straightforward 
and as simple as possible. It is most important that it is children 
who now bear the immediate consequence because the current 
system is not providing the effect it was designed to produce. If the 
current policy is not changed it is the children who will go on 
paying the consequences every day, not just in some cases and not 
by accident but deliberately because of our failure to redesign an 
outdated tax mechanism.
<P>
	This is not just a tax issue but one of wider social justice that 
affects the well-being of Canada's children and of Canada's future.
<P>
	The tax treatment of child support payments allows a payer to 
deduct the full amount of the payment from his income while the 
recipient must include the full amount in hers. The policy has been 
criticized as discriminatory to women because it places an unfair 
tax burden on the custodial parent, and the custodial parent is 
usually the woman and the one who is responsible for the children.
<P>
	How this situation evolved can be partially explained by 
historical changes in the patterns of the lives of men and women in 
Canada over the past half century. The current tax treatment of 
child support was initiated in the 1940s, probably just after World 
War II, and reflects the social realities of that time.
<P>
	There are historical reasons for the bill. From 1940 to 1992 there 
have been significant changes in society and government policy 
which lead to the question of whether or not this tax policy also 
requires revision.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	When the current policy was developed it was designed to 
provide relief to the taxpayer burdened with both a post-war 
increase in taxes and the obligation of spousal and child support. 
The father was typically the sole wage earner and the primary 
taxpayer in the separated family. It was logical at that time that tax 
relief be targeted to him.
<P>
	In the current reality both parents are considered individual 
within our tax structure today. Even those who do not pay taxes file 
their own tax returns to have access to benefits delivered through 
the income tax system. Most lone parents also have paid work and 
pay taxes on their own earned income whether or not they receive 
support.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17102"> 17102 </A></B>
<P>
	The labour force participation of all women has been steadily 
increasing, including women with children. In 1988, 62.2 per cent 
of women with partners and a child under five years of age were 
in the labour force and 73 per cent for those with children aged 
six to fifteen years. With lower fertility rates and a later age of 
first birth, women are spending more time in the paid labour force. 
This allows women to establish some earning power before 
interruption for child birth and care.
<P>
	The labour force participation of women who are lone parents is 
also increasing. In 1988 the rate was 51 per cent for those with 
children under five and 72.3 per cent for those with children six to 
fifteen.
<P>
	While women are increasingly participating in the labour force 
they are still concentrated in lower paying and less secure forms of 
employment. The wage gap is narrowing extremely slowly. Canada 
is not narrowing the gap as quickly as many other industrialized 
nations. For example, women's relative wage in Canada in 1990 
was 67.6 per cent of men's, compared with Australia at 87.9 per 
cent and France at 81.8 per cent.
<P>
	Due to changing economic conditions most families now require 
the labour force participation of women. Even for two-parent 
families two incomes are needed to maintain a single household. 
Upon divorce family resources are often inadequate to continue to 
meet children's needs as two households must be maintained.
<P>
	Most lone parents continue to be solely or primarily responsible 
for the financial needs of children. One of the key reasons for this 
phenomenon is the high rate of default on child support awards, 
estimated in the province of Ontario to be disgracefully around the 
75 per cent level.
<P>
	There have been numerous policy changes since 1940 which 
have had a significant impact on the situation of women, families 
with children and lone parent families in particular. In 1970 the 
report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women 
documented women's economic and social disadvantage in Canada 
for the first time. Since 1976 there has been a federal policy 
commitment to examine the impact of programs and policies on 
women. This was reinforced when the charter of rights and 
freedoms came into force.
<P>
	Better research and data collection as a result of this work 
continues to identify and describe the feminization of poverty and 
its direct relation to the unpaid work involved in raising children 
and other tasks related to human maintenance.
<P>
	There has been decreasing support for families with children 
through the tax transfer system over the past two decades. For 
example, the value of deductions and credits for children as a 
proportion of income has been steadily reduced. The reduction of 
the number of tax brackets to three and other changes to deduction 
and  credits have all had an impact on families and on the tax 
treatment of child support.
<P>
	Divorce law has evolved from a system based on fault to a 
no-fault system. Under the no-fault system there is an increasing 
tendency for support orders to focus on the children with the 
expectation that women, even those who are not in the labour force, 
will become self-supporting in an unreasonably short period of 
time.
<P>
	There is growing political support for the plight of lone parents. 
Provincial governments are trying to crack down on non-custodial 
parents, usually fathers, who are not making their support 
payments to their children. Growing welfare rolls have spurred the 
search for alternatives and particularly the need to make fathers 
responsible for their children.
<P>
	The women's movement, in combination with economic and 
policy changes, has reinforced women's need for and right to both 
paid work and a sharing of family responsibilities. My previous 
comments highlighted several significant changes in Canadian 
society from the forties to the nineties. Individuals and families are 
in very different situations today than in the forties. Given these 
changes it is timely to ask whether our tax policy on child support 
is still meeting the original goals of providing tax relief to the tax 
burdened and encouraging the payment of child support.
<P>
	My bill is intended to bring the tax treatment of child support 
payments into the context of the world we live in today. I am 
cognizant of the increasing levels of child poverty. Any and all 
changes considered must focus on this fact as the guiding principle.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	The general consensus is that the non-custodial parent benefits 
from the current tax policy, not the children. Presently the total 
child support award rarely specifies the total needs of the child and 
the specific amounts needed to compensate for the tax owing on 
this amount.
<P>
	Actual evidence on the current levels of child support 
demonstrates that average support payments are low and would rise 
considerably with the introduction of guidelines based on actual 
expenditures on children. If the support award is not high enough to 
meet the children's needs, it cannot compensate for the tax owing. 
In practice the tax system further reduces the already inadequate 
amount available for the children.
<P>
	Even if a support award is adequate to meet the children's needs 
calculating the gross up, which is the amount set aside for tax 
purposes, and deciding how to split any tax saving are 
extraordinarily complex.
<P>
	In the Thibaudeau case the Federal Court of Appeal ruled invalid 
under the charter of rights and freedoms the requirement that the 
parent who has custody of a child include child support payments 
as income. Since the decision did not deal with the deductibility of 
child  support by the payer, it left in question how the tax will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17103"> 17103 </A></B>
<P>
paid on income directed to child support. Following the finding of a 
Federal Court of Appeal, the attorney general asked that the 
Thibaudeau decision be suspended while an expedited appeal was 
brought before the Supreme Court of Canada. On May 25, the 
supreme court handed down its decision and supported the existing 
provisions.
<P>
	The result of the appeal, the court ruled five to two, was that it is 
not unconstitutional to require the custodial parent who receives 
child support payments to pay the taxes on that money. However 
the question of taxation of child support was not totally resolved by 
the supreme court decision.
<P>
	Madam Justice Beverly McLachlin of the supreme court was one 
of the two dissenting judges in that decision. She wrote in her 
dissenting opinion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The impugned taxation scheme imposes a burden on separated or divorced 
custodial parents which it does not impose on separated or divorced 
non-custodial parents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The custodial parent must include child support payments from which she 
gains no personal benefit. The non-custodial parent may deduct support 
payments from his taxable revenue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The inequality between the custodial and non-custodial spouse is 
exacerbated by the fact that the latter enjoys an automatic and absolute right of 
deduction of support payments from personal income, while the former's 
ability to offset the increase in her taxes by obtaining an adjustment of support is 
unpredictable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Not only must the custodial parent request any adjustment from the court but 
it is not always certain that the court will correctly assess the tax impact or will 
award a sufficient amount to enable the recipient to discharge her additional 
burden.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The logic of a deduction inclusion scheme is further called into question by 
the fact that our society strongly encourages women to obtain financial 
self-sufficiency and, in pursuit of that essential objective, to increase their 
income. The higher the income of the custodial parent, the greater will be her 
tax rate and the more she will be penalized by the requirement of including the 
amount of child support in computing her own taxable income.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the premises on which the logic of the deduction inclusion scheme 
rests, that custodial parents are generally subject to a lower tax rate than those 
who pay the child support, is less and less in accord with present reality and 
undermines the importance our society places on women attaining financial 
self-sufficiency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I might add that if we take families where the husband, the wife 
and the children remain as the family unit, when the husband gives 
money to the wife to support the children she is not taxed on it. Nor 
is he given a deduction. The way it is set up is unfair to the whole 
family unit.
<P>
	Following the Thibaudeau decision the government stated its 
intention to announce a comprehensive approach to reforming the 
child support system including guidelines to determine the 
amounts, the tax treatment  of payments and the enforcement of 
child support orders.
<P>
	Let me refer to why the current system is not working. 
According to research done by Karen Cooper and Ellen Zweibel on 
the current system of deduction inclusion, there is a gap between 
tax theory and family experience. The deduction inclusion as 
designed is expected to produce an overall tax savings for the 
ultimate benefit of the children in divorced and separated families. 
Custodial mothers have made it clear the current system 
undermines their ability to support their children and increases 
their vulnerability to poverty.
<P>
	Fathers from the highest income group obtain the most tax 
savings when paying support to custodial mothers who have not yet 
fully entered the job market. Little or no overall tax savings accrue 
when separated parents are either both low income earners or are 
both moderate income earners. In a minority of cases, the 
provisions can even have an opposite effect.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	SCOPE, which is an Ottawa based support group for custodial 
mothers, in its report to the parliamentary task force examining the 
current system of taxation of child support payments, described 
how the current system is impacting on the lives of custodial 
parents. I will quote from the submission:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How they have had to apply for bank loans, borrow money from friends and 
family, cash in RRSPs, or have been subject to collection proceedings from 
unpaid taxes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, if the non-custodial parent doesn't make full child support 
payments, the custodial mother must still pay a portion of the partial payment in 
income tax-Although she cannot meet all the children's budgeted-for 
expenses from the partial support payment, what she does receive shrinks even 
further because of the income tax burden. How, after struggling for months and 
years to get by without full support payments, when they do manage to collect 
the support arrears, the tax owed on those arrears is often greater than they 
would have been if the amount had been paid on time.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women in its 
submission to the same task force stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In summary, the government's main policy justification fails custodial 
mothers and their children. Rather than providing greater resources for 
children, the current tax policy puts greater pressure on the custodial mother. 
First, she must bargain with the non-custodial father and/or his lawyer for an 
income tax ``gross-up''. There is no guarantee the income tax ``gross-up'' will 
be included: in some cases he does not have enough tax savings to pay a 
``gross-up''; in other cases, he may not agree to it or the judge may order a lower 
amount.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whenever the custodial mother is unsuccessful in getting a fully 
tax-augmented child support award, she must stretch her already limited budget to 
cover the income taxes. When the non-custodial father makes only a partial 
payment, the custodial mother is left without enough funds to meet the children's 
budgeted needs and yet the already insufficient amount she received is still further 
reduced by income taxes. For those  important reasons, the Canadian Advisory </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17104"> 17104 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Council on the Status of Women strongly recommends repeal of the current 
inclusion/deduction provisions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In summary, the movement to reform the income tax treatment 
of child support has been ongoing since the 1970s. It received 
significant attention in the 1990s for a number of reasons. The 
work of the federal-provincial-territorial family law committee 
which over a period of almost four years oversaw original research 
on child support in Canada, reviewed the research results and 
consulted widely with Canadians representing custodial and 
non-custodial parents and with experts in the child support area.
<P>
	My previous motion that I mentioned earlier in the House of 
Commons has essentially raised the visibility of the issue. The 
Thibaudeau case has further brought attention to this matter.
<P>
	The parliamentary task force was headed by the Secretary of 
State for the Status of Women who is in the House today. I wish to 
comment on the good work that she and two of our colleagues on 
the task force did in their travels across the country, holding round 
table discussions. The input they received was heart rending, 
emotional and traumatic. This has further raised the profile and the 
importance of the need for change.
<P>
	It is my hope that the debate in the House of Commons today 
will once again move this issue to the forefront. To quote C. Brock 
Chisholm from a speech in Washington, C.D. in 1945:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most important thing in the world today is the bringing up of children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Designing fairer, simpler systems of providing tax relief is 
essential in order to respond to the needs of children whose parents 
live apart. We must remember this as we draft the laws which 
impact on our children. Their welfare must determine our 
priorities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in this debate on Bill C-241 on behalf of the official 
opposition and I would like to start by congratulating the hon. 
member for putting this bill forward for this House to consider. I 
might add that it is unfortunate that it cannot be voted on.
<P>
	Such is the will of the members. Her intentions were 
commendable, but at the same time, this goes to show how the 
government, by refusing to make this bill a votable item, is really 
only paying lip service to the idea behind it. The hon. member 
ought to be commended for her good intentions, but this goes to 
show at the same time that this government does not care too much 
for her initiative.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-241 is, in my opinion, very positive from the point of 
view of its title: an act to amend the Income Tax Act (child support 
payments).
<P>
	Interestingly enough, of all the forms of child support, the one 
that immediately comes to mind is, of course, alimony. There has 
been a debate on this issue, as we know.
<P>
	In Quebec, I can think of Mrs. Thibaudeau's case. This lady took 
her case all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada to try to make 
the point that the parent, generally the mother, who has custody of 
the children after a divorce, should not have to declare a portion of 
the amount received for child support on his or her income tax 
return, because, for the non custodial parent paying support, this 
amount is exempt from tax, it is deductible.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that there are more women than men in 
this situation, since, as we know, 85 per cent of single parents 
facing this kind of situation are women.
<P>
	We must also remember something else. In spite of the debates 
in this House on child poverty, as well as the laudable initiatives of 
members from all parties to make life more comfortable for 
children, one out of every five children in Canada lives in poverty. 
This is a serious problem.
<P>
	The government often boasts about our country being the best in 
the world. Yet, one Canadian child in five lives in poverty. As you 
know, children are not the only ones living in poverty. If they are 
poor, it is because their parents, their mother or their father are 
poor. Poor children are not all orphans. Their families are in very 
dire straits.
<P>
	The measure proposed by the hon. member is interesting, 
because the person who has custody would not have to declare the 
money received for support, thus making it tax exempt. We, the 
official opposition, are in favour of that.
<P>
	However, when we listen and talk to people, and when we have 
debates in this House, we realize that we have to be careful. That 
initiative must be part of a comprehensive strategy, because, taken 
separately, it might incite judges to take into account the fact that 
the spouse who pays for support can no longer deduct that amount 
for tax purposes, and thus lower the level of that support. We must 
ensure that the person receiving support payments is not penalized 
by getting considerably less money.
<P>
	This proposal must be part of a comprehensive policy. We must 
avoid any boomerang effect and ensure that we do not end up 
penalizing the person in charge of the family. That would defeat the 
purpose.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17105"> 17105 </A></B>
<P>
	In Canada, we used to have family allowances. Now we have 
child tax benefits. I find it deplorable that people who work, unlike 
in Quebec, cannot benefit from tax deductions for children.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Many parents in Quebec believe that, and rightly so. They want 
some incentives to have children. They are looking at the 
government for measures to help them take good care of their 
families, while we are in a situation, as everyone knows, where the 
population is aging, the birth rate is dropping, a larger segment of 
the population is becoming more impoverished and the social 
inequities are growing because of various economic considerations 
which I do not have time to list in the ten minutes I have. Last, we 
have very few measures which encourage young Canadians to have 
a family.
<P>
	Also, we are considering this motion the very same day the 
Minister of Human Resources Development is introducing changes 
to the Unemployment Insurance Act in order to further restrict 
eligibility to UI benefits for new claimants or people who have not 
been working for a very long time, without taking many measures 
to really create jobs. Everywhere we look, there seems to be an 
impending threat, not only a perceived threat, but in some areas, a 
real one.
<P>
	In Ontario, the government is thinking of increasing tuition fees 
and of decreasing education subsidies. So, we see in the end that 
the young people in particular-and I remind the House that I am 
the BQ critic for training and youth-feel like they are continually 
caught in a stranglehold. Under such circumstances, how can we 
blame the young people who choose to wait to have children, since 
their economic situation is becoming increasingly difficult?
<P>
	I want to congratulate the hon. member for Nepean for a very 
praiseworthy motion. However, I cannot help but notice that the 
government, especially this past week, has been considering 
motions, resolutions and even a bill on such issues as the distinct 
society, the veto, and so on. I can see that the hon. member opposite 
is serious and well-intentioned. But, in reality, I deplore the fact 
that this Parliament seems to become more and more a place for 
lofty speeches, for rhetoric-and I contribute to that by making one 
myself today-a place where the government seems less and less 
willing to do anything but look for ways to cut its spending, more 
often than not on the back of the disadvantaged. Who are the 
disadvantaged? Often they are single parents, women, who 
represent a large percentage of the population, as well as children, 
since one in five children lives in poverty. I do not see anything in 
this motion that will correct this situation. It is a good measure, but 
we can see that there is a lack of willingness to do something on the 
part of the government.
<P>
	I hope that the government will soon leave the rhetoric aside and 
start looking at positive ways of encouraging  young people and 
others to start a family. In spite of that, I do not want to be seen as 
being too strongly in favour of pro-natalist measures because 
women have the right to decide for themselves if they want 
children or not and how many. I do not question this fundamental 
right, but it is a question we must ask ourselves from a social 
viewpoint. We must take the necessary measures and soon.
<P>
	I am a baby boomer, I am 48 years old, and here is what might 
happen to some of us.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	If there are not enough young people entering the labour force, 
paying taxes and contributing to private pension plans, the people 
coming after us may not receive a pension. This may even happen 
to us, as we see that old age pensions, for those who are now under 
65, are among the measures being considered. If we do not have 
enough children and if these children do not start life in a secure 
environment so that they have an incentive to continue improving 
our society, I fear the worst.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on Bill C-241, an act to amend the 
Income Tax Act with respect to child support payments.
<P>
	I wish to commend the member for Nepean for her persistence 
and her efforts in support of this bill we are debating today. The 
issue of child support payments and taxation has been festering for 
many years without an adequate response from either this 
government or its predecessor.
<P>
	One parent families are a result of a breakdown in marriage in a 
family. To put this into perspective, in 1991 300,000 Canadian 
parents received child support. The total bill was some $1.65 
billion. It involved some 35,000 children in support and custody 
cases. Further, statistics indicate that 95 per cent of the custodial 
and single parents are mothers.
<P>
	The Reform Party has recognized the need to fundamentally 
address this issue. Our family task force, which I chair, carefully 
considered and developed our position on child support payments 
and taxation in addition to addressing some other related issues.
<P>
	Our motivation for developing a position on this issue is the 
function of our concern about the family and recognizing the need 
for strengthening it for this generation and future generations of 
Canadians. We believe the family is the fundamental building 
block of our society. The family is the fundamental institution that 
transfers and protects our values and culture. The family provides 
our society with the necessary stability needed for our prosperity 
and measured progress.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17106"> 17106 </A></B>
<P>
	Parents and children are the basis for the family. Children can 
in no way be considered apart from or distinct from their parents. 
Children exist through and thrive on the relationship that exists 
between a mother and father. Thus the well-being of a child is 
directly related to the continued shared responsibility. I believe 
this broader picture of the responsibility of both parents for their 
children must be considered if a positive solution is to be found 
to child support payments and family relationships are to be 
strengthened.
<P>
	As I mentioned before, the Reform Party has developed a rather 
comprehensive position on this issue. We addressed the issue of 
taxation, the level of support through guidelines, and enforcement 
and compliance with maintenance orders.
<P>
	On the issue of taxation, child support payments should not be 
considered earned income subject to taxation. The current tax 
regime in paragraph 56(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act does exactly 
that. I ask, where else in the tax system does such an approach 
exist? Child support payments are the fulfilment of an obligation of 
parents to their children regardless of family status. It is money 
directed from a parent for the well-being of his or her child. The 
money that is received for child support is not earned income. The 
federal government should therefore not tax these payments as 
though they were income.
<P>
	This can be illustrated by contrasting child support payments and 
alimony. Child support payments are intended specifically for the 
children and not the mother. Alimony payments, on the other hand, 
are payments received as income for support of the divorced 
spouse. This distinction is a crucial one, one that must be 
recognized.
<P>
	The effect of the tax system is compounded by the deficiency in 
the court system. The levels in support awards do not adequately 
reflect and meet the needs of the custodial parent and children, or 
perhaps the non-custodial parent.
<P>
	With these considerations in mind, the Reform position, like Bill 
C-241, calls for revision of paragraph 56(1)(b) of the Income Tax 
Act that would strike payments received for child support from 
being considered as earned income and therefore eligible for 
taxation.
<P>
	The Reform proposal would also redirect revenues collected 
from the taxation of the non-custodial parent to those single-parent 
families and dual parent families and the children most in need 
through a complementary increase in the federal child tax benefit, 
which is to say it is directed to those in need.
<P>
	These positive and proactive measures will strengthen the 
circumstances and conditions of single parent families. They will 
also address the inequity the current  tax regime promotes in the tax 
treatment of intact and separated families.
<P>
	There is a broader issue of the current level of taxation that all 
Canadian families face. The reality is that the current tax burden 
upon the Canadian family is unjustifiably excessive and onerous. A 
1994 study on families and taxation found that the average family 
composed of two or more persons paid 46 per cent of their cash 
income to various levels of government.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Families cannot now survive on a single income. In 1967, 58 per 
cent of families were supported by a single income. In 1994 that 
figure has been forced to an historic low of 19 per cent, and it is not 
by choice. In a 1994 survey of family attitudes, 52 per cent of 
respondents agreed with the statement that it is not possible to 
support a family on one income any more. The same survey stated 
that 40 per cent of parents agreed that if they could afford to they 
would stay home with the kids, that they work because they need 
the money.
<P>
	Recognizing the needs of families and the pressures they face, 
Reform has developed another positive and proactive measure that 
will address the broader issue of taxation faced by Canadian 
families. The simplified tax proposal will provide some tax relief 
for Canadians, simplify the taxation system through the 
elimination of deductions, exemptions, and tax incentives, and in 
general promote more economic freedom for families. In 
particular, our proposal will provide a generous tax exemption for 
children to account for expenses parents incur in raising children. 
Such a provision will be particularly important for low income 
earners and single parent families.
<P>
	A second important issue related to child support payments in 
addition to taxation deals with a process for administering the issue 
of child support payments. Families and marriages often break 
down under acrimonious and adversarial circumstances. Many 
parents then resort to an adversarial court system. The current 
system essentially pits one parent against the other. This is not in 
the best interests of the parents and it is certainly not in the best 
interests of the children involved.
<P>
	Changes to the current system are urgently needed. The Reform 
proposal addresses this issue. We advocate the implementation of 
unified family courts. An important part of this proposal is the 
front end process of mediation and conflict resolution. The unified 
family court would also resolve the blended jurisdiction of family 
law, such as child support, custody, and access. Presently, 
jurisdiction for family issues is divided between levels of court at 
both federal and provincial levels. The development and 
implementation of the unified family court would better facilitate 
all aspects of family law by incorporating them under one roof.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17107"> 17107 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform proposal also addresses the issue of guidelines to 
determine the level of support awarded. When a family and 
marriage break down, courts are left to determine what the level 
of payments for child support should be. However, the problem 
has been, as my colleague has said, the inconsistency and 
sometimes unfairness of the level of support awarded. Such 
inconsistency is unfair to all concerned. To address this 
inconsistency, our proposal is based on well established legal 
principles of demonstrated need and ability to pay.
<P>
	In practical terms, Reform advocates the establishment of 
nationwide guidelines that will take into consideration the income, 
taxation, and parenting cost implications for both custodial and 
non-custodial parents. Nationwide guidelines would have the effect 
of standardizing the level of support awarded. In doing so they will 
do much more to ensure fairness for those in the situation.
<P>
	Finally, there is the issue of enforcement and compliance with 
maintenance orders. The present circumstances are abysmal. For 
example, in Quebec 25 per cent of non-custodial parents default in 
paying child support. The phenomenon of default is in part a 
function of the adversarial system I discussed earlier. A system that 
perpetuates acrimony and anger is a system that will fail.
<P>
	Reform's proposal addresses the issue of enforcement across 
provincial boundaries. We propose the use of the national registry. 
We will pursue studies to see if this could be co-ordinated through 
the income tax system. A registry of this type would improve the 
access to information and effective response desperately needed to 
improve compliance and enforcement of maintenance orders.
<P>
	In conclusion, the principle and concept of Bill C-241 is well 
founded, but more needs to be done to concretely tackle the root 
causes surrounding issues of child support. Although this bill 
addresses the issue of taxation, it does not consider this issue of the 
level of support and the crucial aspect of enforcement and 
compliance.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	The time for action has come. To foster the stability and 
prosperity for the next generation of parents, children and families, 
we need to start by reinforcing and strengthening decisions made in 
this present generation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first let me applaud the 
time, effort and extensive research that has been focused on 
women, on their families and particularly on the children of our 
country by the very important work that has been done by our 
colleague, the member for Nepean, in keeping the government 
focused on the true needs of Canada's children.
<P>
	I have listened with a great deal of interest to the two speeches 
by the opposition parties. It gives me a great  sense of hope that we 
will make the kind of enlightened decision that we have been 
working very hard for over the last number of months. We hope 
that when the changes are brought forward we will receive the kind 
of support for the interest and time that we have spent to find the 
right solutions.
<P>
	With respect to my friend from Nepean, I think the children of 
this land can thank her and I personally wish to thank her for 
bringing this really important and timely issue to our attention 
today.
<P>
	I share the concerns of the member for Nepean that Canada's 
child support system must be improved. In the spring of 1994, 
following the decision in the Thibaudeau case, which I think came 
down in May, our task force was organized, on the road and 
listening to groups by the end of June or the beginning of July. The 
government named this small task force to hear the views around 
this very complex and emotional question.
<P>
	My colleagues, the member for Winnipeg Centre and the 
member for Saskatoon-Humboldt, and I can tell the House that 
we spent hundreds and hundreds of hours in a very emotional 
setting hearing the views of parents, both men and women, 
grandparents, divorced fathers, divorced mothers, leaders of the 
legal profession, the accounting profession and those who were 
impacted, such as those in the social services and health network.
<P>
	The stories of these single parents, the child support payers and 
those parents in the intact families were so heart rending that one 
was moved to wonder how the family had been able to cope with 
the well-being of the child in many cases.
<P>
	We saw over 550 people. We received over 500 briefs. The 
information and views that were expressed shaped the report which 
I brought to cabinet from this task force on child support. I know, 
my cabinet colleagues know, and in particular the ministers 
concerned know that we need to present reforms.
<P>
	However, this is not an easy country to govern. It is vital that we 
have co-operation and collaboration. We have been working on 
that. I can guarantee that we will have that commitment to change 
for the support system. We have been working very hard, 
constructively and co-operatively over these many months. We 
have practically completed crafting the right and fair balance in the 
final analysis for the well-being of the children of this country.
<P>
	While the government has been very pleased to receive my 
colleagues' suggestions for improvements to the taxation of child 
support payments, we must also remember that a system of child 
support involves a number of elements. We must recognize the 
necessity of reforming the system as a whole, not just piecemeal. 
That means considering much needed changes to the amount 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17108"> 17108 </A></B>
<P>
awarded for child support and the method used to  enforce those 
support orders. Some of these issues fall, as members well know, 
under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	In addition to fair taxation for child support payments, the 
parents need a more equitable and simplified system for 
determining those child support awards. Under such a system, 
awards could generally be higher through more realistic guidelines 
to the courts based on the real cost of child rearing and the shared 
ability of both parents to pay. The variation in award levels in 
similar family circumstances could therefore be greatly reduced. 
Frankly, many of the inequities could also be eliminated.
<P>
	Compliance with court ordered support payments also needs to 
be improved. It is a sad fact that approximately 60 per cent of 
support orders are not obeyed. I find that totally abhorrent in the 
interests of the children and also because it is an abuse of our legal 
system. That means many single mothers in Canada receive no 
support payments at all for their children. The cost to society is 
unfair as many of the families have to resort to welfare. That is 
unfair for the rest of country.
<P>
	Our government is committed to bringing forward a 
comprehensive policy solution which will address each aspect of 
the child support equation: awards, enforcement, and the taxation 
of child support payments. We recognize that the taxation of child 
support payments is perceived as unfair. The rules give a tax 
deduction to the payer, usually the father, while the custodial 
parent, usually the mother, pays taxes on the payments and he or 
she, as the case may be, also bears the partial cost of those 
supports.
<P>
	This whole issue is seen as accentuating the problem of poverty 
particularly among single mothers and is seen as unfair to intact 
families. We also recognize that some changes are necessary in the 
complete package.
<P>
	This government is close to completing its work on child support 
reforms. We propose to introduce guidelines to increase the award 
levels. We will put forward a program to improve the enforcement 
of support orders. We are also completing our review of the tax 
treatment of child support payments. Our objective is to reform the 
system for child support so that it is fair, consistent across the land 
and reflects the best interests of the children wherever they live.
<P>
	The second facet of Bill C-241 consists of amending the Income 
Tax Act so that it includes child support payments within the 
meaning of ``earned income'' for the purposes of the child care 
expense deduction.
<P>
	Allow me to explain the rationale behind the provisions of the 
Income Tax Act with respect to the child care side of the issue, 
particularly with regard to child care expenses. The purpose of the 
child care expense deduction is to recognize for tax purposes the 
child care expenses that taxpayers must incur in order to earn 
income, to attend a recognized educational  institution full time, or 
to take a vocational training course.
<P>
	This deduction is a way for the tax system to acknowledge that 
these taxpayers have a lower capacity to pay taxes than other 
taxpayers who have identical incomes but do not have child care 
expenses. With the changing definition of family and because there 
are families of a variety of shapes, notwithstanding that we must 
have that fairness principle in there and recognize that the family is 
the basis of society.
<P>
	In a sense the child care expense deduction is a recognition of the 
contribution to our own future as a society through our children. 
Under this deduction the income used to pay for child care 
expenses is not taxable.
<P>
	Including child support payments in the definition of earned 
income for the purpose of a child care expense deduction would be 
a precedent that would make it difficult to deny the same treatment 
to persons in receipt of income from other sources.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	All of this information regarding the current tax system is to say 
that we need to examine changes to the taxation of child support in 
a comprehensive way. We need to look at not only the tax side, but 
also review the issue of enforcement and award levels. Any 
changes must be done in concert one with the other.
<P>
	Our challenge is to produce a package of changes in the tax rules, 
in the setting of awards and in the enforcement of support orders, as 
I have said, that is fair to all concerned and reflects what is best for 
our children. The government is acting to meet this challenge. We 
expect to announce specific changes very shortly. While I admire 
the intent of the member for Nepean and I agree with her 
wholeheartedly on the need for these changes, I simply remind this 
House that we need complete change and that we must get it right.
<P>
	Most important, when we are pursuing options to change the tax 
treatment of child support, we must consider only those options 
that go to the root of the problem. Unfortunately, the member's bill 
also includes additional changes to the taxation of child support 
which regretfully make it impossible for the government to support 
her bill without reservations at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to stand in the 
House today and speak to Bill C-241 brought forward by the hon. 
member representing the riding of Nepean.
<P>
	I was disappointed to hear the previous member speak on behalf 
of our government. She was speaking of the great intent of the 
finance department and saying that we must get it right, that we 
have to take time. Today in this House new legislation for 
employment was tabled. Sometimes we have to redo legislation. It 
is very  important that we move on this and I do not want to see us 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17109"> 17109 </A></B>
<P>
delay. We need to move quickly to amend the Income Tax Act so 
that support payments for children are no longer considered taxable 
income for the recipients.
<P>
	Children are our most valuable resource, the most precious asset 
of our country. I am in favour of investing in their future. All 
people must realize that by investing in our children we are 
investing in our own future. Failure to do so will cost us dearly.
<P>
	Very often the causes of child poverty have been linked to family 
breakdown. Whatever the causes of child poverty it must be 
addressed. Principle 2 of the UN Declaration on the Rights of the 
Child states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The child shall enjoy special protection, and shall be given opportunities and 
facilities, by law and by other means, to enable him to develop physically, 
mentally, morally, spiritually and socially in a healthy and normal manner and 
in conditions of freedom and dignity. In the enactment of laws for this purpose, 
the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Child poverty in Canada is disgracefully high. More than one 
million children in our country live in poverty. These poor children 
have many unfair obstacles in the path of their lives. Many children 
of poverty will suffer more illness than other children. They will 
require more emergency food assistance and they are more likely to 
become drop-outs from our schools. These unfortunate children 
through no fault of their own can expect to have a shorter life span. 
These facts are unbelievable, sad, disgraceful and, I am sorry to 
say, true.
<P>
	I call on our Prime Minister, our cabinet and all members of the 
House to focus on one of the greatest tragedies in this country and 
one of the greatest tragedies of this century: the neglect of our 
greatest resource for the future, the children of Canada.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my hon. colleagues to look deeply 
into the hurting faces of some of our young children living in 
poverty and recognize their hurt. While I do call on all members of 
the House to focus more on child poverty in this country, I 
gratefully acknowledge that progress is being made in some areas.
<P>
	Today the Minister of Human Resources Development 
introduced a new employment system for Canadians. A family 
income supplement provides basic protection for low income 
families. Employment insurance claimants with children and a 
family income under $26,000 will be eligible for insurance benefits 
that top up and reflect their family circumstances. The family 
supplement will be better targeted to low income families and will 
deliver a larger benefit for those families who are most in need. 
This is a real step in the right direction.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	In most cases Canadian tax laws have created inequities between 
the payers and the recipients of child support. What other country 
treats the taxation of child support in  this way? The husband 
contributes money toward the welfare of his children while he is 
married and the wife is not penalized by additional tax burdens 
during this period. Therefore, why is there a difference between a 
parent paying for household necessities while living with their 
spouse and a parent who is living separate from their spouse who is 
still paying for the same household necessities? Child support 
payments are simply a continuation of a father's obligation to 
support his children when he is divorced. They certainly should not 
be taxed.
<P>
	The motion gives us an opportunity to make a significant 
difference in a meaningful way which will affect the lives of many 
children in Canada. The average child support order covers less 
than half of the cost of raising a child. Therefore, it is not fair or 
just to tax back a large percentage of support payments which are 
meant to clothe and feed our children. We as legislators in the 
House of Commons must stand up to introduce further measures of 
justice and fairness in our tax system, particularly as they relate to 
the future of our children.
<P>
	Loving parents will take desperate measures to care and provide 
for their children. Sacrifices are continually made by mothers. 
These desperate measures can be very costly to the mothers, to the 
children and to our country in the long run. Scars can be left on the 
parents for a long time. Scars of many kinds are left on the 
children.
<P>
	I again congratulate and thank the hon. member for Nepean for a 
commitment to this very important bill. I ask all members of the 
House to support the bill. It is a bill upon which we should move 
quickly.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
recognize there are only a few minutes left in the debate. I have 
spoken previously on this matter. I do not want to repeat what I said 
at that time, but I do want to reinforce what my hon. colleague has 
just said.
<P>
	The poverty of children costs us. As we look for ways to contain 
the cost of our medical system without reducing the quality and 
access to care, we have to remember that poor children are four 
times as likely to become seriously ill and to die. As we seek to 
keep children in school to improve our ability to compete on the 
international stage, we have to remember that poor children are 
four times as likely to drop out of school.
<P>
	Poverty costs us all. That is why I want to make this point. I have 
no question that we are going to implement the measure proposed 
in the bill, to not make child support payments taxable in the hands 
of the custodial parent. I simply urge the government to recognize 
that this measure will generate substantial amounts of revenue for 
the Government of Canada. We have to make the commitment to 
direct that money explicitly to alleviating the poverty of children.
<P>
	In 1991 the House adopted a unanimous resolution to eliminate 
child poverty by the year 2000. We are halfway  to that target. In 
fact, the rate of child poverty in Canada has increased rather than
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17110"> 17110 </A></B>
<P>
decreased. It is now 1.4 million children in Canada who are living 
in poverty, compared to one million when the House adopted the 
resolution.
<P>
	I rise today only to say to the government that when we generate 
more revenue from taxing child support payments, as they should 
be taxed in the hands of the income earner and not the custodial 
parent, that money should go nowhere but to the children of 
Canada.
<P>
