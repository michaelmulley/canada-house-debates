<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MEMBERFORCENTRALNOVA-SPEAKER'SRULING">MEMBER FOR CENTRAL NOVA-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am now ready to rule on the matter raised 
Tuesday last by the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway 
concerning the speech of the hon. member for Central Nova on 
September 20, 1994 during the debate on Bill C-41, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other acts in 
consequence thereof.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have carefully reviewed the representations of these hon. 
members. I also want to thank the Chief Government Whip and 
the hon. member for Lethbridge for their contributions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	From the comments that were made Tuesday and from the 
<I>Hansard</I> of September 20 there can be little doubt that there 
exists a profound and fundamental difference of opinion among 
members.
<P>
	It is evident from having reviewed <I>Hansard</I> that the opinions 
of the hon. member for Central Nova were stated during the cut 
and thrust of debate. Further, the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway did indeed have the opportunity to 
challenge, refute and question the hon. member on her speech, 
as did the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. This is 
the very reason for debate.
<P>
	It is not the role of the Chair to be the arbiter of opinion. 
Rather it is the role of the Chair to ensure that debate on any 
issue can proceed under the rules which the House has set for 
itself.
<P>
	Held against that standard I am satisfied that the words of the 
hon. member for Central Nova were not directed at any one 
individual or any member specifically. Rather, they were the 
hon. member's personal opinions on the matter. .
<P>
[Translation]
<P>
	I would refer hon. members to a ruling made by the Deputy 
Speaker on November 4, 1987, at page 10741 in the <I>Debates</I>. At 
that time, he said, in part that if remarks ``were not aimed at a 
particular member, the remarks are not unparliamentary''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My colleagues, paramount to our political and parliamentary 
systems is the principle of freedom of speech, a member's right 
to stand in this House unhindered to speak his or her mind. 
However when debate in the House centres on sensitive issues, 
as it often does, I would expect that members would always bear 
in mind the possible effects of their statements and hence be 
prudent in their tone and choice of words.

	The House resumed from September 28 consideration of the 
motion in relation to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill 
C-22, an act respecting certain agreements concerning the 
redevelopment and operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today with respect to the amendments made to 
Bill C-22 by the Senate.
<P>
	Bill C-22, respecting certain agreements concerning the 
redevelopment and operation of Terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport, proposes, among other things, 
immunity for the government from any legal action resulting 
from its disengagement vis-à-vis Pearson Development 
Corporation, with respect to the project to privatize this airport.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is entirely in favour of this provision of 
Bill C-22, and furthermore the position of our party on this issue 
is unequivocal; we are asking for a royal commission of inquiry 
to take a thorough look at the role played in this matter by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6372"> 6372 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian financial establishment and the Conservative and 
Liberal parties, as well as the lobbyists.
<P>
	In addition to clauses 7, 8 and 9 of Bill C-22, which free the 
government of all legal responsiblity regarding agreements 
made by the previous Conservative government with Pearson 
Development Corporation, subclause 10(1) states that subject to 
the approval of Cabinet ``if the Minister considers it appropriate 
to do so, the Minister may-enter into'' agreements to provide 
for the payment of damages.
<P>
	However, subclause 10(2) states, and I quote: ``No amount is 
payable under an agreement entered into under this section in 
relation to (a) any loss of profit, or (b) any fee paid for the 
purpose of lobbying a public office holder-''.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is, of course, opposed to the payment of 
any amount whatsoever to the Pearson Development 
Corporation; we are clear on this. We understand that the Liberal 
government, by opening the door to compensation in the form of 
agreements wishes in a roundabout way to reassure the friends 
of the regime, of whatever stripe.
<P>
	However, the action for damages that Pearson Development 
Corporation wants to institute is for $200 million in unrealized 
profits. This is unbelievable.
<P>
	Bill C-22-as we just saw-rejects this option under the 
pretext that the bill violates a basic legal principle, ``as it 
deprives the parties of their fundamental right to ask the courts 
to rule on their disputes with the government''. This right is 
enshrined in the constitution of nearly all civilized countries, 
but the attitude of Pearson Development Corporation clearly 
goes against any kind of basic social ethics.
<P>
	Such an attitude shows capitalistic greed worthy of 
unrestrained economic liberalism without any kind of 
protection for ordinary citizens. As far as I know, the right of a 
corporation to sue the government and the company it represents 
for unrealized profits is not enshrined in the constitutions of 
almost all civilized countries. This bill does not deny the right to 
sue the government; it simply applies to a specific case, a single 
corporation, a single project in depriving Pearson Development 
Corporation of the right to extort $200 million from the 
Canadian people. That is very clear.
<P>
	So, to use the same words as corporation officials, it is not a 
government attempt to put itself above the law. The Bloc 
Quebecois' position goes beyond simply defending Bill C-22. 
Our party is defending the very principle of democracy, that is, 
people's right to live in decent conditions, in a society that is 
well managed politically and economically and protected 
against any form of exploitation by capitalist or state enterprise.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	In this case, Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois is rising against 
Pearson Development Corporation's shameless attempts to dip 
into the public purse by invoking constitutional law.
<P>
	As for the Senate, its attitude in this matter is most deplorable 
and confirms the urgent need for Canadian society to get rid of 
this archaic institution and for Quebec society to withdraw from 
the federal system. The Upper House once again shows itself as 
clearly undemocratic by amending a bill designed to protect, 
albeit very incompletely, the interests of Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
	The amendments proposed by senators support the interests of 
Pearson Development Corporation, as the Senate proposes to 
delete clauses 7, 8, 9 and 10 giving the government immunity 
from any legal proceedings under the bill, thus leaving the door 
open to all financial claims from Pearson Development 
Corporation.
<P>
	In endorsing the corporation's position, the Senate places 
itself squarely on the side of Canada's financial interests and 
shows its bias in favour of unrestricted capitalist exploitation 
without any kind of protection for society in general. It 
promotes the proliferation of lobbyists and infiltration by 
financial interests, while opening the door to the corruption of 
politicians in Canada and Quebec. Nothing less. A great 
majority of Quebecers do not want the Senate and I hope that 
this House clearly understands this desire.
<P>
	A major theme of the government's red book, the Liberal 
Party's veritable manifesto in the last federal election 
campaign, of which they remind this House, is to question the 
disproportionate and decisive behind-the-scenes influence of 
lobbies on government policies. Their goal is to remake this 
same government's image in order to restore public confidence.
<P>
	So be it, and democracy will be much better in Canada as a 
result. Therefore we urge the government to keep its 
commitment by refusing any compromise with the lobbies, 
senators and companies and by not bowing to this country's 
financial establishment.
<P>
	The Senate is as archaic as it is useless. I think I demonstrated 
that in this House on June 8, when, on behalf of the Official 
Opposition party, I opposed the funding for that other House.
<P>
	I repeat, that other House is nothing but a pretext for the 
government in power to reward friends of the regime, be they 
Tories or Grits, who will then do partisan work either for the 
government or for the interests they represent, and it is 
important that everyone know this.
<P>
	The Senate has no democratic legitimacy as an institution. Its 
members are appointed by the Governor General who, by 
convention, acts on the initiative and advice of the Prime 
Minister, who actually makes the appointments. Since the 
senators are not elected, the Bloc Quebecois considers the 
second chamber to be a political anachronism, a convincing sign 
that Canada's federal system is outdated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6373"> 6373 </A></B>
<P>
	On behalf of my colleagues in the Official Opposition, I also 
denounce the unacceptable waste which the budget of that 
House represents; the Canadian Senate costs some $26.9 
million, plus statutory expenditures of $15.7 million, for a total 
of $42.6 million. Given the current tough economic times, with 
a debt over $500 billion, and unemployment which is especially 
high in regions like the one represented by the hon. member 
who is trying to interrupt, 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, this amount could be 
used for economic recovery and his riding could benefit from 
it.
<P>
	Canada's public debt is partly due to outdated political 
structures, such as obsolete political centralism, a constitutional 
monarchy that is an unnecessary waste of public funds and an 
Upper House that is really just a golden retirement for 
politicians or others who have well served the traditional 
parties, be they Conservative or Liberal.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	The Senate of Canada is modeled on the House of Lords in the 
British Parliament. It is a chamber of highly distinguished 
persons. In keeping with the British tradition, great importance 
is placed in the division of legislative powers between two 
separate chambers each representing a separate social class: the 
people and the nobility.
<P>
	Regarding the Pearson International Airport affair and the 
Senate amendments to Bill C-22, the action of the Upper House 
is in keeping with this tradition, nobility having been replaced 
by the financiers of the Canadian establishment, represented by 
lobbyists and paid by the people.
<P>
	On the other hand, the structural illogicality of having such a 
legislative chamber in a parliamentary system based on the 
British model must be recognized.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> ``Allons, enfants de la Patrie''-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe): </B>You can hide many things 
from everyone, day after day-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. I want to remind the hon. 
member it is not appropriate to sing in this place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> This is a matter of 
blackmail. The very existence of a second legislative chamber in 
a British-type parliamentary system is structurally illogical. 
Clearly dominated by the executive branch, parliamentary 
systems give the Upper House an absolutely ridiculous, if not to 
say insignificant, amount of power and yet it costs us a fortune.
<P>
	To conclude, we consider the proposed amendments to Bill 
C-22 inadmissible and undemocratic. The Bloc Quebecois, as 
the Official Opposition, is against any legislative activity on the 
part of the Senate, an institution which should plainly and 
simply be abolished, and asks that a royal commission of inquiry 
be held to get right to the bottom of the Pearson International 
Airport privatization issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> While the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe was speaking, the hon. member for Simcoe 
Centre reminded me that he did not get to complete his speech 
last time. So, with the hon. members' permission, I suggest that 
we let him speak five minutes more.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I hear a voice telling me that unanimous consent is required 
and I think that is probably correct.
<P>
	On the basis that the member had not completed his time, 
there was an error on the part of the Table or the Chair and he was 
not given the floor first. I would ask for unanimous consent that 
the member might be permitted to complete the five minutes 
that are still remaining to him.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, the point I 
was developing in the first part of my presentation on Bill C-22 
was the fact that what we were doing here actually flies in the 
face of what we should be doing to help restore the trust and 
confidence that have been lost between the politician and the 
voter. I had just completed dealing with the fact that the 30 day 
review of the Pearson contract was done by a well identified 
Liberal. Without getting into the question of how competent that 
individual is, the fact that it was done by somebody so well 
connected with the party just flew in the face of what needed to 
be an open and honest evaluation of that contract.
<P>
	The next step in Bill C-22 was that there was a well identified 
Liberal appointed to review the compensation package. Again 
this flies in the face of what the public told us during the election 
campaign, that it wanted something done differently here and it 
did not want a continuation of the old politics. This again flew in 
the face of that.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	If it was going to be done it had to be done by a non-partisan, 
somebody completely removed from the political arena in order 
to restore the confidence that in fact what was happening here 
was in the best interests of the taxpayers.
<P>
	The bill is unprecedented in that it denies the right of 
companies involved to the due process of law. Again in the 
minds of the public this raises questions. Why is that in there? 
Are we trying to hide something? It comes back to the question 
of trust in the system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6374"> 6374 </A></B>
<P>
	We tried during the committee stage to open up and give 
these people an opportunity to come in and defend their 
position, the people whose names and reputations had been 
called into question, but this was denied.
<P>
	To my thinking there is no other option available now than to 
go through the courts in order to clear the air so that taxpayers 
will indeed know the truth about the original deal but, more 
important, will know the justification for the spending of any tax 
dollars.
<P>
	In all fairness those whose names and reputations have been 
brought into question must be given their day in court. There is a 
saying that those who steal my money steal nothing, but those 
who steal my good name steal all.
<P>
	Do not let this happen. Put yourself in their position and ask if 
this is fair. As upset as we all were at the apparent deceit and 
abuse of the process in the original deal, two wrongs will not 
make it right. The minister said in introducing this bill that he 
wanted to be fair and reasonable to all concerned. Let us do that. 
Let us be fair and reasonable to the taxpayers as well as the 
accused.
<P>
	It is ironic that all this debate and delay is holding up an 
infrastructure project that is a major part of Toronto and Ontario 
if indeed not Canada. Here we have this major piece of 
infrastructure continuing to deteriorate while this debate goes 
on.
<P>
	This project alone was worth almost a billion dollars, 
representing about one-half of the total federal commitment to 
infrastructure with the potential for thousands of jobs 
immediately and yet to this day it is still not happening.
<P>
	With so much support on the other side, who is speaking out 
for Toronto and Ontario? Not only are we talking about jobs 
now, we are talking about jobs that are indirectly tied to Pearson. 
The first impression created by a fast, efficient, safe airport 
plays a major role in decisions affecting where to locate and 
expand new industry.
<P>
	Pearson operations generate some $2 billion in personal 
income, $4 billion in business revenues and $700 million dollars 
in tax revenues and we are allowing this gem to deteriorate 
daily. It makes no sense.
<P>
	There is no reason why negotiations should not proceed as 
quickly as possible. Pearson Development Corporation has said 
in writing that it will do nothing to block expansion. Local 
airport authority discussion need not have been delayed.
<P>
	We cannot delay any further. Far too much is at stake. If this 
government is serious about job creation now and in the future, 
there is no better way to demonstrate that commitment than 
immediate action on Pearson.
<P>
	This government's lack of confidence in our courts to be fair 
and reasonable is as frightening as the cynicism I spoke of 
earlier between the voters and the politicians.
<P>
	There will never be a better time for this government to show 
its commitment to more open and honest government as was 
promised in the red book than to turn this whole situation over to 
the courts.

GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (for Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency)</B> moved that Bill C-52, an act to 
establish the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services and to amend and repeal certain acts, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House 
on the subject of Bill C-52, the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services Act.
<P>
	This bill is one of a growing list of initiatives aimed at 
renewing, restructuring and revitalizing our approach to 
government. Other legislation now before this House will 
reorganize and redirect many functions and organizations such 
as the Department of Natural Resources, industry, consumer 
affairs, communications, science, to name a few.
<P>
	Bill C-52 also addresses the functions of what used to be 
several departments or agencies. These measures are part of a 
coherent plan to bring order, efficiency and effectiveness to 
government. By merging the functions of public works, supply 
and services, the government telecommunications agency and 
the translation bureau, Bill C-52 is another step in the direction 
of more streamlined, more responsive services to government 
operations at less cost.
<P>
	We can take great satisfaction in the fact that this 
rationalization of resources will save the government in the 
order of $180 million by 1998.
<P>
	In this era of fiscal constraint, effectiveness and efficiency are 
obviously of extreme importance to all Canadians. Canadians 
have a right to expect leadership and the example of the 
government to set that leadership and the direction for all 
economies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6375"> 6375 </A></B>
<P>
	This means getting our own house in order, getting our 
expenditures and deficits under control. Nevertheless, we 
should not think of Bill C-52 as mere housekeeping. To get 
Canada back on the prosperity path, to create jobs and 
well-being we need an innovative economic climate. 
Government must provide the leadership and the focus to create 
that environment.
<P>
	In addition to its housekeeping functions Bill C-52 is part of a 
strategy to do just that. The strategy was first outlined in 
<I>Creating Opportunity: The Liberal Plan for Canada</I>, the 
so-called red book which continues to inspire the agenda of this 
government.
<P>
	That document describes the innovative economy that we all 
strive to see to completion. It also describes the proper role of 
government to create the economic condition to permit 
entrepreneurs to succeed.
<P>
	Specifically, the red book defines the crucial role of the 
government in such an innovative system as working with the 
private sector to identify strategic opportunities for the future, 
then redirecting its existing resources toward the fulfilment of 
those opportunities.
<P>
	The potential impact of the resources we are talking about is 
nothing short of tremendous. The department created by this bill 
manages an annual cash flow of $1.4 trillion. It buys $10 billion 
worth of products and services a year. It lets out about 175,000 
contracts for approximately 17,000 different categories of 
goods and services every year.
<P>
	It is the largest property management agency in Canada, 
providing work space for 170,000 public servants involving 
ownership of $6.5 billion worth of real estate. In the business 
world that is called clout. It will be one of the roles of the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services to use 
that clout effectively. It will be used not only to effect savings 
for Canadian taxpayers but also to boost Canadian business. An 
organization that does business on the scale I just described 
necessarily deals with both big and small buyers and sellers. It 
deals with provinces, communities and other federal 
departments. It deals with foreign governments and foreign 
firms. Its purchasing power permits the public works and 
government services to strike alliances with Canadian 
governments and firms to achieve strategic objectives such as 
penetrating world markets by small Canadian firms that would 
otherwise never have this accessibility to them individually.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-52 in fact encourages strategic use of the vast 
purchasing power of the government. It encourages the 
department to adopt an innovative approach to providing goods 
and services to its clients. Equally it encourages a similar 
attitude on the part of its customers.
<P>
	The wording of the legislation makes the bill clear. Where 
previous legislation stated that the department shall provide 
certain services, Bill C-52 says it may. There is no coercion 
here. In essence the bill says to both the  department and its 
clients: ``If it is efficient and effective let's make a deal''.
<P>
	Such an arrangement makes for sharp pencils on both sides of 
the bargain. If the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services wants to keep its customers it will have to be 
competitive. Government operations, Canadian businesses and 
Canadian taxpayers, everyone, will benefit.
<P>
	Bill C-52 places in one organization all the tools necessary 
for efficient economical services to the federal government. We 
have one minister, one deputy minister and one departmental 
team dedicated to the task. At the same time the bill provides a 
single forum for expression of the interest of clients as well as 
suppliers, including businesses and other levels of government.
<P>
	Flexibility rather than coercion is the spirit of the new 
department's mandate. Services provided to federal 
organizations would also be made available to provincial, 
territorial and local governments but only if they wish to use 
them.
<P>
	Similarly the new legislation permits the department to 
provide service to community colleges, school boards and social 
service agencies. Federal and provincial governments combined 
spend some $50 billion annually on goods and services. A mere 
1 per cent savings would add up to half a billion dollars a year. In 
addition to greater and more effective service to other 
governments and institutions, this flexibility has the potential to 
provide significant savings to all Canadians.
<P>
	Yet a remarkable aspect of the legislation is the simplicity. It 
is based largely on existing legislation. No great new powers 
have been invented. In sum, it reduces the government 
machinery, eliminating overlap and duplication. It provides 
one-stop shopping for suppliers and contractors, making it 
easier to do business and easier to get information. It permits the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services to use its 
purchasing power strategically, not only to reduce costs to 
taxpayers but to enhance the effectiveness and competitiveness 
of all Canadian business.
<P>
	The legislation is good for business in Canada. It is an 
instrument of responsive efficient government that will assist in 
creating the economic environment that all Canadian businesses 
need to get on with the task of creating jobs and economic 
well-being.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-52, which is at second reading today, is primarily an attempt 
to group four different services under the same authority.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	These services either existed as distinct entities before, such 
as public works and government services which were formerly 
two separate departments, or were part of another department, 
as was the case for telecommunications and translation services. 
In any case,  under the new legislation those four services will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6376"> 6376 </A></B>
<P>
now be part of a single department, the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services.
<P>
	The primary objective of this bill is obviously to implement 
an organizational restructure. It is simply a musical chair 
exercise to reduce, in the months to come and according to what 
we were told, the number of civil servants from 18,000 down to 
14,000. In other words, the government wants to eliminate some 
4,000 jobs in the public service and offer essentially the same 
services.
<P>
	From that perspective, the bill is not without merit. If the 
government can reduce the number of civil servants and still 
provide the same quality of service, particularly in the current 
context of excessive government spending, debt and deficit, 
then it must do it.
<P>
	The problem is that this legislation does not go far enough. It 
could go a lot further toward improving the operations of the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services. It is 
very unfortunate to stop short of doing that, because the hon. 
member said the following.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``It is another initiative to revitalize. This is not mere 
housekeeping. This is job creation. This is an incentive 
approach. This is government in action, with clout, based on 
simplicity''. It is a lot of mere words that we hear from the 
government. Basically it is housekeeping. These are a lot of 
empty words because there is no revitalization whatsoever.
<P>
	As a matter of fact the law that is being proposed is 
discouraging to some extent because it does not address itself to 
the real problems that concern the Ministry of Public Works and 
Government Services. I am not surprised because the 
government really does not have the backbone to act where 
action is needed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The fact is that except for a musical chair exercise, a grouping 
together of various services, this housekeeping bill does not 
include anything very exciting for anyone. Even though we are 
told that this is the first major change since that legislation was 
drafted in 1867, the bill still does not introduce anything new.
<P>
	In fact, civil servants to whom we had an opportunity to talk 
have insisted that they did everything in their power to ensure 
that no new provisions were included. The various related acts 
were grouped together and great care was taken to make sure 
that nothing was changed. The exercise was conducted as though 
it was important not to affect existing structures.
<P>
	This is precisely why Bill C-52 is such a disappointment. 
There is nothing new in this bill to improve the performance of 
that department, to reduce waste, or to eliminate abuse. Yet, 
changes or improvements to the Department of Public Works 
and Government Services are long overdue. We all know that  
this department is often accused of wasting public money.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you and all the hon. members in this House, not 
to mention the public watching us on television, are aware of 
specific instances of waste in government, which can hurt 
because it is taxpayers' money being wasted. This waste and this 
abuse are often linked to the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services or directly or indirectly. The reason is 
obvious. As my hon. colleague said earlier, the department 
spends a lot of money in Canada, grants something like 175,000 
contracts each year and has hundreds of thousands of civil 
servants and thousands of construction and service contracts to 
look after. In the past, the department has wasted a lot of money 
and significantly contributed to increasing the government debt.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The public also knows full well that this department is the 
major channel for government into patronage. Without going 
into too much detail, how else would the government manage to 
award construction or service contracts to its friends and 
supporters who poured funds into its war chest? In fact, we saw 
again this week to what length government members are ready 
to go to leave the door wide open for unlimited corporate 
contributions.
<P>
	We on this side of the House have tried to limit contributions 
to campaign funds to a minimum and to enforce throughout 
Canada an act limiting contributions similar to the legislation in 
force in the province of Quebec, which is quite reasonable and 
much more democratic and helps to reduce abuses and 
patronage.
<P>
	Again this week the government voted in favour of an act 
which does not limit donations from large corporations in 
Canada. Once the party these compagnies have financially 
supported is in office, the companies want their share of the 
contracts, hence the problem. Such undue influence can be seen 
particularly in the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services. What is disappointing unfortunately is that Bill C-52 
in no way addresses these issues which are vitally important in 
Canada, since, as everyone knows, our country is faced with 
some serious debts.
<P>
	Nor does the bill contain provisions to curb lobbying, another 
big concern for Canadians. We know how lobbyists have control 
over the contracting process when big government contracts are 
involved. But then, for God's sake, with Bill C-52, why does the 
government not take the opportunity to deal with some major 
public concerns, like waste, patronage and lobbying? Nothing in 
this bill addresses these issues. In fact, this legislation does 
nothing to improve openness in the allocation of contracts for 
the Department of Public Works and Government Services, for 
telecommunications or for translation. That is the main problem 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6377"> 6377 </A></B>
<P>
with this legislation. It is also the main problem with the current  
government. It is the main problem facing Canadian politics.
<P>
	Basically, the government has a serious credibility problem. 
Of course, it did not start with the current government. The 
Conservatives before them had the same problem. This is an 
image problem. Elected representatives and the government are 
accused of mismanaging public funds. Canadians accuse them 
of waste and patronage and they are right, since the national debt 
is reaching the $600 billion mark and the deficit exceeds $40 
billion.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Besides, the government has a serious debt problem, so much 
so that the International Monetary Fund is about to intervene. 
From a debt and deficit point of view, Canada is in a critical 
situation. Bill C-52 gives us a great opportunity to reduce waste 
in the thousands of contracts that are granted in Canada and, in 
doing so, to reduce our debt and deficit. But we do not take 
advantage of it.
<P>
	As everybody knows, we are faced with a very serious 
problem, which affects politics in general. Politicians 
themselves have lost most of their credibility with the public at 
large, precisely because of this loose management of the public 
funds, which conjures up stories of patronage, abuse and waste. 
It is not surprising that Canadians call us hypocrites, crooks and 
liars and accuse us of not doing our job as their elected 
representatives.
<P>
	It is a serious problem because that loss of confidence by the 
people in their elected representatives challenges the very basis 
of our democracy. When the uncertainty and the lack of 
confidence felt by Canadians is such that it weakens our 
democratic institutions, then it becomes a serious problem.
<P>
	The government could have seen Bill C-52 as an opportunity 
to address these concerns, to show Canadians that it is taking 
action to reduce waste and overspending, but it has not done so.
<P>
	This bill could have been used to make the government more 
open, which is essential if we want members of Parliament to 
regain some credibility. I think that openness was one of the first 
concerns expressed by the government when it was elected last 
October. The Liberals promised Canadians that there would be a 
certain level of ethics within their government, and that is why 
the Prime Minister appointed a former Liberal minister to see to 
it that his ministers follow this code of ethics. Openness is 
mentioned in the red book, although not on the first page. I will 
read to you an excerpt from page 95 of the red book that most 
Liberal members are very familiar with. It says: ``We will 
follow the basic principle that government decisions must be 
made on the merits of a case rather than according to the 
political influence of those making the case. We will take an 
approach of openness in decision-making. A Liberal 
government will not allow the public agenda to be  dominated by 
lobbyists as it has been since the Conservatives took office''.
<P>
	The Conservatives are being accused of patronage and lack of 
openness, but we see no change. The present government is not 
doing anything to address the problem and does not even seem 
willing to do something about it. Bill C-52 is a perfect example 
of this unwillingness on the part of the government. The 
Liberals could have given some teeth to this bill to put an end to 
the waste and misuse of taxpayers' money, but it has not done so.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	It is disappointing because today, as I said earlier, the general 
public has grave doubts about the effectiveness of its elected 
representatives and the federal system. In fact, that is one of the 
reasons why Quebec wants sovereignty, and will become 
sovereign, because it looks like the federal system is unable to 
adjust.
<P>
	Government members show no indication that they want to 
improve the system. Consider lobbying, for instance, where 
there has been considerable abuse. This week, the government 
which, as I just mentioned, said in the red book that it wanted to 
restrict the influence of lobbyists, again gave in to the lobbyists, 
who scored at least two points on the restrictions the 
government wanted to impose on them. The lobbyists managed 
to avoid having to disclose their fees, and corporations may 
deduct lobbyists' fees from corporate income tax. This is one 
more example of a government that lacks the political will to 
deal with the real problems.
<P>
	We had a whole series of events just this week which clearly 
reflected the government's lack of concern for the problems of 
Canadians. Yesterday we found, for instance, that the Prime 
Minister had purposely withheld information about federal 
compensation for the cost of the 1992 referendum in Quebec. 
The government has shown a preference for secrecy and an utter 
lack of transparency.
<P>
	Consider the Pearson Airport controversy. Granted, the 
government cancelled this contract or attempt at privatization 
because it had to stop this kind of abuse, but it is trying to ensure 
that the parties concerned receive quite substantial 
compensation. The government is compensating lobbyists. It is 
compensating private interests. Even the Senate, in this 
particular case, suggested paying up to $45 million to the people 
involved in the privatization of Pearson airport, which is abuse 
of public funds. The Senate itself is another case of this kind of 
abuse, of wasting taxpayers money: we have 104 senators sitting 
around doing nothing, who are paid $70,000 a year, spend 
$500,000 each and as a result cost the public Treasury a total of 
$50 million. This is a horrific waste of money in a country that is 
already carrying an extremely heavy debt load. We know the 
senators are just 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6378"> 6378 </A></B>
<P>
another kind of waste, another form of patronage, because they 
are all-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I submit to the Chair that it is 
contrary to the Standing Orders to speak disrespectfully of the 
members sitting in the other place or their institution. This is 
clearly stipulated in the Standing Orders of the House of 
Commons and I wish to remind my colleague opposite of this 
rule. I believe he should unequivocally withdraw his statement 
and limit his remarks to the bill before us instead of maligning 
the senators.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry, I just took the Chair and I did not 
hear everything. I would hope that we would always carry due 
respect for ourselves and this Chamber as well as members in 
the other place. I will of course review what was said. If such a 
thing was done I will get back to the House.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We only have a couple of minutes left before Question Period. 
Therefore, I invite the member to resume his comments, keeping 
in mind what I said earlier regarding our colleagues in the other 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, my remarks were aimed at 
government expenditures which many believe are out of control. 
I meant no disrespect to members of the other House.
<P>
	Another example of government waste or lack of transparency 
is family trusts. We are having a very difficult time getting 
information regarding family trusts. The finance minister is 
keeping it a secret. This is yet another case of a blatant lack of 
transparency on the part of the government.
<P>
	As I said earlier, this is a serious problem which affects the 
government in general and the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services in particular. It is even more obvious 
within the Canada Communication Group. This particular 
group, which is part of PWGSC, was illegally given money by 
other departments trying to preserve their budget for the 
following year.
<P>
	At the end of the fiscal year instead of spending the money 
they had left they transferred it to Canada Communication 
Group as payment for services planned for the coming years but 
not yet rendered. This is totally illegal and we have been told 
that there are several millions of dollars in this fund. Several 
departments have been contributing to it. This is what has been 
going on within this government.
<P>
	We doubt whether this will be rectified. Faced with such a 
fraudulent scheme, the President of the Treasury Board has yet 
to take action that would restore our confidence. As a matter of 
fact, there is nothing this government is doing to deal with 
waste, patronage and the lack of transparency that inspires our 
confidence. Some of the CSIS spirit seems to be floating over 
this government. It is trying to conceal rather than reveal what is 
going on within government, and I am convinced that the 
problem is worse in the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services. It is mainly in that department that we 
should have more openness, in order to prevent thousands and 
thousands of cases of abuse and waste of public funds.
<P>
	I should say that the problem is compounded by the minister 
himself, who acts in a way that might not be appropriate. He said 
he intended to relocate a number of Public Works employees in 
the maritimes, in his riding.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. My dear colleague, you will be able to 
continue after Question Period. It being eleven o'clock, 
pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to 
Statements by Members, pursuant to Standing Order 31.

<P>
	The federal ultimatum to the effect that the Quebec premier 
and nobody else should be part of that trade mission is an 
expression of contempt. It is not for the Canadian government to 
decide who should represent the Quebec government. Ottawa 
should not impose an agenda on the Quebec premier. Mr. 
Parizeau, who has responsibilities keeping him in Quebec City, 
is perfectly entitled to send a delegate of his own choice.

complex urban riding with a diverse social structure. As in most 
parts of Canada today, the people who live in it know that the 
health and well-being of their community depend upon an open, 
tolerant and pluralistic society in which discrimination against 
fellow citizens is not permitted and everyone is treated with 
mutual respect.
<P>
	It is for that reason among others that I support Bill C-41 and 
welcome the statements of the Minister of Justice and the 
Deputy Prime Minister that the government will introduce 
legislation amending Canada's human rights act to prohibit 
discrimination against persons based upon their sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	This is not a question of creating special status for anyone; it 
is a matter of ensuring that all Canadians are treated equitably 
under the same circumstances. We must apply this principle of 
fairness to all members of the Canadian population if we are to 
guarantee their rights as individuals as well as our own 
development as a progressive and modern society.

since 1988 certain communications experts within what is now 
the Department of Canadian Heritage have talked about the 
concept of neighbouring rights. That is a form of copyright 
payment imposed on radio broadcasters to be paid to recording 
artists and producers.
<P>
	Other experts admit that 68 per cent of blank cassettes sold are 
used for reproducing existing recordings which are legally sold 
in retail outlets. In this age of user pay let those who are bending 
existing copyright laws, that is the purchasers of blank 
cassettes, pay an artist's fee. Business, that is the big and small 
radio stations in this country, once again should not be required 
to pay. Without radio stations there is no recording industry or 
artist showplace. Without radio stations our sense of community 
surely diminishes.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier 
this week, the Minister of the Environment made some very 
uncalled for remarks with regard to an environmentalist group 
in Quebec, the ``Société pour vaincre la pollution'', which she 
referred to by its acronym, SVP.
<P>
	SVP has been active in the environmental area for 15 years 
now. Like many other groups of its kind, it is on somewhat shaky 
financial ground. For the minister to declare that the restricted 
financial means of that group is a discrediting factor in the eyes 
of the public and of the scientific community is totally 
unspeakable.
<P>
	Furthermore, the minister's data were inaccurate because, as 
one can see in the last issue of the prestigious magazine, 
National Geographic, the SVP group is still very much active. 
Such unfounded judgments on a Quebec environmentalist 
organization are unworthy of someone in a ministerial position.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, fall is in the air and the redness of the leaves is eclipsed

Canada was in debt to the tune of $532,444,756,445.36. That is 
$18,718.40 for every person in Canada, or $37,879.22 for every 
taxpayer. By the time it takes me to read this statement the debt 
will have grown by $88,410.
<P>
	This government says it is concerned about the debt, but I 
remind the House that it was the Liberal Party in the 1970s and 
1980s that sold Canada's future to pay for whatever spending 
was needed to get it re-elected. The Conservatives finished the 
job because they did not have the guts to kick the deficit habit.

	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, 50 years ago today Parliament officially proclaimed 
the creation of the Industrial Development Bank, the forerunner 
of today's Federal Business Development Bank. This was to 
assist in the smooth transition from a wartime to a peacetime 
economy with particular consideration to the financing 
problems of small business.
<P>
	Throughout the years the FBDB has addressed the evolving 
needs of small business by introducing innovative financial and 
management services. Not only was the bank the first to 
introduce term loans to the Canadian small business sector but it 
was among the first to offer small business management 
assistance through counselling and training courses. In addition, 
it became the first national source of venture capital.
<P>
	The bank has proven to be instrumental in building successful 
businesses while at the same time not being a drain on the 
government. In fact over the past five years it has received no 
funds from the government for its lending activities and has 
loaned out some $3.4 billion to small and medium size 
entrepreneurs.
<P>
	With its unique array of services, the bank continues to be 
ideally positioned to help businesses grow and create jobs. In 
fact approximately one in every five businesses in Canada has at 
some point turned to the FBDB for assistance.
<P>
	On behalf of the House and the small business sector, I would 
like to congratulate the FBDB as it celebrates its anniversary. I

	Mr. Carter-Edwards, a veteran of World War II, was the

<P>
	Ed Carter-Edwards was one of the lucky ones because he

occupied Europe and sent to the brutal Buchenwald death camp.

	Instead of being sent to a prisoner of war camp, Mr.

witnessing many inhumane acts. Thanks to Mr. Carter-Edwards 
this untold story is now on the record to be shared by all

II a large debt for their personal sacrifices and courage. I am

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last Tuesday, in an attempt to confirm Robert 
Bourassa's version of the facts regarding reimbursement to 
Quebec for the expenses incurred in the referendum on the 
Charlottetown Accord, the Prime Minister had a telephone 
conversation with Mr. Mulroney. In the account of this 
conversation he gave this House on Wednesday, the Prime 
Minister stated, and I quote: ``I called Mr. Mulroney, who did 
not give me an answer''.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister reconcile the statement he made 
before this House on Wednesday with the now established fact 
that Mr. Mulroney fully briefed him on Tuesday on all that was 
said between himself and Mr. Bourassa?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last weekend we contacted several persons to make sure we got 
all the facts. We had the privilege of speaking with Mr. 
Harcourt, calls were made to Mr. Bourassa, and I personally 
spoke with Premier Bob Rae. I also called Mr. Mulroney. Our 
brief conversation did not satisfy me and we agreed that the best 
thing would be for him to send me a written statement.
<P>
	When one has a $34-million decision to make involving 
taxpayers' money in a matter one did not handle, which had been 
on the table for a long time and involving discussions to which 
one was not privy, as a Prime Minister one must make sure that 
all the facts are in the open and quite clear.
<P>
	I reviewed the matter and on Tuesday consulted the cabinet 
and was authorized to act with the permission of Treasury 
Board. When the documentation was received I was not in the 
House myself, having been held up with the president of 
Tanzania. I was informed at 3.05 p.m. yesterday that the written 
communication had come in.
<P>
	I authorized my minister to take the necessary steps to make 
headway with this matter, but I acted cautiously because it 
involved taxpayers' money and was a matter that was not really 
the responsibility of this government. It had been dragging on 
for some time and we did not have the proof required to 
authorize payment. Once proof was received, we authorized it. 
It is that simple.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I bring the Prime Minister back to the central issue. 
This Prime Minister said in this House that there was no answer 
from Mr. Mulroney, although yesterday Mr. Mulroney reported 
all the facts in a letter to the Prime Minister, saying that these 
facts were conveyed to the current Prime Minister during 
Tuesday's telephone conversation. There is a flagrant 
contradiction.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The least that can be said is that the Prime Minister's memory 
of his talk with Mr. Mulroney is as bad as his recollection of his 
recent telephone call to Mr. Parizeau.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not agree that yesterday's letter from 
Mr. Mulroney formally contradicts what he said Wednesday in 
this House, namely that there had been no answer from Mr. 
Mulroney?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
said in this House that I had discussed the problem with Mr. 
Mulroney. I had not received a satisfactory answer from Mr. 
Mulroney at that time. I told him that I had sent him a letter and 
he told me that he would answer. We discussed the matter but I 
was waiting for his written reply. I never said that I had not 
talked about it with Mr. Mulroney. On the contrary, I informed 
the House that I had spoken with Mr. Mulroney.
<P>
	Furthermore, he told me that he would send me an official 
reply. During our discussion, he told me certain things. Was I 
satisfied with his answer? Was it enough? I do not think so. But I 
had enough after I had spoken with and received information 
from Mr. Harcourt, who was involved in the discussions in 
Charlottetown, as were Mr. Rae and Mr. Bourassa, and after I 
had reviewed the whole matter.
<P>
	The letter itself is not absolutely clear. It was only after 
reviewing the whole matter that I concluded that there was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6383"> 6383 </A></B>
<P>
indeed a commitment and that Mr. Bourassa had received a 
commitment from the then Prime Minister. I took precautions.
<P>
	As I said earlier, on Tuesday, I discussed the matter 
hypothetically in Cabinet, saying in effect, if we receive some 
information confirming all of this, can I go ahead? The Cabinet 
did give me the go-ahead; as for the amount of money, it was set, 
as required by Cabinet, by Treasury Board, which sat yesterday 
afternoon. It always sits on Thursday afternoon.
<P>
	I myself was notified of Mr. Mulroney's letter or of Mr. 
Shortliffe's telegram giving us Mr. Mulroney's version, and we 
accepted it. It is no more complicated than that.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, beyond the question which has now been settled, the 
payment of what is owed to Quebec, there is a serious question 
concerning the proper behaviour of a Prime Minister in telling 
this House the truth. Nothing should prevent this House from 
knowing the facts. This House was told by the Prime Minister 
that he had no answer from Mr. Mulroney, when we know today 
that he had a complete answer, the same answer which was the 
basis of his decision yesterday to pay.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that his statement that he had 
received no answer from Mr. Mulroney was likely to mislead the 
opposition and prevent it from getting to the bottom of this issue 
as it should?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
myself answered all the questions I was asked on this subject in 
this House. I have just explained clearly that it involved $34 
million of Canadian taxpayers' money, as a result of the 
question raised by the Leader of the Opposition claiming that 
the federal government had made a commitment.
<P>
	I took the necessary action to find out if there was a 
commitment from the federal government. He would have been 
the first to criticize me if I had acted on mere hearsay. I did what 
was necessary to assure myself that we could act as soon as 
possible with all the information in hand. A prime minister must 
act in such a prudent fashion. I acted with caution, as a 
reasonable man would.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
during Question Period, the Deputy Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs were obviously not aware 
that a written answer had been received from Mr. Mulroney. Yet, 
that answer had already arrived.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister confirm that he kept his Deputy 
Prime Minister and his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs in 
the dark, since Mr. Mulroney's letter had already reached his 
office around 1.30 p.m., before Question Period?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
could not inform the Deputy Prime Minister, since I was only 
told about that letter at 3.05 p.m. I decided not to show up for 
Question Period because my meeting with the Prime Minister of 
Tanzania took longer than expected. The letter was sent to my 
office but I was not there; I was at home. I was informed about it 
by  telephone at 3.05 p.m. Obviously I could not tell the Minister 
of the Environment at 2 p.m. about something I received at 3.05 
p.m. My office received a letter at 1.55 p.m., but I was not there. 
I am being criticized for not reading a letter which arrived in my 
office across the street, and not at my office here. I was not in my 
office. I am therefore being criticized for not having read a letter 
I had not seen.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Do you not have a fax machine?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I did not send that letter. It is 
up to the sender to make sure the letter reaches its recipient. I did 
not receive that letter. Since when do we blame people for not 
having a letter they did not receive? I received that letter at 3.05 
p.m. and the issue was settled two hours later. This shows how 
efficient our government is.
<P>
	This morning I was expecting the Leader of the Opposition 
and other MPs to congratulate the government for taking swift 
action and making the right decision. I am surprised at how 
partisan they can be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
Prime Minister is not here, it is customary for the Deputy Prime 
Minister to answer on his behalf.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister recognize that by acting as they did 
the senior officials in the PMO and the Privy Council kept the 
Deputy Prime Minister in the dark and prevented her from 
accurately answering the questions asked by the opposition? 
Does the Prime Minister of Canada think he acted as a prudent 
man should?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
explained that the letter arrived when the House was convening. 
It takes a few moments to go over a document, and I was not 
there. The Deputy Prime Minister sat in this House and 
answered based on what she knew. We received a letter at 1.55 
p.m. and we are being blamed for not providing an appropriate 
answer until 2.55 p.m. when the first question was put to us. If 
the letter had been sent to us at noon, we would have been able to 
answer at 2 p.m, but, as it happens, we received the letter at 
precisely 1.55 p.m. So, it took us exactly 70 minutes. We are 
fast, but not that fast. If we have not seen something, we cannot 
have read it.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, last night 
Canadian taxpayers became aware that they had an additional 
financial obligation of $34.5 million, two years after a 
Conservative government supposedly committed to it and 
months after a Liberal government had been in the process of 
denying that commitment existed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6384"> 6384 </A></B>
<P>
	Governments have a moral obligation to fulfil their 
commitments, but governments have an obligation to undertake 
those commitments in a financially and legally responsible 
manner. The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has 
repeatedly assured the House that no formal or written 
documentation existed on this agreement at the relevant time 
period.
<P>
	What I want to know from the Prime Minister is what are the 
guidelines in this government and in the previous government 
for senior officials, for cabinet and for cabinet ministers to 
undertake these kinds of financial obligations on behalf of 
Canadian taxpayers and how precisely are those criteria fulfilled 
in this case?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is an obligation that was committed to by the previous 
government to the premier of Quebec. It was discussed among 
the premiers in Charlottetown or Halifax at a time when there 
were laws in Alberta, in B.C. and another in Quebec about 
provincial referenda. There was a discussion at that time on 
whether there should be one national referendum or a series of 
provincial referenda.
<P>
	The conclusion was that the premier of Alberta decided to join 
in the federal referendum. The premier of B.C. did the same 
thing. But Quebec did not. Mr. Harcourt made a public statement 
that he understood that if he proceeded with his own legislation 
he expected to receive some compensation. I was not there but I 
tried to find out from the participants what had happened to get 
the best proof I could.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	It is not a question of having a contract or not having a 
contract. I said in the House that there was no documentation on 
it. That is why I was prudent. I tried to have good witnesses and 
that is what I have done. However, it is an obligation that was 
contracted by a previous government.
<P>
	In fact the taxpayers have paid for the referendum in all other 
provinces but not in Quebec. It was making an argument about 
fairness and so on. When I had all the files in front of me and the 
discussions that my staff had with the people concerned, I did 
my best. When I had the complete file in front of me I acted.
<P>
	That is the difficulty. As I said before there were no 
documents. That was the problem. But there was a commitment 
by the Prime Minister of Canada to certain premiers that I am 
respecting.
<P>
	It is just like when I get up in the House and I am asked a 
question and I say I will do something, sometimes I have to act 
after I said that. But if a Prime Minister cannot deliver on his 
word, who can?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question.
<P>
	I hope the Prime Minister will agree that verbal commitments 
or verbal agreements made at dinner meetings, cocktail parties 
or on golf courses are not the proper way to conduct the business 
of the Government of Canada. This is an extremely dangerous 
route to go.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister spoke to former Prime Minister 
Mulroney did he ask him whether there were any verbal 
agreements with various other parties, for example, with the 
Pearson consortium or the EH-101 contract? When he does do 
that, how much does he feel the taxpayers of Canada will be 
dinged for on those verbal commitments?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
explained to the House clearly what happened. I have nothing to 
add. There was an agreement between the Prime Minister of the 
day and the premier of Quebec that he would recommend a 
payment. He never proceeded with it, perhaps due to 
circumstances. I do not want to get involved with what happened 
in those days.
<P>
	I said I was confronted with a problem and I tried to find the 
proof that was needed to justify the payment. The payment was 
made. If the hon. member says we should not have paid, that 
would be another argument. That is not what he is saying.
<P>
	Rather than to pass judgment on the substance, he is trying to 
play on the process. I am saying that there was a commitment by 
the previous government and we respected that commitment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
asking precisely about the process. When these various subject 
matters go to the courts these things will be under examination.
<P>
	I would like to know if the Prime Minister will table for the 
benefit of the House the guidelines that he will be using on past 
and future matters to ascertain whether cabinet and cabinet 
members have undertaken financial commitments on behalf of 
the Government of Canada?
<P>
	For example, would the government be open to undertaking a 
request from the current Quebec government to pay for the next 
referendum? How would he handle such a request? What is the 
basis for a financial obligation on that matter?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
it is a provincial referendum that is one thing. In this case, 
however, there was a national referendum where the same 
question was asked of all Canadians.
<P>
	What we did was very easy. We divided the per capita costs of 
having a referendum in the rest of Canada and that is what we 
paid. If there is a provincial referendum in Alberta or B.C. or 
Nova Scotia or Quebec, they pay the bill. This is a democracy. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6385"> 6385 </A></B>
<P>
This was a national referendum and there was a commitment I 
have respected.

recognize by his silence that he accepts that we made the right 
decision.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. Still on 
the subject of the Charlottetown referendum, the Prime Minister 
said in the House that he did not want to act unlawfully like Mr. 
Mulroney.
<P>
	My question is this: Would the Prime Minister indicate 
whether he still considers it unlawful for the Prime Minister of 
Canada to give his word to a colleague, without first obtaining 
the agreement of his cabinet?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> The Prime 
Minister can make commitments but has a duty to go to cabinet 
with his commitment, which I did this week. I talked to cabinet 
about this and they said: fine. The document then went to 
Treasury Board, to determine the amount. This is entirely legal. 
Payment is authorized by the government in accordance with 
certain government mechanisms. The commitment made 
previously was not a clear commitment to pay, and, in fact, Mr. 
Mulroney said so himself in the document you received. There 
was never any reference to specific procedures. As far as I am 
concerned, this payment is entirely legal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister says he discussed it with cabinet, 
and earlier, he told us he mentioned it to cabinet Tuesday. He 
confirmed that this is what happened. Are we to understand the 
Prime Minister called a cabinet meeting, while the next day, he 
told us there had been no satisfactory answer from former Prime 
Minister Mulroney? He said again today that there was 
sufficient and satisfactory reason to call a cabinet meeting to 
discuss the matter although the next day he said in the House he 
did not have an answer. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
everyone in the Press Gallery, everyone in this Parliament 
except the hon. member, knows that cabinet meets Tuesday 
mornings at 10 a.m. All the reporters are there for the Tuesday 
morning scrum. I raised the problem. I did not call a special 
meeting of cabinet. The problem had been making the headlines 
for several days. I talked about it. I said: This is what we could 
do if we receive confirmation from Mr. Mulroney, which, in 
fact, came two days later. We acted on that confirmation, but we 
also made sure we had the versions of Premier Harcourt, former 
Premier Bourassa, and the Premier of Ontario. You cannot be too 
careful when you are about to spend $34 million. I did what I 
was supposed to do. I got the support of cabinet and the approval 
of Treasury Board for making this payment.

the form of metaphors.
<P>
	Leaders of the separatist forces have been called maestros

include the Prime Minister and ask him how long he intends to 
fiddle while the unity issue burns.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is not very complicated. We said the people of Quebec will stay 
in Canada if they have a good government in Ottawa that is 
preoccupied with the real issue of Canadians and Quebecers. I 
am talking about the creation of jobs and security of income for 
those who need it. That is the program of this party and this 
government.
<P>
	Of course the PQ and the Bloc Quebecois just talk 
Constitution and separation even though the people of Quebec 
would like them to talk about job creation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, it

important subject?
<P>

in our party one thing is very clear and not very complicated. I 
told the Canadian people during the campaign that if they 
wanted to have Parliament discussing the Constitution all of the 
time not to vote for me. Now it is the Reform Party members 
who want to talk about the Constitution because when they try to

<P>
his obvious reluctance to compensate Quebec fairly for the 1992

that of the Deputy Prime Minister and of the Minister for  
Intergovernmental Affairs except as a cheap manoeuvre to avoid 
giving Quebec its due?

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, can 
you believe it? Does the Prime Minister admit that by hiding the

acceptable.

would not withdraw the statement that the Prime Minister lied in 
this House. It takes away from the debate when we engage in this

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are going to be faced many times in this 
House in dealing with facts or the interpretation of facts which 
are contradictory, and we are going to engage in very vigorous 
debate. All of us were sent to Parliament to represent very strong 
opinions.

word of hon. members at face value.

interpretation of facts that are contrary one to the other it does 
not serve the purpose of Parliament if we use words that are 
unparliamentary.

	I would appeal once again to the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe, who holds as is evident very strong 
opinions, to withdraw the words ``que le premier ministre a 
menti'' and use other words that would be acceptable to 
Parliament.
<P>
	I am sure it would help a great deal not only in the course of

this type of word. I would appeal to the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe to reconsider what has been said. If he could 
do this, we could get on with question period.

otherwise be unparliamentary language, but the member cannot 
do this by using unparliamentary language in this House. The

which is a very serious matter.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, our research 
indicates that as of September 19 the three levels of government 
have committed almost $1 billion of borrowed taxpayers' 
dollars to projects which are outside the red ink book definition 
of infrastructure. How can the minister justify this breaking of 
red ink book promises?

the red book promise has been fulfilled and the infrastructure 
program is a great success.
<P>
	This program which started only a few months ago has had 
terrific support from every municipality and every province 
across this country to the point where 70 per cent of the $6 
billion allocated has now in fact been approved in projects, 
putting 100,000 Canadians back to work.
<P>
	We said that we would get our $2 billion of the $6 billion from 
reallocation. We outlined in great detail in the red book exactly 
how that is being done. I have seen municipalities and provinces 
right across this country pick up on that spirit, reallocate funds, 
find ways of providing funds to get Canadians back to work 
without further burdening the taxpayers of this country and that 
is what we have done with this program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we are 
doing here at all levels is reallocating borrowed funds.
<P>

dollars on bocce courts in Toronto, the World Canoe 
Championship in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia or the removal of 
overhead electrical wires for a movie in Shelburne, Nova 
Scotia? The list goes on.
<P>
	Will the minister take immediate action to ensure that no 
more borrowed tax dollars fund projects of questionable value to 
Canada's infrastructures?

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Of course what he does know or should know 
is that this is based on municipal priorities. This has to do with 
attracting additional investment dollars to the community by the 
upgrading of infrastructure and it has to do with the quality of

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the role of the federal Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs in the referendum issue is at the very least disturbing. Is 
the minister prepared to state in this House that until yesterday, 
as he suggested, he did not know anything about the content of 
the telephone conversation Mr. Mulroney had with the Prime 
Minister on Tuesday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, my answer is yes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I therefore have to conclude that the federal Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs was absent from the cabinet meeting 
on Tuesday. In that case, does he not feel that he was much too 
quick to take position against Quebec when he stated, without 
having all the facts, that the federal government owed nothing to 
Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the Opposition should know that the conversation 
between

<B><A NAME="6388"> 6388 </A></B>
<P>
the Prime Minister and Mr. Mulroney took place on September 
27 at around 1.30  p.m., thus after the Tuesday morning cabinet 
meeting. The question is therefore pointless.
<P>
	That being said, what is important is that the matter has been 
dealt with in a way that is fair to all Canadians, including 
Quebecers. That was this government's aim. We did exactly 
what we said we would, that is if there was written evidence of 
an agreement, we would reimburse Quebec, and that is what we 
did.

the hours of operation for the Trent-Severn and Rideau

greatly affect tourism and all associated businesses.
<P>

concerning hours of operation.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
September 28, in this House, the Prime Minister, answering a 
question from the Leader of the Official Opposition, said and I 
quote: ``If conversations took place between Mr. Mulroney and 
Mr. Bourassa, I would be delighted to know what they were 
about. I called Mr. Mulroney, who did not give me an answer''.
<P>
	This statement by the Prime Minister, which caught our 
attention, is the subject of our question of privilege since it was 
categorically contradicted by the member for Sherbrooke who 
said yesterday: ``I made inquiries, and I later found that before 
Question Period yesterday, the Prime Minister knew that his 
predecessor had promised the Government of Quebec he would 
submit to his government a request to compensate Quebec for 
referendum expenses''.
<P>
	Moreover, a press release from the office of the President of 
the Privy Council and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
clarifies the whole issue, contradicting the statement made by 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	By his behaviour the Prime Minister impeded the Leader of 
the Official Opposition and members of the House in the 
discharge of their duties since the nature of the answer he gave 
during Question Period changed our line of questioning. The 
Leader of the Opposition and members of the House were asking 
questions pursuant to Standing Order 37 and as such were 
entitled to a valid answer enabling them to carry on their duties 
as parliamentarians.
<P>
	In our view the Prime Minister's behaviour clearly constitutes 
contempt as defined by May, page 136, nineteenth edition:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House in the 
performance of its functions, or which obstructs or impedes any member or 
officer of such House in the discharge of its duty, or which has a tendency to 
produce such results may be treated as a contempt even though there is no 
precedent of the offence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Consequently, Mr. Speaker, given the facts I mentioned, I 
respectfully ask that you rule that the behaviour of the Prime 
Minister on September 28 constitutes an obstruction to the 
discharge of the duties of the House and of the Leader of the 
Opposition and declare votable a motion to refer the issue to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs with a 
view to getting to the bottom of this whole thing, and reviewing 
the Prime Minister's answers and behaviour by calling wit-
<P>

<B><A NAME="6389"> 6389 </A></B>
<P>
nesses, especially the former Prime Minister of Canada, the 
Right Hon. Brian Mulroney.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am looking forward to your ruling in this 
matter and I trust that you will come to the right conclusion.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> I have nothing 
to add, Mr. Speaker. I clearly related everything that happened 
during Question Period. There can be differences of opinion 
between one side of the House and the other. It is a matter for 
debate and not a substantive issue.
<P>
	I admitted earlier that I talked about this with Mr. Mulroney. I 
said it clearly, and he confirmed to me that he would send a letter 
to make things as clear as possible. Read the letter and you will 
see. He explained to me what had happened and I said that I 
would wait for his written reply before stating that I was happy 
with all the answers. I took every precaution to protect the 
public interest by ensuring that there were other witnesses.
<P>
	I am being criticized for being overly cautious. It is a matter 
for debate. Perhaps I should have been careless. Perhaps in the 
future I should follow the hon. member's advice of not thinking 
things through before acting, as the Bloc Quebecois would like 
me to do. I did everything not to embarrass anyone and give 
half-answers because in a conversation like this we talk about 
many things. As I see it, I said that I had not received Mr. 
Mulroney's answer because he told me he would send a written 
reply. I preferred to rely on his written answer rather than on a 
verbal discussion. That is what I clearly said here in this House. 
I was waiting for his final answer, which arrived within 48 hours 
as promised.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a motion has been moved by the hon. member and I 
believe it is my duty to speak to the motion that the member has 
indicated he is willing to introduce.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I want to indicate to you-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair has not heard a motion. One 
moment, please.
<P>
	If the hon. member wishes to enter into this exchange it 
should be on the point of privilege because there is no motion 
before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is exactly the point. I was indicating the 
fact there is no point of privilege in my estimation based on 
citation 31(1) of Beauchesne's which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A dispute arising between two Members, as to allegations of facts, does not 
fulfil the conditions of parliamentary privilege.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Therefore, the member indicates that he wishes to put a 
motion, if you deem that there is a prima facie case of privilege, 
Mr. Speaker. I submit that there is not such a prima facie case of 
privilege because of 31(1) of Beauchesne's 6th edition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I leave this to you to 
decide, having pointed out what I see as a breach of my 
colleague, the opposition leader's privilege. It is from that angle 
that the Prime Minister's answer should be considered and 
absolutely not within the context outlined by the government 
whip.
<P>
	With all due respect, I would like to rise again on a question of 
privilege and repeat my argument that the Official Opposition's 
work has been undermined by an answer which was clearly 
inaccurate.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The seriousness of this point of privilege 
cannot be lost on anyone in the House. I want to be absolutely 
sure in my own mind and I want to take some time. I want to 
review everything that has been said and I want to reflect on it. I 
take it all of the submissions have been made.
<P>
	I would ask the indulgence of the House. I will consider all 
matters that were brought forward and I will return to the House, 
if necessary or when necessary, and give my judgment on this 
request.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFPUBLICWORKSANDGOVERNMENTSERVICESACT">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND 
GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-52, an act to establish the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services and to amend and repeal certain acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Québec-Est now has 
the floor. I believe he still has about 30 minutes left. I am not 
sure. If the member would begin, I will find out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are now debating Bill C-52, the purpose of which is to set up a 
new department, the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services.
<P>
	I will resume the comments I was making before Question 
Period. To begin with, I would like to say that for several 
months, especially during the summer, all the Bloc Quebecois 
members have been sending letters to the Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services asking him to inform them of 
all the contracts awarded by the federal government in their 
ridings, which is a perfectly normal request one would think 
given that we are elected and want to keep an eye on the 
government to make sure that it runs smoothly. Surprise, 
surprise. The answers were negative in all cases. Across the 
board, the Department of Public Works refused to give out any 
information, saying that it was too costly.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	We were surprised by that action, but of course on second 
thought we realize that the department is acting right from the 
start with a lot of secrecy about government contracts. It is 
becoming extremely difficult  for us to get information on 
federal contracts in public works.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6392"> 6392 </A></B>
<P>
	That is worrisome because, as I mentioned at the beginning, 
before Question Period, that somewhat reflects the government 
mind-set, first of all, not to act firmly about waste, not to reduce 
waste in government expenditures. That also reflects a lack of 
transparency by the government, despite its intention, its desire, 
as stated in the red book, to encourage transparency in 
government.
<P>
	It is as if they wanted to hide information, as if there were 
something fishy, things that could not be disclosed, things that 
the minister and his department are trying to hide. Is it because it 
is too complicated? Why is it that elected government people 
cannot obtain information on contracts given by the government 
in public works and government services? Certainly, it is 
because of a lack of concern for transparency. And that is the 
least of our concerns.
<P>
	I know, for example, that in the case of contracts awarded by 
the federal government, Quebec has always been 
short-changed. If you consider Quebec's contribution to the 
federal level and the share of public works and service contracts 
that Quebec should receive, the figure should be approximately 
25 per cent and at least 23 per cent of all contracts. For a long 
time now-10, 15, perhaps 20 years-Quebec has been getting 
much less.
<P>
	Last year for example, in 1993, the province was awarded 16 
per cent of all contracts. It was 15 per cent in 1992 and 13 per 
cent in 1991. When you think that contracts awarded by the 
federal government are worth a total of $30 billion or more, this 
is a considerable loss for Quebec. It amounts to approximately 
$200 million a year. They may be trying to hide the extent of 
these losses.
<P>
	In any case, there are hidden facts, there is a lack of openness 
on the part of the government. We would like to suggest at least 
some improvements. Unfortunately, Bill C-52 deals only with 
minor matters and moves things around and does not improve 
the operation of the Department of Public Works. With this in 
mind, the Bloc would like to make constructive, positive and 
concrete suggestions.
<P>
	For example, the legislation should require that regular 
notices, say for example monthly notices, be given of all 
contracts awarded by Public Works and Government Services.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Normally, this should be included in Bill C-52. These notices 
should be public and easily available and provide data by federal 
riding, region and province. Such a measure would keep the 
members of this House informed on what is going on in the 
Department of Public Works so they would be in a position to 
exercise their discretion and disclose cases of misuse or waste.
<P>
	We also want to make a second recommendation. The 
responsibility for public tenders should be decentralized in 
order that offices of federal members of all parties be more 
involved in the process, that members be consulted, or at least 
informed of the awarding process in the case of government 
contracts regarding their riding. This is not complicated. It is 
normal for the members to be informed of the federal 
government contracts in their ridings, so that they can shed 
some light on some of these contracts, play a positive role and 
do something about cases of waste or abuse.
<P>
	We would even have another recommendation which would 
be to adopt a precise code or agreement on subcontracting in Bill 
C-52 in order for the government and the public servants to 
know the government's intentions regarding this practice which 
has been a policy for some time now. The very complex 
subcontracting infrastructure costs more than $5 billion at the 
federal level.
<P>
	Over the last three to five years, subcontracting has increased 
at an alarming rate because the government never established a 
policy in this regard and has no guidelines indicating whether 
subcontracting would or would not be profitable for the 
government. We opened the door to subcontracting with all the 
problems we are experiencing now and there are no guidelines. 
We would have liked to seen some guidelines in Bill C-52 or a 
code for the government to deal with subcontracting.
<P>
	We have another suggestion for the government. It might be 
time to give the federal civil servants the right to blow the 
whistle on the waste of money in the public service, because 
they know what is going on, but they cannot make anything 
public. Obviously, if public servants had that right, as is 
apparently the case in some American states right now, they 
would not only be more accountable for their job, but I am sure 
there would be less waste in government contracts.
<P>
	Even if that suggestion goes through, some steps would have 
to be taken to ensure that public servants with that right would 
be protected and would not use it against their supervisors. We 
must provide some measures to make sure that exposure of 
abuse and waste by public servants works satisfactorily, and 
would be useful to the government.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, following what I said this morning about the 
lack of openness of this government in awarding contracts at the 
Department of Public Works, and there are many of them, the 
lack of will of this government to give teeth to Bill C-52, while 
it is such an important department, because of all the contracts 
that are awarded every year- 150,000, 175,000-because of 
the amounts involved and mostly because of the doubts that we 
have about waste within the government, in order to allow that 
department to become more open and more accountable toward 
elected representatives we would like to propose  an amendment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6393"> 6393 </A></B>
<P>
to Bill C-52. Therefor, I move, seconded by the member for 
Charlevoix:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by striking out all the words after the word 
``That'' and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-52, An Act to establish 
the Department of Public Works and Government Services and to amend and 
repeal certain acts, because it does not provide for the development of a code of 
ethics aimed at ensuring the transparency of contracting activities and the 
acquisition of all goods and services by the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Having held consultations, I find the 
motion in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
privilege of being able to respond to the proposal by the 
government to put into legislation something which it has 
already done, that is to amalgamate the Department of Supply 
and Services, the Department of Public Works, the Government 
Telecommunications Agency and the Translation Bureau into 
one new department, the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services Canada.
<P>
	Before I comment on the actual legislation before us, I cannot 
help but note that things are being done in backward order. The 
thing is already done. The decision has been made and 
implemented and it will not be reversed. We are now discussing 
it and soon we will be voting to formalize a decision already 
made.
<P>
	I wonder if I am the only one who notices illogical things like 
this. The same thing was done on the question of the military. 
With much fanfare the government cancelled the helicopter 
contracts. With great flair it announced the closure of a number 
of military bases and moving them around. Then a military 
review was announced and the work started on thinking about 
what should be done. After some time the committee will 
announce its findings and we will probably discuss the report, 
but the actions have already been taken at huge expense. There 
will be even greater expense if it becomes apparent that some of 
these decisions need to be reversed.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	We have had exactly the same thing in the last few days in the 
post office. We knew in June that the post office applied for an 
increase in first class postal rates to 45 cents. Ironically the 
government proceeded to do the work. The stamps were printed 
and distributed. Now we see cabinet deciding whether or not to 
actually do it. Meanwhile the taxpayers have spent the money.
<P>
	No real business that has any hope of surviving can operate in 
this way. We need to do our analysis first and include in that 
analysis the most cost effective way of making changes. Why is 
it that government can waste billions of dollars simply by 
terribly poor planning and by taking hasty actions that are not 
well thought  through? Billions of dollars are forcibly removed 
from citizens by the bully of taxation.
<P>
	I need to get on with the main topic of my speech but I cannot 
forget the Pearson airport deal. Is it not another example? If the 
former government had not been in such a big hurry to sign 
contracts without having covered all the facts of the situation 
first, we would not be in the mess we are in now with that deal. I 
find it appalling that the government is now ramming through a 
bill respecting that deal which will hide payments made at the 
discretion of the minister from parliamentary or public scrutiny.
<P>
	I need to turn the corner and talk about Bill C-52. After what I 
have just said members may be surprised to note that in general I 
am in favour of the legislation. In general I support the move 
toward downsizing, but the plan needs to be well thought out. A 
number of issues need to be tackled. They must be done in the 
right order.
<P>
	In analysing the situation one should really ask the following 
questions: First, what public service, what actual work, what 
functions do we want the department to perform? Second, in 
order to achieve what we want the department to do, how can we 
best organize it so that it can perform those functions with the 
greatest efficiency?
<P>
	The amalgamation proposed in Bill C-52 is positive in the 
sense that it will result in the reduction of overlapping duties 
and functions. It should reduce overall costs, though that 
remains to be seen. There will be a reduction of overhead costs. 
Hopefully the new department will be able to deliver the 
services specified in a timely and efficient manner.
<P>
	Another efficiency will be achieved by combining the annual 
report and the estimates. It will make it possible for managers, 
and indeed members of the House, to make decisions more 
effectively and more quickly on whether or not an expenditure is 
being controlled by looking at the consolidated statements.
<P>
	There are two broad principles governments should use. The 
principles have been given to us by the people. The Reform 
Party is articulating the principles on behalf of citizens who 
have not been heard by governments of the past 20 to 40 years. 
The first principle is that governments, civil servants, 
politicians and political parties exist to serve the people. They 
should demonstrate this service at all times.
<P>
	I cannot help but interrupt my speech again to draw the 
attention of the House to a great misunderstanding concerning 
the Reform Party. Several days ago the hon. member for 
Saskatoon-Humboldt gave a rather cute member's statement in 
which she echoed the misinformation broadcast by our 
sometimes untrustworthy CBC. She implied that members of the 
Reform Party were somehow herded along by the leadership of 
the party. The facts are that the leadership of the party and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6394"> 6394 </A></B>
<P>
Reform MPs are driven by the grassroots. Ordinary citizens are 
finding that their voices  are being heard by us. Party policies in 
our party are initiated by the members and the party leadership 
acts as a clearing house to expedite debate and decisions at our 
assembly.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Yes, we believe in service. That is the first principle that 
should pervade all levels of government. It is government of the 
people, for the people, by the people. If we could do a 180 degree 
turn in how governments operate compared to the past and the 
present, perhaps that would be the single most important move 
in restoring the faith of the people in the governments they elect.
<P>
	The second principle is that public money should be regarded 
by governments as funds in trust and governments should 
practise fiscal responsibility. In particular, they should exercise 
the responsibility of balancing expenditures and revenues. 
There are not many issues that upset my constituents more than 
the issue of the burgeoning debt.
<P>
	If we were a board of directors of a public company the 
shareholders would fire us. We are spending 20 per cent more 
every year than we take in. We are headed for financial disaster 
and for bankruptcy. Yes, the shareholders of a company would 
fire the board of directors if that was how they carried on.
<P>
	Indeed, this is what the Canadian people have begun to do. 
They are totally fed up with the flagrant waste of their money by 
governments of the last 20 or 30 years. Beginning in the west 
there is a massive sweep of support for Reform because we are 
promising to balance the budget. We just cannot go on the way 
we are. In some form or another, if not now then in the very near 
future we will have to pay the bills that we have run up.
<P>
	The most unfair transfer of responsibility in this country is the 
intergenerational transfer of debt. We are spending our 
children's inheritance. From our graves we will have to 
apologize to them for giving them the inheritance of such huge 
financial indebtedness that they will not be able to enjoy 
anything near the standard of living that we have stolen from 
them. I am embarrassed to be a member of this generation, 
leaving my children a legacy of profligate overspending, 
exercising no discipline in how we handle our affairs.
<P>
	In speaking to Bill C-52 I believe that we are beginning to 
move in the right direction on these principles. I want to show 
my support and commitment to the principles by helping to hold 
this government accountable for the steps it is taking. I want to 
assume that the motives of the government are honourable. I 
want to assume that it really means it when it says it wants to do 
better.
<P>
	I suppose it is almost impossible to do worse than the 
government that was defeated last fall. But there is always the 
danger that the frail ship can be blown off course. We will be 
there to help and to remind the government to abide by these 
principles.
<P>
	The principle of service to the public should be demonstrated 
by the way that business processes are developed and 
implemented. It should be evident in the way that public 
property is managed, particularly office and warehouse space. It 
should be evident in the way bidding and procurement 
procedures are developed and implemented. It should be evident 
in the way technology will be utilized to increase effectiveness 
and efficiency. Most of all, it should be evident in the way we 
and all civil servants meet the people, the way we talk to them 
and the way we serve them. There should never be an attitude of 
condescension but always an attitude of helpfulness and service.
<P>
	I would add that we should also always have an attitude of 
total honesty and openness, whether it is procurement or 
whether it is talking about the way government influences 
public policy. There should be total openness. It is the people's 
business. The people have the right to know everything.
<P>
	With respect to the second principle I mentioned, the one of 
sound fiscal management and wise use of the limited financial 
resources available, I need to emphasize it is my opinion that we 
are not doing enough here in this bill.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	It is insufficient to merely shuffle the deck to bring together 
two or three departments here and two or three there. It is not 
sufficient to merely reorganize the management tree. We need to 
look very seriously at the functions of government. We need to 
re-examine many things government is doing that is not 
supported by the people. There need to be some cuts. Some 
departments need to be eliminated because there is no longer a 
need or a demand for the functions they provide.
<P>
	Can this be done? Would it be possible for us to discuss this in 
a meaningful, non-emotional way so that we could brainstorm 
our way to some positive solutions?
<P>
	I can think of a number of examples in which we are not 
serving the people well with regard to monetary stewardship. I 
think of the $60 million taken out of the accountability loop by 
the antics of the CCG. I think of the ongoing construction of a 
national GST processing centre in Prince Edward Island at the 
same time as this government is promising to eliminate the GST.
<P>
	I am thinking of some extravagant offices and some 
unacceptable vacancy rates. I am thinking of moneys to crown 
corporations and special operating agencies and the way some of 
them are operating without full accountability. I am thinking 
even of the fact that the collection of hundreds and hundreds of 
smaller 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6395"> 6395 </A></B>
<P>
savings could save millions of dollars for the Canadiantaxpayer.
<P>
	Departmental contracting value for last year was in the order 
of $7.8 billion. The handling of this large amount of tax dollars 
must be treated with great respect. We need to assure the public 
that everything is done out in the open with full disclosure of 
who is getting what and how much they are getting.
<P>
	I wish to conclude by saying that I am personally committed 
to doing my share in influencing the way the government does 
its business. I want the people of Canada to know that in the 
Reform Party and hopefully among the other members of this 
House there are individuals who are deeply committed to doing 
this thing right. We want to treat the people with the respect they 
deserve. We want to stop overtaxing them. We want to serve 
them and we want to be good stewards of the money that they 
entrust to us.
<P>
	I believe that the Canadian public is becoming more and more 
disillusioned with the concept that the government has to do 
everything for everyone. There are more and more people who 
simply want the government to back off and give them some 
freedom to make their own choices and manage their own 
affairs. They want government to do just the minimal things that 
it is not possible for them to do by themselves.
<P>
	The days of thinking that nothing will get done unless the 
government controls and subsidizes or pays for it are over. The 
days are ending when everyone can use the government as a 
means of confiscating the dwindling available earnings of the 
average person to spend at will on whatever project seems to 
meet their fancy.
<P>
	Henry Samtrooke said it well when he referred to the 
rapturous, wild and ineffable pleasure of drinking at somebody 
else's expense. In giving support in principle to Bill C-52, I 
hope that we are beginning to move in the right direction. We 
will be waiting with great interest to observe that this 
government takes it all the way. We want to see that the deficits 
are stopped before its too late.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to be able to follow the two lead critics 
of the Bloc and the Reform Party with respect to this legislation 
because it gives me an opportunity to make a few comments, not 
in an unkind way but to make sure that we understand each other 
and that we are talking from the same base.
<P>
	My colleague from the Reform is supporting this bill and I 
appreciate that. I think it is for many of the right reasons. I want 
to make sure it is understood that the decision to amalgamate 
government had been initiated by the previous government with 
the order in council process. We are undertaking today this 
legislation to affirm that we do have the powers that we thought 
we had.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	It would not be fair to say that we had not done our job. We are 
in fact doing our job. I am not sure that is what he was 
suggesting.
<P>
	I also want to point out that we are open to suggestions. My 
colleague mentioned that he wanted to make some suggestions. 
That is not a problem.
<P>
	A comment was made regarding Canada Post and increased 
postal rates. My colleague will know that Canada Post had 
anticipated that. There was a request made of government and 
that request is being reviewed right now. My minister, the 
minister responsible for Canada Post, is particularly sensitive to 
what the impact might be on small and medium size businesses. 
He will analyse that with his colleagues and look at it very 
carefully before proceeding.
<P>
	The third point that was made was with respect to the deficit 
and the debt. I want to remind my colleague that by the year 
1998, if my memory serves me correctly, the anticipated savings 
with this legislation because of what will be done are in the 
neighbourhood of $180 million and by the year 2000 up to $1 
billion. That is a lot of money and it is going in the direction I 
think he would like, perhaps not as quickly but certainly in the 
right direction on that particular issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois member commented about government 
waste and abuse. He mentioned contracts for Quebec. In a calm 
and generous manner I simply ask him to prove what he is 
saying. Where is the proof? It is so easy to make accusations.
<P>
	The member knows very well that we are now in the process of 
eliminating overlapping and duplication with this bill. If I 
remember correctly this is exactly what some of my colleagues 
from the Bloc are asking. I hope it is not only talk, that they 
really mean it because this bill is tackling the problem of 
overlapping and duplication.
<P>
	I think the member also forgot to mention the large savings 
this will bring about: $205 million by 1998, and one billion by 
the year 2000. I hope he will still be here, as well as myself, to 
see these savings come about.
<P>
	A last comment, to be completely sure there is no 
misunderstanding. Unfortunately, the member gave the 
impression-he is not a bad man, maybe he was influenced by 
somebody else-that the government had been far from 
generous in the allocation of contracts to Quebec. As regards the 
whole question of access to government, openness and 
transparency for the government, the hon. member knows well 
that our open invitations to bid are very transparent and that we 
also have other systems. For the first time in a long while we 
have opened up the process. For the first time in a long while any 
Canadian throughout this vast country can obtain information 
on what the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6396"> 6396 </A></B>
<P>
government needs in terms of goods and services. Therefore 
improvements have been made that I wish to mention.
<P>
	I understand the opposition because I myself was a member of 
the opposition for some time. I may have sometimes 
exaggerated but I think there was gross exaggeration today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to get into my formal remarks. At the conclusion of his 
recent address to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the 
Prime Minister stressed the importance of concentrating on 
providing good government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is what the legislation before the House today seeks to 
achieve. By giving its formal approval to the creation of the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services, 
Parliament goes one step further in offering Canadians 
everywhere good governmental services.
<P>
	The bill brings together in a single department all the service 
agencies of the government in order to streamline government, 
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of services and to 
better meet the needs of Canadians everywhere in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The new department means improved service to other 
government departments and agencies as well as improved 
service to Canadians. Taxpayers save money. Government 
departments have one-stop shopping for all their service needs 
and there is a single window to the government for suppliers and 
contractors across the country.
<P>
	The creation of a new department simplifies the business of 
doing business with the government. It simplifies the process of 
receiving information from the government. Parliament is asked 
to give approval to rolling government service agencies into one 
department and thereby reducing overlap and duplication, 
which is a tremendous way to save money.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works and Government Services 
was formed last year to provide from one source a range of 
essential services in support of all other government programs. 
The amalgamation was achieved by orders in council but this 
bill was required to create the new department in statute. The 
department brings together four common service organizations. 
One major component of the new department is the former 
department of supply and services which was the government's 
internal service organization. The other major component is the 
former public works department which administers a wide range 
of federal buildings and properties. The new department also 
incorporates the former government telecommunications 
agency and the translation bureau.
<P>
	I know that most Canadians have heard the phrase public 
works and government services but I think it is fair to say many 
of them wonder what those phrases mean and exactly what the 
new department does.
<P>
	I would like to take a few moments to outline the 
responsibilities of the new department and to explain how it 
affects the way government operates and how it affects 
Canadians.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works and Government Services is 
the Government of Canada's chief purchasing agent, publisher, 
banker, accountant and paymaster. It provides office 
accommodation, real estate, design and construction, 
telecommunications and translation services for the 
Government of Canada and for other agencies as well.
<P>
	We issue about $200 million payments a year on behalf of the 
Canada Pension Plan, old age security, GST, child tax benefit, 
public service payroll, as well as to our suppliers. We manage 
the government's annual cash flow of $1.4 trillion with an 
average daily balance of $2.7 billion. Certainly one of the most 
popular services is issuing tax refund cheques to Canadians.
<P>
	As the principal purchasing agency for the government the 
department buys some $10 billion worth of products and 
services each year and works on major acquisition projects 
worth another $23 billion. We issue on average 150,000 
contracts to the private sector annually.
<P>
	The department handles the purchase of 17,000 categories of 
goods and services. Our procurement ranges from frigates and 
satellites to medical supplies and food aid, to weather balloons 
and information technology. The department buys for more than 
150 federal departments and agencies.
<P>
	Our new government telecommunications and infomatic 
service is the lead agency in moving the government toward the 
better service and lower costs which can be achieved through 
automation and electronic interaction.
<P>
	Translation is provided in the official languages of Canada 
and some 150 other languages and dialects. Our experts also 
provide interpretation services for some 40 languages including 
sign language. The department fields over 150,000 inquiries 
every year regarding precise terminology.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	You may recall, Mr. Speaker, that I made a statement in the 
House yesterday. On behalf of all my colleagues I spoke in 
praise of the services that interpreters, translators and terminol-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6397"> 6397 </A></B>
<P>
ogists provide us. Their services are very important to us and 
today I wish to stress even more the excellent job they do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The department is the largest real estate agency in Canada, 
providing work spaces for some 150,000 government employees 
across the country. We also run all federal properties under the 
jurisdiction of any other department. We provide a wide variety 
of management, maintenance and improvement services for 
federal properties and facilities. The department holds an 
estimated $6.5 billion of real estate on behalf of the people of 
Canada. The primary holdings are office buildings and common 
use facilities. We are also the custodians of national landmarks 
including the Parliament Buildings where we meet today, 
laboratories, warehouses, residences, bridges, highways, locks, 
dams and dry docks.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Three agencies provide services to public sector 
organizations on an optional fee for service basis. The Canada 
Communication Group offers communication services to 
government departments and agencies. Consulting and Auditing 
Canada's services include the full range of management 
consulting disciplines and specialities. The Canadian General 
Standards Board supports governments and the private sector 
through the development and distribution of standards for 
government and consumer products.
<P>
	As members can see, a tremendous number of services are 
provided by the integrated department. By integrating all of 
these activities into one department we are making it easier for 
Canadians to deal with the government and we are making it 
cheaper for the government to function.
<P>
	In fact the common sense rationalization of activities will 
result in annual savings, as I have indicated before, of some 
$180 million by 1998. We are proving the government can 
reduce costs and improve services to Canadians at the same 
time. This is surely a goal all members of Parliament and all 
Canadians see.
<P>
	The reality is that we are only able to achieve these 
worthwhile objectives through the extremely dedicated work of 
the public servants who have been brought together from other 
departments and agencies into one. Those public servants have 
shown extraordinary commitment to making this new 
department a success and I applaud their efforts.
<P>
	By the time the department is fully integrated, the workforce 
will be reduced from 18,00 full time employees to 14,000. It 
takes a great deal of integrity for people to organize themselves 
out of a job in order to provide better government.
<P>
	As the minister for public service renewal has stated, we can 
and will achieve changes with the absolute minimum of 
dislocation and involuntary lay-offs.
<P>
	I respect the excellent work of the people in this department 
and I understand, as my minister does, that they are real human 
beings with real families, real bills to pay and a real 
commitment to serving the public with integrity. The minister 
and I are determined to treat them with the decency and fairness 
they deserve.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, with your permission I wonder if I could make a 
request. This morning because of medical problem I have, I got 
to my chair a few seconds late and I missed my place, which is 
fair.
<P>
	I wonder if could have the unanimous consent of the House to 
continue?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to allow 
the member to extend his statement by a few minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to add that in creating a 
modern department to serve Canadians better in the years ahead, 
we have also used the opportunity to bring forward legislation 
that is modern and up to date. The bill before the House of 
Commons reflects existing legislation and operational practices 
of the government. To put this in context, the DSS act dates back 
to 1967 and the Department of Public Works Act to 1867. That is 
even older than I am. This legislation must be modernized and 
brought into the 1990s.
<P>
	The problem with making jokes about age is that some people 
agree it is probably true.
<P>
	What we have done in preparing this bill is to eliminate 
unnecessary or antiquated sections of previous legislation 
which no longer make any sense in 1994. For example, in the 
Department of Public Works Act there is a long and detailed 
description of public works. It has been eliminated. We have 
modernized the legislative responsibilities of the department to 
reflect technological changes which have occurred in our 
society.
<P>
	For example, the DSS act referred to data processing services. 
We have changed it to information management and information 
technology systems and services.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	We have also eliminated old rules which added meaningless 
red tape to our efforts to provide responsive and affordable 
service to Canadians. For example, we have deleted the section 
requiring the tabling of an annual report as we are now 
producing a detailed report on the department's operations as 
part of our main estimates.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6398"> 6398 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to assure members of Parliament that the legislation 
before them is based on powers contained in the existing 
legislation and that any changes are straightforward, common 
sense changes to which I am confident every Canadian would 
agree.
<P>
	Without getting into cumbersome detail, I would like to point 
out some highlights of the legislation to members. This bill 
gives legislative approval to the department to create, oversee or 
transfer information electronically or by other new 
technologies. That is the kind of common sense change I was 
talking about. The point is to reflect today's world. When the 
government started centralized procurement policies in the 
1960s nobody had heard of the information highway or personal 
computers.
<P>
	Bill C-52 also creates a real property disposition revolving 
fund. The new fund will simply permit expenditures made in 
selling off property to be paid from the proceeds of the sale. 
Right now Parliament provides a specific amount each year for 
these expenditures. The problem is that it is extremely difficult 
to know what sales opportunities may come along in any given 
year. Any annual appropriation by Parliament in the past was 
based on a guess. The new revolving fund corrects this situation 
and makes sure that the department's hands are not tied if the 
chance arises to dispose of excess property at a fair price.
<P>
	There are other sections of the bill which I think will not be 
matters of great debate but which do represent key 
modifications and improvements to the way the department can 
operate. The new legislation improves upon the legislation it 
replaces by providing greater flexibility and the removal of 
administrative impediments to better service for Canadians.
<P>
	As we stated in the red book, the government will work 
closely with provincial governments to reduce duplication and 
improve service delivery in all areas where governments are 
involved. Under current law, officials on the supply and services 
side are only permitted to share our purchasing power with other 
levels of government after first seeking governor in council 
approval. The public works side does not have this explicit 
authority.
<P>
	The current law does not allow the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services to use its size, expertise and 
contacts in assisting Canadian businesses to move them to new 
world markets. The bill before Parliament will allow the 
department to change all of those practices and to continue to 
move forward in ensuring that taxpayers get the best bang for 
their buck by ensuring that we can provide more help to 
Canadians. This is totally in line with what we laid out in the red 
book. We have done what we said we would do.
<P>
	I do not want to take advantage of my colleague's generosity 
this afternoon so I want to make a few more comments and bring 
this to an end. I point out to my colleagues that this change is 
needed in order to make  absolutely certain that we have the 
legislative authority to operate as a department should.
<P>
	I want to stress that this legislative change is as a result of an 
action undertaken by a previous government so we are doing 
what the previous government might have done. I want to stress 
that this particular change will remove obstacles to good 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I said earlier, duplication and overlap will gradually be 
eliminated, which will allow us to save $140 million by 1998 
and $1 billion by the year 2000.
<P>
	I am almost finished. I do not want to prolong this unduly. I 
hope that I will not only get the support of Reform Party 
members, who indicated in a clear and honest way that they were 
ready to look at the bill with an open heart and an open mind, but 
that the hon. members from the Bloc will agree to reconsider 
what they said this morning and perhaps propose amendments 
that could improve the bill instead of simply making 
unsupported attacks against it. This is not the way one should 
react.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
just heard an absolutely wonderful speech. You would think this 
is the best department in Ottawa. The problem is, I had the 
opportunity to work in this committee of public works and 
government services and I was also the official critic.
<P>
	I can tell you that there is no openness in that department. The 
hon. member for St. Boniface made a big show of it, but the truth 
is we never got what we wanted. Every day we asked for 
information, but this department was never forthcoming. This is 
the patronage department. Let us be clear on that, there is no 
hiding it, this is a fact.
<P>
	The hon. member for St. Boniface is nodding in approval, how 
very interesting. I know you want to answer my question, so I 
will give you the opportunity to do so.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we introduced a motion to amend this bill. I hope 
the hon. member for St. Boniface will take it into account and 
not launch into another one of those dramatic speeches he makes 
every time he takes the floor in the House. I hope he will also try 
to improve this department where there is no openness 
whatsoever, but a great deal of patronage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comment a great 
deal. I realize that the hon. member is the official critic and that 
she was not always satisfied with the answers she received.
<P>
	I realize also that she is not entirely right. We received a lot of 
information. It was sometimes difficult to understand it all, 
since there was so much of it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6399"> 6399 </A></B>
<P>
	It is Friday afternoon, so I will be kind. This is nevertheless 
an unsupported attack. The hon. member was the official critic. 
She could have provided us with concrete examples showing 
where she saw a lack of openness. But she did not do it, she 
just attacked the department without backing up her allegations.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, the day 
Public Works and Government Services Canada becomes really 
open, really very clear and transparent will be a day of 
celebration for me.
<P>
	I am very pleased to take part in this debate on Bill C-52, an 
act to establish the Department of Public works and Government 
Services. As I said earlier, until just recently I had the privilege 
of being the Official Opposition critic for this department and as 
such I had the opportunity to discuss matters with its hon. 
minister.
<P>
	I would like to share with you today what I know about this 
department and what changes should be made to make it more 
transparent, more open and more accessible to all taxpayers who 
wish either to receive information on its activities or do business 
with it.
<P>
	I understand, when one is in opposition one tends to 
exaggerate-I was there, and maybe I did exaggerate a few 
times. I will try not to do it now. I will give my total, sincere and 
deep commitment to do my best to improve the openness of this 
department. I understand that there is room for improvement, 
but I intend to do everything I can to increase the degree of 
openness and try to answer honestly the question of my 
colleagues, including the hon. member who just spoke.
<P>
	All of us in this House will agree that, either way, these are 
legitimate demands on the part of the taxpayers and they should 
not be ignored in a cavalier fashion. This bill should ensure that 
the various demands of the taxpayers can be met, but this is not 
the case. The only thing the enactment does is to merge two 
former departments-a process which incidentally was initiated 
by the Conservatives-as well as various government agencies.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Section 5 of the bill states that this new department shall 
operate as a common service agency for the Government of 
Canada, and its activities as a common service agency shall be 
directed mainly toward providing the departments, boards and 
agencies of the Government of Canada with services in support 
of their programs.
<P>
	Basically, this department is responsible for the acquisition 
and provision of goods and services for all departments of the 
Government of Canada. It negotiates, buys and rents an 
impressive number of goods and services for other departments. 
Last year it negotiated 170,000 public contracts. That is rather 
impressive.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for Laurentides and 
parliamentarian responsible for taxpayers' money as well as a 
taxpayer myself, I want to know everything there is to 
know-and I mean everything-about the tens of thousands of 
government contracts negotiated by this  department every year. 
It is the taxpayers' money that the government spends; it is 
therefore accountable to them for its use.
<P>
	Unfortunately, there is nothing in this bill about how these 
contracts should be accounted for in all the relevant information 
made available to the public. The government sticks to its old 
ways and continues to be secretive. This government refuses to 
make information readily available. That is very clear, but also 
quite sad. It shows mainly that the government is scared to 
death, scared of getting caught spending the taxpayers' money 
improperly.
<P>
	By leaving out of this bill a provision to divulge automatically 
all information in contracts, the government perpetuates the 
widespread opinion that the department still indulges in 
patronage, and awards thousands of contracts under the pressure 
of lobbyists, friends of the government, or people who 
contribute to the funding of the old parties. Failure to take action 
to change this general opinion could prove in part that it is well 
founded.
<P>
	To leave the minister and bureaucrats free to conceal or to 
divulge information clearly indicates that the system does not 
meet the basic expectations of a democratic society. Letting the 
minister decide whether Canadians should know how their tax 
dollars are spent seems contrary to the transparent and open 
government that Liberals have been promising since they 
crossed the floor.
<P>
	The Liberal government is no better than its Conservative 
predecessor, that it once denounced so vehemently. Members 
opposite are backing down. They have lost the backbone that 
made them so brave when they formed the official opposition 
and during the election. The members opposite are going back 
on the commitments they made in their red bible. Transparency 
and openness no longer figure in their vocabulary. First it was 
the red bible, now they dress in red and follow their great leader, 
the Minister of Public Works, Santa Claus personified, the main 
purveyor of government contracts who keeps his secrets to 
himself and silences his little elves gathered round him, across 
the aisle.
<P>
	This bill is nothing but a formality, an insipid document 
which again hands taxpayers over to the minister and those in 
high places under his control. With this bill, the government is 
saying to taxpayers: ``The minister spends your money but this 
is none of your business''. To use an expression made famous by 
our illustrious Minister of Transport: ``If you taxpayers want to 
know to whom, and how, contracts are awarded, use the Access 
to Information Act''.
<P>
	Why make it so difficult to have access to that information? In 
recent months, I have tried to pressure the minister into setting 
up a rational system to disclose contracts awarded. I even tabled 
a motion asking the minister to disclose, on a monthly basis, all 
government contracts awarded. Such a system could even be  
established for all departments awarding numerous contracts. 
The minister replied that this monthly disclosure was 
unnecessary, since all the information is already available and 
ordinary citizens can find out anything they want about 
government contracts. How insulting from the minister! This 
answer shows that the minister has no respect for us. It is wrong 
to claim that 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6400"> 6400 </A></B>
<P>
the information is available and accessible. As evidence of that, 
I have specific requests for information on contracts awarded to 
entrepreneurs in my riding which have remained unanswered for 
more than two months now.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	What is even worse is the fact that recently all Bloc Quebecois 
members were refused access to a list of government contracts 
awarded in their respective ridings during the last year. This 
refusal from the minister and the Liberal government to provide 
that information to members is, in my opinion, a very serious 
violation of their right to information.
<P>
	Indeed, how can an elected member, even if he is a minister, 
deny other elected members the right to know what is going on 
in their respective ridings? This behaviour is totally 
unacceptable and is exactly why people continue to believe that 
politicians and civil servants award contracts only to friends of 
the government and to contractors offering the biggest bribes.
<P>
	The minister must explain why he refused to provide the Bloc 
members with the information they asked for. For the time 
being, he argues that it would cost $160,000 and that he is not 
equipped to provide the list of contracts required. Come on, with 
everyone talking about the electronic highway, no one can 
seriously claim that it is impossible to collect, code and release 
this information according to some specifications.
<P>
	With all the computer equipment the government buys, I think 
it is a bit far-fetched to try to make us believe that all that work 
is still done by hand in the department.
<P>
	I also think that this amount of $160,000 is part and parcel of 
the administration and operating costs of the department. I do 
not see how these costs can be considered as additional 
expenses.
<P>
	Given the minister's refusal, we believe he is trying to hide 
something. He knows full well that his department is not known 
for its integrity and transparency. He also knows that the 
department does not distribute federal funds fairly among the 
various regions and provinces. The federal government must 
play fair and distribute Canada's wealth so as to support 
development in each and every region of the country.
<P>
	However, statistics clearly indicate that the federal 
government supports some regions more than others. For 
example, the city of Ottawa alone received almost 99 per cent of 
all contracts awarded by the government in 1993 for the Ottawa 
region, while its twin city, Hull, across the river, made do with a 
meagre 1 per cent.
<P>
	That is a harsh reality for those who believe blindly in this 
supposedly fair federal system. Federalists and centralists will 
surely find reasons, legitimate or not, to explain these statistics 
indicating such an extraordinary concentration of contracts.
<P>
	In the view of the Bloc Quebecois, this imbalance could be 
corrected if all contracts were made public. Thus, small and 
large contractors would know which goods and services the 
government needs. And knowing this, they might want to do 
business with the government. Moreover, all this information 
would force the government to show greater fairness in the 
contracting process. Furthermore, the government should even 
support and help potential suppliers in neglected areas, thus 
creating growth and jobs where they are urgently needed. Is job 
creation the main goal of the federal government or not?
<P>
	It is about time that the government show some openness in 
the allocation of contracts, not only in the department we are 
talking about today but in all departments. There are means to 
achieve this and the Bloc is proposing some.
<P>
	Ministers across the aisle always beg us to suggest new ideas 
and new ways of doing things. Well, here they are.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member will still have nine 
minutes next time this motion is debated.
<P>
	It being 1.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should enact legislation 
which will protect children from pedophiles by allowing members of the 
National Parole Board to enforce the long term incarceration of offenders whom 
they feel may reoffend.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to 
speak on Motion No. 305 which calls upon the government to 
introduce legislation which will allow for the post-sentence 
detention of child sex offenders who are likely to reoffend upon 
release from prison.
<P>
	Motion No. 305 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6401"> 6401 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should enact legislation which 
will protect children from pedophiles by allowing members of the National Parole 
Board to enforce the long term incarceration of offenders whom they feel may 
reoffend.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I begin by sharing the story behind the motion with my hon. 
colleagues. In June 1988, 11-year old Christopher Stephenson 
was abducted from a Brampton shopping mall by 45-year old 
Joseph Fredericks, a repeat child sex offender who was known 
by criminal justice officials to be in a dangerous state of mind. 
Fredericks murdered Christopher.
<P>
	The details of this need not be recounted here. Rather we must 
focus on action which we as legislators can take to prevent a 
similar tragedy from occurring. The loss of Christopher's life 
was both needless and preventable. This is apparent to anyone 
who takes a moment to review the recommendations made by 
the inquest that looked into Christopher's death.
<P>
	Those recommendations, collectively called the Stephenson 
report, tell us that corrections officials knew that Mr. Fredericks 
was dangerous when he was released. They knew that he was 
certain to reoffend. They just could not do anything about it. The 
legislative authority required to keep Mr. Fredericks in prison 
simply did not exist despite the fact that he was a certified 
psychopath.
<P>
	It is within the authority of the House to enact such 
legislation. It is within the authority of the House to empower 
corrections officials to act to keep people like Mr. Fredericks off 
the streets as long as they pose a threat to our children. That is 
what the motion seeks to do.
<P>
	Motion No. 305 calls on the government to enact legislation 
which will empower the National Parole Board to keep child sex 
offenders who are likely to reoffend upon release incarcerated 
beyond the term of their sentence. This was a key 
recommendation of the Stephenson inquest and it came at a high 
price.
<P>
	When we look at the statistics surrounding child sex offenders 
it is clear that many Canadians are affected by this horrible 
crime. Fifty-three per cent of all females and thirty-one per cent 
of all males are victims of unwanted sexual acts. Eighty per cent 
of these incidents occurred when they were children or youth. A 
full sixty-three per cent of victims in all sexual assaults 
reported to the police are young people under the age of 18. 
Canadian children are prime targets for sex offenders and it is 
time that we took action to ensure their safety.
<P>
	The magnitude of the task is apparent when we look at the 
profile of child sex offenders. In eight out of ten cases the 
offenders are either related or known to the victims. They 
occupy positions of trust in the lives of their victims. It is 
therefore no surprise that a sexual assault against a child often 
goes unreported.
<P>
	One study estimates that for every incident of reported child 
sex abuse two and a half go unreported. Abusers will often 
threaten the children, thus making them too afraid to report the 
offence. Other times the offender will persuade the child that the 
sexual acts are part of any loving relationship and are perfectly 
acceptable.
<P>
	Because of the power offenders often enjoy over their victims, 
their abuse often goes unreported. That is why it is crucial that 
we act in an effective manner toward child sex offenders when a 
child has the courage to speak out about abuse.
<P>
	Current legislation does not allow for truly effective action 
against child sex offenders. Existing provisions of the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act allow for the release of 
offenders upon completion of two-thirds of their sentence.
<P>
	Amendments proposed by Bill C-45, which was before the 
House for first reading last week, would allow the National 
Parole Board to deny the release of offenders if it feels that they 
will reoffend within the term of their sentence. Bill C-45 is a 
giant leap forward in the fight against child sex offenders, but 
more needs to be done.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I do not wish to understate the importance of the amendments 
contained in Bill C-45. By removing the requirement to prove 
serious harm in order to deny parole to a child sex offender, we 
are giving the National Parole Board a very important 
instrument in the battle to protect our children.
<P>
	The serious harm provision was removed out of a recognition 
that the effects of abuse on children are often not apparent for 
some time and that a unique sentencing procedure would have to 
be enacted to deal with child sex offenders.
<P>
	It is precisely because Bill C-45 employs a non-traditional 
sentencing procedure that it is so progressive. Traditional 
sentencing procedures are simply not effective with respect to 
child sex offenders who have one of the highest reoffence rates 
in any criminal group. Studies show that 40 per cent of sex 
offenders reoffend within five years of being released from 
incarceration.
<P>
	I believe it is time we took an even bigger step toward 
effectively addressing this horrible crime. I believe 
post-sentence detentions are the means to take this step. By 
keeping these offenders incarcerated as long as they are likely to 
reoffend we are acting in a constructive, progressive manner. It 
allows us to link punishment with rehabilitation.
<P>
	The change in sentencing philosophy is long overdue. We 
need to send a message loud and clear that punishment is not just 
serving time. It is more than that. In order for punishment to 
have been completed convicted offenders must not be in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6402"> 6402 </A></B>
<P>
same state of mind as they were when they entered prison. They 
cannot simply leave after serving time. If they are likely  to 
reoffend upon release, they must remain in prison and receive 
further treatment. Through the change in philosophy we are 
saying that what offenders do in prison is as important as the 
length of time they stay there.
<P>
	Because the model of post-sentence detention is constructive 
and progressive and looks after the well-being of the offender in 
the interest of protecting society, it poses a particular challenge 
for the criminal justice system.
<P>
	There is no cure for whatever causes an individual to sexually 
assault a child. However treatment is available with limited 
success. One study conducted in Europe identified the reoffence 
rate of child sex offenders as being in the range of 25 per cent. 
The same study found that with treatment the reoffence rate 
dropped by 10 to 15 per cent. This reoffence rate is still too high, 
but any improvement is encouraging.
<P>
	The reality is that sometimes any amount of treatment does 
not help. According to the Stephenson report the treatment 
which Joseph Fredericks received was counterproductive. 
Post-sentence detention would not have helped to improve Mr. 
Fredericks' condition, but it would have empowered the 
National Parole Board to save a very precious life by keeping 
him off the streets.
<P>
	There is nationwide support for legislation introducing 
post-sentencing detention procedures for child sex offenders. 
Earlier today I presented a petition that Mrs. Carole Horan 
began. The wording of my motion is actually very similar to that 
of Mrs. Horan's petition. The petition began as a local initiative 
and soon began circulating across the country. The petition was 
only in circulation for six months. I was pleased to table it in the 
House. It contains 6,100 signatures of Canadians from across 
the country, and no doubt across the political spectrum, who feel 
it is time that an effective post-sentence detention mechanism 
was introduced.
<P>
	Recent initiatives to enact the post-sentence detention of 
child sex offenders have not adequately addressed the problems 
which child sex offenders pose to society. I am referring to a 
draft bill circulated by the previous government and 
reintroduced in Parliament by the member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley as Bill C-240.
<P>
	That legislation would amend the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act and remove the provisions that restrict 
the application of a dangerous offender finding to the sentencing 
court only. That means offenders would be declared dangerous 
offenders after having completed their sentence and 
incarcerated indefinitely, subject to periodic reviews to 
determine whether they still fit the dangerous offender category.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	While I sincerely appreciate and share the concerns of the 
hon. member, I respectfully submit that Bill C-240 is too narrow 
in its application to child sex offenders to be a truly effective 
piece of legislation.
<P>
	Bill C-240 would not have the wide ranging power to enforce 
post-sentence detention which most of us would like to see. This 
is due to provisions found in clauses 16 and 26 of the legislation 
that have the effect of restricting the number of applications for 
post-sentence detention that would be approved.
<P>
	Clause 16 empowers Correctional Service Canada to identify 
offenders who it feels may reoffend and refer them to the 
National Parole Board. If the board concurs with Correctional 
Service Canada, clause 26 allows it to refer the case to the 
appropriate provincial attorney general who may proceed with 
the case before a court. This procedure would apply to a very 
small number of individuals because in order for Correctional 
Service Canada and the National Parole Board to take steps to 
apply a dangerous offender finding, evidence must be presented 
that could not reasonably have been presented to the court that 
sentenced the offender.
<P>
	This is a problem for detaining child sex offenders who we 
know will reoffend. Often the only evidence that can be 
presented, and the only evidence that should have to be 
presented, is that they are of a state of mind to commit the same 
crime again. However it is the same state of mind with which 
they entered prison so it does not qualify as new evidence. We 
need to be clear in saying that part of the original punishment for 
child sex offenders is that they cannot be of the same state of 
mind when they leave prison as when they entered.
<P>
	Some would argue that this philosophy of sentencing runs 
counter to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Specifically they 
would argue that section 11(h) of the charter, which prevents an 
individual from being punished twice for the same crime, 
prohibits the enactment of any post-sentence detention scheme.
<P>
	The courts have been clear in declaring that post-sentence 
detention is not a violation of individual rights under the charter. 
They have ruled that the dangerous offender designation of the 
Criminal Code which allows for the indefinite incarceration of 
an offender is primarily in the public interest and is not a 
violation of an individual's charter rights.
<P>
	I refer to the 1987 decision of the Manitoba Court of Queen's 
Bench in Regina <I>v.</I> Lithium. The court ruled that in dangerous 
offender applications under the Criminal Code the public 
interest is a primary concern and that the specific object of the 
provision is to protect society from an offender who had been 
convicted of a serious personal injury offence and who had 
shown a propensity for violent crimes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6403"> 6403 </A></B>
<P>
	In its precedent setting decision the Manitoba Court of 
Queen's Bench clearly stated that post-sentence detention in 
the case of dangerous offender provisions is in the public 
interest because it serves a protective function. The court 
recognized that the charter exists to protect the freedoms of all 
Canadians. Post-sentence detention should be viewed as an 
instrument for promoting the safety of Canadians.
<P>
	The model of post-sentence detention for which I have argued 
today goes beyond existing dangerous offender provisions and 
is not only in the best interest of society but of the offender 
through the provision of rehabilitative treatment.
<P>
	Many of these offences occur when people are on parole. We 
look for someone to blame and we often blame the parole board. 
I was on the provincial parole board. Many times we had to make 
a decision on releasing an offender whom we were not too sure 
about. If we have two-thirds of the sentence, or even if it is a 
three-year sentence, when we have people in front of the parole 
board who may reoffend do we let them out or not? Many times 
they are let out because the parole board feels they are going to 
be let out anyway and it is better they be let out under 
supervision. This gives the parole board more authority to hold 
these people.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I would like to emphasize that the legislation 
which this motion directs the government to introduce is long 
overdue. The post-sentence detention of child sex offenders 
who are likely to reoffend upon release is sound, responsible 
policy. When dealing with legislation or directives to introduce 
legislation we must always ask ourselves what kind of statement 
the proposed legislation makes about society. We must always 
be sure that this action is focused on the problem it is meant to 
address, effective in dealing with this problem and in the 
interests of all Canadians.
<P>
	I believe that Motion No. 305 fulfils all of these criteria. It 
says that we as a society care about the safety and well-being of 
our children and that we want to protect them from sex 
offenders. It proposes that the government enact legislation 
which will protect our children by imposing the post-sentence 
detention of offenders who are likely to reoffend.
<P>
	It says that this action is in the best interests of all Canadians 
because it moves to assist not only those individuals who need 
rehabilitative help but those Canadians who need protection 
from these offenders.
<P>
	Given the importance which passage of this motion has for the 
safety and well-being of all children in Canada, I request leave 
of the House to give unanimous consent for this motion to be 
deemed votable.

to discuss a very important topic, and as far as I am concerned, I 
felt that the motion as drafted was entirely acceptable and could 
have been referred to a committee for consideration.
<P>
	The hon. member gave us an excellent and carefully crafted 
speech on the threat that child sex offenders represent to society. 
There are of course certain aspects I would like to discuss with 
the hon. member. I said this week, and it is my conviction, that 
there are various ways of expressing one's sexuality. When I say 
various ways, I do not include pedophilia, because I believe a 
sexual relationship should involve consenting partners, those 
partners being adults. Clearly, when pedophilia is involved, one 
partner is in a position of power and dominates the other, and 
there is also the exploitation aspect.
<P>
	As Quebecers and Canadians we are right to be concerned 
about pedophiles being at large. We could, of course, talk about 
why some people in our society are pedophiles. A number of 
theories, including psychoanalytic assumptions, the frustration 
concept and the behaviourist approach are used to explain this 
phenomenon. The fact remains that as legislators we have a 
responsibility, as the hon. member for Brampton said, to take the 
corrective action that is necessary. That is why I am glad she has 
drawn the attention of the House to one of the aspects of this 
problem.
<P>
	However, I thought that the hon. member, being on the 
government side, would have shown more support for the 
contents of Bill C-45. I may have misread the bill, however, and 
that is why I would like to discuss it with her, because I 
understood that Bill C-45-I know we have some people with us 
this afternoon who are familiar with the mechanics of the bill-I 
thought that Bill C-45 gave the National Parole Board the option 
of extending sentences.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I thought that Bill C-45, in two specific cases that I will refer 
to precisely, allowed for a criminal to be found to be dangerous 
and not eligible for a reduced sentence or parole. As I 
understood it, criminals convicted of sexual crimes are almost 
automatically determined to be dangerous and it is extremely 
difficult for them to obtain a reduced sentence or a conditional 
discharge.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6404"> 6404 </A></B>
<P>
	The opposition parties support Bill C-45 on the whole, but, 
as my colleague, the member for Saint-Hubert explained, we 
do have some reservations about the mechanics of its 
application. I thought that Bill C-45 authorized the National 
Parole Board to refuse parole provided two conditions were 
met.
<P>
	First, the convict would have committed a criminal act 
causing serious harm to the victim, and second, that harm would 
be related to a crime of a sexual nature. Naturally, I am not a 
lawyer, and with all due respect for lawyers I certainly do not 
think I am a lesser person for that, but I was under the 
impression that Bill C-45 was a proper answer to the motion. It 
would have been interesting to have the member for Brampton 
explain why Bill C-45 does not deal entirely with her motion.
<P>
	Some of the people who talked to me about this motion, put by 
the member for Brampton, were concerned that it might turn a 
quasi-administrative body into a tribunal. I repeat that we 
support the basic principle of the motion. It is truly the duty of 
the Canadian society, and of all other societies, to protect 
children from possible contacts with pedophiles.
<P>
	According to our present legal system, a judge may impose 
life-long sentences to offenders guilty of criminal acts.  Judges 
already have that authority. Naturally, I believe we should exert 
pressures and stir public opinion on this issue so that the judges 
themselves impose sanctions like the one suggested by the 
member for Brampton.
<P>
	Some people worry about the possibility that this authority 
could be assumed by a quasi-administrative body which was not 
a count. We all recognize that we must believe in rehabilitation. 
Otherwise, it would mean that some individuals are born bad.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to air my views on the topic when we 
reviewed the Young Offenders Act. Personally, I do not believe 
that individuals are born bad, mean, devious, criminal or 
obsessed. I believe that they become that way due to a 
combination of factors, especially social, environmental and 
family factors.
<P>
	The motion presented by the member for Brampton caused 
concern because historically, in our justice system, parole has 
been considered as the best road to rehabilitation. I understand 
the member for Brampton and I respect her point of view. I do 
not claim to have the answer. It may be that pedophiles, contrary 
to other criminals, cannot be rehabilitated, and I would have 
liked her to expand a bit on this point.
<P>
	As legislators we must be aware that in our justice system 
parole has always been considered as the very best road to 
rehabilitation.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	This is the reason why the Canadian Police Association, 
whose objectives are the same as the member for Brampton and 
most legislators, namely to make Canadian society more secure, 
would have felt  more comfortable with some kind of life parole. 
This way, we would recognize that pedophilia is a threat to be 
taken seriously, that it has nothing to do with homosexuality, 
that it is not a way to express one's sexuality but an offence, a 
criminal act which should absolutely not be encouraged.
<P>
	Of course, as legislators, we can try to understand what turns 
someone into a pedophile, but our first duty-and again I want 
to thank the hon. member for Brampton for drawing our 
attention to this issue-is to protect the public. Would it have 
not been possible, as suggested by the Canadian Police 
Association, where pedophiles are concerned, to combine jail 
sentences with more severe controls and what we called parole 
for life, which requires offenders to report to their parole 
officers, live in designated areas and refrain from any contact 
with children?
<P>
	Anyway, I support the initiative of the hon. member for 
Brampton as well as her motion and I thank the Chair for letting 
me complete my speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to and in support of this 
motion. I believe that my hon. colleague from Brampton is 
introducing an issue of great concern to all Canadians.
<P>
	I know that when I raised my children I did not have to worry 
or I never gave any thought as to whether they were outside in 
my yard playing by themselves, whether they were at the corner 
park or whether they were at the hospital grounds playing. I did 
not feel a need to be watching over them every minute. I find this 
attitude has certainly changed over the last number of years. 
Parents are terrified to let their children out of their sight. They 
walk them to school and they sit and watch them play at a 
playground.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Brampton has indicated that 
Canadians want something to happen to those people who prey 
on children. I believe that what she wants is to get them and to 
keep them off the streets so that our children are free again to 
wander without parents watching over every move.
<P>
	The government missed a golden opportunity with Bill C-45. 
It could have incorporated this in that bill. I feel that it did lose 
an opportunity there. I would hope when the committee is 
reviewing it gives consideration to the concern that has been 
raised in the House this afternoon.
<P>
	I feel Bill C-45 does eliminate the need to prove that sex 
offenders who victimize children have to commit serious harm 
to be considered dangerous offenders. I feel that is a good thing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6405"> 6405 </A></B>
<P>
	When it comes to the issue of post-sentence detention this 
government decided to avoid the issue by making it a subject 
for provincial health authorities to deal with. I know from an 
incident that happened in our province of B.C. not too long ago 
that the provincial health authorities do not have the ability to 
keep dangerous offenders off the street.
<P>
	We saw a dangerous offender walk away from a provincial 
hospital because the two guards did not have the authority to 
stop him. I do not think that is what Canadians are looking for.
<P>
	I think there is a better way and that is to enable the National 
Parole Board to apply to the courts for a dangerous offender 
designation. That is what my private member's bill, C-240, 
tried to do. I disagree with my hon. colleague. I feel that Bill 
C-240 does allow some flexibility and would address the 
problem of pedophiles.
<P>
	It allows the correction and parole board members to apply to 
the appropriate provincial attorney general and to initiate a 
dangerous offender application for those inmates who they 
believe will reoffend, not necessarily just pedophiles but also 
adult sexual offenders, but it does include pedophiles who they 
feel will reoffend.
<P>
	Like Bill C-45 it also removes the need to prove the 
likelihood of causing serious harm in the case of pedophiles. 
This is exactly the type of legislation the member for Brampton 
is looking for in her motion.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the two members of the Liberal caucus who 
spoke to Bill C-240 during its first hour of debate did not speak 
in favour of it. I know the member is sincere in her efforts to 
motivate the government to take action on this matter. Perhaps 
she can speak to her colleagues and reconsider her own belief 
that by passing C-240 it would allow these changes to be made 
possible. I believe that Bill C-240 would accomplish that which 
she is seeking.
<P>
	Over the summer months I had the opportunity to tour a 
number of penitentiaries in British Columbia. One of them, 
Mountain Institution in Agassiz, has an inmate population that 
is largely sex offenders. I had an opportunity to discuss one of 
the ongoing treatment plans. The five month program is 
extensive but only works on the outside if the released inmate is 
under community supervision.
<P>
	The therapist advised me there was one situation where the 
parole officer observed that one of the parolees was falling back 
into his crime cycle. It was only because he was a parolee and 
under community supervision that they were able to revoke his 
parole and reincarcerate him. This action probably prevented 
another sexual assault from occurring.
<P>
	On the other hand we have a case like Larry Fisher who 
ironically was released from the same prison earlier this year. 
He was convicted of raping seven women. He was deemed to be 
so dangerous that he spent his entire  sentence behind bars. He 
served 23 years before he walked out free because he had 
fulfilled his full sentence.
<P>
	Larry Fisher is currently out there with absolutely no 
community supervision. One day he is an inmate whom the 
experts consider too dangerous to be released and the next day 
he is a completely free man. There is something wrong with a 
system that prevents society from protecting itself from the 
worst type of sexual behaviour.
<P>
	I agree completely with the member for Brampton that the 
National Parole Board has to have the ability to keep dangerous 
pedophiles off the streets of Canada. Experts on pedophilia 
agree that the chances of ever completely curing a pedophile are 
remote. Convicted pedophiles and other dangerous offenders 
should be kept incarcerated as long as they pose a threat to 
reoffend. If this turns out to be an indefinite sentence, so be it. 
We should feel no obligation to release any dangerous offender 
who is likely to reoffend.
<P>
	Even when we reach the point at which the experts believe 
that the chances to reoffend are low, there must be community 
supervision. This way if a parole officer believes there is a 
likelihood of an offender committing another sex crime his 
parole can be revoked. For those offenders who have shown that 
they have adapted well and are of little risk, the reporting 
conditions of their parole could be minimal.
<P>
	What we need is a bill that would keep pedophiles and other 
dangerous offenders incarcerated as long as they are likely to 
reoffend and a bill that would provide for lengthy 
post-incarceration community supervision to ensure that once 
these individuals are released their activities on the outside are 
closely monitored. This combination will provide society with 
the greatest amount of protection.
<P>
	I repeat that this legislation can be found in Bill C-240, my 
private member's bill. I respectfully ask the member for 
Brampton and all those who support her motion to likewise 
support my private member's bill which could bring this motion 
to fruition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to speak to Motion No. 305 proposed by the member 
for Brampton.
<P>
	There is no doubt our criminal justice system is flawed when 
it comes to dealing with high risk offenders, in particular sex 
offenders who prey on young children.
<P>
	There have been several tragic cases in the past few years 
which have exposed terrible problems of how the justice system 
deals with sexual predators, but perhaps the most tragic is the 
case of Christopher Stephenson.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	The criminal justice system failed 11-year old Christopher 
Stephenson of Brampton in 1988 when it released Joseph 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6406"> 6406 </A></B>
<P>
Fredericks onto the streets. Christopher Stephenson was 
abducted at knifepoint from the Shoppers World mall in 
Brampton on June 17, 1988 by Joseph Fredericks, a known 
pedophile and psychopath.
<P>
	Fredericks had spent his childhood in foster homes, his teens 
in an institution for the severely retarded, although he was not 
actually retarded, 24 years of his adulthood in a hospital for the 
criminally insane, and his middle age in Ontario prisons. This 
man who repeatedly raped, tortured and then murdered 
Christopher Stephenson on June 17, 1988 had been given early 
release from Warkworth Institution after the National Parole 
Board and Corrections Canada ignored an Ottawa judge's 
warning not to release him without psychiatric reassessment and 
extensive monitoring.
<P>
	To make matters even worse, it was revealed during the 
inquest into Christopher's death that the prison psychologist 
believed there was a high probability that Fredericks would 
reoffend, but he crossed his fingers when he dropped Fredericks 
off in Brampton. A criminal justice system that simply crosses 
its fingers and hopes that a psychopath will not reoffend does not 
serve the interests of Canadians. In particular it does not serve 
the interests of young, innocent children like Christopher 
Stephenson.
<P>
	We must make the necessary changes to ensure that such 
tragedies are not repeated.
<P>
	Several years following Christopher's murder an inquest into 
his death was held by the ministry of the solicitor general in the 
province of Ontario. The inquest jury made 71 
recommendations, the first of which was that legislation be 
enacted to ``provide for the protection of the community by 
permitting the continued detention of sexually violent predators 
beyond the expiry of their sentence and to provide treatment 
during their confinement''.
<P>
	The jury also recommended that legislation be modelled on 
the Washington state protection act of 1990, a law that allows 
the attorney general to launch court proceedings against an 
individual even if that individual has been released from jail, to 
commit him to a special facility, possibly for life. While the 
Washington state act was considered to be somewhat extreme by 
Canadian standards, members may recall that in the dying days 
of its administration the Conservative government introduced 
legislation to deal with high risk offenders.
<P>
	That particular bill proposed to allow the National Parole 
Board to detain any inmate believed likely to commit a sexual 
offence involving a child before the expiry of their original 
sentence. The bill in question was of course lost when the 
federal election was called.
<P>
	The time has come to introduce new legislation to deal with 
this serious problem. My colleague's motion echoes the 
recommendation of the inquest jury that legislation is needed.
<P>
	There have been many proposals for reform which have come 
not only from the Stephenson inquest, but from a working group 
on high risk offenders constituted by the previous Solicitor 
General. The time has come to act on those recommendations.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe that legislation to keep high risk offenders in prison 
much longer would go a long way to improving public safety. I 
am also of the opinion that any legislation brought forward by 
the government should include a provision which would allow 
sentencing courts to impose a post-detention term of 
supervision for high risk offenders.
<P>
	A supervision provision would allow for the monitoring of an 
offender's behaviour and actions for an extended period of time 
following sentence expiry. In addition to placing a high risk 
offender under supervision for a period of 10 years residency for 
example, treatment and reporting conditions would also be 
imposed.
<P>
	Any breach of those conditions would land the offender back 
in jail and remove any chance of future early release. That is the 
only way we will be able to monitor the serious sex offenders 
who we have no choice but to release after sentence expiry.
<P>
	Perhaps if such provisions had existed in June 1988 
Christopher Stephenson would be alive today. Perhaps if the 
parole officer responsible for Joseph Fredericks had known 
where Fredericks was living Christopher could have been found 
in time. But there were no residency restrictions placed on 
Fredericks and he had not bothered to report to his parole 
officer. This cannot be allowed to happen again.
<P>
	At a recent criminal justice conference in Hamilton, victims 
rights organizations including CAVEAT, Canadians Against 
Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination, stressed the 
need for high risk offender legislation.
<P>
	Criminal justice reform advocates and even the new chairman 
of the National Parole Board have stated that supervision and 
residency restrictions are necessary if we are to protect innocent 
children from sexual predators and other high risk offenders.
<P>
	As terrible as the murder of Christopher Stephenson was, we 
must learn from it as we must learn from all other cases in which 
high risk offenders have preyed on innocent victims. We cannot 
stand by and let such tragedies recur. We must act now by 
supporting this motion and supporting any forthcoming 
legislation that will keep sick people like Joseph Fredericks off 
our streets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are 
times when being a member of Parliament is very difficult. It is 
particularly difficult when having to deal with this type of issue 
especially when one does some research in order to make some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6407"> 6407 </A></B>
<P>
half intelligent  comments. I have had a feeling of putting my 
head into a toilet.
<P>
	Members of Parliament must make the protection of children 
a first priority. I mention the frustrations of being a member of 
Parliament. From time to time I get the impression that we move 
at glacial speed in this House. No matter how urgent the issue, it 
is highly unusual for this House to move with dispatch. Even as 
we sit here speaking again and again about awful issues like this 
one, we move at glacial speed.
<P>
	In doing some research I came across an article from the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> of June 1, 1994. The headline is ``Ottawa 
ponders nationwide registry of child abusers''.
<P>
	The article reads in part: ``A national registry of people 
convicted of sexually abusing children could help prevent 
schools and child care centres from unwittingly hiring 
offenders, says a government discussion paper released 
yesterday. Children could be better protected from sexual abuse 
by preventing known sex offenders from having positions of 
trust or responsibility with children, says the 19-page 
document. But it draws no conclusions about how to set up such 
a registry or what it might cost taxpayers. However, the report 
says research suggests society pays roughly $200,000 each time 
sex offenders repeat their crime, on investigations, 
prosecutions, imprisonment and judgment''. In other words, 
clearly on the basis of this report it is basically saying that we 
are already spending the money so why do we not spend the 
money more wisely, particularly in the area of prevention?
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	By way of this speech I remind the justice minister that it says 
here ``the justice minister, Allan Rock, has promised the registry 
will be operating by fall once the government has reviewed 
comments from the public''.
<P>
	I can appreciate that this is a sensitive issue, particularly as it 
relates to charter issues. I can appreciate that this has to go 
forward responsibly and well by the justice minister. At the 
conclusion of the article it says: ``A similar provincial registry 
in British Columbia was shut down in 1984 after a court 
challenge. A Manitoba registry survived a challenge last year 
when three teachers suspected of child abuse lost a legal effort to 
keep their names off the list''.
<P>
	I raise that because it was clearly evident on the basis of the 
motion put forward by the member when she asked that this 
House give unanimous consent that this go forward that 
unanimous consent was denied. We have to ask the question then 
in the light of that what is it that we can do?
<P>
	I have three suggestions. The first suggestion I have already 
made, that the justice minister as quickly as possible fulfil what 
I took to be a commitment that there will be a registry so that 
repeat offenders will not have access to the young children of 
Canada or at least as easy access as they presently have.
<P>
	Also, from <I>The Toronto Star</I> of March 23 of this year: 
``Pedophile gets three years for assault on boy 12 years of age''. 
It reads in part: ``It was a matter of trust, a trust bought by 
camping trips and outings to amusement parks like Canada's 
Wonderland. But as Kevin Starnaman himself admitted 
yesterday after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting a 12-year 
old boy and filming the deviant acts'', and this is the quote of a 
convicted pedophile, ``society must be protected from persons 
like myself''.
<P>
	I say again that a convicted pedophile says to us in this 
Parliament as legislators: ``society must be protected from 
persons like myself''.
<P>
	One of the difficulties, again as a legislator coming to this 
august assembly, is that very frequently there are measures 
taken, whether we are talking about justice issues or whatever 
the legislation before us that are half measures, quarter 
measures, mincy steps, sometimes in the judgment of individual 
members steps in the wrong direction. Clearly there must be 
unanimous consent on the part of all members of this House that 
our first priority must be the protection of Canada's children.
<P>
	What is another thing we can do? In light of the fact that we 
are having difficulty in terms of coming forward and there are 
charter concerns and so on and so forth, and we have already 
uncovered one which is a registry, let us take a look at what 
might happen if we were to take tougher corrective action and 
actually bring a grid to sentencing.
<P>
	I will give just a few examples. A 41-year old male was 
charged with several counts of sexual assault and gross 
indecency on five children between the ages of five and nine. 
Pictures of the sexual act were taken and retained. These 
pictures were seized along with sex aids and other pornographic 
movies. Do you know what he got? He was convicted and 
sentenced to an amazing 23 months.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> A 43-year old male was charged with gross 
indecency on several young females aged from 4 to 13 years. He 
took pictures of the girls during the acts. These pictures were 
seized, plus other pornographic tapes. That is several young 
females.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	He is presently before the courts.
<P>
	A male was charged with gross indecency involving two 
13-year old boys. A search warrant located photographs of 
young males in a very compromising position that I do not 
choose to read to this House. He was sentenced to all of two 
years.
<P>
	A 51-year old male sexually assaulted two boys aged seven 
and eight years, taking various photographs of them. The 
accused distributed these photographs to pedophile magazines 
in the United States. A search warrant located the photos of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6408"> 6408 </A></B>
<P>
numerous young males. Guess what he got? Nine months. That 
is a tough one.
<P>
	A 30-year old father attempted to get his nine-year old 
daughter to touch his penis and he in turn attempted to have 
intercourse with her. Investigation revealed he had taken 
photographs of other young girls in his basement. A quantity of 
pornographic material was seized. He received a real toughy, a 
suspended sentence and probation.
<P>
	A 16-year old male sexually assaulted an 11-year old female 
neighbour. He took photographs of her in various sexual poses 
including sexual intercourse. When arrested he had several 
<I>Penthouse</I> magazines-I did not say hard core, blue 
pornography, I said <I>Penthouse</I> magazines-in his possession. 
He got two years probation.
<P>
	It seems to me that we have something on our hands right at 
this moment in terms of the penal system where we could start to 
get serious, where we could take people who are giving lifetime 
sentences to these children. These pedophiles are fouling up the 
lives of their victims for their lifetimes.
<P>
	Surely our court can do better than giving the pedophile all of 
two years, or suspended, or probation or whatever the case may 
be. It is already in our hands. We can go ahead and do something. 
That is a second issue.
<P>
	The first issue is the registry. The second issue is the 
sentencing grid. As the revenue critic, I support the efforts of 
Canada Customs in its interdiction of pornographic material. In 
the research I did there is a very clear connection between 
pornography and particularly the way pornography is used.
<P>
	I mentioned <I>Penthouse</I> magazine that you will find in your 
friendly neighbourhood Mac's Milk or 7-Eleven store. There is 
a very clear connection between these things. I suggest to civil 
libertarians who are always talking about freedom of speech and 
expression that there must be a first priority and that is the 
protection of children in this society.
<P>
	I thank you, Mr. Speaker for the opportunity to intervene on 
this. I feel very strongly about this. We can look at pornography, 
keep it under control, look at the registry and finally the 
sentencing grid to show that we can be serious with the tool that 
we have in hand right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened very carefully to the speeches that have 
been made here today concerning this very important question. I 
think that they have been very good. I commend the member for 
Brampton for bringing this subject matter forward today.
<P>
	The intention behind the motion of the hon. member is very 
helpful. In proposing action by the government to exert greater 
control over sex offenders, particularly pedophiles, she is 
reflecting a concern shared by most Canadians.
<P>
	A few days before introducing this motion the hon. member 
held a press conference in Brampton jointly with one of her 
constituents and announced that a public petition in support of 
her motion was being circulated. I also commend the member 
for Brampton for attempting to go beyond generalities by 
imposing a mechanism that might increase our power to 
incarcerate dangerous pedophiles.
<P>
	In this case she proposes giving the National Parole Board the 
authority to enforce the long term incarceration of offenders 
whom it feels may reoffend. In my view that is where the 
practical problem lies. I do not believe that the National Parole 
Board is the proper body to determine what should be done with 
an offender after he or she completes their sentence. Nor do I 
believe that it is a simple matter, legally, to prolong the 
detention of an individual when he or she has served the entire 
sentence imposed by the court. The problem is with our 
Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Many say that the charter is a problem in a lot of areas. Maybe 
in some things it is very binding. However in this case there is a 
very good reason for this charter protection, and necessary if we 
are to maintain a proper judicial system in this country.
<P>
	When someone goes to court they are innocent until proven 
guilty. They are heard. Both sides of the case are presented. 
Then the person is determined innocent or guilty and, if guilty, a 
sentence is imposed. Once that sentence is imposed that is the 
punishment for that individual for that crime. That sentence has 
been imposed by a court that has heard all aspects of the case.
<P>
	If we are to say before the person is released at the end of that 
sentence imposed by the court that this sentence should be 
extended then we are extending the sentence arbitrarily without 
due process of law in violation of overturning what the courts 
have set down.
<P>
	That is very important. That is not to minimize what is 
attempted in this motion. There are better ways of doing it.
<P>
	The parole board is not to be the vehicle for determining law 
and order in Canada. It has a specific function. That function is 
well defined. The parole board knows it and is perfectly 
competent to do it.
<P>
	We can do two very important things. This is what is being 
examined by the Department of Justice at the present time. The 
first is instead of extending the sentence and imposing a further 
legal period of incarceration that we should instead have the 
person toward the end of their sentence examined by medical 
experts, particularly psychiatrists, to determine whether this 
person is medically fit to go out into society.
<P>

<P>
	If this person is not fit to go out into society, then refer this 
person at the end of his or her sentence to a provincial medical 
facility, thereby giving the person much better treatment than 
they would receive in incarceration. This is then a medical 
problem.
<P>
	Second, there are in the Criminal Code right now provisions 
for dealing with dangerous offenders. Sometimes however we 
do not know and do not designate people as dangerous offenders 
until they have committed a horrendous crime after a series of 
lesser horrendous crimes. They are not targeted early enough.
<P>
	What can be done? We are attempting in the Department of 
Justice, with the minister, with the people in the department and 
with the co-operation of the ministers of justice and attorneys 
general provincially, to designate these people earlier, to flag 
them so to speak.
<P>
	When they are released and show the potential for causing 
further crimes in this ever escalating spiral that some of these 
dangerous offenders follow, and when they reoffend, we will 
take them to court and when they are found guilty to then make a 
motion through the crown prosecutor to have them designated as 
dangerous offenders under part IV of the Criminal Code. They 
can then be kept for an extended and indefinite period of time.
<P>
	The law is there. There are ways of doing it. This has to be 
done. I cannot disagree that in a lot of ways the time that has 
been taken seems long and extensive to a lot of people.
