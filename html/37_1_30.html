<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SPECIES AT RISK ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 28 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-5, an act respecting the protection of wildlife 
species at risk in Canada, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-5, which is before the House today, is a very 
significant bill, a bill that I think we would all do well to 
look at very seriously, because it attacks and has within it a 
consideration of some of the basic principles that govern and 
underlie democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to address two parts of the bill.  The first has to do 
with the concept of how the selection of the endangered species 
at risk is done.  The second has to do with the right of private 
property and how the bill deals with that particular aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have the members of the public who are out there 
watching this debate understand exactly what it is we are talking 
about here this morning:  Bill C-5, which is here to protect 
endangered wildlife species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus on the purpose of the bill as it is stated in this 
particular legislation.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purposes of this enactment are to prevent Canadian indigenous 
species, subspecies and distinct populations of wildlife from 
becoming extirpated or extinct, to provide for the recovery of 
endangered or threatened species, to encourage the management of 
other species to prevent them from becoming at risk. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to completely endorse the purpose of the bill.  Clearly 
one of the things we want to be very concerned about in our 
society and in Canada is that we do protect our wildlife.  We do 
want to create an environment in which wildlife can prosper, live 
and provide enjoyment for each of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize our support of the intent of this 
particular bill.  I want to be sure that everyone out there 
recognizes that the Canadian Alliance, myself in particular, and 
its constituents support the protection of wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to recognize here, though, is how the bill will be 
handled.  I wish to refer to certain provisions in the bill.  The 
first provision of the bill is the selection of the list of 
species and endangered wildlife that will be registered and 
protected by the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 14 deals with this particular part of the activities, so 
I will refer, then, to clause 14, which suggests that a committee 
be established.  It is called the COSEWIC committee and many of 
the listeners will wonder what in the world we are talking about. 
That is an acronym for a long title, Committee on the Status of 
Endangered Wildlife in Canada.  As shorthand we say COSEWIC. This 
is really what we are talking about.  The committee is 
established by this particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am so happy that there are at least some members opposite in 
the House listening to the debate, because it is really 
important.  Some of the points we will make are points that the 
Minister of the Environment in particular should recognize and 
change in this legislation, and we want the minister and all 
members opposite to know that the idea of protecting endangered 
species is indeed an area and an action that we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the establishment of the committee, we need to recognize 
who its members are.  This committee shall carry out its 
functions “on the basis of the best available information, 
including scientific knowledge, community knowledge and 
aboriginal traditional knowledge”. 
That is what the committee is supposed to do.  This is a major 
issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are these people?  The committee is to be composed of 
members appointed by the minister after consultation with the 
Canadian Endangered Species Conservation Council and with any 
experts that the minister considers to be appropriate.  I would 
like to underline the word experts.  The second part of the 
clause, subclause 16(2), is extremely significant: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each member must have expertise drawn from a discipline such as 
conservation biology, population dynamics, taxonomy, systematics 
or genetics or from community knowledge or aboriginal traditional 
knowledge of the conservation of wildlife species. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a blue ribbon membership for the committee.  These are 
very significant and very powerful people.  They are people who 
understand the reality of science and understand what it is to 
use knowledge and to make observations that others can verify. 
They are not subject to political interpretation or the vagaries 
of somebody's imagination.  They are based on facts and on 
observations which can be replicated by other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are supposed to comprise this committee are 
independent and objective.  This is very desirable and highly 
commendable.  I support the minister in identifying this as the 
way the committee should be comprised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might say that the blue ribbon committee will go about doing 
its business, but what is the principle involved in creating the 
list of Canadian endangered wildlife?  What are the decision 
making principles underlying this committee of scientists?  The 
principles involved are truth and integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we talking about when we talk about truth and 
integrity?  Truth concerns a clear knowledge of the facts.  I am 
speaking of things that are commonly accepted as being true in 
fact.  They can be believed and acted upon with confidence and 
courage, recognizing that what has happened before will happen 
again because the basis on which the decision is made is 
verifiable by an independent person in an objective and 
independent manner and the findings can be replicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Integrity means that the people on the committee will actually 
say what was discovered, what has been put there, and that the 
basis on which those decisions are made is indeed one that is 
verified by the various observations that have been taken.  On 
the committee we will have scientists who are objective and reach 
conclusions on the basis of verifiable interpretation, 
experiments and observations that could carried out by other 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no problem with the committee or with the intent of the 
bill.  Why then is there a problem with the bill?  There is a 
problem with a provision in another clause of the bill. Subclause 
27(1) makes a very interesting observation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the 
Minister, by regulation, establish the List of Wildlife Species 
at Risk and amend the List by adding a wildlife species to the 
List, by reclassifying a listed wildlife species or by removing a 
listed wildlife species from the List. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the work of the committee, all the science involved, 
suddenly becomes subject to whatever the governor in council 
decides.  This puts into question the whole integrity of 
establishing a committee in the first place.  In this clause we 
have a group of scientists who are ignored and whose integrity is 
at least insulted if not denied.  The governor in council can do 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, subclause 29(2) is an even more difficult area. 
It follows subclause (1), and I think for clarity I should 
probably read subclause 29(1) as well: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister is of the opinion— 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1015
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section refers to the minister now, not the governor in 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section goes on: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that there is an imminent threat to the survival of a wildlife 
species, the Minister must— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note here that it is not that the minister 
may, but that he must. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—on an emergency basis, after consultation with every other 
competent minister— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notice they are all ministers. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—make a recommendation to the Governor in Council that the List 
be amended to list the species as an endangered species. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reference here to the committee at all.  Subclause 
29(2) reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister may arrive at that opinion on the basis of his or 
her own information or on the basis of COSEWIC's assessment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This really creates a dilemma for the scientists and for 
Canadians who are to place confidence in the Minister of the 
Environment and cabinet itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no attempt in this criticism to suggest that we should 
not have legislation of this kind.  That is not the purpose of my 
criticism.  The purpose of my criticism is to recognize that the 
principle of truth and scientific integrity needs to be observed 
throughout the legislation.  It should be there in a consistent 
fashion all the way through. I submit to the House that clause 29 
does not allow this to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to move from there to the next step in the debate, which 
has to do with why it is so important that we have this truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. members opposite are all Liberals and they had a leader 
at one time by the name of Trudeau who initiated and passed in 
the House a constitutional amendment called the charter of rights 
and freedoms.  At the end of the charter of rights and freedoms 
this is what he wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must now establish the basic principles, the basic values and 
beliefs which hold us together as Canadians so that beyond our 
regional loyalties there is a way of life and a system of values 
which make us proud of the country that has given us such freedom 
and such immeasurable joy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are wonderful and great words.  We are now establishing 
one of those principles.  Surely the right Hon. Trudeau, at the 
time he was Prime Minister and wrote that paragraph, recognized 
that one of the foundational principles of a democracy to 
function properly and adequately is that of truth and integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move into the next step of the legislation.  That has 
to do with the recognition of private property.  The bill 
recognizes clearly that there is such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our charter of rights and freedoms does not grant that right in 
the constitution to individual Canadians, but the basis of 
liberty is the ownership of private property.  It is not just the 
amassing of property that is the issue.  The ownership of 
material things recognizes the dignity of human beings.  It 
recognizes the basic integrity and beauty of human creativity and 
the ingenuity and innovativeness of human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what private property does.  Think about real property, 
intellectual property, all the novels that have been written, the 
poems that have been written and the songs that have been 
written.  These are all matters of private property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean, however, that the right to private property 
means we can do whatever we please with that property.  Neither 
do we have the right to amass private property based on cruelty 
or intimidation or on things of that nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means we must use private property to the interests of the 
people around us.  It does not mean we can use private property 
to destroy endangered species.  The bill makes that clear.  If 
that is the case then the implications of the bill must be looked 
at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the enforcement of the provisions in the bill have 
implications for private property?  The bill clearly identifies 
that yes, it is probably true, there probably are implications. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me look at subclause 64(1).  Subclause 64(1) of the bill 
clearly indicates: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister may, in accordance with the regulations, provide 
compensation to any person for losses— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I draw to the attention of those listening and of our 
colleagues in the House, both on the other side and on the 
opposition side, that the operative word here is may.  It is not 
that he shall compensate; it is that he may compensate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It does not say how much either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  No, it does not, so it is very 
significant that we recognize this point.  Not only that, but it 
says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—suffered as a result of any extraordinary impact of the 
application of (a) section 58— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it goes into specific details as to where he may or may 
not.  The government, in its wisdom, appointed Dr. Pearse who 
presented a report.  That report suggests that if somebody 
experiences a loss of 10% the compensation should be 50%.  That 
is a very interesting report.  If an individual has a loss of 
more than 10% he can get compensation for 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put into perspective what that could mean in one economic 
sector.  I refer to the forestry sector.  It is critically 
important to Canada.  It produces nearly $60 billion of products 
every year.  More than one million Canadians depend on the 
industry for their jobs and it contributes more to Canada's 
balance of trade than any other sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will ask what that has to do with the bill.  It has a lot 
to do with the bill.  Forestry is critically important to B.C. It 
generates more than $15 billion annually and nearly 300,000 jobs. 
Thirty-one out of thirty-seven regions of the province are 
dependent on forestry.  Across Canada there are 53 forest 
dependent species at risk.  Out of the 53 forest dependent 
species at risk, 32 are of concern and 21 are endangered or 
threatened.  Of the 53 species, 26 are located in B.C.  Ten of 
these are considered endangered or threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a clear indication of the potential loss that will be 
experienced by a major sector not only in British Columbia but in 
Canada as a whole.  If people have a loss of 10% and are only 
compensated at 50% of that loss, how would they be able to 
continue their operation?  How would they be able to employ the 
people who are supposed to be employed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are very serious implications and that is only in one 
sector.  We must deal with the agriculture sector.  We must deal 
with cattlemen.  We must deal with a whole host of other 
businesses directly affected by the implications of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance position is very clear.  We take the view 
that private property ought to be recognized and honoured.  Our 
policy statement is very clear.  We believe the right to contract 
freely and to own, use and benefit from private property, 
including labour and real, intellectual and personal property, 
lies at the very heart of our legal and economic systems.  I 
suggest that it lies at the heart of a democratic system in 
Canada and that it distinguishes a free society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will therefore seek the agreement of the provinces to amend 
the charter of rights and freedoms to include this right as well 
as a guarantee.  Referring to the ownership of private property, 
here is the guarantee that applies directly to the bill: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—no person shall be deprived of it— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is, the ownership of private property without the due 
process of law and full, just and timely compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the key under which we operate.  I reiterate that it is 
not the position of the Canadian Alliance to oppose the bill 
because it wants to protect endangered wildlife in Canada.  We 
want legislation that will protect endangered wildlife.  We want 
democracy protected.  We want that protection to take place so 
that the integrity of scientists will be recognized and applied 
in this case, not political vagaries that are subject to 
political interference from special pressure groups or special 
interest groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make sure everybody understands that we support the 
protection of endangered wildlife.  However at the same time we 
recognize that the minister ought to include an amendment in the 
legislation that requires full compensation for those who 
experience loss and that the decisions based on science of 
COSEWIC are recognized and applied and not subject to the 
vagaries of cabinet or of the minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague's 
presentation and he made a couple of key points.  I wonder if he 
could comment on the area of compensation, which I think he 
explained very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment by saying that at committee, when asked directly 
whether he would compensate and whether the legislation would 
ensure that loss of property or loss of the use of property would 
be compensated at full market value, the environment minister 
would not say that would be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what my colleague said is absolutely accurate.  We can 
fully expect that the legislation will not compensate at fair 
market value people who lose their property or the use of their 
property.  Surely in a society that believes in people's right to 
own property we would expect that compensation would be paid at 
fair market value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that issue I would ask my colleague if, under the study that 
was done, there is no compensation if the loss is less than 10%. 
I know of many cases in agriculture and probably in forestry 
where there is not a margin of 10%.  I know of many cases where, 
if the damage and the loss is above 10%, only 50% of the loss is 
compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is my colleague really saying that under the study that was 
done, and the government has not said it would do anything 
different, it is likely that if people lose their property or the 
use of their property they would be compensated for only half 
the loss?  I know as a farmer that half the loss on any 
significant amount of property could cause me or other farmers to 
go out of business.  I would like the member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer is that I and 
my party believe there should be full compensation at the full 
market price at the time.  That is what it ought to be.  This 
whole business of proportions is simply not acceptable. The level 
of compensation ought to be full and complete at the going rate 
in the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I think the more significant point is that the 
legislation does not say that there will be or must be compensation. 
It says that there may be compensation.  Hence, the minister, 
regardless of what the conclusion is, may still deny 
compensation.  That is one part.  The other part is that it is 
subject to regulation.  The rate of compensation, or even that 
there will be compensation, is not part of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fundamental amendment that ought to be made to the 
legislation to indicate that there will be full compensation and 
that the minister will not only be required to pay that 
compensation but to pay it in a timely fashion.  That is very 
important and it should not be delayed unduly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that allays the fears of my hon. colleague and other 
people out there because every person could be affected either 
directly or indirectly by the legislation, not only the people in 
the lumber and farming industries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as you may know, my constituency is an urban core 
riding.  This whole issue can become an urban-rural split on the 
way people approach the legislation.  There are people in urban 
ridings who do own two or three acres of land.  They may own 
cottages or properties near the lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member comment on how the legislation could impact 
those of us who live in urban ridings?  It is not necessarily 
just something to be looked at in terms of agriculture and farms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely 
correct.  It does not have to be a two or three acre plot.  It 
could even be a 30 by 100 foot lot in the city.  It is 
technically possible but not likely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be very careful.  That is all the more reason the 
legislation which declares and creates the COSEWIC committee is 
very good.  It could deal with this issue in an objective and 
independent fashion, which is neither rural nor urban, and on a 
scientific basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of a story I cannot resist telling.  There was a 
kindergarten teacher who had a show and tell day.  One of the 
pupils brought a rabbit to school.  The child was really excited 
about the pet rabbit.  The pupils were looking at the rabbit and 
describing its features.  One of the kids in the back of the room 
asked whether it was a boy or a girl.  The teacher looked at the 
rabbit and did not how to analyze whether it was a male or a 
female.  Again one of the pupils asked whether it was a boy or a 
girl, and the teacher said “Let's vote on it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sex of a rabbit cannot be determined on the basis of a 
majority vote.  That is the nonsense of putting it into the hands 
of a political vagary to decide which way things go.  It could be 
determined in an objective and verifiable way.  It does not 
matter who looks at it, no one can determine the sex of a rabbit. 
The situation in this regard is similar, and that is the point 
that has to be made.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the same 
person would not want to be candling eggs either, I am sure, 
because he or she would be in real trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to speak to the species at risk act.  My 
colleague from Fundy—Royal has spoken eloquently on the bill and 
clearly laid out the PC Party position respecting the 
legislation.  I should like to address some of the specifics of 
the legislation and how they may be applied to those of us who 
live in the rural and urban areas of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time with the member for Brandon—Souris. 
I am sure everyone in the House will be waiting patiently to 
hear his words of wisdom on this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken in the House on previous occasions to highlight 
the plight of wild Atlantic salmon.  When we are discussing 
species at risk legislation, I realize that all species 
encompassed by the legislation are in need of more support. There 
are many more species in need of support than just the wild 
Atlantic salmon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is a need for more support not just from Canadians 
but also from government organizations at all levels, or wild 
Atlantic salmon and other species at risk in Canada will become 
extinct.  Wild Atlantic salmon are decreasing in alarming numbers 
and the problem is that we do not know the cause.  The salmon go 
out to sea but fail to return.  What we are seeing as the years 
go on is fewer and fewer wild Atlantic salmon returning to our 
rivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew for a long time that many of them were being caught by 
commercial fleets off Greenland.  Today the numbers have 
diminished to the point where they are not actually able to go 
out to sea to breed and produce enough smolts to return.  We have 
few grilse and very few multi-sea winter salmon coming back to 
our rivers in eastern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic Salmon Federation has been vocal in its efforts to 
highlight the problems facing this important species and to 
initiate more research into what is happening to prevent the 
return of more salmon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time a number of factors are contributing to the 
decline in general numbers: climate change, the corresponding 
warming of ocean temperatures, acid rain, pollution, the escape 
of farm salmon and predators.  This is why none of these species 
should be looked at in isolation.  There are many overlapping 
factors that need to be examined if we are to ensure that these 
species exist for future generations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill Taylor, president of the Atlantic Salmon Federation, sums 
up very clearly and concisely the issue at stake: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a comprehensive, five year research, restoration, 
protection and community watershed management program dedicated 
to the wild Atlantic salmon and its habitat. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us would be a step in the right direction 
except for the major flaws the bill entails.  My colleague from 
Fundy—Royal clearly explained these limitations, and I would 
like to repeat two points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the legislation does not require the protection of 
habitat.  Second, by allowing the decision on which species are 
endangered to be made by cabinet and not by scientific experts, 
the effectiveness of the legislation has been severely 
constrained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne on January 31 mentioned the need to 
protect species and stated that the government would be 
reintroducing the bill.  What is disappointing is that the 
government did not take the opportunity to learn from its 
previous discussions on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suggestions and recommendations from interested and affected 
stakeholders were not incorporated into the legislation.  If 
changes proposed by stakeholders had been incorporated into the 
legislation, we could have had a more meaningful discussion on 
the real merits of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one more thing that I would like to mention with regard 
to wild Atlantic salmon.  The species is seen as a barometer that 
indicates the health of our oceans.  If the habitat has become 
unsuitable for wild Atlantic salmon, it is also negatively 
affecting other species.  They too will soon be listed as 
endangered, threatened or otherwise at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It tells us that we do not have much time to deal with the 
problems affecting the species and its habitat.  Yet the 
government has delayed making any effective changes.  It has 
talked the talk since 1993, but we have yet to see any real 
meaningful steps taken to help endangered species in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being from Nova Scotia I will focus my attention on a couple of 
other species that are threatened in the province.  The Nova 
Scotia Nature Trust recently identified more lakes in Nova Scotia 
that have some of Canada's rarest plants along their shores. 
Shingle Lake, Ponhook Lake in Queens County and Harpers Lake in 
Shelburne county are a few lakes that have been recognized as 
having rare plant species along their shores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that these rare plants have been identified, appropriate 
measures should be taken to ensure that they are protected.  The 
trust plans to expand its landowner outreach program and public 
education program to make more people aware of these rare plants. 
The first step is to disclose to the landowners that such rare 
plants exist on their property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally these plants were found on many lakes in Nova Scotia 
between Digby Neck and Mahone Bay.  However the use of all 
terrain vehicles, damming and development have been contributing 
factors in their decline to the point where they need to be 
protected today.  I would hope the legislation would protect 
these types of plants in the section on endangered species and 
threatened species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seriously stress and support the idea of encouraging 
landowners to help in this endeavour and to be adequately 
compensated for their assistance in protecting such species for 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no way should the financial burden be placed on an individual 
when all Canada benefits from the protection of these species. 
That is the trouble with this piece of legislation.  It is 
certainly not the landowner's responsibility and it cannot become 
the landowner's responsibility to protect endangered species. All 
Canadians benefit from the protection of species and must somehow 
contribute to the continued protection of the species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of birds, plants and animals in Nova Scotia. 
A few years ago we had a small mammal called the sea mink.  It 
was completely different and did not interbreed with the inland 
mink.  It was larger and lived in coastal areas.  That animal is 
extinct today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of birds that live in very small and isolated 
groups.  The ipswich sparrow on Sable Island is a prime example. 
There is the piping plover which I have been fortunate enough to 
have actually seen.  There are 50 or 60 breeding pairs left in 
the world. 
They breed upon the shores and the beaches of the south shore of 
Nova Scotia.  It is these types of animals and birds that we have 
to protect. We have to find a way to protect them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is simply wrong-headed.  What is even more 
disappointing is that the government had ample opportunity to 
listen to the dialogue of opposition parties, the Sierra Club, 
landowner groups and big industry, but it did not hear what those 
groups were saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It refused to change or alter the bill.  It refused to take it 
out of the hands of government, members of cabinet and privy 
councillors.  It refused to list rare and endangered species in a 
meaningful way so that we could do something about the protection 
of these plants and animals.  We have ended up with legislation 
that is kind of warm and fuzzy and sounds good but in reality 
will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  I have a number of cousins who are 
loggers in Sonora in northern California.  Their logging 
operations have been shut down because of the spotted owl.  They 
log mostly on government land and they simply cannot get timber 
contracts.  They cut wood that is diseased, and that is the only 
wood they are allowed to cut.  If there is a diseased tree on 
government lands in northern California they are allowed to cut 
it.  Their own timber tracts are severely restricted and it is 
just about impossible to cut on public land.  I will just take a 
couple of more seconds because I know— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure someone will ask the hon. 
member a question that would allow him to finish what he intended 
to share with all of us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
I understand it, my hon. friend and colleague from South Shore 
has a number of relatives in the industry in California who 
unfortunately do not have the opportunity to expand their 
livelihood because of implications with respect to endangered 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he tell us exactly why these individuals have been 
impacted?  What in the legislation would cause the same problems 
in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the point I should like to 
get across is that our legislation very much mirrors the American 
legislation.  The American legislation did not involve the 
landowners, loggers or farmers.  It very much pitted landowners 
against land users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they have ended up with in the States is that when people 
find a rare or endangered species on their property they shoot 
it, bury it, and do not tell anybody.  That is the type of 
legislation that we are looking at today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to protect endangered species, especially plants and 
animals, we must find a way to compensate landowners.  If as a 
landowner I had to exclude 10, 20 or 100 hectares because of a 
rare or endangered plant or animal which needed protection, I 
would want to be compensated for that.  I am more than happy to 
allow for the protection, but if agricultural or forestry land is 
being taken out of production, all the onus cannot be upon the 
shoulders of the landowner.  There has to be some sharing of that 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation does not do that.  It did not do it in 
California.  It put people out of work south of the border.  It 
caused animosity between people who depend upon the land to make 
a livelihood and people who simply want to enjoy the benefits of 
walking and looking at a beautiful piece of real estate.  We 
cannot afford to do that in Canada, and unfortunately that is 
what the bill would do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from South Shore for allowing me to share his 
time on Bill C-5.  I will not be sharing it with my colleague 
from Richmond—Arthabaska.  He does not want to speak, so we are 
okay on this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay special tribute to my colleague from Fundy—Royal who has 
taken the lead.  He has basically acted as the official 
opposition with respect to the legislation.  He has been 
extremely effective.  He is very knowledgeable about the 
legislation and in face put forward a white paper that has been 
more accepted by the stakeholders than the legislation presented 
by the government.  He has spent an enormous amount of time and 
energy on the legislation and has spoken with great eloquence and 
great knowledge of the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His white paper was accepted by a rather large stakeholder group 
encompassing the Canadian Pulp & Paper Association, the Mining 
Association of Canada, the Sierra Club of Canada, the Canadian 
Nature Federation and the Canadian Wildlife Federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the people who came forward as part of that 
group we realize that it is a rather diverse group.  It contains 
representatives from industry as well as environmental activists 
who sometimes do not get along very well with industry.  They 
said they had to put together an effective piece of legislation 
that would work, not something that was warm and fuzzy and on the 
surface looked like the government was doing something.  They 
presented some very good recommendations to the government and, 
lo and behold, none of them were incorporated into the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about some of the deficiencies of the legislation 
and about why the government has failed miserably in trying to 
protect something that Canadians want to protect.  Since 1993 the 
government has said that there must be endangered species 
legislation.  It was identified in the 1997 red book.  Also the 
government mentioned it in the last three throne speeches in 
1996, 1999 and 2001, but it is still not on the floor in the way 
it should be in order to protect all endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about a couple of areas in which the legislation 
falls down quite dramatically.  As my colleague mentioned, 
landowner rights would be impacted quite dramatically by the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from an area that encompasses an urban and a rural 
community.  About 50% of my constituency is rural.  The economic 
backbone of the area is agriculture. Farmers and producers of the 
area are stewards of the land.  In most cases they accept 
responsibility for stewardship, not only of the land but of the 
habitat on the land and the endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Landowner rights are not reflected properly in the legislation. 
We in the PC Party agree that there have to be more carrots than 
sticks. 
That comment was made by my colleague from Fundy—Royal.  If we 
think about it, there have to be more carrots out there than 
there are sticks.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no compensatory opportunity under the legislation to 
allow producers with endangered species and habitat on their land 
to continue their operations to the benefit society.  People in 
Montreal, Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver and other urban centres are 
demanding that producers, ranchers and landowners make sure that 
the habitat and species are retained, but they are not prepared 
to pay anything for that to take place.  That is absolutely 
wrong.  If landowners are not able to farm, ranch or do what they 
wish with their property, the species will be endangered even 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the Americans refer to the three esses: shoot, shovel 
and shut up.  That does not solve the problem.  Nor will the 
legislation.  We must make sure that fair compensation is 
provided to landowners, that the necessary dollars are provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would result in an inability to work with the 
provinces.  It deals with federal lands but unfortunately only 
deals with about 40% of the problem.  Some 60% of endangered 
species and their habitat will not be affected by the 
legislation.  We should work with the provinces to make sure that 
the legislation is effective, not simply something that would be 
thrown out by producers or landowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Carrots and sticks, protection of critical habitat, partnerships 
with the provinces and scientific listings are some of the 
issues.  It was mentioned earlier that responsibility for the 
identification of an endangered species would be given to the 
cabinet.  Politicians, as much as we would like to think 
otherwise, are not terribly well respected in their abilities to 
put forward the truth and the necessary intelligence to ensure 
that the decision is a proper one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are suggesting the decision should be based on information 
from the scientists, the people who know the issue better than 
politicians.  We are asking for decision making to be taken from 
the cabinet table and put into the hands of the people who know 
the issue.  We should let them make the decisions on the listing 
of protected species.  It is a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be an accountability mechanism for citizens to ensure 
the government enforces its own act.  If the act is to include an 
accountability mechanism, the PC Party believes there should be 
an independent process for the public to ensure the act is being 
effectively implemented. The process should allow citizens to 
challenge the federal government and not other citizens.  We 
believe very seriously that it is the citizens who will enforce 
Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe and Canadians believe there is a need for endangered 
species legislation.  The legislation that we are debating right 
now would not solve the current problems.  It will go forward to 
committee where I ask the government to listen with an open mind. 
A number of stakeholders are prepared to come forward with some 
interesting amendments to the legislation.  When it goes to 
committee, I ask the government not to handle it as it does other 
pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too important for that majority government to ramrod it 
through.  We must make sure that the legislation comes forward 
for final reading in the House in the proper fashion and is the 
proper piece of legislation.  I look forward to the legislation 
coming back from committee in a different form.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear an additional comment from the member, 
especially on the one issue that I see as a major flaw in the 
legislation, which is the lack of compensation for landowners.  As 
other opposition members have mentioned, that contributes to the 
rural-urban split. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give an example of that.  We in Nova Scotians used to like 
to say that we had landowners and land users.  For years I took 
that attitude as well.  I learned over time, actually about 25 years, 
that those land users could be our friends.  Whether they 
were birdwatching, hunting or skidooing on our property, if 
we had a good relationship with them they would be our 
friends.  They would make sure that our cabins were not being 
broken into, fires were not being set, no one was stealing our 
Christmas trees and they were not causing a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will force many of us who are landowners back to 
resenting the land users because we will be the people who will 
be paying the bills.  I would like the member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would correct one thing 
that the hon. member for South Shore said.  It may have taken him 
25 years to learn this lesson but he is not quite as slow a 
learner as he may have indicated to the House.  He is actually a 
very astute individual and has a background in farming and in 
the stewardship of the land.  He knows of what he speaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the compensation factor of the land itself, I 
could not agree more.  They are stewards of the land and, as I 
said earlier, not everything is perfect in this very imperfect 
world but in most cases the owners of the land believe in the 
stewardship of the land.  They make sure to protect the habitat 
and the species that enjoy that habitat.  They certainly utilize 
the land in the best interest not only of themselves, because 
that is their livelihood, but also in the best interest of 
people outside the rural area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue I would like to point out is that urbanites within our 
country wish to make sure that they have access to other lands. 
They also want to make sure those lands will be available to 
them.  I sincerely believe that they should be required to pay 
some of the costs of that stewardship.  It means the carrots 
instead of the sticks that we talked about.

despite much effort, there are still too many Canadian children 
living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past November, Campaign 2000 released its ninth annual 
report card on child poverty in Canada.  The report is positive 
about the role social policy can play in addressing child poverty 
issues.  This includes recent government initiatives, such as 
increases to Canada's child tax benefit, extension of employment 
insurance parental benefits, agreement on early childhood 
development and enhanced tax measures for children with 
disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also indicated improvements were evident over the 
previous two years.  Societal improvements include the national 
child benefit, which has injected millions of dollars back into 
low income family budgets and has enhanced programs and services 
for these families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The condition of children in poverty will improve because of 
strong government initiatives.  We must sustain these efforts to 
give children the good start they deserve.  Children are a 
priority of the government.

farmers are struggling for their very survival.  Many are facing 
the loss of their homes and their businesses to the banks and the 
federal Farm Credit Corporation.  Some of these farms have been 
in the family for close to 100 years and these people desperately 
want to keep them but cannot because they are not being paid for 
their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What these farmers need is simply a fair return on the sale of

admission, after about a year and a half of us asking him that 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know something.  We know the names of three of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

not take back the shares.  As recently as yesterday the ethics

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am satisfied, and have been for an awfully long time, that the

that (the Prime Minister) did not own those shares between 1993

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

there may be more information, he has now asked the director 
general of the corporations branch of Industry Canada to examine 
the books, a little fact that the Deputy Prime Minister left out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister's officials examine the books, they will know 
whether in fact the Prime Minister was in conflict of interest or 
not.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is repeating something that is not 
accurate.  The Prime Minister did not own the shares in 1996.  If 
he did not own the shares in 1996, he does not have jurisdiction 
over the documents.  The jurisdiction over the documents depends 
on the requirements and wording of the Canada Corporations Act

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr.

1996 when the Prime Minister talked to the ethics counsellor and 
told him that he had a problem because he still owned the shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister talks about the shares as being in a blind 
trust.  If those shares were in a blind trust, he would have no 
idea whether he got those shares back or not.  That is the issue. 
There is an ethical obligation here to find out if the Prime 
Minister actually owned those shares in 1996 and was in a 
conflict of interest when he was lobbying for grants and loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry, hopefully, although he is trying to 
protect his boss, will get to the bottom of that.  The question 
is, who is that fourth secret shareholder and will he name that 
person?

those shares between 1993 and 1999...I've gone through this very,

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not getting straight answers here.  The government 
obviously has something to hide.  Again, we know that there were 
three shareholders.  The Prime Minister claims that he was not a 
shareholder and the ethics counsellor says “yeah, you bet”, 
although why in the world would they have this conversation in 
1996 then?  That is a moot point.  There would have been no need 
to even have that discussion if it was in fact in a blind trust.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent Statistics Canada study suggested that the wealthiest 
half of Canadian families have 94% of the wealth and the poorest 
half of Canadian families have some 6% of the wealth.  In other 
words, the gap between the rich and the poor is widening and 
moving further away from the Trudeau vision of a just society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of that, could the Deputy Prime Minister tell the House 
why the government chose to cut capital gains tax a few months 
ago when it clearly favoured the rich over the poor, further 
widening the gap between the rich and the poor in this country? 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, to give a fair and balanced picture, the hon. member 
should also have talked about the billions and billions of 
dollars we have added to the national child benefit, a most 
important new social program in a generation especially focused 
on low income Canadians.  He should also have mentioned the $2.5 
billion that we committed last fall to early childhood education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, poverty is a serious problem, but we are working on it.  As 
far as the government and I are concerned, we are making 
progress. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Statistics Canada says exactly the opposite.  It says 
that the gap is widening between the rich and the poor and that 
the government's tax package will widen that gap even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some corporate executives in this country have saved millions of 
dollars because of the cut in taxes and capital gains.  My 
neighbour in Saskatchewan, John Keen, told me this morning that 
he saved $25 on his $500 capital gains on a small mutual fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this kind of evidence from Statistics Canada, will 
the minister now consider a wealth tax in this country at a 
similar level to the United States?  The American government is, 
of course, admired by both this government and the official 
opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

almost 800,000 low income Canadians off the tax rolls.  We have 
introduced full indexation, which helps those at the bottom end 
the most.  Thirty-five per cent of our personal tax cuts went to 
low income Canadians and Canadians with families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, our tax relief of $1.3 billion for energy costs 
went to low and middle income Canadians and the homeless received

today desperate farmers are occupying the legislature in 
Manitoba.  Yesterday they were burning the minister of 
agriculture in effigy.  What does the minister do?  Does he go 
and find more money for these desperate farmers?  No.  His 
department decides to do a media blitz and advertises how 
wonderful his government is doing in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister tell us how much that media blitz cost? Could

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

we should tell Canadians what the government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we did was explain to farmers and to Canadians the support 
and the increase that the government has provided.  I do not need 
to take the time of the House to remind everyone that we have 
gone from $600 million to $1.6 billion.  There will be $2.66

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
still do not know how much the media blitz cost but I am sure we 
can do that through access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should tell Canadians what this minister has not 
done.  He said in the House that his government since 1995 has 
been putting more money into agriculture.  Could he tell us why 
in 1993 there were $4.4 billion in federal funding and today 
there are only $2 billion in federal funding?  What happened to 
the difference?  Before he talks about the $42 billion deficit, 
we know there is money there.  The finance minister has told us 
that there is surplus.  Could the minister tell us why he cannot 
find another $400 million for agriculture? 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member answered his own 
question.  When we formed this government, the Government of 
Canada was taking in $120 billion a year and spending $162 
billion.  We cannot do that on a farm or in any other business. 
That is a $42 billion deficit.  We had to put the fiscal mess 
that the Tories left us in order before we could help farmers. 
Now that we have it in order, we are helping farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday's edition of the Toronto <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
contained a letter by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
In his missive, the minister said clearly that Quebec is a 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the minister not admit now clearly that, despite his fine 
words and hollow rhetoric, he is unable to get his arrogant and 
centralizing government to accept this fact, which he himself 
accepts, the fact that Quebec is a nation?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Quebec is a nation in the sociological sense of the 
word, but, in the opinion of the Quebec Premier, there are a 
number of nations in Quebec, since he refuses to consider the 
aboriginal nations part of the Quebec nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be a part of Quebec and Canada.  I see no 
contradiction in belonging to the two, and if I could at the 
same time have native membership, I would be very happy.

greater the costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the parliamentary secretary why the government is forcing

hard, overtime, to get rid of that surplus.  At the same time 
Sierra announced fourth quarter revenue profit increases of 221%

Madam Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to 
present a petition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The undersigned residents of Canada, many of them from the

rural route mail couriers often earn less than the minimum wage 
in working conditions reminiscent of another era.  They have not 
been allowed to bargain collectively to improve their wages and 
working conditions like others.  The private sector workers who 
deliver mail in rural areas have collective bargaining rights, as 
do public sector workers who deliver mail for Canada Post in 
urban areas, and they have a problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the petitioners call upon parliament to repeal 
section 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SPECIES AT RISK ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK172">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-5, an act respecting the protection of wildlife 
species at risk in Canada, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I should note that I will be splitting my time 
with my hon. colleague in front from Surrey Central, one of the 
most loquacious members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today and speak on Bill C-5, the species at 
risk act.  The government describes the purpose of the proposed 
act as follows.  It aims to protect wildlife at risk from 
becoming extinct or loss in the wild, with the ultimate objective 
of helping their numbers to recover.  The act will cover all 
wildlife species listed as being at risk nationally and their 
critical habitats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of the legislation is certainly a laudable goal.  We in 
the official opposition recognize that there is a need for 
effective endangered species legislation.  In fact, this 
recognition is reflected in our official policy statement.  Our 
policy statement states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is committed to protecting and preserving 
Canada's natural environment and endangered species, and to 
sustainable development of our abundant natural resources for the 
use of current and future generations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, our farm policy states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For any endangered species legislation to be effective, it must 
respect the fundamental rights of private property owners. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This entails including just compensation for landowners if 
habitat must be taken out of production.  It also means that the 
government should strive to be as co-operative as possible with 
farmers and ranchers rather than using threats and criminal 
sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the official opposition support effective endangered 
species legislation.  However, we have some concerns with regard 
to this particular legislation.  We do not disagree with the 
government's goal but we do have some difficulties with the 
message it is employing to achieve that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the lead of our member for Red Deer and the member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona in the last parliament, who have done yeomen 
work on the bill, we have attempted to be as constructive as 
possible in our criticisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following are the criticisms that I would like to highlight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the final listing of endangered species should rest not 
with the federal cabinet, but with the Committee on the Status of 
Endangered Wildlife in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the voluntary co-operation and incentives already in 
Bill C-5 should be stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill must include a clearly outlined full 
compensation scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, socio-economic analysis should be conducted prior to the 
development of species recovery plans to ensure that they do play 
a prominent role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the bill must respect provincial jurisdiction and apply 
equally to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a substantive list of criticism, many of which have been 
thoroughly covered by my colleagues here in the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus in particular on the need to protect the 
private property rights of landowners and include fair 
compensation for landowners if habitat must be taken out of 
production.  The effectiveness of the legislation directly 
depends on whether or not it respect those fundamental rights. 
The bill fails to clearly spell out what compensation will be 
provided for stakeholders who are forced to lose financially in 
the implementation of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment minister has indicated that he will spell out 
these compensation provisions in the regulation of the bill after 
its passage by parliament.  That is simply unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Pearce Report, which the minister seems to be 
considering at this point, suggests that landowners would only 
receive compensation if economic losses exceeded 10% and that 
compensation would be limited to only 50% of losses.  This is 
neither full nor fair compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are therefore two specific requirements that we would 
propose for compensation.  First, the compensation provisions 
must be clearly indicated in the bill before members of the House 
so that we as parliamentarians and Canadians can determine 
whether these provisions are just. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, those who incur increased costs or reduced income as a 
result of the requirements of the bill must have full 
compensation.  Saving endangered species is a benefit to all 
Canadians.  The cost should not be excessively borne by a few 
landowners, farmers, ranchers, they should be shared by all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the specific compensation requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to address the more general issue of the need 
for the government to respect private property rights.  It seems 
to me that the government, through many of its bills, has 
encroached further and further into the realm of private property 
rights.  This is a disturbing trend, one that we as 
parliamentarians ought to watch very carefully.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that since the beginning of the session we 
have been very much occupied with the whole question of 
parliamentary reform, which is a smaller issue within the larger 
question of how we pass the laws that govern us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as the famous philosopher Isaiah Berlin pointed out in 
his seminal essay, “Two Concepts of Liberty”, there is another 
question which is equally, if not more, important.  That is the 
question of what activities government itself even ought to be 
making decisions about.  It involves that very large question of 
to what extent we as individuals, citizens, families and 
communities require or even desire a government to involve itself 
in our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fundamental question for any political community and yet 
it strikes me how rarely we in the House even address it.  We 
spend hours debating specific amendments to certain bills, but we 
spend precious little time debating the larger question of 
whether the government ought to be expanding its influence in the 
first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is particularly alarming for me, because I generally 
believe that those communities which function best over the long 
term have governments that operate within clearly defined 
constitutional limits.  In these communities, these limits are 
best set by a constitutional recognition of genuine, classical 
rights such as the right to own property and not be deprived 
thereof without just compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many great thinkers have expounded on the importance of private 
property and its relationship with liberty and justice.  Even the 
great philosopher Aristotle mentioned it in his works in ancient 
Greece.  The great orator of Roman times, Cicero, is actually 
responsible for the word property being transferred down to us 
today.  One only has to think of John Locke and his “Two 
Treatises of Government” and his important discussion of private 
property rights there, or John Stuart Mill, or even the great 
American philosophers in the American revolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote another thinker.  Earlier today I was 
referring to a saint, so I would actually like to employ the 
words of another saint.  These are very good quotes because they 
have a sort of sanctified presence about them.  I would like to 
quote the patron saint of politicians, St. Thomas More.  He 
linked the foundation and endurance of a civilized community with 
the proper respect for property, saying “Security of property is 
the first and all-essential duty of a civilized community”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to property and the proper limits of governance, St. 
Thomas More warned that the worst which can happen to the law 
itself is its overextension, its expansion into fields in which 
it cannot be competent.  What happens then is that disrespect for 
law in all its capacities will increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stated that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You may to a certain extent control property and make it 
subservient to the ideal nature of man; but the moment you deny 
its rights, or undertake to legislate in defiance of them, you 
may for a time unsettle the very foundations of society, you will 
certainly in the end render property your despot instead of your 
servant, and so produce a materialized and debased civilization. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should bring this debate back from this abstract discussion 
and finish in terms of the practical effects of the bill. 
However, I hope that all parliamentarians would consider the 
general nature and profound importance of property rights and the 
need for this legislation to properly respect the property rights 
of individual landowners.  It can do so in specific ways, first, 
by working with private landowners on a voluntary basis, and 
second, by clearly indicating in the bill full and fair 
compensation provisions for those who incur increased costs or 
reduced income as a result of the requirements of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also encourage my fellow parliamentarians to consider 
carefully the notion of property rights and the limits of 
government in general.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by my hon. 
colleague and friend from Edmonton Southwest and thank him for 
his flattering remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to participate 
in the debate on Bill C-5, the Liberal government's proposed 
endangered species protection act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out at the outset that I am currently 
seeking the input of the people of Surrey Central concerning this 
controversial bill.  I am certain that the people I represent are 
in full support of protecting our environment and endangered 
species at risk, but I am not certain that we will support this 
legislation as is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's previous attempt at passing this kind of 
legislation was a discriminatory and punitive bill, Bill C-33. It 
was very unfair to Canadian landowners.  In the previous 
parliament I wanted to support that weak and confused legislation 
because of its intent, but I had such serious reservations about 
the strong arm tactics the government was using against Canadian 
landowners and farmers in order to protect species that I did not 
support the bill.  The government was playing politics with our 
endangered species.  It was not paying attention to the science 
involved and it was not going to properly compensate Canadians 
who also wanted to protect our endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the new bill it seems that most of the flaws of the old bill 
are still in place.  In anticipation of that, I have sent a 
message to my constituents asking them to advise me whether we 
will hold our noses and support this smelly bill or oppose it 
because of its undemocratic nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have decided to oppose it until after the committee hearings. 
In the meantime we will see if the Liberals adopt any of the 
suggestions from the witnesses appearing before the committee or 
from the official opposition and the other opposition parties. 
We will see if the government conducts hearings on this bill once 
it has passed second reading and if witnesses will be given 
enough chances to come forward and express their positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly outline the chief concerns I have about the bill 
so far.  First, we want to see effective legislation.  That means 
we want to see a full review of the bill by the House and the 
committee.  We do not want the Liberals to resort to using 
closure or to stifling debate so they can have the legislation 
passed by June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we need to see an emphasis on voluntary initiatives and 
partnerships.  While the current bill is a slight improvement 
over the punitive American endangered species act, it can be made 
better.  We know the American legislation has failed miserably. 
We need our legislation to be not only better but much better 
than the American legislation, which the Liberals are using as a 
template for what they are offering Canadians with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we need to see science, not politics, used as the basis 
of the legal list of endangered species.  The legal list must be 
left not to the discretion of the cabinet but to scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we need to see compensation regulations that are fair. 
These compensation regulations must be clearly spelled out in the 
bill.  There should be provisions for full compensation, not just 
the 50% or the formula promised by the Liberals so far.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, we need to make sure the bill recognizes that protecting 
spaces is critical for protecting species, and species recovery 
action plans must consider socio-economic studies before recovery 
plans are developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, we need to see that transparency and accountability are 
improved, through the suggested round table in the bill being 
truly representative of all stakeholders and through equal 
application of the law to all Canadians regardless of race or 
creed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we need to see that there are mechanisms in the bill to 
resolve disputes with the provinces.  The Liberal government has 
never paid attention to developing relationships with provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians want to help the environment.  They want to 
protect biodiversity.  We in the Canadian Alliance care about 
protecting species at risk and protecting or recovering critical 
habitat.  Canadians recognize that we need a proactive approach 
to protect species at risk, one that is based on respect, respect 
for the species that inhabit our lands and waters and respect for 
those who own those lands.  We want a common sense policy that 
considers the needs of all stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is committed to protecting and preserving 
Canada's natural environment and endangered species and to the 
sustainable development of our abundant natural resources for use 
by current and future generations.  The Canadian Alliance 
maintains that for any endangered species legislation to be 
effective, it must respect the fundamental rights of private 
property owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Surrey Central, whom I represent, are from largely 
metropolitan or suburban areas.  While we are not running the 
risk of having our land confiscated without compensation or 
without reimbursement of fair market value, we do not want any 
Canadian subjected to such unjust treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, far from working in a democratic way to help Canada's 
ranchers contribute to our nation's efforts to save our 
endangered species, the Liberals are promising punishment for 
those ranchers.  My heart goes out to the farmers and ranchers, 
who are already overtaxed by the government and who are already 
suffering.  They have huge input costs that are the fault of the 
government and its lack of vision.  They have to compete at a 
disadvantage on world markets thanks to the government's poor 
record on international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I have been told, the Liberals are now planning to 
take sometimes thousands of acres of land from individual 
Canadians without a fair process of compensation and under the 
threat of criminal charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Canadian Alliance has two main concerns to be 
addressed in regard to the bill.  The first is scientific 
integrity. Species listing must be determined by scientists, not 
by politicians.  It should be determined by scientists and based 
on scientific fact.  Our second concern deals with fair 
compensation.  The Canadian Alliance believes there are a number 
of areas that can be strengthened in the bill in order to make it 
more accountable and transparent to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I feel strongly that the government has more work 
to do on the bill and I would like to see that work done before I 
support it, but again, I am not above voting the way my 
constituents want me to vote on this bill on their behalf.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-5 
concerns the protection of wildlife species at risk in Canada. 
I would like to briefly put the bill in context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biodiversity as a whole is the result of the evolution of the 
earth over more than 4.5 billion years. This process created a 
wide selection of living organisms and natural environments on 
our planet. Together they form the ecosystems that we know 
today. Each one plays a specific role in the food chain and 
contributes to the biological balance of the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in recent years scientists have been warning about the 
disappearance of certain species in increasing numbers, as well 
as the rise in the number of species facing extinction or 
extremely vulnerable species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate to have a debate on this legislation just 
after the list of species at risk of extinction in the country 
has grown to an all time high. In Canada the number of wild 
animals, plants, insects and marine organisms at risk of 
disappearing now stands at an all time high of 354. This is a 
stark reminder that our country's natural heritage is under 
threat. The rate at which species disappear from our planet 
speaks volumes to the overall health of our environment and 
ultimately our own human health. As we know, when species 
disappear from our planet it means that we could also disappear 
if we are not careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worldwide we are experiencing the largest extinction epidemic 
since the time of the dinosaurs.  Down through the ages an 
average of two or three species disappeared each year for 
natural reasons.  Two or three species are now disappearing 
from the planet every hour.  This is alarming and it is entirely 
due to the actions of human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois are aware that all Quebecers and 
Canadians are concerned about the protection of species at risk 
and about protecting and preserving the environment as a whole. 
We recognize that the fragile balance of the ecosystem must be 
protected and preserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few years there has been a worldwide attempt to 
halt this phenomenon.  Since the 1970s international agreements 
have been signed with a view to limiting trade in certain animal 
and plant species in order to protect them from extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cases in point include the 1971 convention on wetlands of 
international importance especially as a waterfowl habitat, 
better known as the RAMSAR convention, the 1973 convention on 
international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and 
flora, and the 1979 convention on the conservation of migratory 
species of wild animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, at the Rio summit, many nations of the world, including 
Canada, signed the convention on biological diversity and made 
the commitment to “develop or maintain necessary legislation 
and/or other regulatory provisions for the protection of 
threatened species and populations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soon after that, the Liberals promised, in their red book, to 
ensure long term protection of species that live on our planet. 
In 1995 the Minister of the Environment introduced a bill in 
that spirit. 
The bill gave rise to an incredible amount of criticism and 
protest, mainly from environmental groups.  One of the main 
objections to the bill had to do with the fact that the 
legislation would  apply to federal territories only.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the federal government proposed a Canada-wide agreement 
to the provincial and territorial ministers of the environment, 
the Accord for the Protection of Species at Risk.  In October 
1996, the ministers responsible for wildlife gave agreement in 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time although the Quebec minister of the environment 
signed he issued an independent press release in which he made 
it clear he could not ignore the fact that the agreement would 
likely pave the way for overlap and that developments would have 
to be monitored very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will tell me that it is a common event to have overlap 
between Quebec and the federal government. 
At that time, the provinces were very vocal in their criticism 
of the federal government for giving itself such broad powers on 
the protection of species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pollution and migration know no borders, so a concerted effort 
is required worldwide.  Canada needs to better protect its 
species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in 
Canada, COSEWIC, has designated 340 species of wildlife in 
Canada as being at risk.  Of that total, 12 are extinct, 15 
others are extirpated in Canada, 87 are endangered, 75 
threatened and 151 vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the increasing rate with which species are disappearing, 
the situation is serious.  Effective action is therefore 
necessary. 
But has this bill really made a contribution to improving the 
protection of our ecosystem and of the endangered species in it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government and the minister are wrong about 
what their real role is in designing a realizable plan to 
provide such protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is but one of the many stakeholders, and it has 
not yet figured out that its true role is to build bridges 
between the various stakeholders, not walls.  I must say that 
the federal government is far more interested in promising to 
build bridges when it is electioneering than in building bridges 
between stakeholders.  It is extremely good at building walls, 
however.  So that is what the true task of government is when it 
comes to endangered species, a task it has failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill on species at risk the Liberals have introduced will 
polarize and divide stakeholders much more than it will unite 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every action plan to protect species at risk must be based on 
respect, that is on respect for species living in our waters and 
our lands, and for those to whom they belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is full of provisions providing discretionary power, 
to the point that, if it passes without amendment, it will be 
the weakest of its type in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True to the Liberal style, Bill C-5 establishes officially the 
Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as the 
ultimate authority in determining endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the bill prevents this committee, which makes 
decisions based on scientific data, from determining which 
species are in fact protected by law.  The committee determines 
which are the endangered species, but will not be allowed under 
the bill to take steps to protect these species and to draw up a 
list of them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day the bill becomes law, there will be no more endangered 
species in Canada, at least officially.  Not one species at risk 
today will be protected under this legislation, until the 
minister has established his list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current list of species at risk, the product of 23 years of 
work by COSEWIC, will not be considered a given and will not be 
automatically included in the law.  When is an endangered 
species an endangered species?  When the minister so decides, it 
seems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What threatens species most is the loss of their habitat, where 
they live, reproduce and feed. 
Habitat loss is responsible for 80% of species decline in 
Canada. Passing a law that does not protect habitat is really a 
waste of parliament's time. Again Bill C-5 fails in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention as an example an issue I raised this week about what 
the Canadian forces are doing right now in Lake Saint-Pierre, in 
Quebec.  We know that the government is still thinking about 
cleaning up Lake Saint-Pierre, which would indeed come under 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the provisions of this bill a species will be 
protected at the discretion of the Minister of the Environment. 
Not only does the bill give broad discretionary powers to the 
Minister of the Environment, but it does not respect the 
division of powers as stated in the constitution and as 
interpreted over the years. This bill truly interferes in an 
area under provincial jurisdiction and excludes the provinces 
from any real and direct input into the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main problem with this bill, which seems to be raised by all 
environmental groups, is the fact that the decisions on the 
designation of species will be taken by the minister and his 
cabinet, and not by scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the increasing rate of species extinction, the 
situation is serious. It is true that we must take effective 
measures, but does this bill really provide an additional protection that 
is enforceable? Will it really do something to improve the 
protection of our ecosystems and of the threatened species that 
are part of them? In our opinion the answer to these two 
questions is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact we are opposed to this bill because it constitutes yet 
another direct intrusion into many areas of Quebec's 
jurisdiction. It even overlaps the act passed by Quebec in 1989, 
which works just fine and has already had a significant impact 
in our province. The federal government is again engaging in 
overlapping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill could very well increase paper burden, instead of 
allowing for an efficient use of already scarce resources. 
This is what the federal government is currently specializing 
in: creating paper burden, instead of respecting everyone's 
jurisdictions and working more efficiently with less money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, what the federal government calls a double safety 
net, that is two levels of government operating in the same 
jurisdiction, waters down the accountability of both and seriously 
complicates the assignment of responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we recognize the need to improve the protection 
of our ecosystems and the endangered plant and animal species 
that constitute them, 
but we do not believe Bill C-5 is the way to go.

<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is extremely important for me to speak today on this 
piece of legislation.  It is certainly important to people in my 
constituency: farmers, ranchers, people in the oil and gas 
business, people who have cottages at lakes and even those living 
in towns who may run into serious problems in the ownership and 
use of their property through this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I owe it to those people, who supported me so well in the past 
election, to speak on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe there is any party in the House that does not 
take seriously the issue of protecting species at risk, although 
I wonder why it has taken the government seven years to finally 
bring in the legislation.  Of course, it has not passed yet and, 
I would suggest, should not pass without some serious amendments. 
However, we will work on that by offering some of our 
suggestions, which is what I am here to do today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking quite openly and honestly, I think every member in the 
House wants to protect species at risk and endangered species. 
That is not the issue.  The issue is whether Bill C-5, the 
legislation presented by the government, will in fact do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will approach the issue from two points of view and deal with 
two key parts of the legislation which would determine whether, 
as it is, it would protect even one species at risk or endangered 
species.  I suggest that it will not.  I will use evidence from 
other countries to back that up.  However, I will not leave it at 
that. I will also offer a positive approach to fixing the bill so 
that it will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point I want to make concerns the issue of fair market 
value compensation.  The second point concerns using a 
co-operative approach to saving species rather than a 
heavy-handed approach.  As I go through those two points it will 
certainly show that the legislation can be changed to make it 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to read what the Canadian Alliance has to say about 
species at risk, endangered species and the environment 
generally.  It is just a short statement.  The Canadian Alliance 
says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to protecting and preserving Canada's natural 
environment and endangered species, and to sustainable 
development of our abundant natural resources for the use of 
current and future generations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not what the endangered species legislation is supposed 
to be about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance maintains that for any endangered species 
legislation to be effective it must respect the fundamental 
rights of private property owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the issue I will deal with first.  I will approach it 
not only from the point of view that the legislation tramples on 
private property ownership rights but also that taking that 
approach will cause the legislation to fail.  I believe it will 
cause it to fail to save even one species.  I will use evidence 
to indicate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking that if a piece of property, be it farmland, a 
cottage at the lake or a piece of commercial property being 
developed, is taken from someone in the name of protecting a 
species at risk, which in some cases makes sense and must be 
done, then compensation should be made at fair market value. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1250
<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What principle could possibly lead the government to suggest 
that compensation be anything less than fair market value?  It 
seems to me that most Canadians respect that as a value on which 
to base legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the use of property, be it a cottage at the lake or farmland, 
is curtailed in some way in the name of saving a habitat or a 
species at risk, then let it happen within reason.  Let us ensure 
that compensation for the loss of the use of that property is at 
fair market value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government would change the legislation and put in it 
clearly that compensation would be at fair market value, it would 
have gone a long way to making the legislation work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will look practically at a couple of things that are likely to 
happen and that have happened in other countries where 
legislation has not offered fair market value compensation.  I 
would like everyone to think of a farmer, for example, who has a 
piece of property where a habitat for a species at risk is found. 
The farmer loses part of the property or the use of part of it 
without fair compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If farmers or ranchers know that if a species at risk is found 
on their property they will lose the property or the use or 
benefit of it without fair market value compensation, what are 
they likely to do?  I suggest they would do everything they could 
to ensure the species or habitat was never found.  Does a piece 
of legislation that would lead to this type of action sound 
productive?  I suggest it is not.  That is why it must be 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation must be amended to have a guarantee of fair 
market value compensation.  A farmer, rancher or someone who owns 
a cottage at the lake will respect and protect species if they 
know the legislation ensures compensation at fair market value. 
That is a fundamental issue which is key to making the 
legislation work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government continues to push the legislation through 
without making that amendment, then it will fail.  We can point 
to examples in the United States.  A lot of Americans and 
Canadians are shocked that this government has tailored its 
legislation to the American endangered species legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use a couple of quotes.  The first is about the American 
endangered species act.  It is by Bruce Vincent, president of 
Alliance for America, and he cares about protecting endangered 
species.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We've watched in horror as Canada tries to replicate the mistakes 
we've made down here. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is from an American on his shock that Canada is using as a 
model American legislation which has failed miserably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next quote is from the U.S. National Wilderness Institute. 
It said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Though unmeasured, the costs of implementing the Act as currently 
written are in the multi-billions, yet in over twenty years not a 
single endangered species has legitimately been recovered and 
delisted as a result of the Endangered Species Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That quote is from the U.S. National Wilderness Institute.  It 
cares about protecting wilderness and species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, they understand that the American legislation will not 
work.  They also understand that the Canadian legislation, which 
is modelled after the American legislation, simply will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am doing today is offering suggestions that would change 
the legislation to make it work.  That is the bottom line and it 
is what all of us want here.  We want legislation which will work 
to protect endangered species.  These changes will help that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start by ensuring in legislation fair market value 
compensation for property loss or for property where the benefit 
is lost.  That is the first fundamental principle that is not 
respected in the legislation and which must be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a far more effective type of species at risk legislation 
would be one that used a co-operative approach rather than the 
heavy-handed approach the government has used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to a few examples from around the world where 
co-operative approaches have worked.  In western Canada, we have 
Operation Burrowing Owl, a voluntary operation that does not take 
a heavy-handed approach.  Ranchers and farmers across 
Saskatchewan and parts of Alberta have voluntarily and willingly 
participated in the operation because they care about the 
environment and about protecting endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 500 farmers have agreed to have their land kept in a state 
that will protect the habitat of the burrowing owl.  That is a 
co-operative way of ensuring we save species at risk.  It works. 
This legislation will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second example is the North American Waterfowl Management 
Plan.  Whether these species are at risk or not, the principle 
works the same.  It is a co-operative way where people across 
North America have protected habitat or waterfowl using the 
voluntary approach.  It is extremely effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ducks Unlimited has proven that its program works and works 
well.  I have not heard much complaining from farmers who have 
been asked to take part.  They willingly take part.  There is 
compensation involved.  It works because it is co-operative and 
because they care about species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting in place a piece of legislation that encourages and 
allows a voluntary approach will cause species to be saved, which 
is the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One more category of voluntary approach that works involves 
private ownership of property.  Private groups and individuals 
have taken initiatives, that are allowed under their legislation, 
that have really worked.  The first is in limited areas of 
Alabama and Florida where private groups and individuals can 
create their own reefs.  Because it is a private thing, guess 
what?  It really does protect and develop the reef habitat, and 
it has been extremely effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lists of examples of voluntary approaches from almost 
every continent.  I do not know of any from Antarctica but I know 
of them from every other continent, and they work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980, land was purchased by a privately owned nature 
conservancy in California to form the Kern River Preserve.  This 
preserve harbours one of the rarest ecosystems:  a riparian 
habitat with a number of rare wildlife species dependent on 
riparian forests.  The managers of the preserve have worked to 
develop the trust of neighbouring landowners.  They do not 
enforce or use the heavy hand of the law.  They do not say that 
they will take away property without fair market value 
compensation.  They have worked to gain the trust of neighbouring 
landowners to make the project work and it has worked.  Species 
have been saved.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of this fact, in spite of this evidence and in spite of 
the government knowing this evidence, has it altered this 
legislation to include these two important issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue deals with compensation of fair market value, 
not just some broad statement that there may be compensation at 
some level.  That is no comfort to someone who may have their 
property taken away or the use of it denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue is the use of a co-operative approach without 
the heavy hand of the law hanging over them.  I would suggest 
that if the government were to focus this legislation more on 
these two areas it would work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence from other countries around the world shows that this 
type of legislation will not work.  In the name of protecting 
species at risk, I ask the government to amend the legislation to 
include the two important points I brought up today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud and happy to speak on behalf of my constituents and 
other people right across Canada whom I have heard from over the 
past five years, since I have been dealing with government 
legislation to protect endangered species.  I am proud to stand 
on their behalf to propose these changes which will lead to the 
protection of endangered species and species at risk right across 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am delighted to enter into this debate on behalf of my 
constituents in Elk Island.  As the House knows I have a number 
of people in my area who are very interested in this legislation. 
Most of the concerns expressed to me deal with some of the things 
which my colleagues have already mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember growing up on a farm in Saskatchewan where we had the 
delight of having a dugout right in our yard.  When I was a kid 
preserving water was one of the greatest things.  With the dugout 
came all sorts of different animals such as birds, ducks and 
occasionally some geese.  They would live right in our yard and 
we enjoyed them so much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out, in terms of a personal commitment, that my 
dad, my brother and I were always very careful not to interfere 
with the lives of these animals unless they declared war on us, 
which they did occasionally.  For example, we had an ongoing war 
with rats which caused a lot of damage to our buildings, grain 
storage bins and so on.  I know that when we buy a loaf of bread 
we do not want it to be infested with rat droppings and other 
things like that, so we had to take measures to fight them 
varmints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were other animals which gave us a lot of pleasure like 
the ducks that swam around on our pond.  We watched mother duck 
raise her little ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On occasion we would accidentally disturb or sometimes even 
destroy, what is called under Bill C-5, the natural habitat of 
birds.  We never did that deliberately.  Whenever we saw a nest 
we would drive around it even though it meant perhaps not seeding 
that portion of the field.  Sometimes we were not aware of it 
until we had driven over it and then it was too late.  There was 
nothing we could do about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-5 when that happens to a farmer maybe the penalty 
given to them will take into account the fact that there was 
nothing the farmer could have reasonably done to prevent such a 
loss.  Yet the farmers in my area are very concerned that they 
may be subject to prosecution if they make an error like that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife and I now live on an acreage east of Sherwood Park.  I 
had a very interesting experience a couple of years ago.  I was 
cutting my lawn with my little garden tractor.  We have about an 
acre of lawn so it is a nice, fun project.  I was driving along 
and I noticed this killdeer running around.  I am aware that when 
a killdeer has a nest in the ground the mother does everything 
possible to try to distract a person away from it.  If we are 
walking and that mother runs in that direction, we know that the 
nest is somewhere behind her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did everything possible to see whether I could find the nest 
before I proceeded to cut the grass.  I could not find it. 
Eventually, I drove over it.  Fortunately, I perfectly straddled 
it with the wheels of the tractor so that the nest was left 
undisturbed.  Once I was able to determine where it was, it was 
protected until those little babies grew up and left home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just the way we westerners are.  We do not deliberately 
go out and kill animals whether they are endangered or not.  For 
the Liberal government to bring down heavy-handed legislation 
which threatens all sorts of penalties and jail sentences to a 
farmer is really very offensive.  We voluntarily do everything 
possible to prevent that, as I have indicated from my own 
personal experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However is there need for some legislation?  I suppose there is. 
There are some who would deliberately destroy the lives of 
endangered species.  Perhaps some restraints for them is a 
legitimate process of legislation, and I am not against that. 
However, the legislation should specifically say that if a 
specific move is made to destroy that life, then there should be 
penalties.  We are very concerned about the application of the 
laws as they are going to be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as a little aside, where we live there is a lake with some 
exotic ducks.  I have forgotten their name.  Every year we have 
observers from all over North America who come and set up their 
little booths to watch this particular breed of duck.  It is a 
very special thing.  We enjoy the visitors, especially from the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day my wife and I were sitting at the kitchen table looking 
out on our backyard.  There were probably 250 or 300 Canada geese 
that landed just right behind our house.  It is one of their 
staging areas in their annual migrations.  We saw a coyote coming 
out of the trees.  It was very fascinating to watch.  He put his 
tail way down and sort of slunk along because he was having goose 
for breakfast that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he got close, he was not aware that every time there is a 
flock of geese, there are always two, three or more scouts out 
there while the others are busy looking for something to eat. 
There are always some geese with their heads up.  They are 
looking and watching to see if anything is coming toward them. 
When he was probably about 15 to 20 metres away from the geese, 
somehow they must have given a signal and they all took off.  It 
was so fascinating to see the coyote sitting there on his hind 
legs looking up and watching his breakfast disappear into the 
sky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife was cheering for the geese.  I, of course, was lamenting 
the coyote who was going hungry.  We really enjoy wildlife in 
that way.  It is definitely worth preserving.  It is a policy 
with which we agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the issue of rights and property, we want to let 
it go to committee so that the committee can deal with these 
things and bring in the amendments.  We talked about amendments 
regarding the definition of endangered species and taking the 
politics out of that definition.  Some of my colleagues have 
spoken about some of the other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk specifically for a few minutes now about the 
right to own property.  This is one of the high points of the 
Canadian Alliance policy. We believe that we should have assured 
in our charter of rights the right to own and enjoy personal 
property. 
That is not given to us in our present charter of rights and is 
something which the Liberal government seems dead set against 
because it means it would lose control over every citizen's life, 
if it could ever stop controlling every little thing that someone 
does.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always thought it was an oxymoron or at least a contradiction 
in terms that the Liberals use the word liberal because it comes 
from the same root word that I think means liberation, freedom 
and liberty.  Yet the Liberal government is more intent on 
controlling every aspect of our lives than any other government. 
It is a contradiction in terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak now on behalf of a number of residents in my riding who 
have expressed their concern with respect to compensation.  They 
say that if portions of their land, where they make their 
livings, very meagrely these days I might add, have to be taken 
out of production, surely they should be entitled to full 
compensation for it.  Bill C-5 does not permit that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 says if their loss is more than 10%, it would be 
considered, but they would only get up to 50% of that.  Which one 
of the Liberal members would accept it if someone came to his or 
her house and said the going value of the house was $200,000 but 
he or she would be given $100,000 for it.  It was not a matter of 
take it or leave it, the member had to take it.  There was no 
option. This is what is being offered to farmers for their 
property, their land and their source of livelihood.  That is not 
good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has nothing to do about animals but it is about the 
government confiscating property.  I remember when I was a kid on 
the farm.  The government came along and said it was going to put 
a high tension power line through the property.  The government 
actually said this to my brother who farms in Saskatchewan. 
There was this big dual pole property line and the soil was 
sterilized for about 30 metres in diameter from each pole, 
probably even more, diagonally across a field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My brother had to work his machinery around those posts, and all 
that land was taken out of production.  He did not get a fair 
value for the land nor for the production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big issues right now is that farmland is almost being 
given away because of the depression in the agricultural 
industry.  If land which usually sells for $500 or $600 an acre 
is now selling for $200 because of this temporary, we hope, 
depression in the agricultural industry, what is fair market 
value?  According to the bill, if we take half of it we are down 
to $100 an acre.  That is not acceptable.  That must be amended. 
I for one am going to vote against the bill, unless there is an 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on longer but I am going to terminate my speech out 
of deference for my colleagues who also wish to add some comments 
on the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to have the time to speak on this 
issue.  I will be sharing my time with the member for Medicine 
Hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity, as it is my first chance 
to speak in the House of Commons since the election, to thank my 
constituents of Wild Rose for their overwhelming support by 
returning me to this place.  I certainly appreciate their strong 
support.  My appreciation for the Wild Rose people is certainly a 
good opening for the speech which I am about to make on 
endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I looked through the constituency polls throughout most of 
Alberta, and particularly Wild Rose, the counts for the Liberal 
government were very low, so I can see why it would be anxious to 
get some kind of endangered species act in place.  I can assure 
the hon. members across the way that if they are looking for more 
support in the west, they had better not even think about passing 
a bill of this nature. 
They must recognize those individuals who work hard and produce 
all kinds of good things for the nation.  They work very hard to 
look after our environment, to look after our wildlife, and to 
look after the many things the bill is supposed to be addressing. 
For their own initiatives they should receive a lot of applause 
from that side of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely abhorrent the government introduces legislation 
that suddenly indicates to these same people that they are 
criminals if they do not shape up and follow the legislation. How 
in the world could it come up with legislation that points the 
finger at individuals who have worked hard all their lives 
protecting wildlife and endangered species and say that they are 
the people it will go after if they do not follow the Liberal 
law? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why the government left property rights out of the 
charter of rights.  I have no idea.  It is a disgrace that it 
did.  It would be very beneficial if the House would consider 
some kind of legislation or amendment to get property rights back 
into a national constitution in some manner.  Seeing it is not 
there, we have to do everything we can to protect these 
individuals from draconian legislation that simply says “obey us 
or become criminals”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I immigrated to Canada some 30 years ago having spent a lot of 
time in the western part of the United States where I was born 
and raised.  I saw legislation go through various governments 
there that was very similar to what I am holding in my hand 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each summer I have a chance to visit some of my relatives and 
friends in the United States I notice that various chunks of land 
are held in reserve under land management of the state of Idaho, 
the state of Wyoming or other states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this land used to be privately owned productive land.  Some 
of the people who owned it and produced on it for years were 
friends of mine.  They were removed from the property and were 
never compensated.  After all the years of working their 
property, they are gone.  They do not own it.  It is now under 
land management of a particular state, the government, and they 
received no compensation.  That is a devastating move to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened as a result of that kind of legislation? Those 
who remained in ranching, farming and doing whatever they could 
to make a living, have adopted their own policy.  It is called 
shoot, shovel and shut up.  In other words, they do not worry any 
more about endangered species because the government will attack 
them if they announce that they need some assistance in helping 
to protect a certain species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of fear alone they simply will not disclose any information 
to the authorities indicating that there might be a need for some 
good scientific work to preserve some species at risk.  That is 
what that kind of legislation leads to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Living in the little town of Sundre in the foothills of Alberta, 
I cannot say what a joy it is to go around that particular neck 
of the woods.  I never know on any day what I might enjoy seeing 
in terms of wildlife or flocks of certain species. In our home 
one night my wife and I heard a rumbling in the furnace.  We 
thought a mouse could have been caught in there. 
The next day we decided we should get brave enough to get at the 
furnace to see if we could get this mouse out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  I hope it was not a skunk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Yes, we hoped it was not a skunk or 
something, but the noise kept going on during the night.  The 
next morning when we got up we began to take the furnace apart, 
piece by piece, so we could locate the noise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It so happened a bird got down our chimney, ended up in the 
furnace and fluttered around all night trying to get out.  I did 
not realize it was a bird until I finally opened up the right 
area.  It immediately flew out over my head and shoulders and 
enjoyed flying around our house for the next half hour as we 
attempted to get it outside.  To this day we have no idea what 
kind of bird it was.  I had not seen a bird like that for a 
long time.  It was not covered with soot or anything and it was 
certainly an interesting beast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if I had called the government to help me in that 
situation whether I would have been charged for endangering the 
life of an endangered species.  We thought it was a mouse and we 
were tempted to put poison in there to get rid of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is this.  People in Canada, people in the land where I 
live, Alberta, really and truly enjoy wildlife and really and 
truly enjoy living in the foothills, where we never know from day 
to day what we might encounter.  They certainly do not need 
legislation and direction from the mighty powers in the ivory 
towers of Ottawa on how to maintain their land and how to look 
after the kinds of things that we are talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the government will force through legislation that will 
make criminals out of good, honest people who love wildlife and 
who love this country.  Once again the Liberals will go way down 
in the polls, and if I am fortunate enough to run again I am sure 
I will get an even bigger majority, so maybe I should thank the 
government for this kind of stupid legislation.  In the meantime, 
welcome to Canada, the land of shoot, shovel and shut up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a real pleasure to rise today to address the 
legislation.  I wish to begin by acknowledging the efforts of 
some people in my riding who have really done a lot to draw 
attention to the problems with this piece of legislation.  They 
represent the Brooks and District Chamber of Commerce and brought 
forward a resolution dealing with concerns over the government's 
endangered species legislation to their Alberta chamber and 
ultimately to the Canadian chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention some of them by name:  John Nesbitt, 
Mara Nesbitt, Don Bruce, John Petrie, Clint Hendrickson and Terry 
Magnussen.  They have all served on the board of the Brooks and 
District Chamber of Commerce and have really worked hard to try 
to improve the bill.  At one point I believe they even had a 
meeting with the minister and urged him to consider some of the 
things that were just mentioned by my friend from Wild Rose and 
by others who have spoken today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that concerns me most is the government's 
know-it-all attitude.  For 100 years, people in Alberta have 
settled the land and have gone out of their way to protect the 
environment.  I just cannot emphasize that enough.  My friends 
have referred to that, but I want to say it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one drives through our part of southern Alberta, one see a 
lot of farms and ranches.  Invariably on those farms and ranches 
one can see where farmers have put up shelter belts, where 
animals now have habitat, and one can see, especially in my part 
of the world, a lot of irrigation.  That irrigation ends up 
creating all kinds of habitat on the corners of fields.  We see 
sloughs which would not otherwise exist that are full of cattails 
and full of pheasant and the animals that feed on pheasant, such 
as coyotes and all kinds of foxes.  There are a lot of foxes 
coming back into the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People want to preserve that.  They like the wildlife just as 
much as the people do in the big cities and in those parts of the 
world that will not be as heavily affected by the legislation as 
the people in the rural areas will be. 
It is critical the people understand that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of Ducks Unlimited projects in the area where I 
live.  Every year at the Brooks Ducks Unlimited dinner, $70,000 
is raised by auctioning prints and all kinds of different donated 
items.  It has created an unbelievable string of sloughs, or 
marshes which is the term people here use, that go for miles 
through our part of the world.  As a result, deer and antelope 
have access to water.  There are all kinds of ducks, geese, 
muskrat and beaver that are able to enjoy that as habitat.  That 
is something people voluntarily do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a program called Operation Burrowing Owl.  We preserve 
pieces of land voluntarily so that burrowing owls have a place to 
establish a habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that for many years people in Alberta, and certainly 
in my area, have gone out of their way to protect habitat.  What 
bothers me is that, although there have been consultations this 
time, the minister was not listening.  The fact that these groups 
went out of their way to protect this habitat is simply not 
reflected in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other element that is critical to people is the issue of 
compensation.  According to one report that was requested by the 
minister, there was a suggestion that the government should pay a 
compensation of up to 50% of the losses for people who would have 
their land set aside for habitat.  Fifty per cent is absolute 
theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when it is the law makers who break the law?  There 
is a natural law that should guide this country which says that 
if we take something from somebody then we pay them full 
compensation, not half.  We are in a situation where the 
government is effectively saying that it is going to take 
people's livelihood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind people that, while we are having a debate in 
this place, farmers are going through one of the roughest periods 
in their history.  It is a terrible time, where they are 
struggling to make it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is adding insult to injury by saying to the 
farmers, as they struggle with some of the lowest commodity 
prices in history, that it will be putting in place legislation 
that would limit the compensation they get to half of what they 
actually deserve, according to fair market value.  That is 
ridiculous.  It leads to the sort of consequences my friend 
mentioned a minute ago, where farmers will say that if it comes 
down to their survival or the survival of these animals, then 
these animals will have to go.  We then get this perverse 
situation where we get completely the opposite results of what 
was intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will wrap up by acknowledging the work of people in my riding 
who have done so much.  There are many cattlemen in the riding 
who have gone to great lengths to point out some of the flaws. 
Tom Livingstone who is a cattleman has pointed out some of the 
problems.  I would urge the government at this point to consider 
some of the things that have been raised and not push this 
forward over the objections of the people who actually have to 
live with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance)</B> 
moved that Bill C-240, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(prohibiting certain offenders from changing their name), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, Bill C-240 would prohibit serious 
offenders from changing their names, provided of course that they 
get direction from the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would wonder why on earth this is a particular issue.  It is 
unfortunate, by the way, that the bill is not votable because I 
do believe it would pass.  I guess the issue of private members' 
business not being votable and yet being debated is a subject for 
another day.  What the final outcome of that will be, I will 
never know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this issue has been raised for several years now, in 
fact for about eight years, is that I have been working with 
people throughout the country, starting with a lady by the name 
of Rosie in Windsor, Ontario, who was assaulted by an individual 
and left for dead.  The individual was put in prison.  He 
promptly changed his name and all his ID.  He was released from 
prison, unbeknownst to her.  She was not told anything.  He came 
back to town with a new driver's licence, new ID, new everything, 
and began once again to stalk her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at that situation with her and found it to be accurate 
and true.  When I made a bit of noise about it in the House of 
Commons, a number of letters started to trickle in about similar 
circumstances.  Then lots of letters started to come in, so I did 
a fairly intensive bit of research and found that it was actually 
becoming common practice in the country.  My findings show that 
the people who are doing it more often than not are sex 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week I will be making a national presentation on all 
individuals who will be eligible next year for section 745 early 
release.  They are first degree murderers looking for the old 
faint hope clause.  We have done a fair bit of research on it, as 
we have every other year since the beginning.  I find from 
looking at the first page of the list that two of the four people 
have applied for name changes in anticipation of moving into our 
society again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of them is Darren Andrew Kelly, a.k.a. Ryan Scott Brady. 
Anybody who knows about this fellow knows he is one dude who 
should not be out on our streets, much less have a name change 
and the opportunity to have his identity hidden while he is out 
in our subdivisions and communities.  He is serving a life 
sentence for the rape and murder of a three year old girl in 
Sechelt.  The girl was abducted from a motel room, molested and 
then murdered.  Kelly is also considered to be the person 
responsible for the beating death of young Aaron Kaplan of 
Vancouver. 
Kelly is believed to have also molested the Kaplan boy before 
killing him by bludgeoning him about the head and chest with a 40 
pound chunk of concrete.  He sought the name change while in 
prison in Saskatchewan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope that the individual who is no doubt going to 
speak against this from the Liberal side does not rag on isolated 
incidents and look for the extreme cases.  I can assure the other 
side that is not the case.  I have list upon list of all of these 
individuals, or many of them.  In fact, I could not spend enough 
time tracking all these people down because there were so many of 
them.  Suffice it to say that some of Canada's worst sex 
offenders, oftentimes not murderers but serious sex offenders who 
have done all sorts of things, are on this list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about Robert Gordon Stevens.  The logic in this 
case is absolutely beyond me.  Robert Gordon Stevens was a very 
serious sex offender who abused children.  He went to prison. He 
met a fellow in another prison who was also a serious sex 
offender and who had changed his name from Willoughby to Oatway. 
Stevens and Willoughby-Oatway met in another prison and had 
themselves a little arranged matrimonial ceremony while in 
prison.  Stevens then changed his name to Oatway, which meant 
that Robert Gordon Stevens became Bobby Gordon Oatway and 
Willoughby was also named Oatway.  Bobby Oatway is the result of 
this.  Bobby left prison and admitted to the public that not only 
was he a serious sex offender, a well known fact in British 
Columbia, but also that he was in his crime cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of things happened and he moved back in, but while we were 
dealing with this issue under the name of Bobby Oatway I had a 
call from a lady in Quesnel who said she did not think he was 
Bobby Oatway.  She said that she had been one of his victims and 
his name was Gordon Stevens.  We traced it and found out what had 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is far too easy for serious sex offenders to hide in our 
society as it is, much less to allow serious offenders to change 
their names while in prison, while in the custody of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill makes provision for the courts to disallow individuals, 
where the circumstances involve serious crime, from changing 
their names or hiding their identities for a certain period. That 
way we can give some assurance to the public that if these 
offenders are out in public they are at least not disappearing as 
easily as the present kinds of technicalities allow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that some day the bill will come to the House of Commons 
and be voted on, because I find it passing strange in this 
country and in the House of Commons that the bill would not be 
passed and that we are having a change of heart on the national 
sex offender registry as well.  The government says yes, it will 
develop a registry, but then says it already has one, which is 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That's not what the police say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  It is not what 30,000 police say.  It is 
not what virtually everyone in the country says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By now we have hundreds if not thousands of letters that say we 
need a national sex offender registry.  We need to register the 
people.  We need to have them mandated to report.  We need to 
give them penalties if they do not report.  They need to report 
in person.  Deterrents need to be added.  The public needs to 
know where these people are.  What makes it doubly difficult is 
the system itself allowing them to change their names while in 
prison.  The system has a difficult time tracking them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again I have heard of cases.  I will mention a 
couple to the House.  In one case, a convicted murderer who was 
sentenced to 15 years in prison changed his name to Michael 
Francis Blais.  In another case, that of Robert Noyes, who was a 
very violent sex offender in British Columbia, I got a call from 
a parole board person who said that this offender had changed his 
name.  I was told that I could not get his name because someone 
else might find out.  After getting off the phone I telephoned 
the prison and was told that it was private information.  No one 
could tell me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Come on, I said.  This guy had sexually assaulted many children. 
He was a teacher.  If he changed his name and went to another 
province—which he did—what was to prevent him from leaving 
prison in B.C., changing his name and address, getting a new 
driver's licence, changing his name on his teaching certificate 
and, using a bit of jargon used in the teaching discipline, 
getting on as a substitute teacher in a new community, getting 
seniority and getting back into the classroom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If hon. members think this is some kind of fearmongering, it is 
not.  This is what these individuals do.  This fellow preyed on 
children in the classroom.  It is not above and beyond the 
mindset of these individuals to do such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation now is not a punishment for these individuals.  It 
is yet another situation whereby individuals go into a courtroom 
or a prison and basically nothing is done to prevent another 
occurrence of the situation.  In fact, the system aids and abets 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking for in this bill is a bit of common sense.  Not 
only do we need a sex offender registry, but we also need the 
ability, at the discretion of the courts, to prevent serious 
offenders from changing their names while in prison.  I am not 
saying it should apply to everybody.  Everybody has different 
circumstances.  However, surely in Willoughby's case and Gordon 
Stevens' case it applies.  I know some of Stevens' victims rather 
well.  They were chained to logs in his basement, and he charged 
a fee for people to sexually assault these children.  This is the 
kind of individual who is changing his name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just do not think that allowing people to change their names 
is a very good idea and neither do the many people I have worked 
with.  In fact, they are watching this today and hoping that 
there is some kind of reasoning from the other side, that the 
government will take a second look at this and maybe bring it 
back to the House for a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jamie Munro changed his name.  He, along with his brother, is a 
convicted killer of police officer Michael Sweet.  He served 12 
years, was released on parole and legally changed his name. Peter 
Patrick Bender changed his name to Peter Asher.  He has a long 
history of convictions dating back to 1979.  He was also 
convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to life in 
prison, but applied for a section 745.  The hearing is coming up 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changing names is as common as walking into a parole board 
hearing, which I have done many times, and hearing the same four 
things from prisoners.  Virtually every time one attends a parole 
board hearing, one hears the same four things.  A guy walks into 
the room and says, one, he has found Jesus, two, he has a woman, 
three, he is sorry for what he did, and four, he has taken some 
courses in prison and now wants to get out.  They get this 
ability from inside the system.  When questions start coming from 
parole board members, they go into meltdown because they really 
do not know what they are saying and they really do not know how 
to persuade or convince somebody of those statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the word gets out to sex offenders in prison that if 
they are getting out they are going to be watched, so for 
everything to be copacetic they should change their names, their 
IDs, their addresses and everything else.  They can become 
obscure and live in a house beside someone and everything will be 
copacetic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that when children or women are re-offended by an 
individual who has gone through all that, it is because we have 
permitted, aided and abetted it in our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government will not allow this to be votable and since 
this will not become law here for at least four years, I ask 
government members to reconsider what I said.  I also ask them 
not to stand and degrade the situation by saying that it is some 
kind of erratic response to an isolated incident.  I assure 
members opposite that it is not isolated.  It is in fact becoming 
commonplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the number of sexual offences on the rise, we must do 
everything we can, not only in our courtrooms and with a sex 
offender registry, but we must also convince judges to do 
everything in their power to prevent the reccurrence of crime. 
All of us know that sex offenders are the most difficult, if not 
impossible, to rehabilitate and get ready for the street. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to speak today to private member's bill, Bill 
C-240, respecting the rights of offenders to legally change their 
names. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ability to propose measures that are not among the 
government's priorities is an important element of parliament, 
one that can from time to time lead to constructive changes that 
have been hoped for.  The government is open to suggestions from 
those who sincerely believe they are proposing positive and 
significant changes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the sponsor of the bill has brought an idea to the 
wrong legislative body.  The process and the policies that govern 
legal name changes reside within the mandates of the provincial 
governments.  Each province has an official registrar or 
equivalent that grants or denies name changes and registers these 
changes in official records.  The federal government does not 
have jurisdiction in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I think the goals of the bill are of interest to all 
members of the House.  We all would agree that the need to keep 
track of convicted offenders is an integral part of the public 
safety equation on which the government stands firm.  It is 
especially a concern if an offender changes his or her name in an 
attempt to hide from authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of course critically important that government and police 
agencies across the country have the ability to track offenders 
released from our penal institutions.  That cannot be 
overemphasized, and the government stands firm in its resolve to 
ensure that is the case.  That is precisely why the government 
has invested in important and useful tools to keep track of 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only look at the Canadian Police Information Centre, 
CPIC, and the national DNA databank as examples.  The Canadian 
government has a national database containing information on all 
individuals who have been convicted of an indictable offence in 
Canada.  It includes birth names, names chosen later in life, 
aliases and any other pertinent information with respect to the 
individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That database is called CPIC and it is maintained by our 
national police force, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  It is 
available to all police agencies across Canada.  I can assure 
this House that CPIC has been a national success story in law 
enforcement since it first began operation in 1972.   We continue 
to provide the necessary resources and tools, and it has become 
the envy of police forces around the world. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT46"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT46"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1350

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House why.  CPIC is the primary tool used to 
identify suspects, to access outstanding warrants and restraining 
orders, to screen out sex offenders from jobs involving contact 
with children and to flag files of dangerous offenders.  It is a 
database that serves over 60,000 law enforcement officers in each 
province and territory and it handles over 100 million queries 
from 15,000 points of access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPIC is linked to over 400 criminal justice agencies in Canada 
as well as internationally, and the government has committed 
millions of dollars to upgrade and renew CPIC to ensure it 
remains a valuable resource, which it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also put in place another mechanism to 
identify some of Canada's most serious and repeat offenders:  the 
national DNA databank.  This is a tool that has, in my view and 
in the view of the government, revolutionized the way police work 
is done in Canada today.  It is already proving to be a very 
valuable tool with respect to public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA databank is maintained by the RCMP.  It contains a crime 
scene index that includes DNA profiles from unsolved crime scenes 
as well as a convicted offenders index containing DNA profiles 
from serious and repeat offenders.  It has been in place since 
last June as a result of the wisdom and foresight of our 
government.  It has already had an unprecedented number of 
matches between crime scenes and convicted offenders and it is 
helping police conduct their investigations more effectively and 
efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, Madam Speaker, the national DNA bank is yet 
another example of how the government is keeping tabs on 
criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point, and the reason the government has invested in these 
tools, is simple.  Because of leading edge technology at our 
disposal, like CPIC and the DNA databank, we effectively keep 
track of offenders in a number of ways and not only through their 
names.  We also use fingerprints and even their DNA.  We do not, 
I repeat, do not, simply rely on criminals to tell us their 
proper names.  That would be pretty naive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality for criminals in Canada is that they can run but 
they cannot hide.  This is especially important for victims of 
crime.  I can assure you, Madam Speaker, and all members in the 
House, indeed, all Canadians, that it is the victims who are our 
first concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an enormous amount of sympathy for victims.  I worked 
with them when I was chair of the Waterloo Regional Police 
Service and I can tell members that because victims are involved 
in our criminal justice system through no fault of their own, we 
should be there for them.  While it is true that many wish to 
hear nothing further from their perpetrators, there are also 
countless victims who wish to be kept informed of what happens to 
offenders once they enter a federal penitentiary.  In those 
cases, then, victims are most certainly brought into the process 
by Correctional Service Canada as well as the National Parole 
Board.  Each of these agencies has active victim outreach 
programs which, upon the victim's request, provide information 
about the location of the offender, upcoming hearings, transfers, 
conditional release dates and other details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to realize that the agencies within the criminal 
justice system also talk to each other.  Correctional Service 
Canada, for example, and the National Parole Board work closely 
with the RCMP to provide information that is relevant, important 
and of interest to the CPIC people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the practice of Correctional Service Canada to provide 
information in each instance where an offender succeeds in 
formally changing his or her name.  What that means is that all 
authorities who have a key role to play in the administration of 
an offender's sentence have access to information about the 
offender which is continually updated with important information 
the police authorities need to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the issue are those offenders who make an 
effort to rehabilitate themselves and who want to put their 
troubled pasts behind them.  These are the offenders who 
participate in programs that are available to them in the 
criminal justice system.  These are the offenders who participate 
in mental health programs, literacy programs and educational 
opportunities.  These are the offenders who try to make, and 
hopefully do make, an honest effort to put their pasts behind 
them, move on to a new and law abiding life and reintegrate into 
society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak of the majority of offenders when I mention those 
people.  Upon their return to the community some of these 
individuals seek anonymity to break the ties with their past so 
that they can make a fresh start.  Regardless, the appropriate 
authorities still have a record of those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to realize that even if offenders succeed in 
changing their names through a provincial government registry, 
that information is added to our existing federal government 
databases.  The information is maintained by our national police 
force and shared with local police services across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is my belief and the belief of the government 
that with the DNA databank, CPIC and the co-operation of the RCMP 
and municipal and provincial police services across this great 
country, we already have the tools to ensure these efforts are 
maintained in a positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out again, as I did at the beginning, that it is beyond 
the jurisdiction of parliament to deal with this issue.  For 
those reasons, then, I do not support Bill C-240 and I ask all 
hon. members in the House to do the same. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the previous speaker for his foray into the language of 
Molière and assure him it is always appreciated on this side of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we can support the bill introduced by my 
colleague although we acknowledge the worthiness of the 
concerns he has shared with us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think all Canadian parliamentarians are concerned about 
public safety and want us to live in a society where those who 
represent a threat to public safety or may be sexual offenders 
or may commit other types of offences punishable under the 
criminal code may be known to the police.  We think that the 
means proposed by this bill do not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us begin by saying that the sponsor of the bill spoke as if 
the bill was to apply just to sex offenders, when the bill 
clearly provides that it applies equally to people who have 
committed first or second degree murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me there are fairly significant distinctions to be 
made between the ability of someone who has committed second 
degree murder to be rehabilitated and that of someone known 
nationally as a sexual predator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that in the bill, as section 727.1 appears, this 
difference is not very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the identity of the criminals covered by the bill cannot 
be sanctioned or the subject of interventions by this House, 
since the various civil registers are not under federal 
jurisdiction.  It would be difficult, through a change to the 
criminal code, to ask the courts of justice to be responsible 
for this application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, for example, the provisions on name changes would be 
found in the civil code. It is hard to imagine how we could 
reconcile having a common law court apply the criminal code and 
a judge issue orders relating to the civil code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find disturbing in a bill like this one is that, in a 
way—and the sponsor of the bill mentioned this several times—it is 
as if the rehabilitation of people who have been found guilty of 
criminal offences is simply not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example to illustrate my point. In my riding 
office in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, I met a 17 year old who comes 
from a dysfunctional family. 
His mother had remarried to a man who beat her up and who 
displayed extremely violent behaviour. This young man killed his 
stepfather.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe he had turned 18 when he committed that murder. This 
makes it first degree murder. He killed the man because he was 
living in a home where family violence prevailed. He claimed he 
did it to protect his mother. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there can be no excuse for such an action. But with a 
bill like this one, this young fellow citizen is in jail for 10 
years. If he becomes eligible for parole after serving 10 years, 
he will then be 28. He will not even have lived one-third of his 
life and he may well want to reintegrate society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who sponsored the bill would have us believe that 
people who are incarcerated are not required to undergo any sort 
of rehabilitation program.  I believe that it is comments such 
as these that show that our Canadian Alliance colleagues lack 
the judgment we are entitled to expect from parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They must know—particularly with respect to Quebec, but I have 
been told that this is true in the case of other provinces—that 
those who are incarcerated are periodically evaluated.  And 
programs exist to help them develop their social and behavioural 
skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The various federal penitentiaries offer a cognitive skills 
training program, a living skills program, and a sex offenders 
program.  There are therefore a number of programs to help 
individuals try to improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do these programs produce results in all cases?  Of course not. 
Some people are offenders through and through.  It is in their 
genes and they will never change.  It is the role of the 
government and of legislators to ensure that these people do not 
come into contact with the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, as drafted, is much too general. Interpreting it 
would pose quite a challenge for judges and it does not go into 
the detail we are entitled to expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I follow the bill's logic, my constituent who, at the age of 
18, killed his stepfather in the circumstances I recounted, 
would not be eligible to change his name. I do not think this 
would be desirable in his case.  It is possible for someone to 
have made mistakes in one's life and to be rehabilitated.  It is 
possible to have committed first or second degree murder and 
subsequently become a good citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection I am not sure that the right means are being 
taken to attain this most desirable objective.  I do not, I 
repeat, want to see sexual predators or serial killers moving 
about freely in my riding of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve any more than 
the hon. member wants them in Ahuntsic.  That is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a long jump from that to asking us as parliamentarians 
to pass a bill that would provide the courts with an 
interpretative framework that disregards the constitution.  This 
creates difficulties.  It is not possible for a court of 
justice, which has to reach a decision on an offence covered by 
the criminal code, to make interpretations relating to the 
identity of individuals since that involves provincial civil 
records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next month the Minister of Justice will be introducing a bill 
that will review the important provisions on organized crime and 
the criminal code.  If I had one well-meaning criticism to make 
of my colleagues in the Canadian Alliance, it would be that they 
do not always differentiate between criminals in general and the 
worst type of criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take for example Mom Boucher, the leader of the Hell's Angels, 
whose stomping grounds were my riding of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
I have no hopes that he will be rehabilitated now that he is 
behind bars.  I hope that we, as parliamentarians, will bring 
more severe provisions into the criminal code so that it will be 
unlawful to even be an ordinary member of any of the 38 
motorcycle gangs known to the RCMP and to the criminal 
intelligence service.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not prepared to support a bill providing that a person 
found guilty of first degree murder, under the circumstances I 
have mentioned, is to automatically be denied an identity 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a debate on criminal law, rehabilitation and protection in 
society, there are nuances to be made.  Unfortunately, things 
are not always as black or white as members of the Alliance 
would have us believe sometimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I am sure than our colleague, the sponsor of this 
bill, is motivated by the very noble reason of public safety, 
but I am not sure that the means and the route he advocates are 
the right ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote statistics which, I think will 
illustrate my remarks once more.  We know how the parole system 
works.  Eligibility for parole does not come automatically. 
When sentencing provides for the possibility of parole, it comes 
after 25 years if a life sentence is involved, and after one-sixth 
of the sentence has been served in other cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I know that these concepts are familiar to you 
because you have served as Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, when we study our colleague's bill I hope we 
will find it contains harsher measures for criminals, but the 
possibility of rehabilitation for those who would seem to have 
the potential for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, a happy St. Patrick's Day to you and other 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to Bill C-240.  This is a bill that brings 
forward the discretionary powers of a judge to expand upon 
conditions that can be put in place to protect the public 
generally.  It is a bill that would prohibit certain offenders 
from changing their names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discretionary powers that currently exist in terms of the 
sentence a judge may mete out, include such things as putting in 
place prohibitions on the possession of firearms, weapons or 
explosives, or the use of drugs or alcohol, or prohibiting an 
offender from associating with known criminals or associating 
with children.  These are obviously protective measures that a 
judge in his or her wisdom has deemed necessary to continue with 
the rehabilitative process and, more important, to protect the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose with this bill quite clearly is the prevention of an 
individual who has been convicted of a serious violent offence, 
whether it be of a sexual nature or violence, from changing his 
or her name either during or after incarceration so that the 
public might be informed and there might be an ability to 
recognize this individual by name.  Banning the ability to change 
name I would suggest does enhance the ability to protect the 
public, so there is a very rational purpose behind the bill 
brought forward by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revelation, or the heightened public awareness, came about 
quite recently that Karla Homolka might be planning to change her 
name.  This certainly alarmed a lot of people around the country. 
There was a sense of fear and frustration on the part of many 
that a person convicted of such a heinous crime could somehow be 
released and live under an alias.  It is very similar to the 
reason in which persons will often cloak themselves or wear masks 
to hide their identities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although in this notorious case it did not occur, there was an 
excellent point behind the rationale of the bill.  Violent 
offenders often attempt to change their names and successfully 
change them while in prison.  Although media publicity would make 
it virtually impossible in the case that I referred to for that 
individual to go unnoticed, the reality is that there are many 
violent offenders who are successful in hiding their identities. 
Then, subsequent to their release, blend into communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the importance of rehabilitation and the ability of 
offenders, having paid their debt to society, to come back and to 
try to contribute in a productive way.  However, there is also 
this ongoing threat in the case of certain types of offences. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1410"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT50"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT50"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1410

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member would not take any umbrage with 
possible amendments to the legislation he has proposed.  The bill 
calls for discretion.  It is not the be all and end all answer to 
the problem.  It calls for discretion on the part of judges to 
exercise whether they would impose this ban.  It is, as well, 
enunciated that it is for a scheduled list of offences.  A judge 
would obviously take into consideration certain circumstances as 
to whether it would be appropriate.  This is not to be used in 
every case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the argument that once people have served their 
time that they want to get on with their lives.  The greater 
purpose of public protection sometimes warrants that the 
knowledge exists that these individuals involved themselves 
previously with violence or in the worst of cases involving 
sexual violence with children.  I would suspect that those 
vulnerable persons in our society must take a priority when it 
comes to protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The priority of the Conservative Party has always been with the 
rights and safety of the public.  We sadly acknowledge that there 
are individuals who continue to pose in some instances a life 
long threat to children in particular.  I am referring to 
pedophilia where it has been diagnosed in many cases as an 
affliction that remains with an individual.  Sex offenders in 
particular continue to pose that threat even after release, if 
there is no follow up or treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary gave the House a particularly odious 
self-congratulatory speech.  He droned on about the ongoing 
dubious accomplishments of the Liberal government.  The reality 
is when it comes to the CPIC system, we were on the verge of 
collapse just a few short years ago.  We heard the 
re-announcement time and time again of the $115 million that went 
into the CPIC system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association told Canadians it needed double 
that amount to make the system really work.  It was only a few 
short years ago that it was described by a member of the police 
association as being held together with bubble gum and barbed 
wire.  That was a bit of a different slant on things than we 
heard from the parliamentary secretary.  This was coming from an 
individual more in the know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary also spoke about the communication 
and the exchange of information between departments.  I want to 
speak very briefly on that.  It appears that there is increasing 
evidence that there is a breakdown sometimes in the communication 
between departments, whether it be CSIS, the solicitor general's 
department, Corrections Canada, the RCMP and the parole board. 
Our RCMP on occasion do not share information with the department 
of immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very recent example of that.  In the Amodeo case, 
this debacle where an individual wanted by Italian authorities 
was in Canada, there were communications from the Italian 
authorities to the RCMP and to the Department of Justice.  There 
were applications under way for extradition.  We know that on 
June 10 the immigration department received an application from 
the wife of this notorious individual that contained the name of 
Mr. Amodeo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some reason, and the minister has referred to legal 
documents and one can only assume this means the individuals were 
separated, it had the name in its possession.  Surely someone in 
the department of immigration must have run a check either on the 
wife or Mr. Amodeo himself.  It would have found the name red 
flagged on the CPIC system if it was operating properly.  The 
system is also linked to Interpol.  There is a question as 
to whether the CPIC system was working or whether this was a 
human error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This communication break down can be very fatal when we are 
dealing with individuals like Mr. Amodeo who is suspected of 
involvement in three murders and Mafia connections in Italy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That demonstrates the fact that this system is not foolproof. 
It is certainly subject to human frailties if the information is 
not entered.  It also demonstrates that there is a need for 
protection.  The use of that information is extremely important 
in law enforcement in this country.  The bill would enhance the 
ability of law enforcement communities to use information 
successfully to protect the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other examples where the current system has failed us. 
The refusal of the government to eliminate the statutory release 
from corrections and conditional release.  This allows even the 
most unco-operative offenders who continue to pose a threat and 
who have refused rehabilitative efforts, to be placed back in the 
community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This often comes after serving less than two-thirds of their 
time.  It is a sad reality that Canada has consistently seen 
violent criminals being released without proper rehabilitation. 
It is good proof that systems anywhere are not always perfect, 
but we have to do everything that we can to try to enhance the 
law.  It is incumbent upon us to examine approaches such as the 
one put forward by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an example that would demonstrate how this would work.  A 
not so notorious killer, or a rapist, or an unrepentant, 
unrehabilitated offender from Nova Scotia was released upon 
warrant expiry.  He changed his name, moved to British Columbia, 
received a new driver's licence, new identification and set up a 
new life for himself, which he was entitled to do.  What if that 
individual then applied to become a Boy Scout troop leader, a Big 
Brother or a coach? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of situation could put a child in serious jeopardy 
given that individual's past.  It could be prevented possibly by 
the type of system that is envisaged in Bill C-240.  There is no 
guarantee but it would be a step very much in the right 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of lack of knowledge can be tragic and at the 
very least it is entirely possible that this type of offender, if 
he committed a crime in British Columbia under a new name, would 
be given the benefit of extra judicial measures.  It is a 
subterfuge to change the name or mask a person's identity.  There 
needs to be responsibility.  The purpose of the bill enunciates 
the type of crimes for which it would be appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not oblige judges to act.  It simply allows the 
courts to make these types of prohibition orders.  It may be a 
prohibition for life or for a short duration.  The courts can 
consider the desirability and applicability of the circumstances. 
A court now makes prohibition orders on similar circumstances. As 
well, the penalties are tied into indictable offences.  I 
cautiously support the bill, or a variation thereof, and I 
congratulate the hon. member for bringing it forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Betty Hinton (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, my comments will be very 
brief.  First, I commend my colleague from the Tory party for his 
comments.  It is reassuring to know that there was someone in the 
House who was listening with full attention today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very upset with some of the comments that were made.  There 
is a very distinct reason for the legislation that we are putting 
in front of the House today.  It is to protect children.  It 
cannot be emphasized too much that this would be at the call of a 
judge.  There would be a chance for a judge to determine whether 
the person was trying to change his or her name for the wrong 
reasons.  In the case of sexual offenders against children, there 
can be no right reason to change his or her name.  We need to be 
able to identify those people across the country to keep 
children, our most sacred natural resource, safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national screening system, CPIC, is another thing that has 
been raised.  It only serves to prevent sex offenders from 
working or volunteering within organizations involving children. 
CPIC only contains the criminal records of sexual offenders.  It 
does not inform police that a dangerous sex offender is living 
within their jurisdiction.  That is what the legislation would 
also do.  It would inform a community that it had a dangerous 
offender in its area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to do the things that we are expected to do in 
the House, and if any errors are made, we should always err on 
the side of the child.  I will support the legislation fully. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I commend the member for putting forth the proposed 
legislation. I too regret, as he mentioned in his speech, that 
Bill C-240 is not votable. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1420"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is great to be able to talk about issues in this place called 
the Parliament of Canada, the place of speaking, the place of 
words, but the ultimate purpose should be to put our words into 
action in a practical sense so that our goals as members of 
parliament representing our constituents are actually met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our primary goal with legislation like this is, as has been 
mentioned over and over again, the protection of children and 
women.  We are talking about the ability of serious criminals to 
change their name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day we spoke at length about the need for a national 
registry of sex offenders, those who prey on women and children. 
The purpose of things like that is very clear.  We know we cannot 
make people good just by passing a law, but we also know that the 
function of law is to restrain those who are evil.  That is why 
we are here and why motions and bills like this should be 
votable.  We should be able to actually implement ideas that will 
make our society safe and restrain those who would do very bad 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned that there is almost a passive response to 
these initiatives on the governing side.  I know our current 
rules of debate will be subject to revision and we need to really 
seriously ask the question whether we should be even able to have 
such a debate without bringing it to a vote.  The second and the 
more important issue here is that, with the parliamentary 
secretary having given a speech that said basically the Liberals 
do not favour the legislation, it would mean that even if we were 
able to vote, it would go nowhere because they would tell 
their people to vote against it and that would be the end of the 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are suffering from a lack of a democratic environment in the 
House.  We are in a situation where we need to change some of 
these laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address another issue in the bill, the issue of 
jurisdiction.  It has been pointed out that the keeping of vital 
statistics is a provincial matter, and I believe that is 
correct.  When our children were born in the province of Alberta, 
we registered their births in Edmonton, not in Ottawa. I should 
not say they were all born in Edmonton because we also had a 
daughter born in southern Alberta, in the little town of Brooks. 
However, their births were registered in Alberta.  I personally 
have a birth certificate from Saskatchewan, the province in which 
I grew up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the fact of the matter is that we are dealing here with 
a criminal issue.  We are dealing with people who can change 
their names, move to a different jurisdiction and, consequently, 
by changing their identity can become an unknown danger to people 
around them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Bloc made a very good point when he said 
that we ought not to put a wall in front of people who are 
genuinely rehabilitated, who want to get on with life and who, 
from this point onward, want to be good, law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think we err when we buy into the argument that a 
person convicted of a crime and having paid the penalty to 
society, as it is often said, is then off the hook.  In our 
country we often find people only serving two-thirds of their 
sentence because the government does not enforce the full rule of 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that all of us have obligations.  I 
have never been convicted let alone even charged with a crime and 
yet I have an obligation.  When I walk down the street at night 
and there are other people sharing the sidewalk, I have the same 
obligation not to attack them as the person who has served time 
in jail for having attacked someone.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that our obligation to society does not end when we 
have fulfilled a sentence for having broken the law.  All of us 
carry an ongoing obligation to society to maintain our 
surveillance and protection of others around us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It boggles my mind that there is such resistance to many of the 
measures that we are trying to implement and promote, which would 
enhance the safety of Canadian citizens.  We should have a number 
of really good laws like the one being proposed that would 
improve the safety of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can say that it is too harsh but I do not believe that it is. 
I do not believe that some of the penalties we are proposing, for 
example, serving consecutive sentences for crimes that are 
committed rather than concurrently, are too harsh.  If people 
think that is too harsh, let them simply not break the law.  The 
law will never apply to them, and they will have freedom for 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say they break the law, violate the safety and violate in 
some cases the property of other people.  In the case of 
property, there should be restitution.  In the case of personal 
violence against individuals, there should be time penalties and 
incarceration.  There should be no discount for consecutive 
offences.  There should be rules that tell us that if we do 
certain things there are consequences, and then we should stick 
to it.  I do not see why that is difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always said that I personally do not care whether there 
is capital punishment for murder or not because I am not going to 
commit murder.  Therefore, I do not expect to face a charge which 
will lead to capital punishment.  For people who are 
contemplating it, hopefully it would restrain them.  That would 
be the overriding purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have drifted a little from the purpose of the bill, which 
would disallow offenders from actually changing their names in 
order to hide behind the cloak of anonymity when they re-entered 
society.  We need to help these people all we can.  Knowing that 
they have committed a crime, I do not think is a hindrance to 
their rehabilitation.  I do not think it is not as useful for 
them to be able to hide and pretend that they did not commit a 
wrong, as it is for them to face up to the crime, admit they did 
it and ask their new neighbours to help them to be strong, to do 
what is right and to fix their life.  It is an ongoing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like alcoholics.  When they go to Alcoholics 
Anonymous, even though they may not have drunk liquor for a 
number of years, they still begin their speeches by saying their 
names and that they are alcoholics.  They recognize that there is 
an ongoing temptation and that it takes great inner strength and 
the strength of those around them to support the positive changes 
and not reoffend in that sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it may be difficult for a person who has committed a crime 
to live with that identity.  I am aware of several individuals 
who have committed crimes of a lesser level.  I am their friend 
and I help them.  They are doing fine.  We do not shut our eyes 
and pretend it never happened.  We have to realistically admit 
that it happened and work together toward the goal that will 
guarantee it will never happen again in that individual's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in the whole basis of taking responsibility for what 
one does.  That is the missing link in a lot of what leads to 
criminal behaviour in our society these days.  There are 
youngsters in school.  They could be youngsters who go home, the 
parents are absent, certain things happen and they are allowed to 
do whatever they want without being personally held accountable 
for it.  That develops and eventually we have the commission of 
these crimes.  I urge all members to support the bill.
