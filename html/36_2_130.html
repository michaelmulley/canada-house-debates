table or that he is prepared to give to all the opposition 
parties about that?

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>INFORMATION COMMISSIONER 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege concerning the 
systemic intimidation of an officer of the House of Commons. This 
is a very serious allegation, I admit, but in the past 24 hours 
our attention has been drawn to the government's use of its 
levers of power to intimidate the office of the access to 
information commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you would know as an officer of this House, the 
decision on the definition of what constitutes contempt is 
reserved for the collective House of Commons, that is, the issue 
now before the Chair is whether there is sufficient evidence to 
give this matter to the House for examination and decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Speaker laid on the table the report of the access 
to information commissioner, who is similarly an officer of 
parliament, both of the House of Commons and of the other place. 
The commissioner has made very disturbing and troubling 
allegations.  I refer to his report at pages 9 
and 10.  I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its part, the Privy Council Office (PCO) decided to resist 
and challenge almost all of the Commissioner's investigative 
powers.  To this end, officials of PCO have ignored orders for 
the production of records; failed to fully comply with such 
orders (in one case non-compliance persisted until after two 
Federal Court judges had ordered PCO to comply); 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on in the next paragraph to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this latter regard, PCO lawyers advised a senior PCO 
official, 
of Deputy Minister rank, to refuse to answer questions under oath 
put to him by the Commissioner, because there could be no 
punitive consequences.  When the Information Commissioner cited 
the official for contempt and began the enforcement process, PCO 
also agreed to pay the legal costs associated with the 
constitutional challenge.... 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is blatant contempt for the commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on in the final paragraph on page 9 to say: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...with no prior notice or consultation, to rescind a protocol 
with the Commissioner's office which was adopted and followed 
since 1984.  The protocol governed the process by which the 
Information Commissioner could obtain a certificate from the 
Clerk of the Privy Council officially attesting that records 
claimed to be Cabinet confidences are, indeed, confidences. 
PCO claims now that it may exclude confidences from access 
without any obligation to certify through the Commissioner (as it 
must for a court) that such records are, indeed, confidences. 
</UL></UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, on page 10 of the information commissioner's annual 
report for 1999-2000, it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Justice Canada, the “home” department of the access law, 
it decided not to defend the Access to Information Act against 
the above-mentioned constitutional challenge brought against it 
by the senior official of PCO and funded by the Crown.  Indeed, 
in proceedings before the Information Commissioner, an agent for 
the Attorney General took the unprecedented position of impugning 
the constitutionality of the very legislation which the Attorney 
General has the duty to defend. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a blatant conflict of interest at work based on the 
words and in this report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of my submission I refer to page 11 
of the report which says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's palpable animosity towards the “right” of 
access (it would prefer to dole out information by grace and 
favour in well-digested mouthfuls) is no more apparent than in 
the disconnect between talk and action in the matter of reform of 
the Access to Information Act.  Every study of the Act (from 
Parliament's own review in 1986, to the Justice department's 
internal reviews, to the Information Commissioner's reviews, to 
independent, academic reviews and careful reviews conducted by 
private members) has concluded that the law needs to be 
modernized, strengthened and expanded. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very heady and very heavy words.  I submit that this 
report to parliament, written by an officer of parliament, raises 
sufficient questions and alarms to constitute a prima facie case 
that should be put before the House for examination and 
disposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner states that the privy council office, at public 
expense, has systematically challenged its powers and that the 
treasury board has systematically denied the commissioner 
resources to go about his duties.  These are grave allegations 
and grave findings which are deeply troubling and should be 
deeply troubling to every member of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has a duty to give this report a priority over other 
business which the government seeks to place before the House in 
its rush to a premature election call.  We cannot allow this 
damning report to be swept aside in a rush to the Prime 
Minister's vanity election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Prime Minister himself, the man responsible for the 
privy council office, who stands accused of impeding an officer 
of parliament in his duties.  The Prime Minister is going to 
dismiss the House before we can take action using the normal 
processes of examination of this report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon the Chair to put the House of Commons 
first, to rule that the findings in this report raise sufficient 
questions that they merit action and that the debate in the House 
should take place immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am of course prepared to move the necessary motion to let the 
House proceed with this issue.  I expect that other House leaders 
will have similar comments.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you to take 
action on this matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have two things to add to what the member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I have never read or seen a report from any officer 
of the House so condemnatory of the government as this one.  The 
report talks about the denial of resources to the information 
commissioner; that working for the information commissioner is 
the death of one's career because of the way the government 
reacts; that the privy council office is actively involved in 
denying information; and that the justice minister is not only 
complicit in this, but her department is actually attacking the 
very legislation that gives the information commissioner the 
right to do his business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never heard such strong language in the seven years that I 
have been in parliament.  Never have I read language which 
basically says that the government is trying to stop an officer 
of the House from doing his job.  It is doing it systematically, 
routinely, day after day and across the departments. 
That is something that should cause all Canadians great alarm.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just have to read not only the report but Mr. Reid's comments 
that were published today in papers across the country in which 
he said that democracy itself was at risk when the government 
gets away with what it is doing right now.  I could not agree 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to bring to your attention, Mr. Speaker, 
something that happened yesterday.  It does seem to fit the trend 
that we see from the government.  At 11 o'clock in the morning 
the information commissioner's report was tabled in the House. 
We in the opposition could not get copies of it until question 
period had begun, three hours later.  The report was tabled in 
the House at 11 a.m. and we were denied access to it. 
That too should be part of the debate.  How can we have things 
tabled in this place and then not have them available to the 
members of parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have the exact date and time but I remember, within the 
last couple of months of Speaker's rulings, where the Speaker 
actually said that when anything is tabled at the Table in the 
House of Commons it should be available immediately.  He also 
chastized the government for not making sure it was available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure how or why that happened.  I just know that for 
three hours we checked the website, phoned the office of the 
commissioner and did everything we could to get copies and we 
were denied access to something that was tabled in the House. 
There is something wrong with that and it should also be part of 
the debate that I hope we enter into today.  How on earth can the 
government say that it is defending democracy and our 
parliamentary traditions when the information officer of the 
House says that the government is complicit in hiding information 
that should be available, not only to the House but to Canadians 
at large?  Everything around here is based on our access to some 
kind of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be debating this.  It is an absolute condemnation of 
the government in the way it has handled this whole issue.  I 
hope that you, Mr. Speaker, will rule that we can enter into a 
debate about the confidence this place has in the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, our hon. 
colleague has raised a point of privilege I feel is of such 
importance that it requires us to intervene at this time, adding 
our voice to theirs and to that of the leader of the official 
opposition, in order to call for this matter to be addressed 
with the utmost urgency, as well as the serious accusations made 
in the information commissioner's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is appropriate to point out at this time—since we 
have gone to the heart of the matter—that I myself asked under 
Standing Order 52 that there be an emergency debate at the end 
of the day today on this matter, given the serious nature of the 
accusations and the fact that the report states in black and 
white, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>PCO refuses to accept the clear words of Parliament giving the 
Commissioner the powers of a Superior Court of Record in the 
conduct of his investigations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the accusations, the serious nature of this one is 
without precedent.  Privy council shunts aside and rejects the 
wishes of parliament to which the information commissioner is 
answerable. 
I would be prepared, in one way or another, to go along with the 
hon. member's request for an immediate debate on this issue, for 
a motion to be introduced and the issue debated.  If that were 
to be done, it would pre-empt the emergency debate we had called for 
this evening, or the Chair should bear in mind in its ruling 
that if it does not allow an immediate debate, we should at 
least use the evening to debate the matter pursuant to Standing 
Order 52.  Whatever is decided the final days of this 
government are a sorry spectacle.

scenes in this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the NDP caucus, I would like to comment on a point 
of privilege brought forward by the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, the House leader for the 
Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of privilege arises out of the tabling of the annual 
report of the information commissioner for 1999-2000.  I would 
just like to remind the House, but more specifically the 
government, that Mr. Reid presents his report to the Speaker of 
the House.  He says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Mr. Parent: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the honour to submit my annual report to Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report covers the period from April 1, 1999 to March 31, 
2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make here is that this 
report and the officer who has made this report is a creature of 
parliament and answers to parliament.  What we see developing 
here in the report of the information commissioner is part of a 
larger disease that affects the Canadian body politic, and that 
is, the relationship between the government and parliament is not 
what it should be.  What we have reported here, and which should 
be a concern for anyone, especially the Chair who is concerned 
with the integrity and the reputation of parliament, is evidence 
of what most of us see here every day, and that is that the 
government has contempt for the role of parliament and the 
democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, it is contempt for an officer of parliament.  In 
this case, we see evidence of the systematic attempts to 
frustrate the efforts of an officer of this parliament, the 
information commissioner, the person who reports to this 
parliament, to obtain the kind of information that he is mandated 
to obtain under the freedom of information act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report comes from someone with extensive experience in 
government and who was actually once a Liberal member of 
parliament.  This would certainly, in fairness, give the lie to 
some of the things we sometimes think, that just because someone 
has partisan considerations he will never give the government a 
hard time.  This guy is giving the government a hard time and 
properly so, but it points even more so to how bad the government 
practices must be in this particular instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, Mr. Speaker, that you should consider this point of 
privilege very favourably.  For me it is just one more symptom of 
a larger disease, and that is the contempt that this government 
has for this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not pointing fingers at the government House leader. 
In many respects, as is too often the case unfortunately, the 
people above the government House leader, those people in the 
Prime Minister's Office, in the senior bureaucracy and in 
treasury board, treat us all with contempt.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a question of government members treating opposition 
members with contempt.  It is a question of the Prime Minister's 
office, that small circle around him, and the senior bureaucracy 
treating all of us with contempt, whether we are a government 
House leader or an opposition House leader.  We have all fallen 
into the same basket as far as they are concerned:  people whose 
will is to be thwarted, whose status is to be diminished and who, 
instead of being respected because they are elected, are held to 
be the very people that obstruct their will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again we see the collective consensus of those in 
the senior bureaucracy and in the Prime Minister's office.  The 
information commissioner has laid bare the reality of this as far 
as freedom of information is concerned.  It behooves us all, 
including you, Mr. Speaker, to seize this opportunity to initiate 
a debate on what is a growing problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although points of privilege cannot become election issues, this 
frankly is something that the Canadian people ought to take into 
account.  We have seen another contempt of parliament just today 
when people are appointed to cabinet who have never been elected. 
It is better to be an unelected friend of the Prime Minister than 
an elected member of parliament who the people vote for.  Imagine 
that.  Let us bring in some of the backroom boys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona says he is trying to be relevant.  I hope he 
will try a little harder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with a point of privilege raised by the hon. member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough which has nothing to do with 
cabinet appointments.  Perhaps he can stick to the point.  I know 
he is doing his best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  What I am trying to point out is a 
pattern of contempt.  It is just a coincidence that on the very 
day we are talking about a report that shows this kind of 
contempt for parliament in terms of the government's actions with 
respect to the freedom of information commissioner and the work 
his department does, we have another example of this in the way 
in which the Prime Minister has appointed people to cabinet who 
are not at this time elected, some of whom have never been 
elected to the federal House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair ball to try to place this 
particular violation of parliamentary privilege, that is to say, 
those things the freedom of information commissioner points to, 
in the context of the larger contempt which the Prime Minister in 
particular has for the House and even for his own members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I remind the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona that we are not yet having a debate on this 
subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is rising on a question of privilege.  I hope he 
is trying to assist the Chair in coming to a decision as to 
whether or not to recognize this as a question of privilege.  If 
he has remarks along those lines, I would appreciate hearing them 
rather than what I think might be a very good speech on a motion, 
were there one permitted before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  The polls are relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a member across the way 
says the polls are relevant to this debate.  That is all the 
government thinks about.  Nothing else is relevant except the 
polls.  I suppose if the polls said that the government should 
take out a bunch of people and shoot them, the government would 
say “Fine, the polls say that is okay.  We will just do 
whatever”.  Instead it is members of the other side who aspire 
to be in cabinet who have been politically executed, while others 
have been brought in who are not even members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know you think this is not relevant, Mr. Speaker, but the point 
I am trying to make is that all of us should be concerned about 
the respect for this institution.  Whenever a government acts in 
a way that is disrespectful of democracy and disrespectful of 
parliament it is something that the Chair should concern itself 
with.  This point of privilege is an opportunity to give the 
members in the House a further opportunity to speak their minds, 
including those government backbenchers who may be embarrassed by 
the way they have been passed over and abused by their own Prime 
Minister

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

of privilege here this morning, as the Chair no doubt has already 
recognized or, I suspect, as he is about to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some discussion here as to whether or not the

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will acknowledge that it was raised.  I certainly do not want 
to contribute to that process because that is the Speaker's 
decision and only the Speaker's decision.  I recognize the 
Speaker will do that with the usual wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether one likes or dislikes a report tabled in the House does 
not constitute privilege.  That is not the case.  Whether someone 
receives the budget and he or she wants to do his or her function 
is not a matter of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Central Nova said that certain government 
departments sought legal counsel when there was a difficulty or a 
challenge to the interpretation of law.  Surely the learned 
member of the House should not be offended by the fact that 
people seek legal counsel in the interpretation of laws.  It is 
certainly not a question of privilege.  I do not see how anyone 
could even take that allegation seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader for the official opposition said that the 
access commissioner did not provide sufficient access to his own 
document.  That may be interesting as a point but the government 
does not distribute the copies of the access to information 
commissioner's document.  My own colleagues were trying to get 
copies of this yesterday and could not get it either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reminded by members across the way that this is an 
independent officer of the House.  Surely the independent officer 
of the House is not going to be dictated to the government as to 
how many copies to bring along.  That is something to be 
discussed between the Speaker and the independent officer in 
question, whether it is the auditor general, who will table 
documents later today, or whether it is the privacy commissioner 
or whether it is some other independent officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When independent officers who report to parliament do not 
provide sufficient copies of their documents, the Chair will 
discuss that with that independent office.  It is not something 
that the government is in any way responsible for or otherwise. 
The mere allegation of that is bordering on the preposterous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know someone raised and was quite nervous about the fact that 
the Prime Minister made excellent cabinet appointments this 
morning.  That nervousness was duly noted.  I will not comment on 
it further other than restating that I do not believe a question 
of privilege has been raised today with the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not know how much longer the 
Chair needs to hear members on this point.  I must say the Chair 
has heard enough to take the matter under advisement at this 
time.  I will allow brief comments from the three members who 
rose.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of points that may 
be of assistance to the Speaker.  One is the point made in the 
report which quoted Justice Gérard La Forest in 1997, a former 
Supreme Court of Canada justice.  I refer the House to the facing 
page of the report which says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overarching purpose of access to information legislation...is 
to facilitate democracy.  It does so in two related ways.  It 
helps to ensure first, that citizens have the information 
required to participate meaningfully in the democratic process, 
and, secondly, that politicians and bureaucrats remain 
accountable to the citizenry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that as members of parliament, as representatives of 
the citizenry of the country, we are deeply concerned about 
anything that puts a stranglehold on the information required to 
participate meaningfully in the democratic process and to do our 
job to hold the government accountable to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report not only clearly but scathingly points out that the 
government is impeding that very important process.  I refer to 
one quote on page 10, second column, first paragraph of the 
report which says “In sum, then, there is a full counter-attack 
in progress against the Office of the Information Commissioner”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take this very seriously.  It is not just a matter of 
partisanship; it is a matter of fundamental democratic practice 
in our country.  I urge the Chair to take this matter very 
seriously.  It is a matter of privilege, not only for every 
single member of the House but for every single citizen of this 
country.  I would ask the Chair to accede to the request of my 
colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough to bring this 
matter forward on an urgent basis so that it can be dealt with in 
a meaningful way, not swept under the carpet by the events that 
are taking place elsewhere in the democratic arena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would plead with you, Mr. Speaker, to give this matter the 
priority that we as members of the House feel it should have.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind you that there was 
a question of privilege moved by myself last June that is now 
before the House which relates directly to this matter.  I 
suggested that there was interference with my privileges as an MP 
because of certain documents that were presented to cabinet by 
the justice department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that you are expected to rule on 
this question of privilege very soon.  You might consider taking 
under advisement the current question of privilege until after we 
hear your ruling on my question of privilege.  My question of 
privilege is very specific and alleged direct interference.  If 
you find a prima facie case for my question of privilege, I think 
there will be ample opportunity for the House to debate the 
information commissioner's report in that context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair appreciates the comments of 
all hon. members who made submissions on the point that is before 
the House this morning on the question of privilege raised by the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the distribution of the documents, it is the 
Chair's understanding that there was a miscommunication between 
the privacy commissioner's office and the Chair in respect of the 
time of the tabling of the documents.  It is agreed that the 
documents were tabled at 11 o'clock and the documents were not 
released to members until later.  That was clearly the result of 
this miscommunication between the two offices and should in no 
way reflect on the validity or otherwise of the question of 
privilege that has been raised by the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair will take this matter under advisement and get back to 
the House with a ruling in respect of the hon. member's question 
as soon as possible.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair has received notice of a request 
for an emergency debate by the hon. member for Roberval. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you for 
recognizing my privilege, my right to speak to this request and 
to give my reasons for making it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that you should examine this request in the 
light of the question of privilege raised a bit earlier. 
Allowing the question of privilege would automatically dispose 
of the emergency debate, because there would be a debate today, 
which would meet our objectives.  If you were to rule the 
question of privilege out of order, obviously the matter of an 
emergency debate would remain an extremely pressing one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 1 of the information commissioner's annual report, the 
hon. Mr. Justice Gérard La Forest, former judge of the supreme 
court, says—the words are heavy with meaning—and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overarching purpose of access to information 
legislation...is to facilitate democracy.  It does so in two 
related ways. 
It helps to ensure first, that citizens have the information 
required to participate meaningfully in the democratic process, 
and secondly, that politicians and bureaucrats remain 
accountable to the citizenry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Page 2 of this report contains an extract from the Access to 
Information Act, subsection 2(1): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. (1) The purpose of this Act is to extend the present laws of 
Canada to provide a right of access to information in records 
under the control of a government institution in accordance with 
the principles that government information should be available 
to the public, that necessary exemptions to the right of access 
should be limited and specific and that decisions on the 
disclosure of government information should be reviewed 
independently of government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I have requested an emergency debate is that, in the 
report submitted to parliament, because the information 
commissioner reports to parliament, it says, and I quote very 
briefly: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>PCO claims now that it may exclude confidences from access 
without any obligation to certify to the Commissioner (as it 
must— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker: </B>Order, please.  This is not an opportunity 
to make a speech on the matter raised by the hon. member for 
Roberval with respect to the debate this evening.  It is merely 
a very brief presentation on the urgent nature of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to restrict his remarks to that 
point alone, nothing else. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Just one sentence, which 
will satisfy both you and myself. It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Privy Council Office refuses to accept the clear words of 
Parliament giving the Commissioner the powers of a Superior 
Court of Record in the conduct of his investigations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Privy Council Office is the department of the Prime 
Minister. It is questioning the authority of parliament and its 
decision to confer upon the commissioner responsible for access 
to information the powers to investigate, audit and distribute 
documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strikes me as so serious, given the words of Justice La 
Forest, that it is an attack on the very essence of democracy by 
the department of the Prime Minister.  It is not a minor matter, 
but rather one which merits an emergency debate this very day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair has carefully considered the 
comments by the hon. member for Roberval, as well as his letter 
submitted earlier this morning on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member has indicated, the Chair has already received 
a question of privilege from the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and has taken the matter under 
advisement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Chair decides it is a true question of privilege, as the 
hon. member for Roberval has indicated, there will be an 
immediate debate in the House on the motion by the hon. member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  It is possible to continue 
that debate during regular sitting hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, it is perhaps not necessary to consider the 
matter of an emergency debate this evening, because the Chair 
has already taken the matter under advisement.  In my opinion, 
the request is not in order at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, from what I understand, the 
ruling on the point of privilege has not yet been brought down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does your response mean that you are maintaining my request 
pending a ruling later on?  Because a favourable ruling disposes 
of my request, while an unfavourable one leaves it active and 
fully justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know where we stand exactly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. members must wait for the Chair's 
ruling on another point of privilege.  I must add, however, that 
it is standard practice to renew a request for an emergency 
debate daily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, if the Speaker's ruling is not brought down this 
afternoon, tomorrow the hon. member can request an emergency 
debate on this issue for tomorrow evening.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>AN ACT TO INCORPORATE THE WESTERN CANADA TELEPHONE COMPANY 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK47">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Industry)</B> moved 
that Bill S-26, an act to repeal an act to incorporate the 
Western Canada Telephone Company, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT12"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT12"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1055

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the purpose of Bill S-26 is to remove from the laws of 
Canada obsolete provisions that restrain Telus Communications 
from operating throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-26 is a standard housekeeping bill in many ways.  It 
would repeal an act to incorporate the Western Canada Telephone 
Company, known as the BC Tel act.  It thus would remove 
restrictions that hinder BC Tel from competing across the 
country.  These are restrictions only BC Tel faces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This constraint was put into place in the bad old days of 
provincial monopolies.  Today it is contrary to the competitive 
climate in which the telecommunications industry works in Canada. 
The Competition Act, the Telecommunications Act and the Canada 
Business Corporations Act will still apply to Telus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the bill because it is consistent with Canadian 
Alliance policy that government should foster a healthy economic 
environment for the benefit of consumers by pursuing free and 
open trade at home and abroad, including eliminating 
interprovincial trade barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The telecommunications industry is Canada's fastest growing 
industry.  According to the Canadian business performance report 
revenues grew 50% in this industry between 1998 and 1999.  This 
is tremendous growth.  It is one of the strongest assets in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian society is being transformed by the increasing use of 
technology.  In their homes, businesses and schools Canadians are 
embracing technology and the changes it brings.  Computer use in 
Canada jumped to a 36% national average in 1998 from 29.4% in the 
previous year.  Governments in Canada at all levels are changing 
the way they do business by incorporating this new technology 
into their practices.  Telecommunications companies provide the 
important ramp on to the information highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Canadian Bankers Association, between November 
1999 and January 2000 in Canada approximately 12.7 million 
adults, or 56%, used the Internet.  That shows an increase of 13% 
since 1997.  We can see this is a growing sector.  The 43% who 
are not currently on the Internet anticipate getting online 
within a couple of years.  We definitely need the infrastructure 
the telecommunications industry provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is not all good news today.  Too many bright Canadian 
entrepreneurs have been forced to go to the United States to find 
capital for their ideas.  Too many Canadian companies have been 
forced south or overseas by high taxes. Canada's personal income 
burden is the highest in the G-7.  It is 21% greater than that of 
the United States.  High taxes combined with a stagnant standard 
of living and an abysmal Canadian currency of a 65 cent dollar 
have been leading many individual Canadians to leave our country, 
in increasing numbers.  It is quite disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer Statistics Canada reported that over 62,000 
Canadians left the country this year, enough people to populate a 
medium size Canadian city.  That is an increase from the 58,000 
who left last year.  This is accelerating, if anything.  We know 
the U.S. high tech companies continue to look for people around 
the world.  That will continue unless we get our house in order 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While those people were packing their bags the Liberals were 
denying that the brain drain existed.  As recently as June the 
Prime Minister publicly rejected the notion that Canada was 
losing its best and brightest.  He insisted that the brain drain 
was only a myth being perpetuated by his critics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year 65,000 Canadians do not agree with that.  The brain 
drain problem must be addressed.  The Canadian Alliance fair tax 
plan would address the main reasons behind the exodus.  The 
Canadian Alliance would increase income for all Canadian 
taxpayers no matter how much they make.  We would remove 1.4 
million Canadians with the lowest incomes from the tax rolls 
entirely.  We would encourage investment and savings for 
retirement.  These measures would encourage Canada's best and 
brightest to stay and work here at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes quite a bit before a Canadian wants to leave this 
country.  Our friends and families are all here.  It is a major 
disruption.  For the people who have immigrated to Canada over 
the years we know it has been a major traumatic experience. These 
people did not do it willingly.  They were being driven out of 
their countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to relieving the onerous tax burden, Canada needs a 
strategy to compete in the global economy.  The Canadian Alliance 
would reduce business taxes and build a positive climate for 
doing business while ensuring Canada has a skilled workforce and 
a modern infrastructure.  Part of that infrastructure is 
telecommunications.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investors need confidence that government is getting the 
economic fundamentals right, and I would suggest that is not 
happening now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To encourage more high tech investment in Canada's economy, the 
Canadian Alliance would lower payroll taxes so that employees 
would take home more money and businesses could hire more 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would cut the capital gains tax on investing, which would 
take away obstacles that restrict investment and which would 
encourage the economy to prosper.  We only need to look at the 
situation in Ireland as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would cut taxes on the high tech industry.  The current 
system penalizes the new economy.  The Canadian Alliance proposes 
to tax all types of companies equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this day and age Canadians must be able to access government 
information and services online.  We would appoint a senior 
adviser on technology to oversee a project to ensure that 
Canadian citizens could access the Government of Canada online. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would increase support for Canada's research granting 
councils and co-ordinate scientific activities in all government 
departments to ensure that science, not politics, prevails. 
Canadians should not be left behind in the rush to do business 
online.  Canadian regulations need to be modernized to reflect 
the reality of a new technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-26 is a straightforward piece of legislation which would 
allow Telus to compete on a level playing field with other 
Canadian telecommunication companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an increasing global market deregulation of this kind is long 
overdue.  In fact we have quite a bit better legislation and 
trade agreements in terms of international trade agreements than 
we have here at home because of our interprovincial trade 
barriers which restrict Canadians from doing business across 
provincial borders.  That needs to be addressed.  It is long 
overdue.  I would suggest the government has not made much 
progress in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to give Telus the legislative freedom to do business 
in Canada.  Therefore the Canadian Alliance is supportive of the 
bill and will be supporting it at all stages to allow it to go 
through the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  My colleague from the opposition just mentioned the 
reason for my point of order.  I think you would find unanimous 
consent in the House to proceed with all stages of the bill 
today, including consideration in committee of the whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to proceed 
with the bill as indicated by the deputy government whip? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, we have a Minister of 
Industry and allow me to offer my congratulations this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased that the Alliance Party member for Peace 
River expressed himself on the bill.  We all heard him speak in 
support of the bill.  It is really a housekeeping bill as he 
clearly stated.  On our side we fully appreciate the fact that 
there is good co-operation on the bill.  He referred, for 
example, to the BC Tel act, which was enacted in 1916.  We 
certainly have to modernize things, and that is what we are 
trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He touched upon some of the most important issues.  I will not 
go into the nitty-gritty, but through Bill S-26 we are trying not 
only to modernize but to create a level playing field so that 
telecommunications companies have an opportunity to compete, to 
remain strong and to grow.  Not only will they offer excellent 
service but at the same time will create opportunities for 
Canadians locally and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank everyone for co-operating in moving the bill forward. It 
is also important to take this opportunity to talk about some 
issues with which we are faced today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Peace River touched upon some very important 
points.  He talked about technology and how we had moved forward. 
I stand here proudly as the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Industry to talk about our connecting Canadians 
program and our computers for schools program which put our 
country above every other nation.  We are probably the most 
connected nation in the world, offering high speed Internet and 
low cost. 
As Canadians we feel very proud of it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised one very important issue.  He talked about how 
we had better policy to deal with our international partners than 
we do within the provinces.  He is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government cannot simply stand and say it wants to 
do something.  Provincial jurisdiction has to be respected.  We 
have to work with our provincial partners.  I know the member 
agrees; we have talked about it personally.  I am sure he feels 
that by working together we will slowly, hopefully, overcome 
those barriers as quickly as possible for the good of each 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch upon some of his points.  He talked about companies 
and people moving.  In a global economy, in the global village we 
live in, there is a lot of mobility.  There is a great shortage 
of high tech people in Canada because it is one of the fastest 
growing industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not too long ago I read an article in the local papers in which 
applications had been put out for lab technicians.  About 80% of 
the individuals who applied were Canadians wanting to come back 
to Canada for several reasons: the fact that we have invested in 
research and development and that we have made some very positive 
steps in the last budget in how we treat, for example, our stock 
options in terms of capital gains, which the member for Peace 
River so eloquently touched upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what has clearly been addressed in the budget in terms 
of how we address options to motivate people to invest in our 
country.  That has been happening in a very healthy way.  Steps 
have been undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All statisticians and pundits out there, not us, have been 
saying that we are going to lead.  We have been leading the G-7 
in economic growth and in job creation.  We were the first to 
balance our books and we were the first ones to show a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just the other day I read in an article a comment made by Mr. 
Klein, the premier of Alberta.  He is now basking in the surplus 
he has.  He is now reinvesting it back into his province, and I 
am glad for that.  He said Alberta did not want to go back to 
1993 or 1994 when it had to make tough decisions.  Now he is able 
to reinvest in his province and he is able to give out some 
bonuses, as did the premier of Ontario, for example.  That is 
their prerogative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important at this stage to talk about the tough decisions 
that we as a government had to make in 1993.  We had a growing 
deficit after nine years of the Conservatives not being able to 
meet one of their budget targets.  We had a growing debt that was 
out of control.  Thanks to the Canadian people we carried out our 
commitment and balanced the books.  We are lowering the debt 
consistently, and now we are in the same position as Mr. Klein, 
thank God, to reinvest in our country.   Part of that 
reinvestment is looking at the high tech sector— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>   They do not want reinvestment; they 
want taxes down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  I am glad the member for Peace River is 
talking about taxes.  If we do not have the money, we cannot 
support the system, lower the debt and lower the deficit at the 
same time.  That is voodoo economics.  That is skidoo 
mathematics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government took a very responsible position, headed by the 
Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Industry 
and the new Minister of Industry.  We made those tough decisions 
in a compassionate way.  Yes, we created a lean government but it 
was not a mean government.  We went to the people with 
commitments and promises we have kept.  We are very proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member touched upon payroll contributions.  In 1993 they 
were pegged at $3.30 per $100.  My colleague sits on the industry 
committee with me.  He is a great participant with whom I have 
enjoyed spending time on the committee.  They prefer to refer to 
payroll contributions as taxes, but as a former employer I call 
them contributions, as did the former leader of the Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is on record year after year that payroll contributions have 
been going down.  Members opposite fail to accept this and ask 
why we have revenue.  Let us talk about revenue.  In 1993 we had 
11.4% or 11.6% unemployment.  We were having to put money out to 
support these people.  Today we have over two million people 
working who are not taking out of the system but who are paying 
into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about revenue and economic growth.  I stand here 
proudly as I look at the Secretary of State for International 
Financial Institutions, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance and the minister responsible for northern 
development who has invested in the north and created jobs. These 
people are working hard to put people to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about tax equality.  When I go to the 
doctor and I have an ache in my arm, he will start from that 
point and work his way.  We did everything within our means to 
deliver compassion to the nation.  I stand proud that the high 
tech industry the member talked about is growing by leaps and 
bounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been the creation of 2,000 21st century research 
chairs across country.  The United States has MITs.  Can we 
imagine having 2,000 MITs across our country?  That is what it is 
all about.  The government and the Prime Minister chose not to 
build monuments for the 21st century.  They chose to invest in 
the future of the country, our youth, by creating the Canadian 
millennium scholarship endowment fund which is preparing our 
youth of today for the economy of tomorrow.  That is one of the 
best investments we have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me close by saying that we have followed a very balanced 
approach.  This is reflective of what we are doing by modernizing 
legislation permitting Canadian companies to compete locally and 
internationally.  The member for Peace River referred to 
provincial barriers.  I am hopeful in the future and with their 
co-operation we can move toward working with the provinces to 
bring down interprovincial barriers so that we can have mobility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our health care system we have sent a very strong statement 
to Canadians across the country that the Liberal federal 
government is adamant about protecting health care.  It will 
enforce the Canada Health Act.  It has put its money where its 
mouth is and we intend to continue in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing let me thank all the parties that co-operated to fast 
track Bill S-26 for the good of the country, for the good of 
Canadian people and for the good of Canadian companies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the rather enthusiastic 
comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Industry this morning.  Normally he is a very quiet individual, a 
thoughtful, low key and humble kind of man.  Today he is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wondered what would cause my friend to have a different 
approach today.  Then I remembered that he is a hard working and 
determined guy who is dedicated to the Department of Industry. 
When he heard the Minister of Industry was leaving, I suspect he 
probably thought he would get an appointment, a better job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Prime Minister do?  He reaches out into a 
provincial legislature, picks a guy who promised to serve out his 
term in Newfoundland and places him as Minister of Industry. Talk 
about Machiavellian politics.  This has to be a case study in 
manipulation and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume the enthusiasm of the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Industry is a masking an extreme disappointment that 
he has been overlooked and our friend from Newfoundland has been 
brought back into cabinet in this eleventh hour cynical move. 
However that is the way the world is and there is not much we can 
do about it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his comments, my friend talked about the government's 
restoration of health care funding.  What he failed to mention is 
that when all of the restoration takes place, it will only lift 
the federal contribution to the level it was at in 1994.  I want 
to tell my friend this is not 1994.  It is not 1995, 1996, 1997, 
1998 or 1999.  It is the year 2000.  In other words, to feel 
great about this whole thing and to pat himself on the back with 
both hands, to say that we have increased funding to the 1994 
levels when we know populations have increased, when we know 
inflation has increased, is not really that great a contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just say to my hon. friend, we are still looking for a 
little bit more, but the point is still well taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also mentioned the investment the government has done.  I 
will be the first to say, yes, in a balanced approach, there have 
been very useful investments in the high tech sector.  We are a 
relatively well connected country, perhaps even, as he says, the 
most connected country in the world, but let me also remind my 
friend of other investments made.  They were not investments in 
social housing because the government says that we do not have 
any money for social housing, but we do have money for luxury 
hotels and resorts and we do have money for golf courses all over 
central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make the record clear, when my friend says we are investing 
in the economy, yes, he is investing in golf courses, hotels and 
resorts, but the government has not invested a single cent in 
social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  That is absolutely true.  Since the 
government took office in 1993 not a single cent has gone into 
social housing in this country.  The government has abandoned 
that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members can talk later and explain where I am wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is, we have people on Parliament Hill today from the 
women's march who are reminding us of this.  Every single MP is 
being lobbied today.  These people are saying “Please put some 
money into social housing”.  The reality is that the government 
has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just make it clear.  There is government money for golf 
courses, hotels and luxury resorts but no money for housing that 
is much needed in all parts of the country.  I could go on to 
identify other sectors as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he did not mention either was the incredible growth of food 
banks.  Not only have the national chartered banks done very 
well, the food bank business is also booming, and that we should 
be much ashamed of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend also did not mention the money that has not been 
invested in children.  While we woke up this morning to come to a 
parliament that is about to end, 1.4 million children woke up 
this morning living in poverty.  The reason they woke up living 
in poverty is not that only they are living in poverty but their 
parents are living in poverty.  Is this not some form of societal 
child abuse?  For a country as wealthy as Canada to permit, year 
after year, hundreds of thousands of children to live in poverty 
is a form of societal child abuse.  Quite frankly, we should be 
ashamed of this record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government announce any major initiatives in regard to 
child poverty?   No, but if someone needs money for a golf course 
in Atlantic Canada there is money, apparently, and if someone 
needs money for a luxury resort, there is money.  However there 
is not enough financial support to deal with child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on in regard to a number of issues but we are not 
actually supposed to be talking about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend also mentioned balancing the books.  He forgot to 
mention that one of the ways in which the government balanced the 
books was to take money out of the EI that employers and 
employees contributed in anticipation that they were going to get 
some return on their insurance investment.  The government dipped 
into their fund to take out the money and dipped into the pension 
fund of the federal public service as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we remind ourselves, in a more balanced 
way, of why the books of the country have been balanced.  It is 
because money put into the employment insurance fund has now been 
siphoned off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two quick points.  Today we are talking about telephone 
services.  I think we would all agree that communication is 
crucial in a knowledge based economy, crucial today in an ever 
shrinking globalized world and absolutely fundamental in terms of 
economic development in the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we talk about this legislation, there are parts of Canada 
that do not have any telephone service.  I know some members will 
be surprised to hear this, but there are parts of Canada that 
have no telephone service at all.  As a matter of fact there are 
some parts of my own riding that do not, to be specific, the East 
Barrière Lake area and the Red Lake area.  There are others.  A 
lot of people who live there have been trying to get the 
telephone companies to provide service but to date they have not 
been able to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make that point clear as we are getting ourselves 
excited about how connected we are.  There are still a lot of 
people who do not have even fundamental telephone services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we talk about balancing off this sort of equal playing field, 
which is what this legislation is all about, and talk about 
providing a level playing field for all players, let us also 
remind ourselves that as we speak we have the softwood lumber 
agreement that the Government of Canada agreed to which prohibits 
Canadian lumber exporters from exporting lumber into the United 
States.  This is up for renewal on March 1.  I do hope the 
government, if it actually espouses the fundamental belief in 
free trade, abandons this forum of managed trade which, quite 
frankly, militates against western lumber producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to my Liberal friends across the way.  When companies 
are making the case that we should have free trade in lumber, 
when the members of the IWA say they want to have free trade in 
lumber, I appeal to the government to actually agree to have free 
trade, particularly as this is free trade with the United States. 
I thought we actually had a free trade agreement with the United 
States but when it comes to softwood lumber we do not have a free 
trade agreement.  I find it rather perverse and almost amazing 
that we would allow this to occur but we have.  Hopefully we can 
undo this damage in the next number of weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to Bill S-26, others before me have indicated that 
this is actually a pretty straightforward piece of legislation. 
It is a bit unusual when one thinks about it.  The British 
Columbia telephone company special act was enacted back in 1916 
by this parliament.  The purpose of this special act was to 
federally incorporate the British Columbia Telephone Company and 
place it under federal jurisdiction.  At the time this special 
act was created, the Canadian telecommunications industry 
consisted of monopoly service providers, including fledgling 
provincial crown owned corporations just beginning to be 
established in the prairie provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today this special act is inconsistent with the open and 
competitive Canadian telecommunications industry where all other 
Canadian owned telecom companies are free to compete in every 
Canadian jurisdiction.  This places Telus at a competitive 
disadvantage for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than go into those reasons, I think it is obvious that 
when one company has to seek permission from the CRTC every time 
it wants to make a major corporate decision whereas other 
companies it is competing with do not and can simply do it within 
their own corporate structure, we are asking Telus to compete in 
the marketplace with its hands tied behind its back, so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, we in the New Democratic Party support the updating 
of the legislation.  We also support, as we indicated earlier, 
the rapid movement of the legislation through all stages so we 
can complete it today.  It has already gone through the stages at 
the Senate, which has done due diligence on this legislation.  It 
is appropriate that we move expeditiously as well to enable the 
legislation to be proclaimed prior to the dissolution of this 
parliament.

to state briefly the position of the Bloc Quebecois on Bill 
S-26, whose aim is to treat Telus the same as the other 
companies.  This company is governed by the Act to incorporate 
the Western Canada Telephone Company, which dates from 1916. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of this very short bill is to not subject it to a 
specific law, but to treat it like the other companies and have 
it governed by the Canada Business Corporations Act, which will 
enable it to continue its activities throughout Canada on the 
same footing as the other companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a matter of not governing this company any longer, but 
of affording it equal treatment.  Accordingly, we will not 
debate this at length, since everyone is in agreement to pass 
this bill as quickly as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know and cherish the health system in Canada.  For 
many years we have had a made in Canada solution which ensures 
that all Canadians have access to quality health care. 
Generations of Canadians have grown up expecting that their loved 
ones, their families and they themselves would have adequate 
health care available to meet their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the Liberal government Canadians no longer can be 
assured of that.  The stark, cold reality is that over the last 
few years the health care system of yesterday has been steadily 
destroyed by the Liberals of today and will not meet the health 
care requirements of tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to describe the problems that have resulted from 
the Liberal government's uncaring approach to health care.  For 
the record, I and the other members of the Canadian Alliance will 
be supporting the bill.  However, let me be perfectly clear on 
our measure of support for it.  We are supporting it because 
finally the Liberals are rectifying past Liberal mistakes that 
have needlessly hurt many Canadians in the process, need never 
have been implemented, and would not have taken place under a 
Canadian Alliance government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, when the Liberals came to power, the federal portion of 
the Canada health and social transfer was $18.8 billion.  Within 
four short years the heartless Liberals slashed away more than 
$6.3 billion annually.  Today the federal Liberals are still $3.3 
billion lower than in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to this bill the Liberals had stripped away $24.7 billion 
from the health care system in Canada.  Their earlier budget 
plans called for the removal of another $9.9 billion over the 
next three budget years.  Were it not for the pressure of the 
official opposition, the provinces and indeed Canadians 
themselves, the Liberal government would have gouged an 
incredible $34.6 billion out of Canada's health care system over 
a projected 11 years.  That was what it was intent on doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That $34.6 billion represents more than $1,100 less in health 
care for every man, woman and child in Canada today.  Can we 
imagine what another $1,100 of health care spent on every person 
in each riding would do to alleviate the pain, suffering and 
discomfort many feel? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan there are approximately 
100,000 people.  That translates, if my math is correct, into 110 
million missing health care dollars.  That $110 million could 
have been used to hire more nurses and maintain and reopen 
operating rooms.  It could have been used to ensure that more 
people were not subject to longer than necessary waiting lists 
and to give the opportunity to upgrade or purchase new medical 
technology equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not a region in the country has not been negatively affected by 
the callous financial approach the Liberal government has 
inflicted upon Canadians from coast to coast.  A case in point is 
the Cowichan District Hospital in Duncan, in my riding, where a 
dialysis unit sat idle.  What was the primary reason it sat idle? 
Simply put, there was not enough money in the system to hire 
trained personnel to operate the equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my hon. colleagues to imagine the concern and the pain in 
the hearts of parents whose children require a dialysis machine 
to stay alive and who know that because of funding the equipment 
in the hospital has never been used.  This is not an academic 
subject for me.  I know that feeling.  I have a daughter who 
could have been one of those who required dialysis.  She has only 
one kidney.  Even though the dialysis unit was only 15 minutes 
from our home, the stark reality was that if her one remaining 
kidney had shut down we were over an hour away from the nearest 
dialysis unit.  For her to use the pediatric dialysis unit we 
would have had to take her to Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A dialysis unit costs approximately $630,000 to purchase.  The 
annual operating cost for 36 patients totals approximately $1 
million.  Let us imagine if a portion of the $110 million the 
Liberals have ripped out of the system in my riding alone could 
have been used for dialysis in the Cowichan hospital.  Then let 
us imagine the sense of relief a parent or patient would feel when the 
unit was finally opened and put into operation. 
Unfortunately this unit is already approaching capacity.  It is 
expected that in less than one year new dialysis patients will 
once again be required to make the one hour trip to Victoria for 
the dialysis treatment they require.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 in my riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan, Mr. Pat Carson 
donated $861,000 toward the purchase of a CT scanner.  That is 
what the health system in the country has come to.  There is a 
critical need for new technology and modern equipment.  The 
government does not have the money to pay for it.  Individuals 
who know of this crying need are coming forward to pay for this 
equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Carson's wife had cancer.  Unfortunately she died of it. 
While there are no guarantees, it was thought that earlier 
treatment for her could have been initiated through a faster 
diagnosis by a CT scan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members are wondering how well the scanner is now working. 
Has it saved lives?  I am sad to say that the scanner is still 
not in operation.  The money has now accumulated to over $1.3 
million.  Only now, after the promise of more federal money and 
nine years after this very generous public donation was made, is 
the CT scanner coming online.  How many lives would have been 
changed or even saved if the CT scanner had been in place years 
ago?  Simply put, a lack of funds claims lives in our health care 
system every day.  The Liberal government must accept much of the 
blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these were the only stories, the story of health care in 
Canada today would not be such a tale of woe.  Unfortunately 
this is only one of thousands of stories from across the country. 
Through the remainder of the day we will hear from others about 
surgery waiting lists, cancelled surgeries, long waiting periods 
to see specialists, pain, suffering, and even death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of British Columbia we have had patients 
lying on gurneys in the hallways and in linen closets, if we can 
believe that.  Cancelled surgeries at the hospitals in my riding 
of Nanaimo—Cowichan are a daily occurrence.  We can and we must 
do better than this.  We have done so in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The track record of the Liberal government speaks loud and 
clear.  In the last few months the health committee has had 
meetings and at each opportunity I raised the issue of the 
committee studying the overall system of health care in Canada. 
What happened when I raised that issue at committee?  The Liberal 
majority simply said no.  During the discussion at the agenda 
planning subcommittee one Liberal member actually had the 
audacity to state that health care was too big a topic for the 
committee to study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine that:  Canadian health care is too big for the 
House of Commons Standing Committee on Health to study.  If the 
Standing Committee on Health cannot study the health situation in 
Canada, may I ask who should? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent report from the Canadian Institute for Health 
Information stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of health professionals from 1988-1997 did not keep 
pace with Canada's population growth, resulting in fewer health 
professionals per capita in 1997. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over that 10 year time period “the number of professionals per 
10,000 population declined by 1.7%, from 185 to 182”.  Based on 
these numbers, we are short 9,000 health professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would further ask hon. members to consider our aging 
population.  We are all getting older.  We cannot reverse that 
trend, unfortunately.  According to Statistics Canada 
demographics in 2001 about 13% of our population will be 65 years 
of age or over.  By the year 2026, just a few years down the 
road, this same age group will rise to 21% of our overall 
population.  In real numbers this is a rise from 3,945,700 to 
7,759,700, almost a complete doubling of this age group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members that with few exceptions this includes 
each and every one of us here.  It includes our peers, our 
personal friends, our neighbours and many family members. Without 
an end to the serious damage inflicted on our health care system 
by the Liberal government I am afraid the health care system may 
not be available to those of us who may require it the most in 
the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I know some hon. members will scoff at this premise, 
let us consider a few facts within the various fields of 
professional health care.  Currently the Canadian Medical 
Association has noted with concern that the number of doctors 
leaving Canada is roughly equivalent to the graduating classes of 
six medicals schools per year.  That amounts to almost 40% of our 
medical school graduates.  To my mind that is simply 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It now takes half the output of all Canadian medical schools to 
replace the physicians who leave the country annually.  One 
reason is the cost of medical education.  The president of the 
CMA asserts that the debt of a graduating medical student could 
rise as high as $140,000.  Other reasons as given by the former 
director of research at the Association of Canadian Medical 
Colleges of Canada include health care cuts and plunging morale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some other facts.  In 1996, 731 doctors left the 
country.  In 1997, 659 left.  That totals 1,390 doctors in just 
over two years.  Doctors moving south of the border represent 
just a quarter of all medical personnel leaving the country every 
year.  Most of those leaving are nurses.  We are told, and I 
believe it to be true, that we face a chronic shortage of nurses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 1997 study of 489 orthopedic surgeons graduating between 1985 
and 1994 showed that fully 25% have moved to the United States 
and 70% of the rest were considering it.  The most common reasons 
were restrictions on operating time, unavailability of beds and 
other frustrations with practice restrictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMA has also stated that there is a severe shortage of high 
tech physicians capable of reading the results the latest medical 
technology gives us.  There currently is a shortfall of 150 full 
time radiologists in Canada, with an expected shortfall of 500 
over the next four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that it takes a great deal of time to train 
the doctors and nurses we need in Canada.  Regular training for a 
general practitioner takes at least seven years.  Specialist 
training takes 13 or 14 years.  We are short of trained staff 
now, not in seven or thirteen years.  A crisis looms on the 
horizon, and still the government remains intent on destroying 
rather than renewing our stressed health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims it is treating the health care system with 
compassion.  We hear that word from our hon. colleagues across 
the way quite often.  They say they are a compassionate lot, with 
compassion oozing out of their pores.  Last month in Montreal the 
Prime Minister stated that he had “invested in health care”. 
The Minister of Health laid claim to this being a “compassionate 
government, leading the way for those among us that require 
health care”.  The 1997 Liberal red book stated that they 
“would not abandon the health care field and that predictable 
and financial certainty was essential for our health care 
planning”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Absolutely nothing could be further from the truth if we take a 
look at what the government has done.  I have been calling for a 
serious review of the Canadian health care system for over three 
years now.  The government has done nothing like that.  It has 
cut the transfer payments.  It has chastised the provinces for 
attempting to find real solutions to real health care problems. 
It has made federal-provincial relationships completely 
untenable, and still it attempts to make the claim that it is 
upholding health care in Canada.  On the eve of an election in 
the country finally it does something about it.  Surely Canadian 
people can see through that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the federal Liberal government will be forever 
remembered in history as the destroyer of our present health 
care system.  The facts are indisputable.  It has permitted the 
rise of two tier health care on its watch, across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, the Minister of Health and all their minions 
can bluster and rant all they want, but the truth is crystal 
clear:  the Liberal government has failed all Canadians when it 
comes to health care.  It has permitted, even encouraged, the 
failure of the health care system that Canadians have come to 
enjoy and count on.  Canadians all across the land know it.  They 
will not forget the Liberal government's actions when the next 
election comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are not as gullible as the Prime Minister would like 
us to believe.  I believe Canadians know where the blame rests 
for the unacceptable status of our health care system.  It rests 
firmly at the feet of both the Prime Minister and Minister of 
Health.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are looking for someone to champion health care. 
Canadians are looking for a political entity that will put things 
right in this country, beginning with health care itself. 
Canadians are realizing that the Liberal health care talk has no 
substance, has no meaning and has no depth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has attempted to make the claim that they 
are the only party willing to support the five tenets of the 
Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the red book stated that the Liberal “commitment is to 
the five fundamental principles of our medicare system and on our 
commitment to the continuing role in financing and other aspects 
of the federal government in health care”.  That is a very noble 
statement, but have they lived up to it?  When it comes right 
down to it, have they attacked this problem at the provincial 
level where the delivery of services actually takes place?  How 
far from the reality of today, when the government is truly the 
architect of the demise of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All across this country there are examples of abuses of the 
Canada Health Act.  If someone hurts a knee on the job and 
the Workmen's Compensation Board is paying for it, there is no 
problem.  That person gets to go to a private clinic and jump ahead of 
everyone else waiting for knee surgery.  It may be legal but it 
is not right, and the government should fix that kind of queue 
jumping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone need an MRI?  There is a three week lineup.  If 
someone pays $800 cash at a private clinic they will avoid the 
lineup.  If they do not like the wait time involved they can take 
their credit card and head south of the border.  There are a lot 
of Canadian doctors and nurses there already.  Maybe it will seem 
like a Canadian reunion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the Liberal government attempted to resolve these issues?  I 
do not think so.  Certainly not while I have been around this 
place.  Rather than working with the provinces and attempting to 
ensure that all Canadians have quality health care, the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Health prefer to antagonize and 
cause dissension rather than build unity.  Canadians see past 
the Liberal smoke and mirror show and they are really tired of 
it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are turning to the Canadian Alliance to right the 
wrongs that this Liberal government has forced upon all 
Canadians.  Corrective actions cannot be implemented immediately 
but they can begin immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I recognize, of course, that money alone is 
not the whole solution to this problem.  However, we cannot deny 
that many of the problems were caused by the government's 
significant reduction in funding, funding that this Liberal 
government has simply slashed out of health care among other 
things.  Many of the solutions will require funding, yet further 
efficiencies can be found in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we need more trained professionals.  Yes, we face 
challenges that we have not previously encountered.  Certainly we 
have an aging population.  Yes, the delivery of health care 
services remains a provincial responsibility.  We know all these 
things to be true. However, what positive role has the federal 
government played in this?  To date, none.  It has been 
irresponsible in its lack of solutions to the health care crisis 
that now faces Canada.  Many of the problems are systemic and 
there has been no plan from the government to attack the systemic 
problems in our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians look to government for leadership.  They have not 
found it here in this place with this Liberal government as far 
as health care is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do need changes in the health care system.  We need a system 
that shows we are truly getting results.  We need a system where 
governments work together.  We need a system that provides 
funding on a regular basis consistently over the years working 
co-operatively with the provinces.  That is what a Canadian 
Alliance government offers to Canadians when it comes into 
office.  What we will do for the health care system is what the 
Liberals have failed to do.  They have acted irresponsibly. 
Putting this kind of money back in at this point will simply be a 
band-aid solution to a growing problem.

very pleased to stand as the member for Halifax West and speak on 
behalf of my constituents to Bill C-45.  I should indicate at the 
outset that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-45 is an act respecting the provision of increased 
funding for health care services, medical equipment, health 
information and communications technologies, early childhood 
development and other social services, and to amend the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill came about as a result of the September 11 health deal 
that was reached between the federal government and the 
provinces.  The bill is in two parts.  The first part provides 
authority to make expenditures into a special $1 billion medical 
equipment trust, as well as a $500 million fund for information 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the bill authorizes an increase in transfer 
payments through the Canadian health and social transfer for 
social programs which are defined in the Federal-Provincial 
Fiscal Arrangements Act as programs in respect of health, 
post-secondary education, social assistance and social services, 
and early childhood education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the September 11 health deal is a step forward, and we 
admit that it is a small step forward, it really does not go far 
enough.  When I say that it does not go far enough, I am not just 
giving my opinion on this.  I have knocked on well over 1,000 
doors within the past few months talking to the constituents of 
Halifax West.  Many of the people to whom I have spoken have 
indicated to me that health care is still the number one issue 
for them.  They feel that the present agreement of restoring the 
kind of funding that has been put back in does not go far enough 
to deal with the kinds of concerns and problems they have. They 
do not see any immediate relief to the many problems that they 
are facing:  waiting for needed surgery, long line-ups, trying to 
obtain needed medications and so forth.  They do not see any 
immediate relief to those problems in the deal that was worked 
out between the federal government and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example of this I will tell the story about what happened 
at one of the doors that I knocked on.  It was on a beautiful day 
just last week.  The sun was shining and there was beautiful 
colour in the leaves in the maritime provinces.  It was a nice 
day to go around getting to know the people within the riding of 
Halifax West.  Up until the point when I knocked on that door, I 
was feeling pretty good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After I had knocked on the door, a young man answered.  I asked 
him if he had any special issues he wanted to discuss that 
related to the federal government or its programs.  He said 
“Yes.  Step inside for a minute”.  I entered and right off the 
bat he started to tell me about his concerns with the health care 
system.  He introduced me to his wife who was lying there.  This 
young man was probably no more 30 years of age and his wife was 
probably around the same age.  When he introduced his wife I saw 
this lady lying on a couch and the look of her belied her age. 
She looked much older than I knew she was.  This was because 
the woman was dying of cancer at such a young age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To hear this young man tell his story about his involvement with 
the health care system, about the trials and tribulations that he 
has gone through and about his concerns for his wife, just about 
brought tears to my eyes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing about this young man's story was that he 
was telling me his story not so much because he thought it would 
help his wife, as he knew her days were limited, but 
in the hope that it might help other people who find 
themselves in a situation where they need health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of things that we are seeing right across 
the country, the kinds of problems that we see coming because of 
the short-sightedness of the government in dealing with our 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell another story, about an elderly woman.  She is the 
widow of a veteran who served our country proudly.  On one 
occasion my wife and I visited this lady.  We had a wonderful 
time having a cup of tea and chatting with her.  Not too long ago 
I decided to call her up to see how she was doing. She told me 
“I am not doing too badly. I just came back from the hospital. I 
had been in the hospital for a while but now I need to have 
permanent nursing care on a daily basis. I need someone in my 
home with me on a daily basis”.   Up to that point this lady had 
lived by herself in her home, a beautiful home in the Bedford 
area along the shore.  She said “I do not know what I am going 
to do because I cannot afford this kind of care.  I wonder if 
there is any way I can get any help”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since she was the spouse of a veteran I thought I could refer 
her to the veterans independence program under which she may 
qualify for some assistance.  I gave her the name and the phone 
number and asked her to call. 
I asked her to let me know how she made out.  Some time later I 
had not heard from her so I gave her a call just to see how 
things had worked out.  She said “Well, the news is not so good. 
Unfortunately, my income is just beyond the threshold at which 
they cut people off for such assistance.”  That is not a very 
high threshold.   She then told me that she did not know what she 
was going to do.  She said that she needed to pay for the service 
but that she would probably end up losing her home because she 
could not really afford the service.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at Bill C-45 we see that it does not really deal 
with the kinds of concerns that Canadians have in the health care 
system.  It does very little to address an overall plan for 
health care, and specifically, there are no initiatives pertaining to 
national home care, which is what this lady would benefit from, 
and pharmacare, which so many of our seniors are in need of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about home care, I must say that even though the 
current government has gutted the health system and has not 
really put back the amount of money that is required, the amount 
of money that is being put back is less that it was in 1994, and 
this is the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that kind of gutting of the system, I must take my hat off 
to the people who are working in the system day in and day out 
with commitment and dedication and working against adverse 
circumstances to try to provide health care for their fellow 
human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think about home care workers, I am honoured to indicate 
that Nova Scotia has dedicated this week as Home Support Workers' 
Week.  Many people are recognizing and expressing their 
appreciation to the home care workers who help thousands of Nova 
Scotians get the quality of care service that they need in the 
comfort of their home and close to their family and friends. Home 
support workers are an essential part of the fabric of the health 
care in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look to reshape health care in Canada and hopefully 
begin to undo the damage wrought by years of health care cuts 
administered by Liberal and Conservative governments, we need to 
ensure that home care is properly funded, that the workers are 
properly supported and paid properly, and that they work in 
decent conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial support for those needing home care—and I think 
of the lady I mentioned—must be made available.  Home care 
workers offer experienced care, support, compassion and dignity 
to people within our communities.  They are an integral part of 
the health care system, taking a lot of the responsibility and 
the weight off much needed hospital beds in today's system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the areas that Bill C-45 does not address. 
Those are some of the things that we must give attention to if we 
are going to make this health care system one of which we can 
continue to be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill is necessary, I guess, in the final analysis, and 
while the NDP does support the bill as a step in the right 
direction, it is really a small step forward in light of the 
giant steps backward taken by the Liberal government.  Let me 
also make it perfectly clear that we feel the Liberal government 
has missed a golden opportunity to present a vision for the 
future of medicare and to advance a plan that would preserve and 
strengthen universal public health care. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague's very eloquent 
presentation and I must say that it is probably one of the most 
thoughtful presentations I have heard in the House for some time. 
I commend him on his thoughtfulness and the thoroughness of his 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a speech later in the day so I have some notes here. 
There must be a mistake in my notes because I remember that a few 
years ago there used to be a 50:50 balance.  The federal 
government would put in 50% of the funding for health care and 
the province would put in 50% of the money.  My notes say that 
the federal government now has reneged so much that it only 
allocates 13% of the total, which means the provinces have to 
pick up 80 some per cent and the federal government only picks up 
13%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my friend at least tell me my notes are wrong?  If in fact 
the feds are only giving 13% of health care funding, that would 
be absolutely scandalous.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, despite the protestations 
I hear from the other side that my hon. colleague's notes are 
wrong, my research indicates accordance with his notes that the 
federal government is currently down to a low of around 13% in 
terms of the health care.  It wants to talk about tax points and 
other things to try to accommodate that but we know full well 
that it falls far short of what is required to provide the kind 
of health care, home care and preventive measures which are 
so necessary today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to try to put a band-aid on a cut when it is 
bleeding and festering.  It is another thing to try to get at the 
root cause and to prevent the illness in the first place.  This 
is what adequate funding will do.  We are calling upon the 
government to provide the kind of funding it used to, which was 
at least 50% of the cost of health care, and make a meaningful 
contribution to the well-being of our citizens. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I direct my comments to my Liberal friends 
sitting across the way.  I assume they have been out door 
knocking like my friend from Halifax who indicated that he had 
been knocking on doors for the past number of weeks.  I know I 
have and there is one thing that I found out at almost every 
door. Those who wanted to talk inevitably talked about health 
care and the abysmal state of our system.  There were some people 
who did not want to talk or they were not at home or they could 
not talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say it is almost in a crisis situation.  As a matter of 
fact, I suspect there is not a single member of parliament today 
who does not know someone personally in his or her family who has 
not been confronted with an inadequate health care system in 
terms of treatment.  I know I certainly have.  My parents are 
elderly and are sort of struggling all the time.  They do not 
complain but they have had to wait weeks for tests and weeks to 
get into the hospital for a minor operation and so on.  That is 
what one hears everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely scandalous that the government has somehow 
gotten away with not taking responsibility for the problem.  It 
has blamed it on provincial governments, not to say that they do 
not deserve some criticism.  However, the reality is that it was 
this government that made those massive cuts to our health care 
system, which caused this problem from coast to coast to coast. 
That is fact number one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number two, as my friend from Halifax just verified, is 
that the federal government was supposed to throw in 50% of the 
funding for health care but is now contributing only 13%.  That 
in itself is scandalous.  Let us face it, when it throws in only 
13% we can forget about national standards from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forget about the same quality and standard of health care in 
British Columbia as one would find in Prince Edward Island or in 
Nova Scotia.  That is not the case.  We now have virtually 13 
different health care systems.  There are no serious national 
standards because the government puts such a minor amount of the 
money into health care that it cannot enforce national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends across the way must be shaking in their boots as 
people are finding out what is happening in Alberta.  There are 
50 private health care clinics in the province of Alberta.  Bill 
11 opens the door now for an American style, two tier, for profit 
health care system.  If we ask any real health care providers or 
any serious students of health care what they think, they will say 
that we are opening the door to a two tier for profit American 
style health care system, which is not what Canadians want.  I do 
not think I have ever encountered a single Canadian who says he 
or she wants to be like the Americans when it comes to our health 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps, as my hon. friend reminds me, there are some parties in 
the House that feel comfortable with an American style health 
care system, but Canadians do not.  People ought not to make 
profits on sickness, injury and suffering.  That is what 
a private health care system does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend who spoke just said that Bill C-45 was a small, baby 
step in the right direction.  However, I would not say it is a 
baby step.  This is more like a nudge forward.  We have so much 
more to do.  The government for the last two elections has 
promised Canadians a home care system.  Do we have a one today? 
No, we have not. 
For the last two elections the Liberals promised a pharmacare 
program for Canada.  Do we have a one?  No, we do not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government goes to the electorate and says that if it elects 
the Liberals it will give the people a child care system but they 
do not do it.  The next time they say that if the people elect 
them they will give them a home care system, but they do not do 
it.  Or they say that if they elect them they will give them a 
pharmacare system, but they do not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will eventually figure out that this is a group of 
folks they might want to be cautious of when they say that 
they will do this or that for them while really meaning they will 
do it to them.  We will not have a child care system, a home care 
system, a pharmacare system or an elder care system.  I hate 
to say it but unfortunately that is the reality.  I wish I could 
say something different.  I wish I could say that the government 
has provided health care and home care and so on, but I cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have members ever seen people trying to clap themselves on their 
backs using both hands and both feet?  That would be quite a 
sight.  That is what we have seen.  We have seen people clapping 
themselves on the back and saying “Look how wonderful we are. We 
have restored funding”.  That is not the case.  The government 
has not restored proper funding for health care.  It has restored 
funding to 1994 levels.  The Liberals should wake up. 
This is not 1994.  This is the year 2000.  They have increased 
the funding to 1994 levels, which is a nice step, but what 
about 1995 levels?  Populations were increasing and inflation was 
increasing.  What about 1996?  What about 1997? What about 1998? 
What about 1999?  What about the year 2000? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we supposed to get excited that the government has dipped 
into the EI fund and into the federal pension fund to come up 
with moneys so it can increase federal health care spending to 
1994 levels?  Are we supposed to be cheering?  Yet that is what 
we are expected to do, cheer.  We are not cheering, nor will we 
cheer.  We will say not only is it not enough money, but we have 
to look at the components of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members would agree that we have to have a decent home 
care system in our country.  We are an aging population.  How 
many householders do we know of who do not have to be concerned 
about caring for an aging member of their family?  Home care is a 
reality.  To have a health care system in the 21st century 
without a home care component is just not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the price of drugs.  We know that the price of 
pharmaceuticals has been skyrocketing, particularly after the 
Mulroney government brought in protection for the drug companies, 
unfortunately supported by this government.  We cannot help that. 
That is what we have.  We need a pharmacare program because we 
know that seniors by the tens of thousands cannot afford the 
necessary prescription drugs which they require because we do not 
have a pharmacare program.  We cannot have a modern 21st century 
health care program without having a pharmacare component in 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about elder care and child care.  I know this is not 
necessarily part of this discussion.  However, when we look at 
modern countries around the world, do they not have a national 
child care program?  Of course they have.  Do they not have a 
national home care program?  Of course they have.  If these 
countries can afford it, why on earth can we not afford it?  We 
have these huge surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we have money to spend to build luxury holiday resorts. 
We have money to spend on building huge fantastic golf courses. 
As a matter of fact, I golfed on one this summer.  I did not 
realize it was subsidized by the federal government and by the 
taxpayers of Canada.  We have money for golf courses and luxury 
resorts but we do not have money for home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a lot about the values of our society.  The Prime 
Minister said that this would be an election about values.  I 
hope it is.  I think Canadians from coast to coast to coast will 
also hope that it is.  What does it tell us about the values of a 
government that says it has money for luxury resorts, for golf 
courses and for fancy statues and fountains in the Prime 
Minister's riding but cannot afford health care in terms of 
home care, pharmacare, elder care and child care?  It cannot 
afford these.  It cannot even afford social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that the Prime Minister lives in social housing. 
The Governor General of Canada lives in social housing.  The 
Leader of the Opposition lives in social housing.

and for the Prime Minister of Canada, we should have some social 
housing for people who actually cannot afford decent housing.  It 
seems reasonable to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to start thinking about what kind of a country we want. 
Mr. Trudeau called this a just society and our goals should be a 
just society.  The New Democratic Party supports this.  We like 
the idea of a just society so that if we are sick or injured, it 
does not matter where we happen to be in Canada, we will have 
access to the top quality care.  That is not the case today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to my Liberal colleagues to be generous.  We have a 
huge surplus of perhaps $20 billion before us.  Invest some of 
that money in home care, in pharmacare, in elder care and in 
preventive care so that we can build the health care system of 
the 21st century that Canadians want, one that we can afford 
if we have the will to do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in today's debate on Bill 
C-45. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure how to begin.  We are obviously not going to deny 
the health care system more money because it needs it.  There is 
no question that this is a cynical move on the part of the 
government on the eve of an election.  That is really what drove 
the government to the bargaining table with the provinces, so it 
came up with a deathbed reprieve and put money into health care, 
money which it took out of the system over the last seven years 
after it came into office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard on many occasions this morning about the dollars that 
the government has taken out.  If we look at this, it has taken 
$24 billion out of the system.  It projected taking out another 
$9 billion but was forced to back down on that.  If the Liberals 
had their way, they would have taken at least $35 billion out of 
the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money they are putting back into the system will bring us 
back to 1994 levels once the full value of the package kicks in. 
However, we are going to be waiting a number of years before we 
get there.  Actually, by the year 2004, we will be back to the levels 
of spending of 10 years ago.  It does not make sense but that has 
been the government's cynical approach to governing over the last 
number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, on the eve of an election, the Liberals are suddenly wanting 
to rush this bill through the House.  They are attempting to 
marginalize this place because the agreement was struck between 
the Prime Minister and the provinces.  The House of Commons and 
parliament were not consulted on the best way to approach this. 
Now we are stuck again with a deathbed reprieve.  That is what 
they are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be somewhat cynical but it will be 18 months before the 
payments actually kick in.  It is not going to immediately repair 
the damage that they have inflicted on the system in the last 
seven years.  The first amount of money comes in 18 months.  It 
will not affect the lineups at the emergency wards during flu 
season.  In fact, that might be one of the reasons the government 
members want to go to the polls early.  They do not want to go 
through another winter of lineups at the emergency ward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not going to stop the trips or the busing of Canadian 
citizens to the United States to receive cancer treatments.  In 
my home province of New Brunswick we are taking cancer patients 
down to Bangor, Maine, for treatment because our system has been 
denied funding for the last seven years.  We cannot afford to 
treat our own patients, so at a higher price per patient we are 
now shipping them to the United States.  Does that make sense? 
Of course it does not, because basically they do not have a plan. 
They do not have a vision.  They are devoid of ideas.  “No ideas, 
no votes” should be the slogan in the next election.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of New Brunswick put it best.  Our share as a small 
province is about the same as that of Nova Scotia, I might add. 
It would be in the order of $16 million once the money kicks in. 
That would keep the system in New Brunswick running for all of 12 
days once it gets its full share of the money.  There are 365 
days in a year so there is a big shortfall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister in New Brunswick expressed it another way. 
The moneys that would come to the province of New Brunswick, if 
it wanted to use them on a day to day basis would keep the system 
running 12 days.  That is another way of putting it.  The health 
minister, Mr. Furlong, said that money would pay off existing 
health corporation debt, debt that has been racked up over the 
years simply because of the money shortage and because of the 
lack of commitment by the federal government to fund health care. 
That responsibility rests at the doorstep of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election, with the same kind of deathbed 
reprieve, he asked for forgiveness for taking a wrecking ball to health 
care.  On the eve of the election he pumped a few billion dollars 
back into it to resurrect his political fortunes.  Fortunately 
for the Prime Minister it worked.  Unfortunately for the Canadian 
people it worked, because now we are victims of the same cynical 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to go back to the election of 1993 and the election 
of 1997.  Let us remember red book one and red book two.  I 
suppose we could call them fairy tale one and fairy tale two.  I 
could quote from either one of the documents to make my point. In 
both those documents the present government made a commitment to 
health care.  In two successive elections it reneged on that 
promise, not to mention its promise on the GST.  We will forget 
about that one because that is another argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revenues from the GST are making the government look pretty 
good today in terms of balancing the books and eliminating the 
deficit.  Automatically we could extract $30 billion from the 
equation today as we stand in this place because of the revenues 
coming in from that hated tax, the tax the government was to axe 
when it got into office.  It is seven years and waiting and we 
still have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take a look at the OECD report in terms of world economy 
and how Canada is faring, it credits the GST and the free trade 
agreement as the engines of the Canadian economy, the structural 
changes that we made along with deregulation and privatization to 
get the Canadian economy rolling.  What do the Liberals do?  They 
pick on the most vulnerable in society: the sick, the poor and 
the elderly.  I could add the unemployed.  They use the same 
technique of heavy handedness on the most vulnerable of all 
workers, our seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only a fight that we waged in this little corner 
of the House of Commons that forced them to back down.  They took 
a position they could not sustain, especially on the eve of an 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this were six months after an election they would roll in for 
another three years or so.  The plan of the Liberals is that they 
do not go to the people every four or five years.  They go in 
three and a half years.  They do not wait for the constitutional 
period a government is allowed.  They go because of political 
expediency.  They go because they are high in the polls.  They 
are not going because their agenda has been filled or their red 
book promises have been fulfilled.  They forget about red book 
one and red book two. 
They go on the trash heap of all trash heaps in terms of 
political promises.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is like a crazy glue, Scotch tape approach to government. 
We can see them pasting together a platform that might work with 
the aid of crazy glue and Scotch tape.  I hate to use the words 
Scotch tape in reference to the Liberals.  I guess it is 
derogatory used in that sense.  Their approach to government is 
basically ad hoc.  They make it up as they go along, with no plan 
for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no plan in the health bill.  The plan is to get 
re-elected to impose the same kinds of draconian cuts.  There are 
no guarantees in the bill that they will not do it six months 
after an election.  How did they get away with it?  They forced 
the provinces into a room and said either take the money or there 
is no money.  This was the deal or no deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister basically asked how they would go back home 
and deny their people that money.  That is old fashioned 
blackmail.  That is what the government is used to.  It got away 
with it for seven years.  This will be the third election in 
seven years, with no other reason than political expediency for 
calling an election.  The government's commitments to the 
Canadian people have yet to be filled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They went back to trash heap and resurrected red book two from 
1997.  Where are the commitments to health care in terms of 
delivery of a home care program and a pharmaceutical program? 
They are lost somewhere out there in great Liberal propaganda 
land, nowhere to be seen.  The government is hoping that 
Canadians will forget about it, but we will not forget about it. 
We will remind them exactly what the government has done or in 
this case not done on the health care file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing there to be proud of.  The premiers wrapped 
their arms around this in Ottawa at 24 Sussex.  It is pretty hard 
to deny the Prime Minister on his turf.  He would probably kick 
them out on the street if they did.  The premiers went home and 
sobered up.  I am saying that in a sincere sense.  After having a 
chance to go through the document, every one of them said the 
document came up short of the mark.  The Canadian Medical 
Association said it was $17 billion short of the mark.  The 
government will continue on the same track if it is given the 
mandate.  That should be a sobering thought for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old expression that there is nothing like a lynching 
in the morning to sober the mind.  I am saying that is what the 
government will get because it is looking at a huge ocean of 
support, a mile wide, but unfortunately for it only about an inch 
deep.  It will evaporate on the first day of the campaign.  It 
will be a downhill trail for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago David Peterson in Ontario suddenly called an 
election for no reason other than the fact that he was popular in 
the polls.  The same thing will happen this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the preamble should read to Bill C-45, because we 
are talking about fairy tales one and two.  In other words, red 
book one is fairy tales edition one and red book two is fairy 
tales edition two.  We are anxiously awaiting fairy tales three 
or a rerun of one or two.  The preamble to red book three, if 
there is one, should go something like this:  Once upon a time, 
long ago in a land far away, the benevolent king bestowed upon 
his et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fairy tale in the making.  It is not real.  I guess the 
Liberal philosophy is, if it worked once we will do it again, if 
it worked twice we will do it again, but three times and the jig 
is up. 
The Liberals have no credibility on that file.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about balancing the books.  I see, the Secretary of 
State for International Financial Institutions here.  He loves 
to get up, button his suit and boast about their financial 
record, conveniently forgetting that he stood on this side of the 
House and raged against the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a moment of weakness not too many months ago that same 
minister admitted we could not eliminate the GST and that some of 
their financial success was due to revenues generated by that 
instrument.  I see the minister clapping.  I appreciate that. It 
has taken him seven years to publicly acknowledge that in the 
House of Commons.  I welcome questions from the minister as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nurses have taken an awful pounding from the government, as have 
doctors.  The government forgets about the commitment of 
Canadians to preserving health care: the nurses and doctors, the 
people cleaning hospitals, the instrument technicians and the 
people who work in cafeterias.  Every one of them, from the top to 
the bottom, has been a victim of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will happen again.  In addition to the five principles of the 
health care act, universality, portability, accessibility, et 
cetera, we are suggesting that we need the sixth principle of 
secure, defendable, dependable funding so that governments have a 
chance to plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government cannot give everything to everybody all the time, 
but most Canadians deserve a road map, a plan of where the 
government is going, which would allow hospital corporations and 
provinces to budget and lay out plans that would be workable in a 
five to ten year period.  We know what spending costs are doing 
in the health care field.  Statistically we can forecast what the 
cost will be down the road in a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reading from a document of June 2000 that talks about the 
cost drivers.  It predicts that annual provincial health care 
costs will rise to at least $85 billion in 10 years from the $54 
billion of today.  That is just on the health care side 
provincially.  It also says that the long range outlook is even 
more stark.  Provincial health care costs could rise by 247% in 
the next quarter century to $186 billion from today's $54 
billion.  Those are real numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must acknowledge the fact that we are getting a 
deal on health care.  We have a system that includes everyone. 
Every one of us is entitled to the publicly funded health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States the system is driven by litigation and 
private corporations, insurance companies being one of them, not 
to mention medical corporations or HBOs.  Some 40% of all 
Americans are left out of their health care system because it is 
not publicly funded.  A majority of the other 60% is getting 
services below a standard that would be acceptable, simply 
because it is driven by the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to see that type of system in Canada.  The fact 
is that the Americans, as a percentage of GDP, pay more for a 
system that is completely broken than we pay in Canada.  In GDP 
terms in the U.S. it is just slightly under 15%. 
In Canada we are slightly under 10%, more in the order of 9%.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a deal but it does not come without a cost.  We 
acknowledge that, but we must have a commitment from the 
Government of Canada stating that, yes, it will have sustained 
funding and it will make sure the system works, and no, it will 
not subject people to the next round of budget cuts as has been 
done in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in this package, Bill C-45, that gives us any 
sense of relief or satisfaction that the Government of Canada has 
learned its lesson and that stable funding will be there.  At the 
whim of the Prime Minister or the Minister of Finance acting on 
behalf of the Prime Minister and cabinet, the government could 
actually come in six weeks after the election and take a scalpel 
to health care again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle we are standing by is the sixth one, sustained 
dependable funding, and adding it to the health care package or 
the five principles of health care so that there is a road map, a 
business plan.  No one can run a business without a plan except 
the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said originally in this debate, there are no ideas.  The 
government is devoid of all ideas.  There is no plan for the 
future.  I think the Liberals' campaign slogan in this election 
should be “No ideas, no votes”.  I would accept that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened intently 
to the hon. member's comments on this piece of legislation.  He 
was talking about fairy tales earlier, and I was thinking about 
why we had budget cuts in the first place.  It seems to me it was 
a government that the member's party was part of that brought us 
to a $40 billion annual deficit.  That deficit, I very well 
remember, endangered not just the simple health of every Canadian 
in this country but the financial integrity of this country.  It 
was this Liberal government that took up the cause to eradicate 
that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Thirty-two billion dollars of that debt 
belonged to Pierre Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Yes, there were some changes made, 
some unfortunate changes, and health care was one of them.  Now 
we are happy to say that our financial house is back in order, 
that we in fact have surpluses and that we are able to share them 
with the provinces in this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must keep focused about just who administers the health care 
system.  Canada has the fourth highest per capita spending on 
health care in the world.  The member would say that we should 
spend more.  That is not the answer because people are saying at 
the same time that we rate 18th in service delivery.  That tells 
us a whole story, not of the federal government but of the 
provinces and territories that are responsible for administering 
the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this legislation includes an accountability 
framework.  It requires provinces to meet certain accountability 
targets, like how much money we are going to be spending in new 
technologies and buying MRIs, like how long the waiting lists are 
going to be and how we are making progress to improve health care 
for average Canadians.  That is what this legislation is all 
about.  The fairy tales the member was talking about were in his 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, not that I have to, but I 
would be willing to table the fairy tales, edition one and 
edition two, if the member would like to have them just as a 
reminder of what those members have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was not in the House in the eighties.  Not once 
between 1988 and 1993 did the Liberals, including the Secretary 
of State responsible for International Financial Institutions, 
who is sitting in the House right now, or the finance minister, 
for that matter, ever stand up in the House and vote for anything 
that would reduce either the size or the cost of government, 
never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals left office in 1984 they bragged that they 
left the cupboard bare.  They said that they had left the country 
in such financial destitution that the Conservative government 
could never recover and would never get re-elected.  Surprise, we 
did. 
Basically they are reaping the rewards for a lot of tough things 
we did, things we had to do and were forced to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when they resort to hitting the most vulnerable in our 
society, the sick, the poor and the elderly, simply to balance 
their books, there is something wrong.  There is something wrong 
when they have a $40 billion surplus in the EI fund which they 
want to use to pay down debt to balance the books.  When the 
mini-budget comes out we can rest assured that they are going to 
lay down a lot of cash on the national debt right on the backs of 
the poor, the working poor, the sick and the elderly.  The 
transfer of funds into health care, education and welfare has 
been decimated by the government and by no one else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the sad legacy on which the Liberals are going to have 
to run the election.  It is a record that I would not be 
particularly proud of.  I do not think they are going to be able 
to stagger around too many parts of Canada promoting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their latest hero to come on the scene is Captain Canada, all 
the way from Newfoundland.  Perhaps we should call him Captain 
Kangaroo because he stood up in this kangaroo court called 
parliament and voted for these draconian cuts to health care that 
almost decimated his own province.  He went back home and almost 
admitted the same, saying “I can go back home and fight as 
premier for this province and restore health funding”.  He is 
the very man who stood up in the House and took it away.  That is 
the phony of all phonys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is coming back now to save Canada.  He is saving Canada only 
because the Prime Minister wants to keep Paul Martin off his 
back.  It is a political game that even the Liberal caucus 
understands.  Putting a man like that into cabinet— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As the hon. member

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.  Speaker, it is interesting to see 
that the member from New Brunswick can read.  He was giving us 
the Canadian Alliance platform just a minute ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the platform of the party he represents?  None of us 
have seen anything in writing to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is 
accusing me of not reading, but obviously she was not listening. 
One of the cornerstones of our platform will be the sixth 
principle of the Canada Health Act:  secure funding so that 
provinces, even Alberta, even B.C., will know where they are down 
the road, so that they can plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Running a government or a country is no different from running 
one's own family or business.  Mr. Speaker, you have been in 
business.  You have a number of businesses on the go now, I 
think.  You are an entrepreneur.  You take risks.  You do not get 
out of bed in the morning without some kind of plan as to 
where you are going or how you are going to do it.  People must 
have a plan no matter how successful their business, no matter if 
the cash is flowing in by the barrel or the truckload.  Mr. 
Speaker, you must have a plan for how you are going to reinvest 
or for where you are going.  You just do not simply hand out 
money and think that it is going to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the government is doing in this case.  A deathbed 
reprieve is what it is looking for.  “Here is the cash, do not 
get in my way, there is an election coming” is exactly what the 
Prime Minister is saying.  He is saying “Just get lost, here is 
the money, do not make a peep.  We can change it all tomorrow, 
but we are getting ready for an election and we do not want to 
talk about it.  Take the money and run”.  That is exactly what 
the government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a feeling that it is not going to work.  Canadians are a 
bit too smart for that.  As I said earlier, the Canadian people 
were duped once by red book one, twice by red book two, and the 
cut, paste and crazy glue approach to red book three is not going 
to work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think we need to debate in the House the record 
of the Mulroney Conservatives and the role they played in 
diminishing transfer payments to the point where in fact cash for 
health care would have completely dried up as we speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do need to address are the comments by the Liberal 
member in this debate that defend a deal which in fact does 
nothing more than put back the cash transfers the government took 
out in 1995.  It does not even ensure that those moneys flow 
immediately.  It makes provision for some money to flow a year 
from now.  It does not even increase the base from which to build 
for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue here is how anyone can justify a government 
maintaining federal funding at a low rate of 13% despite being in 
this surplus position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is 
usually kind except when she gets onto this.  How can I express 
this in a generous way?  The point is, I take exception to some 
of what she said, but in terms of the government and their track 
record on this issue I could not agree more with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all seriousness, the Canadian people are becoming just a 
little bit cynical about a government running by the seat of its 
pants.  It will come down to ideas and a commitment to doing the 
job the way it has to be done in civilized society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  New ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Yes, with some new ideas, ideas that 
will to challenge us, where the government meets the challenges 
head on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have never spent any political capital on ideas, 
have they? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  None.  The government is basically 
running by the seat of its pants on seeds sown and work done by 
previous administrations, including, to give him credit, some of 
the work done by Mr. Trudeau.  It is just running on the past, 
devoid of ideas, because when we go out and do something new and 
challenging, it means that we are going to lose some popularity, 
that we are going to spend some of our political capital.  These 
people could never be accused of spending political capital. 
These people are always the cynical sort, where it is “make it 
up, write the cheque”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, this is a cheque book approach to governing.  These 
people are taking out the cheque book to plug every hole in the 
dike.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really am at a loss as to where to 
start.  There have been many interesting comments and a sharing 
of ideas, and even a borrowing of ideas from one party to the 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where we have to start is to talk about the reality.  We have 
parties who claim that the health care system is the best in the 
world, that Canada's publicly funded health care system is next 
to none.  I think we need a reality check.  We have this 
perception in Canada that the Canada Health Act and medicare is a 
universal plan.  That is just not so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me universality means that every Canadian is treated in the 
same manner with regard to health care.  This is just not so. 
There are individuals in the province of British Columbia who 
have no health care.  They are in arrears with their health care 
premiums and have people from collection agencies after them to 
collect the health care premiums before they receive medical 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people in the rest of Canada are not aware that there 
are two provinces where the citizens actually have to pay out of 
their pockets on a monthly basis in order to receive health care 
services.  If they do not pay those premiums they do not receive 
the services.  If they do not have health care insurance because 
they do not pay for it, they have to pay cash to see a medical 
doctor.  In Ontario and in Saskatchewan that is not the case, but 
in B.C. and in Alberta if people have not paid their health care 
premiums they are not covered under medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say that does not happen, but I will tell them about 
this young lad whose name is Tim Jeffries. 
When he showed up at a local hospital with a shattered ankle he 
was put into the operating room for corrective surgery.  Then, 
when they found out his health care premiums were in arrears, 
they removed him from the hospital room.  They did not do the 
surgery until his mother had paid the health care premiums owed. 
That is not universality.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not universality when individuals in B.C. can be taken off 
operating tables because they have not paid premiums but 
individuals in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Atlantic Canada 
and Quebec can get the service without paying a cent out of their 
pockets.  People in B.C. have credit agencies after them.  People 
in Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we talk about is a health care medical services 
plan that it is portable:  no matter what province one is in, one 
can go to another province and receive medical services. 
Portability, a key part of our medical system, does not exist 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual from my constituency who needs dialysis was 
planning a trip to Ottawa to visit his son.  There was no room in 
the public system for Mr. Rushworth to receive dialysis.  He 
would have to go to a private clinic.  Because of the difference 
between the cost of the dialysis and what the province of B.C. 
would pay, it would have cost him $1,400 out of his own pocket to 
be able to visit his son in Ontario.  Portability does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have misconceptions about our health care system.  I 
do not have to tell anybody about accessibility.  I had a 
conversation with my florist while ordering some flowers.  He was 
over in Britain when it was discovered he had a life threatening 
aneurysm.  He waited seven months for the surgery to repair it. 
This was a life threatening condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it accessibility to have to wait 12 months, 18 months, two 
years or whatever it takes to have hip or knee replacement 
surgery?  Accessibility does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the system south of the border and just how awful 
it is.  I have contacts in the United States who run a public 
hospital system there.  I know them very well.  When I told them 
about the young man who was pulled off the operating table they 
were horrified.  They said, perhaps for lawsuit reasons, they 
would never have taken anybody off an operating table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where the health care system Canadians think 
is there for them is not.  Why is it not there for them?  The 
numbers tell the story.  In 1993-94 the federal government 
transferred to the provinces through Canada health and social and 
education transfers a total of $18.8 billion over a period of 
seven years.  It actually was budgeted for a decrease to $11.5 
billion, but a few years ago the Liberal government realized the 
crisis it had created and reversed that.  The bottom end figure 
is $12.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That $6.3 billion was taken directly out of cash transfers to 
the provinces to provide health care services to the people of 
Canada.  With these numbers there is no question that the federal 
government, through the cuts to transfers to the provinces to 
provide health care services, is solely responsible for the 
crisis in our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address some of the comments being made by both 
the Liberal government and the New Democratic Party that Canadian 
Alliance wants to support a two tier health care system.  It is 
just not true. 
We have always supported public health care for Canadians that 
delivers what it promises to deliver in a system that works. 
However, we are not naive enough to think that we now have a one 
tier health care system.  Anybody who has had to make use of 
Canada's health care system knows it is a multi-tier system.  Let 
us not even talk two tier.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address something of interest.  The New Democratic 
Party in my province of British Columbia has kept up the fallacy 
that we have a one tier system.  It is also hypocritical to the 
point where, in conjunction with the federal government, the 
province of B.C. helps fund a private clinic in China.  It is a 
private clinic for only those who can afford to go there.  It is 
funded by the federal government and the province of B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another hypocrisy involves an individual by the name of Robert 
James Mason.  It was not his fault.  He needed surgery 
immediately.  It was not a situation in which he could afford to 
wait.  In our health care system everyone has to wait.  Lo and 
behold if we did not have a union supporting his desire to have 
the government of British Columbia send him down to the United 
States, that hated country south of the border, to get the health 
care he needed.  He could get it immediately there. He could get 
good health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party, which is always ragging on the American 
system or anybody who says that their health care system is 
actually delivering good health care in a timely fashion, 
supported one of its union members going to the United States for 
service.  There is a bit of irony in that and a bit of hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not stop there.  We cannot use the private clinics in 
Vancouver or in our country if we pay with public dollars. 
However, the New Democratic Party in B.C. can.  The cabinet uses 
it in B.C.  The Workers' Compensation Board and the union use it 
in B.C.  Why can some people make use of these private clinics 
and get quick treatment when they need it when others have to 
wait for 15 months or 18 months to get the services? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a multi-tier system.  For people in the New Democratic 
Party and the Liberals to pretend that it is not so will not help 
solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of things are necessary.  First, we have to change our 
attitudes.  The federal government has to stop blaming everybody 
else and assume responsibility.  When the Liberal government in 
1967-68 brought in health care it made a promise to the provinces 
that it would fund it at 50%.  It made that promise to get the 
provinces to come into the Canada Health Act.  What is the 
current percentage of funding?  It will be 13%.  After promising 
50% funding it delivered something much less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should Canadians believe the government that lives and 
breathes stories about the health system that are not true?  Why 
should Canadians believe the government that made promises it 
cannot and will not deliver?  Why should Canadians believe in the 
end run it will deliver on the promises it is making today 
through this legislation? 
Why should Canadians believe the government will not, when it 
suits its purposes, once more cut funding in transfers to the 
provinces?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seems to think this is a time for photo op 
politics.  With a federal election looming it gives the money to 
the provinces and is the saviour of health care.  The real story 
is that the government took the money out of health care.  It 
created the crisis.  It is responsible.  All it is doing is 
putting back in some of the money it took out in the first place. 
What would stop the government, should it unfortunately be 
re-elected, from doing that again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Priorities are funny things.  The government claims the delivery 
of health care services to Canadians is a priority.  Let me talk 
about the government's priorities.  Many of us have seen the 
television ads about how wonderful the federal government is for 
putting back into the system some of the money it took out.  That 
advertising cost $8 million.  Believe me, $8 million could do an 
awful lot to put the necessary technological equipment into our 
health care system.  That money could do an awful lot to create 
more training and educational positions in our universities and 
to help replace the doctors and nurses leaving our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government spent $8 million to tell Canadians how wonderful 
it is.  If that is not photo op politics, if that is not buying 
votes for an election, I do not know what is.  It certainly is a 
case of misplaced priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed?  Money is needed, but more than that we need new 
ideas.  We need to encourage provinces to come up with new and 
innovative ways to deliver good health care that will be there 
for the people.  Our concern should not be whether health care is 
here today or tomorrow but whether it will be here 10 and 20 
years from now for our children and grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What needs to be included in the Canada Health Act, and what 
should have been there in the first place, is a legislative 
commitment that the federal government will not renege on its 
funding commitment. The Canada Health Act needs the addition of 
long term funding from the federal government to the provinces. 
That way the provinces can plan and design a system that will 
work in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need ideas and plans from the federal government.  The 
Minister of Finance has loosened up his pocketbook and provided 
an additional sum of money but it is not what is needed.  The 
Canadian Medical Association has said an additional $10.5 billion 
is needed.  This is only a drop in the bucket of what will be 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that we need more than money.  The finance minister 
has given us some more money for our health care system, but what 
new plans and ideas has the Minister of Health given us?  None. 
What good is putting money into a system as broken as ours 
without some idea of how we are to allocate the funds or make 
sure the deficiencies in the system are corrected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other speakers have mentioned our shortage of doctors and nurses 
and our obsolete equipment.  We need the new technologies out 
there that can be used for diagnostic purposes.  Those kinds of 
investments can probably save dollars in the future.  That is 
what we need.  We need some assurance that the money that goes 
into the system will be appropriated in the right places to 
actually make a difference.  We need to encourage the doctors and 
nurses who have left our country to return to Canada and provide 
the health care services we so desperately need here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we do that?  We do it by making their work environment 
much better and by providing them with not only the technology 
and equipment but also with a lower tax rate to make them 
competitive and put more money in their pockets.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at other areas in our country, at rural areas 
and aboriginal communities where the health care services they 
have today are not acceptable.  We need to look at them in order 
to address how we are going to provide better health care in 
rural areas and in aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems are enormous.  What Canadians are looking for is 
leadership.  They are looking for leadership from people who have 
new ideas, who are willing to be part of a partnership.  Whether 
this Liberal government likes it or not, the constitutional act, 
the BNA Act, has given the delivery of health care to the 
provinces.  It is a provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it makes bad photo ops prior to a federal election if the 
federal government does not get the credit for it.  I am sorry, 
people, but the provinces are the ones with the responsibility. 
The federal government's responsibility is to work with the 
provinces, not to threaten them, not to coerce them, not to 
blackmail them, but to work with them to find the solutions, to 
find areas in which we can better our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have had is a federal government that is so concerned 
with getting the credit that it blames the provinces for 
everything that has happened.  It blames the provinces for the 
crisis in the health care system.  It wants photo op politics. It 
will spend $8 million to get photo op politics, to get the 
accolades that go with saving our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we put away jurisdictions.  It is time that we 
delivered good health care to our citizens.  It is time for our 
federal government to acknowledge and to respond to its place in 
delivering the health care system, and that is to make a 
financial commitment that it sticks with and does not change.  If 
that means legislating, so be it.  It means that we legislate a 
commitment of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it means that the federal government does not get the credit, 
so be it.  The main concern should not be buying votes at 
election time.  The main concern should be that every Canadian is 
able to get the medical services when needed, at the time— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think it is inappropriate in the House to allege that the 
government is buying votes.  It is unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Your point is well 
made.  I was paying attention to that.  The allegation was made 
in the obtuse.  It was not directed at any one individual or at 
any one ministry.  It was an obtuse suggestion and as such I did 
not consider it unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it very interesting 
that the government would be so sensitive to that fact and yet 
see nothing wrong in spending $8 million on advertising to the 
Canadian people who is responsible for saving medicare.  If that 
is not vote buying, then I would be interested to know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the federal government has made a commitment 
to the Canadian people and the big question is from its past 
delivery, its past governance:  can Canadians trust it to 
deliver?  I would say no, Canadians cannot. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the 
dissertation of the member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley 
and a number of things escaped me.  She talked about the loss of 
money in the envelope for health care spending.  It is quite 
common that people forget about tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I will not be able to sell the country on tax points, but 
I would like to draw members' attention to the concept that the 
provinces and the federal government came to an agreement on years 
ago.  Rather than transfer cash payments to the provinces, the 
federal government would transfer a combination of cash and 
taxing room.  In other words, the provinces would be allowed to 
tax more and the federal government would tax less in the area of 
income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this same period revenues have increased. In fact the 
propensity for provinces to gain more revenue to support the 
health care system is also part of this arithmetical formula.  It 
serves the opposition to simply ignore that fact of reality as if 
Confederation and other things in this country had never 
happened, but that is reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This member likes to use examples.  She constantly alludes to 
what a great system the Americans have and gave a number of 
examples about people in her own communities and so forth who are 
without health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to give an example.  I can remember being on a 
dock in Florida.  Beside me were an American doctor from Illinois 
and a fellow who had a heart attack while fishing. In 
cardiac arrest, lying on the dock, is this man of about 63 or 64 
holding onto this doctor's hand and saying “Do not send me to a 
hospital.  I cannot afford it.  I will lose my house”.  That is 
the kind of health care system that the Alliance would like us to 
have here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance constantly talks about the provinces' 
responsibility for health care.  Yes, under our constitution the 
provinces are responsible for the administration of health care, 
but the Alliance then turns around and says that it is 
inefficient and that it is the federal government's 
responsibility.  The Alliance cannot have it both ways.  If the 
provinces are responsible for the administration of health care, 
the provinces are responsible for the inefficient use of that 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is interesting that the hon. member talks about the 
province of Alberta and the fact that people have to pay premiums 
there.  If they do not pay them they cannot get access.  Her own 
leader was the treasurer of the province of Alberta.  That is the 
kind of health care system the Alliance wants to bring to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  I do not ever recall saying that I 
thought we should have an American health care system.  I do not 
believe that and neither does the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are concerned about is that when we send Canadians to 
the U.S. to have their treatment because we cannot provide it 
here, it costs, in the case of this one individual, $60,000 to 
the health care system of B.C. or Canada to pay for this service 
in the States.  That $60,000 U.S. is not helping to support our 
Canadian health care system.  It is helping the public health 
care system in the United States.  That is what I object to.  We 
are using our Canadian health care dollars every time we send one 
of our patients south of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is happening all the time.  I have newspaper clippings here. 
The third patient in a week went to Seattle.  This was a trauma 
patient who was turned away from three hospitals in the lower 
mainland and got shipped to Seattle to get trauma care after a 
motorcycle accident in which the guy's spleen was split wide 
open.  These sorts of things should be treated immediately.  He 
was sent to Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what?  Our Canadian dollars are supporting that medical 
system in Seattle.  They are not in Canada supporting our health 
care system and that is the responsibility of this government 
because it took the money out of the provinces' hands and the 
provinces cannot deliver the care citizens require.  It is the 
responsibility of the government.  The government took $6 
billion-and-something out of the health care system, no one else. 
That is its responsibility.  It ought to assume that 
responsibility instead of trying to pass it on to the provinces.

Speaker, in my own community in Calgary West, some of the 
constituents I have door-knocked have talked about some of the 
practical, real, front line implications of these cuts the 
government has made to health care over the last while.  I have 
seniors in my community who have of course contributed to the 
growth and the building of this country.  They are the foundation 
upon which we stand and yet they are in lineups for hip 
replacement surgery.  For these people, frankly, every single day 
they have left is precious. Health complications like these only 
make it that much more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member might be able to comment, for 
example, on how the government cuts have resulted in people 
having to line up for hip replacement surgery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like the hon. member to comment, for example, on 
the case of my grandmother who received eye surgery.  She went to 
a clinic called the Gimbel Eye Centre, in Calgary.  The reason 
she went there, of course, was that the public system was not 
able to handle her for months. 
Instead of operating on both eyes at once, they would have done 
one eye at a time with regard to her developing cataracts.  If 
that were the case, my grandmother would have been deprived of 
her sight for months.  As well, the public procedures in terms of 
the facilities in Calgary were actually less effective than those 
of the centre.

that my grandmother could not get access to those things.  The

United States to get that type of surgery.  I would like the hon. 
member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about $8 million in ads.  I wonder whether the 
$8 million the government has put into ads to try to pull the 
wool over the eyes of Canadians would be better spent on doctors 
and nurses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the 50:50 commitment there used to be with regard to 
health care in Alberta?  Alberta was paying 91% of the health 
care bill in our province.  I wonder what it is like in the 
member's native province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we need to clarify 
something for the listening audience.  When I talk about a $6 
billion cut I am talking about each year.  Collectively over the 
five years it was budgeted for, we are talking in the 
neighbourhood of $30 billion.  That is the enormity of the actual 
loss in funding that the provinces have had to operate under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about private clinics versus publicly 
administered health care services.  I do not imagine that there 
is a province in Canada that does not have some type of private 
clinic.  Some clinics are for eyes, some for general practice, 
some for laboratory work, some are abortion clinics and so on. 
There are a lot of private clinics out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the concern Canadians should have.  Because of the 
failure of our public system to handle the demand for hip 
surgeries, cataract operations and whatnot, Canadians who can 
afford it are taking to the United States the dollars that could 
be supporting a Canadian health care system of private clinics, 
public services or whatever.  That money is supporting American 
public health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have good friends in Mount Vernon, south of the border, who 
run a public hospital, from birth to death.  They have a public 
system for people who cannot afford insurance.  People who come 
into their emergency room are looked after whether they can 
afford it or not.  My friends are overjoyed with the Canadians 
using their services, because Canadians are subsidizing that 
public service they give to their own American people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does that make any sense?  In Canada our people are waiting 
15 or 18 months for hip surgery but if someone can afford to use 
an American clinic, he or she can have surgery next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the concern Canadians should have.  Our dollars are 
supporting the American health care system, not the Canadian 
health care system.  We have to stop that.  We have to make our 
system work by a commitment, followed up on by the federal 
government, to put funding in place which the provinces can count 
on to be there, and that funding cannot be taken away 
unilaterally when it serves the purpose of the federal 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of Bill C-45 is 
to implement certain of the Government of Canada's commitments in 
respect of health care and certain early childhood development 
commitments arising from the meeting of the first ministers held 
in Ottawa on September 11, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides funding for the acquisition and installation 
of medical equipment and funding for health information and 
communication technologies.  The amendments to the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act provide for increased 
funding over five years to the provinces and territories through 
the Canada health and social transfer for health, post-secondary 
education, social assistance and social services, including early 
childhood development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have to ask themselves why the Liberals have to be so 
reluctantly dragged into reality.  In view of the bill before us, 
the angle I am going to take for the moment is to put in 
perspective children's and human rights legislation, entitlements 
versus privileges and health care spending.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the UN declaration of human rights recognizes that all 
beings are born free and have equal dignity, it gives minimal 
recognition to the unique nature of childhood.  Most of its 
articles refer to everyone, but article 25(2) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and 
assistance.  All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, 
shall enjoy the same social protection. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no other reference to childhood and age is notably 
absent from article 2 in the list of human characteristics for 
which discrimination is precluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms also makes no 
reference to children per se, either their specific freedoms or 
any limitation of them, except to recognize age as among the 
human conditions for which discrimination is specifically 
precluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither of these declarations mentions any responsibilities that 
adults should or must have toward children when asserting or 
using their rights.  Article 3 of the charter states that every 
citizen of Canada has the right to vote and to be a qualified 
member of a legislative assembly.  Since children cannot be 
members of a legislative assembly it seems possible they were 
overlooked in the legislation.  Their special vulnerabilities 
were certainly not acknowledged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1991 Canadian ratification of the 1989 UN convention on the 
rights of the child was thus of key importance for Canadian 
children.  The convention challenges the signatories to seek to 
attain benchmark behaviours toward the needs, rights and freedoms 
of children.  As a co-signatory the Canadian government is 
obliged to report on its progress toward full implementation of 
the convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 the Canadian Coalition for the Rights of Children 
reported on compliance to convention articles in six selected 
areas.  These areas are education, fundamental freedoms, 
treatment of abused and neglected children, refugee children, 
children with disabilities, and Canada's response to its 
international obligations with regard to children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of articles were assessed for this compliance:  article 
4, which is international co-operation; articles 13, 14 and 15, 
which prescribe fundamental freedoms; article 19, which requires 
protection from maltreatment, abuse and neglect; article 23, 
which outlines the rights of children with disabilities; articles 
28 and 29, which are directed to ensuring access to education; 
and article 22, which requires countries to offer protection and 
humanitarian assistance to refugee children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Examination of these articles has shown seven areas where 
children's rights are being systematically violated in Canada. 
Action is required in 26 situations before compliance can be said 
to be achieved.  This lack of compliance is clear.  One example 
is the lack of both adequate national data on the extent of 
disability in childhood and resources for children with 
disabilities and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada the rights of children under the UN convention are not 
fully recognized in many other ways.  Article 3 requires that the 
best interests of the child shall be of primary consideration. 
When much of the information is examined in the light of the best 
interests standard, it is clear that in many instances it has not 
been attained.  The lack of environmental standards specifically 
directed to the protection of the fetus and growing child is an 
obvious example.  Likewise, data on school age children and youth 
reflect the difficulties they encounter with regard to violence 
and sexuality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 17, while recognizing the social and cultural value of 
the mass media, also directs states to develop appropriate 
guidelines for the protection of children from information and 
materials injurious to their well-being.  A day spent watching 
television or surfing the Internet confirms that such injurious 
material is readily available to developing children, reflecting 
the extent to which adult rights and freedoms continue to be 
exercised without regard to the possible impact on the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 18, while recognizing the responsibilities of parents 
for the upbringing and development of the child, also asks states 
to ensure that children of working parents have the right to 
benefit from child care services and facilities for which they 
are eligible.  Clearly we have performed indifferently in this 
regard.  The Liberal record is very poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 24 recognizes the right of children to enjoy the highest 
attainable standards of health.  Article 24(e) seeks to ensure 
that all segments of society, especially parents and children, 
are educated and supported in such basic aspects as health, 
hygiene, sanitation, prevention of accidents, nutrition and 
breast feeding.  While the rates of injury have fallen over the 
years, the relatively high rates that persist among young 
children reflect the continuing attitude that the young child 
must adapt to the adult world, oftentimes a developmentally 
impossible task.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the advantages of breast-feeding are today more widely 
known, rates of breast-feeding rapidly diminish in the weeks 
following birth through the lack of ongoing support for this 
natural process.  Similarly the record of Canadian hospitals in 
adopting the World Health Organization 10 step breast-feeding 
support program can only be described as abysmal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 26 recognizes the right of every child to benefit from 
social security.  Article 27 calls on states to recognize the 
right of every child to a standard of living that is adequate for 
the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social 
development.  It also states that while parents have primary 
responsibility to secure these standards, states will assist 
where necessary through material assistance and support programs, 
particularly with regard to nutrition, clothing and housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With food banks that serve thousands of individuals, with 
extensive dependency on clothing exchanges and donation programs 
for those in need, with school nutrition programs essentially 
dependent on non-government agencies, and with the number of 
homeless children and families increasing in large cities, it is 
clear that Canadian governments have much work to do before 
compliance with these articles is achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under article 31 children are entitled to rest and leisure and 
equal opportunities for cultural, artistic and recreational 
leisure activities.  Chapter 7 demonstrates that such activities 
are viewed not as universal entitlements in Canada but as 
privileges dependent upon adequacy of family income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sexual abuse of children and adolescents is all too common, 
especially for those who have disabilities or who live on the 
street.  Article 34 charges states to protect children from all 
forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse and includes in 
this protection from inducements or coercion.  Measures must be 
taken to protect them from prostitution, unlawful sexual 
practices and exploitative use in pornographic performances and 
materials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The apparent acceptance of high rates of prostitution as a means 
of survival among the youth living on the street, the horrendous 
revelations regarding official suppression of evidence of sexual 
abuse of children in both residential schools and recreational 
and sports activities, and the 1999 decision on the possession of 
child pornography in British Columbia are all examples of our 
delinquency as a society toward children and of the consideration 
of adult freedoms over children's rights.  It is a record of the 
Liberal government's failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the articles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child challenge the age-old attitude to children that regards 
them solely as parental property.  This is a particular tension 
in North American society, reflecting attitudes that must be 
questioned in today's rapidly changing family demographics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A comparison of the facts of the health of Canada's children 
with the provision for child health and well-being in the UN 
convention is a sobering but worthwhile exercise.  It becomes 
clear that the rights and freedoms of children are generally 
dependent upon the goodwill of adults.  When this fails, children 
often lack ready mechanisms to redress situations of concern. The 
old style Liberal government has failed the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Canada has ratified the UN convention, it unfortunately is 
not part of domestic law, has yet to be used in Canadian courts 
and is not legally respected.  These circumstances leave many 
children in society still lacking in many basic human rights.  We 
have a government that has failed children and should be 
denounced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the increased funding of health 
care for Canadians, especially children, but it does not believe 
just putting more money into the issue will solve all the 
problems in our health care system, again, especially the 
situation for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the funding is welcomed by our party we also oppose the 
Liberal government's opposition to attempts by the provinces to 
find new, different and more creative ways to deliver services 
within the Canada Health Act. Our party has greater respect for 
provincial jurisdiction of health care under the constitution and 
would work with the provinces to find more effective and 
efficient ways to deliver health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Liberal government cannot continue to denounce the 
provinces for trying to establish less top heavy, 
bureaucratically inefficient, Soviet style health care delivery 
systems.  It is a position of the Canadian Alliance that more 
money does not necessarily solve all the problems that arise from 
inefficient delivery models.  Restricting how the provinces may 
use the money does nothing to help heal our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My community wants better governance than we have had.  I will 
continue to be their voice for higher standards, a more 
comprehensive consideration for families and children, and an 
accountable, optimistic vision for the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is suggesting that the government has done nothing 
for children and families.  Although I was not prepared to speak 
on this, I wrote down a couple of items that perhaps the House 
would like to be refreshed on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the increase in the Canada child tax benefit to 
the advantage of all families with children.  Another $2.5 
billion included in there means an aggregate of $9 billion 
annually goes to families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 1, 2001, there will be an increase in maternity and 
parental leave benefits.  Parents can choose to provide direct 
parental care to their children up to a full year.  Families with 
children will benefit from the $1 billion for that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child care expense deduction was increased in 1998 from 
$5,000 for a preschool child and $3,000 for a school age child up 
to $7,000 for a preschool child and $4,000 for a school age 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the deindexation of the Income Tax Act and the 
increase in the basic personal amount available to all Canadians. 
This puts more money into the pockets of Canadians so that they 
can choose to provide the kind of care their children need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just some of the examples of the work the Government 
of Canada has done on behalf of all Canadians to invest in 
children, who are our future.  I would ask the member to simply 
clarify his remarks with regard to the investment we have made in 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I tried to very quickly go 
through details to try to provide a different perspective on the 
general conversation around health care.  I tried to say that 
concerning our international commitments, when we compare what we 
are doing with the commitments we have made under the UN 
convention of the child, Canada comes up very short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member has talked about goes a bit in the right 
direction but is still very short of what could have been delivered 
in the current fiscal envelope.  Under our solution 17 package 
the child care expense deduction is still there and the child tax 
benefit is still there, but where is the standard deduction for 
children that is not means tested, that as a society recognizes 
the value of children, and that provides freedom and opportunity 
for parents to decide how they will look after their own 
children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have painted quite a stark picture of how Canada 
boasts internationally and makes proud commitments but within 
these domestic borders falls very short. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member for New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby spoke 
about early childhood development.  That is one of the aspects of 
the bill.  I suggest that there is no greater need for early 
childhood development than in the area of health care, where we 
see huge lines of very young children waiting for surgery.  That 
is a travesty in terms of early childhood development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment on the $8 million 
pre-election ad campaign the government is running these days. In 
my riding they could not get funding for an MRI diagnostic 
equipment machine.  It costs about $1 million.  The $8 million 
the government is wasting on its ad campaign would have bought 
eight MRI machines.  To buy the machine they had to raise the 
money locally, within the constituency, because there was a 
shortage of funding as a result of the $30 billion the government 
cut from the health care system through its drastic cuts in 
transfers to the provinces over the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member see that as being of detriment to the early 
childhood development he is talking about today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague has made the 
point.  I do not need to repeat it.  However I can add to what he 
has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Typically when governments are heading into elections government 
departments spend taxpayer money on soft advertising or image 
building for government services.  People understand that as 
being quasi-political advertising. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another example of that.  We have these soft, warm, 
fuzzy commercials that talk about how we are glad that the family 
law system and child maintenance are there because children are 
first.  Then there is the web page number and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the expense of producing those commercials and at how 
many thousands of dollars it costs every time those commercials 
are run, yet the government has done nothing to implement the 
joint Senate-House of Commons committee report on child custody 
and access and has done nothing to reform family law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of fancy commercials to make us feel warm and fuzzy 
about the federal government, that money should have been put 
into providing real services to children, to establish unified 
family courts across the country and all kinds of relief that 
could be directly provided to children and families. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, to pick up on the last point the member brought forward 
about the joint Senate-House of Commons committee on our 
children, the child custody issue and the recommendations that 
were given to the federal government by a joint all party 
committee of both the Senate and the House of Commons, I know the 
member spent a lot of time travelling the country and taking part 
in those committee hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had someone in my office again last week asking about the 
45 recommendations.  He was a divorced dad who was trying 
to get access to his children, trying to look after his 
children and trying to pay his child support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the the member could briefly describe what he thinks 
should have been done.  Could he also give us some of the key 
recommendations of the child custody report that he spent so much 
time working on, and tell us what has happened to children at 
risk because of this government's lack of action on that front? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, many other countries have 
gone through the same agony of trying to update their divorce and 
separation laws.  Certainly Canada is far behind developments in 
the western world on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The road map is there, but the response of the federal 
government is that it is just one more study in the ongoing 
debate.  The federal government has absolutely no political 
commitment to take action on the review of family law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter where we go, from province to province, there is an 
agenda out there in the public, that is, the family law system is 
broken and in a mess and it needs leadership from the federal 
government, not an excuse saying that it is a complicated problem 
of shared federal-provincial jurisdiction and we must discuss it 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want leadership from the justice minister and the government 
with regard to taking some action and bringing the provinces along. 
We can restore the balance and fairness in family law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where appropriate, we can make family law much more child 
focused.  We can develop shared parenting plans instead of seeing 
children as property.  We can work with the shared jurisdiction 
of the provinces to enhance conflict resolution, non-court 
processes and unified family courts across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can implement specifically the recommendations of the report 
“For the Sake of the Children”, including the specific 
principle of shared parenting and mutual parental responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to improve the process whereby grandparents have to go 
through an extra barrier if they feel they have to get legally 
involved with the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to get the courts to enforce their own orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to deal with the issue of false allegations in the whole 
family law context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tremendous agenda but unfortunately the Liberal 
government has a track record of no commitment to getting 
anything done in the family law area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say a few words on the bill before the House 
today, the bill that is putting more money back into health care. 
I want to state the obvious, which is that even with the 
additional money, we will still not be back to the levels we 
would have been at if the government had not touched the bill in 
the first place back in 1995 in the budget of the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the history of this period is written, we will find that 
there has been no government that has taken as much money out of 
social programs, particularly health care, as the conservative 
government across the way.  I say conservative because it is 
more conservative than the Conservative government was when it 
comes to restricting programs for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now of course we have an election campaign that is about to be 
announced.  The Prime Minister will drop the writ this weekend 
for November 27.  One wonders what that campaign is all about. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this campaign is more about the Prime Minister's fear of 
the Minister of Finance than his fear of the opposition 
parties.  He is afraid of the Minister of Finance and afraid of a 
rebellion on the backbenches of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a government whose cabinet has recommended no election 
this fall.  Here is a government whose caucus recommends no 
election this fall.  Here is a government whose pollster has 
recommended no election this fall.  Here is a government that 
knows the Canadian people do not want to waste $100 million to 
$200 million on an election campaign this fall.  Here is a 
government that is only three years and a few months into its 
mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a government that does not want a campaign, but there is 
a Prime Minister who wants a campaign because he is afraid of the 
Minister of Finance and a rebellion in the backbenches of the 
Liberal Party.  That is what politics has been reduced to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to say those words in the debate today because the 
Prime Minister has been trying to fast track absolutely 
everything so that he can drop the writ come Sunday of this 
particular week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my friends in the Liberal Party—and there is one behind 
the curtain now—are quite embarrassed by the Prime Minister in 
terms of how he is trying to engineer an election for his own 
purposes because of his fear of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister of course is bringing in the premier of 
Newfoundland to be a minister in the government.  The premier of 
Newfoundland is not a member of parliament and, God help us, not 
even a member of the other place, the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The  Prime Minister is setting a really dangerous precedent.  He 
did this with the minister for trade and the minister for 
intergovernmental affairs a few years ago.  He put them in the 
cabinet and called a byelection to get them elected. They were 
not even members of parliament but were given cabinet positions. 
The same thing has happened with the premier of Newfoundland.  He 
has been put in cabinet and is not a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I remember that happening before this Prime 
Minister was back in the days when, I believe, the leader of the 
today's Conservative Party brought in a fellow named René de 
Cotret and put him in the cabinet.  He later ran in Ottawa 
Centre.  I think it also happened when former Prime Minister 
Pierre Trudeau appointed Pierre Juneau way back in the 1970s or 
early 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a Prime Minister in the modern age taking someone 
who is not elected.  He has done it three times.  He is setting a 
very dangerous precedent by putting three people in cabinet with 
no election, without going to the people.  I do not think that 
should be done.  If someone wants to serve in the cabinet, he or 
she should be elected to the Parliament of Canada.  The Prime 
Minister has not done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have a very healthy debate about all these issues. 
They are all very important.  I believe we should have set 
election dates.  We should have elections every four years unless 
the government falls on a confidence vote.  We should have a set 
parliamentary timetable with a set time for a throne speech, a 
budget and a beginning and an end to a session so that the Prime 
Minister cannot manipulate the timetable for his own partisan 
political differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the people most frustrated with this are the Liberal 
backbenchers themselves.  When they walk out of the House they 
tell me how frustrated they are with a Prime Minister who runs a 
one man show with the support of one or two ministers and a few 
bureaucrats in his office, including one of my friends who I see 
across the House here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system has to change.  We need a government and a parliament 
that listens to the people of Canada.  If we had that we would 
not have had the big cutbacks in health care in 1995 to begin 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are Liberals hanging their heads in shame.  Their 
government has cut absolutely billions of dollars out of health 
care.  They were a bunch of nervous nellies who were afraid of a 
Leader of the Opposition at that time who was advocating massive 
cutbacks in health care and in social programs.  The Liberals cut 
back more than any other government in the history of Canada. 
They should be very embarrassed by their government's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone across the way said that it would be a dinosaur who 
would advocate more money for health care.  I do not know where some of 
those Liberals have been but they should talk to the ordinary 
people in this country.  Canadians want an investment into 
programs for people.  They want the social deficit eliminated. 
They want the opportunity to have health care regardless of their 
incomes.  Those are the things Canadians want but the government 
is cutting back on them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care came into this country through a courageous fight 
many years ago waged by people in Saskatchewan.  It began back in 
the 1940s with hospitalization and in the 1960s with health care. 
It was people like Tommy Douglas who brought health care into the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the Canadian population we will find that there is 
no program as popular in Canada as health care, yet we have 
Liberals across the way laughing about it, saying that it is an 
old-fashioned thing, that it is out of touch, a thing of the 
dinosaurs.  I wish they would get up in the House and say that 
publicly rather than just heckling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I was talking with a number of people in the inner 
city of Regina who were very concerned about losing health care. 
They were very concerned about the government's massive cutbacks 
in all social programs.  They were concerned about the government 
putting all the money on paying down the national debt while 
forgetting to invest in people and paying off the social deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the great progressive Liberals, those great left wing 
Liberals who used to stand in the House and advocate programs for 
people, advocate the redistribution of income and wealth in the 
country, advocate a vision of a country that is based on sharing, 
co-operation and greater equality? Now they seem to be Alliance 
people in a hurry. There is not much difference between the two 
parties in terms of their tax programs, paying down the national 
debt and forgetting about the fact that we need money and 
programs for the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a choice in the election that is coming up.  There 
will be a couple of different visions in the election.  There are 
two parties, the Alliance and the Liberals, that share a very 
similar vision as to how they want to organize the economy. There 
is an argument as to whether or not they should put more money 
into the debt and deficit or put more money into helping wealthy 
people pay down their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance Party has a 17% flat tax that it is advocating in 
its second term, a flat tax that would be a big cutback for 
millionaires in the country.  How much different is the Minister 
of Finance?  A lot of his tax breaks have put a lot more money 
into the pockets of wealthy people in Canada as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to the Canadian people that the Liberal 
Party across the way will leave a legacy of being the most 
conservative government in our post-war history:  more 
conservative than the government of John Diefenbaker, more 
conservative than the government of Brian Mulroney and certainly 
more conservative than the governments of Pierre Trudeau and 
Lester Pearson.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder if Canadians watching 
the debate today would be shocked to know that we are debating a 
bill that would put $23.5 billion back into the Canada health and 
social transfer to the provinces for health care and early 
childhood development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill passed, money in the medical equipment fund, a $1 
billion fund, could flow tomorrow.  We have members standing in 
the House denying Canadians the right to that medical equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example.  In regard to the province of 
Saskatchewan, $33 million could be available tomorrow if its 
member would support this bill and get it through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a member opposite from British Columbia, where $132 
million could flow in the next few days for medical equipment 
such as MRIs and CAT scanners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have lost touch with the cost of an MRI or a CAT scanner, but 
if we are looking at $1 million or $2 million, Saskatchewan could 
have 30 of them in the next few days, and we sit here and debate 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would enact $23.5 billion in addition to $14 billion in 
the last two budgets that would be transferred to the provinces 
through the CHST for health care, post-secondary education and 
social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle deny the residents and 
citizens of Saskatchewan access to this $33 million medical 
equipment fund? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, did I hear the 
parliamentary secretary correctly?  Did he say that in the next 
few days we will have 30 more MRIs in the province of 
Saskatchewan?  Is it a commitment on behalf of the Minister of 
Health and the Minister of Finance that in the next few days 
there will be 30 more MRIs?  If that is the commitment, would he please 
get up and tell us that is a commitment by the Government of 
Canada.  If it is not a commitment, then why does he say it?

</I></B></P><P align=left>He is complaining that I spoke for about eight or nine minutes 
in the House of Commons.  The government could have put money 
into the health care system in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 
2000. However, the government cut back its funding of the health 
care system by billions and billions of dollars making people 
suffer and making sure that hospitals closed from coast to coast 
in this country.  Now he complains that we speak for 10 or 20 
minutes in the House of Commons.  Where is his common sense? 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it quite interesting to listen to the 
parliamentary secretary when he said that if this bill does not 
pass today at all stages hell will freeze over and the end is 
upon us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary knows full well that in discussions 
with the government House leader, we were told absolutely, point 
blank, that this bill must be passed by March 31 and I certainly 
hope it will be.  It would be under a Canadian Alliance 
government.  We were told that the funding is not in jeopardy and 
that the provinces will not be disallowed the right to buy MRIs 
or other equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows full well that the deal is going ahead. All 
the parties in the House of Commons are going to support it. We 
will support it.  We want to make sure it goes ahead.  The 
provinces can carry on in full confidence that the $1 billion in 
the technology fund which he talked about will be theirs.  The 
agreement spells that out.  Everyone in the House knows that is a 
fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the way the Liberals do business.  They say either we 
agree with them and agree with them on their terms or we will be 
punished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member from Saskatchewan to describe for 
us what he thinks about being held to ransom by the Liberals.  They 
are saying that we are not even allowed to talk about this issue 
because if we do it we are somehow anti-health care.  What does 
he think of the Liberal tactics here this afternoon? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, those are typical 
Liberal tactics.  That is why I speak so much about reforming the 
parliamentary electoral system so people can have input, so there 
is proper debate and proper participation in how we spend the 
money that belongs to the taxpayers of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we debate an issue of importance like health care for a few 
minutes, they get upset because we are going to stall things. 
That is the same party, by the way, that has promised a home care 
system and pharmacare in this country.  Where is pharmacare? 
Where is home care?  We should be raising those questions in the 
debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember my grandfather telling me years ago that the Liberal 
Party promised medicare in 1919 and fought for it.  It did not 
come in until the 1960s.  It only came in after it was started in 
Saskatchewan under the leadership of the CCF and Tommy Douglas. 
Can we believe the Liberal Party?  That is its track record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need serious parliamentary reform in this country so we can 
hold ministers accountable, so we can have proper debates and so 
the people of the country can have their voices heard.  If we do 
not do that we will find ourselves sleepwalking right into a 
crisis in democracy.  We are seeing that today with the snap 
election call coming on Sunday by the Prime Minister.  We are 
seeing it in the way he brought Brian Tobin, the premier of 
Newfoundland, into cabinet without a seat in the House of 
Commons.  That is really shameful and cynical political behaviour 
on the behalf of the Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know it is a fact that the Liberal Party does not want this 
election campaign.  The cabinet has been advising against it. The 
caucus has advised against it.  The Liberals' own pollsters 
advised against it and yet the Prime Minister is trigger happy 
and wants to call an election campaign.  Is that democracy?  Is 
that the kind of system where we have checks and balances, where 
ordinary people's voices can be heard, where people are empowered 
and where we have a democratic system? Should one man be able to 
call an election whenever he wants regardless of what is 
happening in the country and regardless of what bills are before 
the House of Commons?  My answer to that is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a country where the Prime Minister appoints the head of 
the army, the head of the police, the head of the supreme court, 
all the justices, all the senators, all the cabinet ministers and 
makes every major appointment in government without any proper checks 
and balances by the House of Commons.  This is something that 
should be changed.  We need a political system that is democratic 
and that empowers people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we need a change in the electoral system to bring in a 
measure for proportionate representation where everybody's vote 
counts and votes are not wasted.  That is the kind of agenda we 
need in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask my colleague from the NDP to refer to some of the 
remarks that were just made by the Liberal member a few moments 
ago. 
Let us be honest.  The only reason we are debating this health 
care accord is not because of the federal government, it is 
because of the leadership that the provinces provided.  They 
pretty much dragged the federal government kicking and screaming 
to the table to negotiate this particular accord.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree with the Progressive Conservative 
sentiment that this bill should be reclassified as the post-dated 
cheque bill, given the fact that none of the dollars that were 
initially cut by the federal government for health care will be 
restored immediately?  It will be done partially next April, but 
the dollars that were cut will not hit the 1994 levels for over 
three years.  Would the hon. member support that this was a 
provincially led initiative that the government had to accept 
because it was a take it or leave it deal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it absolutely 
is.  Most of the money will start flowing well after the bill has 
passed through the House.  The money will go out next year and 
the year after and the year after that but not in the immediate 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, and I think the parliamentary secretary knows this, 
it was the leadership that came from the provinces, particularly 
from premiers like Premier Doer of Manitoba, the chair of the 
premiers this year, and Premier Romanow of Saskatchewan, who 
started to put this on the agenda a number of years ago.  This 
forced the federal government to act.  The federal government was 
a very hesitant player in terms of putting more money back into 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the most important issue in the country.  The money is 
there.  It is about time we reinvested more money into health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to enquire via questions and comments, where is the 
promise on pharmacare?  Where is the delivery and promise on home 
care?  I see Liberals hanging their heads and not getting up to 
respond to that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to enter into this debate on what I 
think Canadians think is a very important bill.  It is a bill 
that the Canadian Alliance is pleased to support.  We do not 
think it is perfect but we are supportive of it in the sense that 
it restores some of the gutting of the Canada health funding, 
which took place under this Liberal government, and restores, at 
least in part over the next few years, what the government took 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of a famous political story in British Columbia. 
B.C. had a premier who people said would put rocks in shoes for 
the entire time he was in office.  However, just before the 
election he would pull out two or three rocks expecting that 
everyone would say thanks for the relief and that his party would 
be re-elected.  That premier is long gone so we will not talk 
about him.  This reminds me of what the Liberals are up to today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to health care, it is interesting and instructive 
to go right to the platform that the Canadian Alliance Party will 
be campaigning on in the weeks ahead.  It is pretty 
straightforward and in a capsulated form on the right hand side 
of a document that can be found at www.Canadian Alliance.ca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, our plan for the health care system is to maintain 
Canada's medicare vision and the five principles of the Canada 
Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is to replace federal-provincial confrontation with a more 
co-operative approach.  We should not have to drag the federal 
government to these meetings.  It should be co-operative.  Let us 
try to work together on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is to maintain funding commitments to health care with a built 
in funding escalator to allow for increases in population, 
changes in demographics and so on.  That will be built into our 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improved funding will increase access to quality care for the 
family.  That is a given and everyone knows that.  We will also 
guarantee in law long term funding to the provinces so we can 
rebuild our health care system with confidence.  That is the big 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan also says that right now the Canada Health Act does not 
impose any obligation on Ottawa to maintain funding levels.  The 
health accord that we are talking about today does not obligate 
the federal government in the long term to give strategic long 
term funding in health care.  It is a short term agreement and is 
good as far as it goes.  However, it does not commit the federal 
government in legislation that the provinces can count on the 
funding for the future.  Our plan goes on to say that the 
Canadian Alliance thinks it is wrong that the health act does not 
include that right now. 
We will amend the Canada Health Act to ensure that the federal 
government cannot unilaterally cut health care funding again.  We 
propose to entrench five year funding agreements, negotiated with 
the provinces, in the Canada Health Act.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this is important is that the federal government, and 
we saw some of it here this afternoon already, will go into this 
next campaign and it will say all kinds of things, particularly 
about our party, I believe.  They brought in Mr. Tobin from 
Atlantic Canada.  They needed a rat pack organizer and brought in 
the king of the rat pack to do it.  He will be the king of the 
drive-by smear.  Whatever is said about the Canadian Alliance, 
his job will be to paint an evil picture of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me a little bit of something our leader said in a 
speech the other day when we launched our platform campaign 
in Kitchener.  Close to 2,000 people came out to hear this.  He 
talked a little bit about the health care funding.  I remember it 
well and it is something to remember for this coming campaign. He 
had some advice for the Liberals, which was to try telling the 
truth all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so innovative for the Liberals that they might actually 
find it is something worthwhile.  Instead of saying, for instance, 
that the Canadian Alliance will do away with the Canada Health 
Act, maybe the Liberals would like to pick up the document, turn 
to page 15 and say that we will maintain Canada's medicare vision 
in the five principles of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals speak the truth, it might even feel good to 
them.  Instead of smearing other people, instead of spreading 
lies, spreading innuendo, spreading nonsense that they know is 
not true, what if they actually got up and spoke the truth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old saying that the truth shall set us free.  What 
it means is that it is a very freeing thing to tell the truth, 
even about someone we may oppose politically.  Instead of 
attacking someone individually, instead of going childishly off 
into the distance, painting on campaign signs and literature and 
thinking it is funny, why do they not try just telling the truth 
that the Alliance will maintain the Canada Health Act, will 
enshrine five year funding agreements with the provinces, will 
give Canadians back what the Liberal government took away and 
will do it in spades? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the House will look forward to 
the continuation of the hon. member's remarks later today.  I 
should advise him and the House that there are 15 minutes

Speaker, where is the Liberal government's heart?  It is 
certainly not with entrepreneurial men and women on the family 
farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan, the Archers, Darrell and 
Anthea, recently wanted to add to the agricultural diversity of 
Canada.  They determined there was a growing market for water 
buffalo milk and cheese in Europe and that the trend was shifting 
to North America.  They wanted to be a part of it.  It made sense 
agriculturally and economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One year ago they bought and began the importation of their herd 
from Denmark.  Agriculture Canada and the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency gave approval at every step.  The herd was in 
quarantine in Denmark and now is in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now after an outbreak of BSE in one cow in Denmark, the Archers 
face the loss of everything.  They have invested everything into 
this enterprise and the CFIA has demanded the herd be destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the need to protect our beef and dairy markets, 
both domestically and internationally.  However through no fault 
of their own, the Archers face the loss of everything.  The 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has failed to offer this 
family any compensation.  This is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Archers and the people of Canada need a change.  It is time 
for a government with a change.  The Canadian Alliance will be—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan—King—Aurora, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada has undergone an economic renaissance known 
internationally as the Canadian miracle.  Over two million jobs 
have been created since 1993, the vast majority by a determined, 
focused, visionary group of individuals who embody the very best 
of human qualities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They pursue their goals with passion and commitment.  They 
persist through obstacles even when they appear insurmountable. 
In a world of constant change, they stay ahead of the curve. They 
are innovators, risk takers and job creators.  They strive for 
excellence.  They take pride in their products and services. They 
contribute to their communities and, yes, they are nation 
builders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to small business entrepreneurs, the engines of 
Canada's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strong voice for Canadian small businesses is the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business.  This well known national 
organization today has reached an important milestone in its 
history.  The CFIB has reached a membership of 100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a personal note, I want to express my gratitude and 
congratulations to the CFIB on this important and very meaningful 
event.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the report tabled yesterday, the information 
commissioner made an unequivocal attack on this government's 
culture of secrecy, which deprives the people of Canada and of 
Quebec of their right to access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the commissioner, the highest government levels are 
involved.  The Prime Minister's Office, in an unprecedented act, 
has refused to allow the commissioner access to its files. The 
Privy Council Office is involved in a court challenge of the 
constitutionality of the commissioner's right to carry out 
investigations.  Both Treasury Board and the PCO are creating 
procedures to delay the publication of embarrassing internal 
audit reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should not come as any surprise.  A government that looks 
out for its friends, who then repay the favour through the 
party's election coffers, has no choice but to conceal 
information from the public.  Secrecy is one of the things that 
characterizes nepotism.  In a country that claims democratic 
practices, this is totally unacceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the legacy continues.  In 1984 Prime Minister Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau initiated the Canadian heritage river secretariat 
to recognize the great natural and human heritage of Canada's 
rivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 14, 2000, the Thames River in southwestern Ontario was 
officially designated as one of Canada's 28 Canadian heritage 
rivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over its 11,000 year history, the Thames River has played a key 
historic role.  Natives, hunters, explorers, fur traders, 
settlers, soldiers and former slaves have all travelled this 
natural highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the river and its watershed are home to great diversity 
of plants, birds, fish and animals, some of which are endangered 
and found nowhere else in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month, at the annual Heritage Day Festival, I was pleased 
to join with provincial and first nation representatives to 
unveil a plaque recognizing the heritage river.

membership mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of the members of its national management committee are 
in Ottawa today to celebrate this important event.  I was 
honoured to meet with them earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses produce most of the new jobs created in Canada. 
They provide most of the new inventions and innovations and, yes, 
they pay a ton of tax to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the CFIB came along, the interests of small businesses 
were largely ignored when important policy decisions were made in 
government.  All that started to change after the CFIB came into 
existence.  Twenty-nine years later and 100,000 members strong, 
the CFIB has grown in size and influence to now become the big 
voice for Canada's small businesses.

the A Week Without Violence programs being promoted by the

</I></B></P><P align=left>In past years, the community “Y” of Grey-Wellington raised 
awareness of violence by holding competitions for T-shirt designs 
in local schools, having the clergy dedicate prayers against 
violence, sending letters to the newspapers, handing out 
anti-violence literature and holding discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In designating October 15 to 21 as A Week without Violence, the 
YWCA asks us to be aware of our own attitudes and negative 
behaviours as we pledge to spend seven days without committing, 
condoning or contributing to violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the YWCA for the work it does and for

was given the critic area of small business.  One of my first 
duties was to meet with John Bulloch, the founder of the Canadian

outspoken advocate of the small and medium business sector and I 
learned much from his wise counsel.

still speaking out on behalf of small and medium sized Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business currently has 
over 100,000 members across the country, the largest individual

has been the direct input from its members in the form of surveys 
which are sent to all members of parliament to assist us in our

</I></B></P><P align=left>I share in the cry of Centraide-Québec, which, in its open 
letter to people who are not concerned about poverty and to 
everyone else, said “Over the past several years now, we have 
come to believe that poverty and social inequality involve costs 
and consequences that result in our society's shooting itself in 
the foot because of its failure to sufficiently or properly 
invest in the fight against poverty and inequality”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the eve of the economic statement, I encourage the Prime 
Minister to show a modicum of compassion by re-evaluating his 
priorities and by recognizing his government's seven years of 
social deficit.  This would be a fine opportunity to act on the 
demands by the women who are continuing their walk for a fairer 
and more humane world.

These conditions are in part what has prompted the organization 
of the World March of Women.

were interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner's report in bold type has the words

information from the HRD commissioner on wasting $3 billion a

careers of the commissioner's staff have been threatened, and 
that if members of the public service come to believe that it is 
career suicide to do a good job for the information commissioner, 
the effectiveness of the office is in grave danger.

that the Prime Minister set the worst record of any minister in 
17 years.  Looking at this, it is no secret the Prime Minister 
does not want to show off a recent poll which says Canadians 
think he is the most arrogant and untrustworthy of all political 
leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He can restore some small faith to Canadians if he would admit

it is here in the information commissioner's report:  the worst 
record in 17 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he will not admit that the information commissioner was 
telling the truth, if he will not take responsibility for wasting 
$3 billion a year which could have gone to health care, will he 
at least support the Canadian Alliance position on health care to 
add a sixth principle to the Canada Health Act that will 
guarantee funding at the federal level so that no federal 
government ever again could rip $25 billion out of the health

important reports have been released in the last 24 hours:  the 
report of the information commissioner and the report of the

this government really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister ask the public to trust him when the 
information commissioner is making very serious accusations 
about the attempts by the Prime Minister's own department, the 
PCO, to control information in order to avoid accountability? 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have disclosed more records over the past two years than ever 
before, thousands and thousands of records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the law provides that some records, such as those for 
internal use within each minister's office, may remain 
privileged, and this has been respected by all information 
commissioners over the years.  I think that ministers are 
entitled to speak with their staff without having to release the 
content of such communications to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the commissioner feels that the government has acted contrary 
to the law, he has a recourse, but we are doing exactly what 
has been done since the law was first passed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this

all-time record for RCMP investigations.  More investigations 
have gone on in the riding of this Prime Minister than in the 
ridings of any of his predecessors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does he explain that the PCO, his own department, is 
challenging almost all the commissioner's powers, that it is 
ignoring information requests and that senior PCO officials are 
refusing to answer questions, probably under his orders, even 
under oath?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member must know that the reason there are investigations is 
because we have asked for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case involving the riding of Saint-Maurice now before the 
courts, it was my office that called the police to inform them 
that there seemed to be some abuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that we have tabled thousands and 
thousands of documents and our present information policy is 
the one that has been around since 1979.

short memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Placeteco affair, his government attempted to conceal all 
of the facts and it was the Bloc Quebecois which demanded an 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PM can give all the fine speeches he wants.  Let him stand 
up and tell the public what his explanation is for the statement 
by the information commissioner, referring to him and his 
cabinet, that this was the first time in close to 17 years a 
minister has refused to co-operate in an investigation by the 
information commissioner.  He is the one the commissioner is 
referring to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
shall repeat again what I have already said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the law, there are certain documents which are privileged 
information for the administration of a government, a minister's 
office or the Prime Minister's Office.  There are others that 
are privileged information for MPs.  There are certain things 
that belong to MPs, that relate to the operation of their 
offices.  They do not want everyone seeing what goes on within 
their offices.  The same goes for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am entitled to speak with my staff and my ministers and to 
keep information just for myself.  This is normal, and there

this is a very sad turn of events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not sad to see that the key Liberal value used by this 
government as its mandate comes to an end is the control of 
information and thus of democracy?  Is this not sad? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is focussing on just one part of the report. 
The commissioner also says that he congratulates certain 
organizations for their excellent co-operation.

everything that goes on in my office.

communicate with the people who work with me without having to 
make public all the documents and all the conversations.

<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
auditor general gives the government a failing grade in meeting 
its obligation for aboriginal health.  Higher infant mortality, 
lower life expectancy and chronic disease are rampant.  Suicide 
rates are astronomical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the government ignored 65% of the auditor general's 
recommendations from three years ago for meeting its health 
obligations to aboriginal Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
over the last 10 years the health status among the aboriginal 
population has improved, with reduced infant mortality and longer 
life expectancy, which is not to say there is not a great deal 
more to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are grateful for the recommendations the auditor general has 
made in his most recent report.  We take encouragement from the 
fact that the auditor general has pointed out that we have made 
progress since his recommendations in 1997.  There remains more 
work to do and we are committed to doing it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the 
health minister is so grateful for the auditor general's 
recommendations, why has he ignored 65% of them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 Canadians were horrified to learn of the desperate 
conditions at Davis Inlet, particularly substance abuse and 
suicide among youth.  The government promised urgent assistance, 
relocation and improved living conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six years later the suffering continues.  The government's 
failure to address the underlying problems leaves the residents 
of that community at grave risk.  Is the government prepared to 
sacrifice another generation of aboriginal youth?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to inform 
the member that we have been working very closely with community 
members of Davis Inlet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the process now of moving a whole community, which 
takes a significant amount of time, effort and planning.  We are 
on track to move a community out of a very desperate situation 
into a brand new place to live with brand new housing, sewer and 
water, all the different amenities people in Canada take for 
granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that will be what the member is expecting, because that 
is what the aboriginal people in Labrador and the Innu are 
expecting. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
report of the auditor general revealed today a growing pattern of 
deals made in secret by the government, whether they have to do 
with specs that are changed or offices in Sydney or whether they 
have to do with approvals for HRDC grants that are given directly 
by the minister in the riding of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I ask the Prime Minister one specific question about a deal 
made in private?  Why was the $100 million expenditure on 
Downsview kept from parliament? 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the minister 
responsible for Canada Lands, the creation of that corporation 
was according to the rules on creating crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That corporation will report to parliament through an annual 
report of Canada Lands.  That report will be available to the 
House committees.  Therefore all parliamentarians can question 
the officials on the operation of that corporation.  Everything 
is in the open. 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister says everything is fine.  He followed the rules he 
wrote.  The rules he wrote said he could hide a $100 million 
expenditure from the House of Commons but he would let parliament 
look at it after the money was gone.  That is perverse and that 
is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister of Canada undertake now first to change 
those rules his minister hides behind and, second, to stop this 
pattern of secret deals that betray the public interest of 
Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canada Lands was built under an act of the Parliament of 
Canada.  This corporation is obliged to report to the House of 
Commons in an annual report, as the minister said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all according to the law passed by parliament.  If the 
hon. member does not want to have a crown corporation of this 
type, he should say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that Canada Lands is a good operation at arm's length 
from the government, so there will be a minimum of intervention 
in its operation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government is trying desperately to look good on all 
kinds of fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The HRD minister has assured Canadians time and time again that 
there were very few grant overpayments at HRD.  The auditor 
general disagrees with that.  Only 76% of the more than 17,000 
active files, that is, less than one-half of 1%, were subjected to 
departmental review.  That one-half of 1% generated 11 police 
probes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister avoid the other 16,900-odd files?  Were 
there not enough RCMP officers to go around for the 
investigation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by reading from the news 
release of the auditor general wherein he wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Longstanding and widespread problems finally being 
addressed—Sustained effort is required. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said on a number of occasions, the administration of 
grants and contributions in my department was unacceptable.  That 
is why we implemented a corrective action plan for which today 
the auditor general has given unqualified support.  He asked us 
to sustain our effort, and I will commit to the House that indeed 
we will. 
<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is finally being addressed.  They have been in 
government seven years.  I can understand they would get the itch 
to do it right.  The auditor general also said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note, however, that HRDC's review of 76 sampled files was not 
sufficient to determine whether all 17,000 active files fully met 
program requirements. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a heck of a shortfall.  How can the minister defend 
ignoring 99.5% of all those files?

member opposite has never, in all these months, taken the time to 
look at our corrective action plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing that we said we would do was review our active 
files, because of course that gives us the opportunity to correct 
them now.  In that action plan we also commit to reviewing our

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
auditor general informed us this morning of two serious problems 
in CIDA's awarding of a contract to Transélec, in Louiseville. 
This company now belongs to the Prime Minister's good friend, 
Claude Gauthier, who also owns Placeteco, which received funding 
worth $1.2 million and is under investigation.  This is the first 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister for International Cooperation justify the 
choice of Transélec in the prequalification stage, when it did 
not meet the basic criterion of 51% Canadian ownership. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the pre-qualification stage the 
officials sent to the minister a list of seven companies, one of 
which was Transélec.  This was under the old system before a 
competitive system was established, which we changed after the 
previous government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This company won the competitive bid with 30% under.  It has 
finished the program without any problem whatsoever.

<P><A NAME="LINK147"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
unconvincing, but there is a second problem.  The auditor general 
tells us that Transélec did not even get a qualifying grade on 
CIDA's evaluation grid. 
How does the minister explain the Prime Minister's friend 
getting the contract? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously the member is not listening. 
The memo that went to the minister concerning the pre-qualified 
companies included seven companies.  Transélec was one of those 
seven.  Three companies were selected to go to bidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was under the old system when these things went to the 
minister.  That is no longer the system.  We have changed that 
system, because we now have a transparent and open system in 
CIDA. 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, according to today's auditor general's report, 
Transélec, the company run by the Prime Minister's friend and 
campaign contributor, did not qualify for the $6.3 million CIDA 
contract awarded to it in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did it not meet the minimum score to apply, it was not 
even Canadian owned during the pre-qualification phase.  Yet that 
did not stop the Prime Minister bending every rule in the book to 
benefit his friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not just admit that the auditor 
general has caught him red handed using public funds to favour 
his Liberal friends? 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the allegation is totally irresponsible. 
First, CIDA's practice is to hire professional auditing 
accounting firms to ensure compliance with professional decision 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case CIDA accepted the formal declaration by the 
proponent that the Canadian ownership requirement was met, with 
the declaration confirmed by a recognized reputable Canadian 
accounting firm.  The allegations are totally erroneous. 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, personally I think it is terrible that the Prime 
Minister's career has to end this way.  For over a year the Prime 
Minister has attended his cronyism as business as usual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the auditor general the PM has broken every rule in 
the book in handing out this $6.3 million contract to his friend. 
How does the Prime Minister defend this obvious abuse of taxpayer 
money simply to reward his friends?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

the HRDC minister has been grossly exaggerating, even

the jobs supposedly created from her free-spending ways.  I 
quote:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister insult Canadians with pretend numbers when 
she knows she cannot back them up with facts? 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

jobs had been created.  There is a question over how many and he 
is right that we did not document appropriately the data that 
would support the numbers employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the auditor general recognizes that last 
spring we implemented a program to review all our programs to 
ensure that we have appropriate outcomes identified and the 
measures to confirm those outcomes.  That work will be done and 
implemented by next spring. 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

$3 billion a year something would be created.  The problem is 
that the minister justifies her reckless spending by saying jobs 
are being created, and yet the auditor general says she has no 
basis on which to make those allegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The records are not being kept.  There are jobs being claimed 
for which other people are paying.  The minister is not coming

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the week after David Dingwall was appointed a minister 
of the crown, he said “I want the government to rent space in 
the building at 338 Charlotte Street”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other competitors were denied the opportunity to bid because the 
contract was drawn so narrowly.  We paid $200,000 a year more in 
rent than what was an adequate rent.  It turned out after all 
that we did not even need the space so we let it to someone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that every time the auditor general reports, we 
get these smelly contracts which seem to produce public money for 
private gangs? 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first concerning the 
bidding process, my department had an internal audit and the 
matter was dealt with.  As a matter of fact, in the internal 
audit concerning that space, the auditor general cited that ACOA 
had potential partners but that those partners did not come 
through, and that was the problem.  Now the government of Nova 
Scotia is renting most of the space. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I like these internal audits.  They lead to places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give another example.  The Canada Communication Group was 
privatized in 1997.  It is now owned by St. Joseph Corporation. 
The auditor general told us in 1997 that it was given a privileged 
advance arrangement, in other words a sweetheart deal, because 
it could go five years in business with no competitive bidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the connection between privileged advance arrangements 
and the fact that in the last two years CCG and St. Joseph 
donated $30,000 to the Liberal Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think that question is out of order 
as it does not appear to relate directly to the competence of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part of the question concerning the contract with the 
crown corporation may be in order and the hon. Minister of Public 
Works may choose to answer that part of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, St. Joseph printing, 
like any other printing company, had to bid for the contract.  It 
was an open process and therefore the company had no sweet deal. 
As a matter of fact it complained that we were too hard on 
it.

would like to take the minister back to the deal cut in October

<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said, during 
that time my department had an internal audit on that matter and 
all the questions were dealt with.  As a matter of fact the 
auditor general in his report quoted the internal audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of the transparency was dealt with and everything 
was done according to treasury board policy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in Cape Breton, Liberal values mean contracts offered to 
golf buddies of the Prime Minister: a friend under RCMP 
investigation who got ministerial help arranging a sole source 
contract from ACOA that saw hundreds of thousands of dollars 
spent on renting empty offices.  These are the values laid out in 
the auditor general's report today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the new unelected minister for ACOA be responding to these 
documented abuses before Canadians are forced to go to the polls? 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can continue on and 
repeat the same thing.  Everything was in order.  Everything was 
done according to the rules.  The department had at that time an 
internal audit and confirmed that everything was done according 
to the rules in terms of space.  The partners for that space did 
not come through and ACOA was able to rent the extra space to the 
government of Nova Scotia.

question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internal e-mails to NRCan show that the heritage minister 
intervened on behalf of a company to permit them to manufacture 
less energy efficient refrigerators for 18 months beyond the 
current regulation in the guise of protecting jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet Camco's own internal documents, which I have here, 
show that it will be sourcing those same refrigerators 
from the United States 18 months from now anyway.  This is a very 
precarious precedent for industries and companies who invest in 
environmental technology due to governmental regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is not concerned about jobs in Alberta for which 
she makes regulations.  Why are jobs in Hamilton more important 
than jobs in Alberta? 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

the auditor general has identified many inconsistent and unfair 
practices in dealing with Canada's airports.  Toronto gets a $185 
million rent reduction right out of the blue, while documents 
from the ministry of transport show that Moncton airport will be 
in a deficit position for 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister have a special deal for the airport in his

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell the hon. member that the 
devolution of Canada's airports was one of the most successful 
programs initiated by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a program that has improved quality, has put management 
into the hands of local entrepreneurs, has responded to the needs 
of local communities and has given the kind of investment that 
the public sector would have had to pay for but is now being paid 
for by users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regime that has been put into effect is an accountable one 
and one that has had uniform application across the country.  It 
has been tough in negotiating some of these deals because 
airports have not liked the fact that we have to be consistent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.) </B>moved that Bill S-25, an act to amend the 
Defence Production Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking members 
of all parties for their co-operation with respect to this very 
important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for two reasons. First, it will facilitate 
a solution with the United States with respect to ITAR, but more 
importantly still, it will ensure the implementation in Canada of 
an effective control system that will support our interests and 
those of the Americans in matters of security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment is changing.  New threats to security, such as 
intranational conflicts, the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, and international terrorism, have appeared.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new challenges are causing western countries, including 
Canada, to look at their defence needs in new ways.  In the U.S. 
the changed perception of this threat, especially in congress, 
has led to an increased focus on domestic security issues.  As a 
global response to this increased risk of diversion, the U.S. 
tightened up its export control over sensitive goods and 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was sideswiped by these broad concerns of new perceived 
security threats when the U.S. department of state amended the 
Canadian exemption provisions under ITAR.  Many of the 
preferential elements that had previously been available to 
Canadian firms were removed and the definition of who could take 
advantage of Canadian exemptions was also narrowed considerably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This had major repercussions for Canada's industrial sector, in 
particular, defence, aerospace and satellite industries.  The 
result of this action did, however, provide Canada and the U.S. 
with a convenient and timely opportunity to pursue extensive 
discussions on export controls of sensitive goods. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, the amendments have eliminated the earlier 
preferential status of Canadian companies and imposed new permit 
requirements for a vast range of goods and technologies.  The 
amendments have also tightened up the definition of who can 
enjoy a Canadian exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our industry, the amendments add administrative formalities, 
costs and significant delays that mean lost business 
opportunities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we need this bill.  Canada must establish 
appropriate safeguards to assure both ourselves and our U.S. 
defence partners that certain controlled goods and technology, as 
set out in Canada's exports control list, are available to only 
authorized individuals and companies.  We need such assurances 
not only to protect certain controlled goods and associated 
technology of the North American defence, aerospace and satellite 
infrastructure, but also to encourage trade and improve Canada's 
national economic stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting these safeguards in place will be an important step 
toward reinstating the ITAR exemption for Canadian firms, 
allowing again for licence free cross-border transfer of most 
U.S. origin controlled goods and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A big part of this new system of safeguards is the proposed 
controlled goods registration program.  This Canadian made 
registration system will be housed within my department and will 
ensure effective control of access to and the transfer within 
Canada of controlled goods and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very briefly, the registration system will work as follows. 
Companies or individuals that wish to be registered or companies 
that wish to have a temporary worker or visitor exempt from 
registration must apply directly to the minister.  Registration 
will authorize the registered company's directors, officers and 
employees to access controlled goods provided they are screened 
by the company.  If the application is approved it will be up to 
the company to ensure ongoing compliance with the new regulations 
and to establish a compliance system that can be inspected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies will also be required to submit reports to the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services and to submit 
to periodic inspection by my department.  As minister, I will 
have the power to deny, suspend, amend or revoke registration and 
exemptions on the basis of a security assessment.  I will also 
have the authority to request necessary information from 
applicants for registration or exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that when the bill becomes law, the transfer 
of controlled goods in Canada may occur only between registered 
persons and certain individuals or classes of individuals who may 
be exempt from registration.  U.S. visitors who are already 
registered with the U.S. government are an example of the type of 
individual that could be exempted.

the act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I thank all colleagues for helping to give this 
important bill speedy passage.  It will protect the security of 
our North American defence system and in the meantime will allow 
the defence sector to continue to do business with its defence 
partners in the U.S. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to enter debate on the particular 
bill.  I am very happy with the hon. member opposite who just 
outlined some of the provisions of the bill.  I will go into the 
bill in a little more detail and perhaps suggest exactly its 
purpose and why it is needed in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I assure the minister that we are here to support 
the bill.  Although we have some questions about it, essentially 
we will support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-25 amends the Defence Production Act, as already 
indicated, to establish a new regulatory system which will 
regulate access by Canadian defence industries to certain 
controls, military goods or goods with military application.  The 
bill reflects a new Canada-U.S. agreement on co-ordinated 
legislative measures to strengthen our control over trade in 
defence related goods and technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed regulatory regime will be administered by the 
minister of public works from whom we have just heard.  It will 
ensure effective controls to have access to and the transfer 
within Canada of controlled goods and technologies.  Under the 
proposed system persons would have to be registered by the 
minister or be exempt from registration under the regulations to 
have access to such goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure some people listening to the debate will ask why we 
need the bill.  On April 12, 1999, the United States state 
department amended the international traffic and arms regulations 
and removed many of the preferential elements in the Canadian 
exemptions contained in part 126.5 of ITAR.  The amendments 
reduce the scope of the Canadian exemptions by imposing licensing 
requirements on a broad range of goods and technologies that had 
been licence free before April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the U.S. narrowed the definition of a Canadian 
citizen and ruled that Canadians with dual citizenship could no 
longer take advantage of the Canadian exemptions.  These 
amendments and the stricter interpretation of a Canadian citizen 
have significantly and adversely affected access to U.S. goods 
and technology, thereby affecting the competitiveness of the 
Canadian defence, aerospace and satellite sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has impacted these sectors very significantly in that this is 
a major part of the Canadian economy.  There is a lot of trade 
between Canada and the United States in these sectors.  It is 
essential that this part be secured because national security is 
at issue to a large degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States had reason to take action on April 12 of last 
year, despite the claim of the Minister of Foreign Affairs that 
decreasing the export of Canadian military related goods and 
materials controlled unrestricted defence related technology, 
which was being sent by private companies in Canada to places 
where it should not have been sent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not some kind of willy-nilly action by the United 
States.  It had a basis in fact.  The hon. senator observed 
certain things in the action by the United States.  For example, 
he had heard the suggestion that components of our frigate 
program found their way to the People's Liberation Army of China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally there was no provision under Canadian law to 
prevent controlled unrestricted technology, including data and 
other information, from being transferred between civilian 
companies and others within Canada.  That was the instigator, the 
lever that caused the Americans to question whether they could 
trust Canadians to maintain secrecy and to assure national 
security both in Canada and the United States.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This state of affairs and insecurity in our defence production 
sector caused grave concerns.  Our partner, the United States, 
said that it wanted to protect its security.  If we would not do 
it, the Americans would protect theirs.  The U.S. has threatened 
to relieve Canada and did so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a reason why the Americans did this.  The hon. 
minister mentioned just a moment ago that it gave us the 
opportunity to do something.  The interesting comment I would 
like to make is that the Liberal government, over and over again, 
needs to be prodded to do something meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government that is concerned about governing the country and 
its security would take and have the necessary precautions to 
ensure the security of the nation and ensure that the secrets of our 
technology and such intimate information would not be made 
available to anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a good reason for the Americans to do this.  I am very 
happy the government has now taken a step.  I am also sad to say 
that it took an outside country to draw attention to a weakness 
that existed in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 8, 1999, a Canada-U.S. agreement in principle was 
announced, recognizing a shared commitment of both governments to 
protect against illegal transfers or retransfers of controlled 
goods and technology from North America and to maintain a strong, 
integrated North American defence and industrial base.  The U.S. 
provided assurance that it was prepared to reinstate many 
Canadian exemptions and enhance others in tandem with Canada's 
harmonizing controls in the USML items within Canada and 
introducing appropriate legal sanctions for infractions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not interesting that our government did not have the 
initiative or the courage to do the things it is now threatened 
with because it missed the point?  As part of the agreement 
Canada has put forward new legislation, which is before us today. 
It will put forward new regulatory provisions that will 
strengthen Canadian defence export controls as a result of these 
changes.  The Canadian export council list will control the same 
defence goods and technologies as identified in the U.S. 
munitions list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States concurred with Canadian legislative and 
regulatory changes.  It intends to revise its defence trade 
control regulations to reinstate most of the pre-April 1999 
Canadian exemptions, allowing for licence free transfer for most 
U.S. origin unclassified defence goods and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States confirmed its intent to expand the exemption 
to allow for licensed access to such U.S. origin exports by 
Canadian citizens, including Canadian dual nationals and Canadian 
permanent residents.  The United States also intends to expand 
the prior exemptions to permit the export without licence of 
certain additional defence goods and technical data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this goes ahead we can be reasonably assured that we will now 
have the same kind of reciprocal relationship that we had before. 
Perhaps it will be even a little smoother than it was.  That is 
good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the bill originated in the Senate.  Why 
did it not come from the government?  It should have come from 
the Prime Minister's party because it should have been done at 
that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then is the legislation required?  The bill is required to 
reinstate special exemption for Canadian firms under the U.S. 
ITAR so that permits for the export of defence goods and services 
are not required.  Without special exemption Canadian companies 
are hampered from competing.  An estimated $1 billion of the $5 
billion business done by high technology, aerospace and other 
defence industry companies located in Canada have been 
potentially affected by the U.S. regulatory changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will ensure a continued access to U.S. defence market 
and related technology.  The Canadian defence industry stated 
that the Canadian exemption would be largely reinstated if there 
was evidence that three major issues were being addressed: 
first, the tightening up of our own export controls; second, the 
harmonization of the Canadian export control list with the 
American counterpart, which the joint agreement on October 8 
states will be the case; and, third, the implementation of a 
registration system.  All three elements would come into play 
with the passage of the legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on good ground at this point in time to ensure there will 
be a smooth transition.  The defence industry will be well served 
with this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the government the legislation is further required 
so that Canada establishes appropriate safeguards.  It is not 
just good enough to make the statements, but safeguards are 
required to assure both ourselves and our U.S. defence partners 
that the controlled goods and technologies as set out in the 
Canada export control list are available only to authorized 
individuals and companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need such assurance not only to protect certain controlled 
goods and associate technology of North American defence 
aerospace and satellite infrastructure but also to encourage 
trade and improve Canada's national economic stability.  Since 
about 85% of our export market is with the Americans to the 
south, it is a very good idea to have good relations with them. 
That is precisely what is being set out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the provisions of the bill pretty clearly in mind, but 
some other questions need to be addressed.  Will the new 
regulations be costly to Canadian industries?  The minister has 
already alluded to the fact that it will cost them something. The 
estimate is between $2.5 million to $3 million annually, but the 
cost to industry would be quite minor because a large percentage 
of the companies that have control of goods are already in the 
government's classified industrial security program.  Thus 
government has already screened a number of their employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this program, however, industry would have to appoint a 
designated official to ensure that controlled goods are properly 
controlled within companies.  That would be the main cost to 
industry.  We do not know exactly what the additional cost will 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Access to Information Act apply to the provisions of 
the bill and to the Defence Production Act as a whole?  The 
answer is yes.  However, so too do the protections for 
commercially confidential information, as well as the possibility 
of applying coverage for national security purposes.  That is 
important to recognize, but it places a tremendous onus on the 
minister and his personnel to be sure the national security is 
preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to admit that although this part of the legislation is 
necessary and essential and although we will support it, the 
integrity, honesty, stability and accountability of the 
government and its officials will be very significant and 
important in terms of making the legislation provide for the 
security we want in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the regulations in question be printed in <I>The Canada 
Gazette</I> and therefore open to parliamentary review and 
comment?  This is an interesting question because, as we heard 
this morning, much of this is done in secret behind closed doors. 
Because cabinet has the authority to make regulations under this 
act, it can make amendments to these regulations without making 
them transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Department of Justice the regulations to be 
made under the new part 2 of the act would have to be published 
in the ordinary way.  It would require pre-publication in part I 
of <I>The Canada Gazette</I> to allow for comment and consultation 
and to take views of affected parties into consideration for 
revision of the proposed regulations.  That would then be 
followed by publication of the ultimate regulations in part II of 
<I>The Canada Gazette</I>.  The Department of Justice says that 
they will be available. Then the defence industry and the public 
will know that these are the regulations that have to be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in the committee proceedings in the Senate requested 
that the minister undertake to deposit the regulations with the 
committee once a year.  The minister is on record as saying that 
he had no problem with the request.  The minister spoke to the 
bill just before I rose to speak.  We suspect he will do exactly 
that.  If we become the government, we would undertake to do the 
very same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regulations respecting ongoing compliance would allow the 
department to conduct inspections and gather information on those 
registered.  Would this give the government unreasonable access 
to information which could be used in a manner that would violate 
privacy?  It is very easy to assume that could be the case. 
What is the assurance that the information gathered when these 
inspectors are in the highly secure industries will not be used 
by the government for other purposes? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Registration will authorize the registered company's directors, 
officers and employees to access controlled goods provided they 
are screened by the company.  If an application is approved, it 
will be their responsibility to ensure ongoing compliance with the 
new regulations and to establish their compliance so it can be 
inspected.  Companies will also be required to submit reports to 
the Department of Public Works and Government Services and to 
submit to periodic inspections by the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, then, the department officials responded this way. 
The intent, and I draw the attention of the House to the word 
intent, of using administrative inspection is to enable the 
inspector to look at the security systems in place and suggest 
alternatives that will be helpful, which is the normal practice 
of inspectors and other regimes throughout the government.  The 
intention is not to have the inspectors do anything in connection 
with a criminal search. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the inspector found something in the course of an ordinary 
administration inspection that he believed was appropriate for a 
criminal investigation, the inspector would have to present 
himself in the ordinary way to obtain a search warrant.  Thus, he 
would have to withdraw from the premises and then, on reasonable 
and probable grounds, assert evidence sufficient to obtain a 
search warrant under the criminal code.  That is absolutely 
critical and essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty will be that there is a judgment factor involved 
here and the person doing the inspection will have to make that 
kind of decision.  The incumbent will have to be very careful and 
aware of what the security requirements are, what the regulations 
are and what criminal offences could be perpetrated by certain 
individuals or by certain companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the main provision in Bill S-25 is clause 5, which 
would add a series of new provisions to the Defence Production 
Act in the form of new parts 2 and 3 of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new part 2 of the act proposed in clause 5 of the bill would 
provide for the control of access to certain defence related 
goods.  Essentially, part 2 would restrict access to such goods 
to those persons who were registered by the Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services or who were exempt from such 
registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to the new section 35, the controlled goods subject to 
the proposed regime would be set out in a new schedule to the act 
which would be added to clause 7 of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By virtue of new section 36, the new regime would not apply to 
most public sector employees in Canada, when acting in good 
faith, in the course of their employment duties or to any member 
of a class of persons to be prescribed in the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New section 37 would make it an offence for a non-registered and 
non-exempt person to knowingly examine or possess controlled 
goods or to transfer controlled goods to another person.  This 
section would also make it an offence for any registered or 
exempt person to knowingly transfer a controlled good to or 
permit the examination of such a good by a non-registered and 
non-exempt person.  The section would clarify that transfer would 
mean to dispose or disclose the contents of a controlled good in 
any manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 37 would also clarify that a person's registration 
extends to authorized corporate officers and directors as well 
as authorized employees of the registered person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New section 38 of the act would provide for a scheme of 
registration of persons by the minister for access to controlled 
goods.  The minister would furnish registered persons with a 
certificate.  Registration and renewal of registration would be 
subject to conditions to be prescribed in regulations made under 
the act in addition to those that the minister considered 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the minister would be able to request any information 
from applicants for registration which the minister deemed 
necessary.  The minister would be able to deny any application 
for registration or suspend, amend or revoke a registration on 
the basis of a security assessment to be prescribed in the 
regulations.  We can see the significance of the minister's role 
in this operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New sections 39 and 39.1 would provide for a system of 
ministerial exemptions for individuals or classes of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under new section 40, registered persons would be required to 
provide the minister with information, as prescribed by the 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New section 41 would provide for the designation of inspectors 
to ensure compliance with the proposed rules.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>New section 42 would give such inspectors the power to enter and 
to inspect any place; to require the attendance of and question 
any person; to require any person to produce for inspection a 
document; to detain or remove any controlled goods until satisfied 
that it was in compliance with the requirements of the act and 
regulations; and to require any individual in charge of a place that 
is the subject of an inspection to take any measures that the 
inspector considers appropriate.  While exercising the authority 
under this new part, inspectors could be accompanied by another 
person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New section 43 would provide the governor in council with 
authority to make regulations for carrying out the purposes of 
the provisions of this new act including: prescribing classes of 
persons to whom the new restricted access regime to be 
established by the purposed new part 2 of the act would not 
apply; prescribing procedures for authorizing employees, 
corporate directors and officers of registered persons to have 
access to controlled goods; prescribing various matters 
pertaining to registrations and exemptions under this proposed 
new part.  This would include: eligibility conditions; 
applications procedures; the factors to be considered by the 
minister in deciding on registrations or exemptions; the 
minister's power to renew, suspend, amend or revoke registrations 
or exemptions and make regulations of conditions of registration 
or their renewal; conditions of exemptions and their renewal; 
security assessments; and amending the schedule of controlled 
goods on the joint recommendation of the minister and the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This last point is significant.  We now have a countervailing 
balance of one department with another department.  It cannot be 
done unilaterally by one minister alone.  That is a wise thing to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed new part 3 of the act would create a new offence to 
cover various acts of obstruction in relation to the inspection 
and reporting scheme proposed in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New section 44 would make it an offence to: provide false or 
misleading information; destroy any record or document required 
to be kept under the act or the regulations; make a false record 
or document which the act or regulations required to be kept; 
interfere with anything detained or removed by an inspector; or 
fail to comply with any reasonable request of an inspector or 
otherwise obstruct an inspector in the performance of his or her 
functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a comprehensive act.  There are very significant powers 
given to the cabinet and to the minister in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to new section 45(2), violation of new section 44 and 
any other provision of the act would be punishable on summary 
conviction by a fine of up to $25,000 or imprisonment for up to 
12 months or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to new section 45(1), the punishment for violating new 
section 37, that is, the access to controlled goods by a 
non-registered and non-exempt person, would be on summary 
conviction a fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment for up to two 
years or both, and on an indictment, a fine of up to $2 
million or imprisonment for up to two years or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now a punishment or a fine that is given to 
people who violate the provisions of the act.  That is a 
significant impact that gives the minister some power to do 
things and make it meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two other sections that I would like to look at but I 
will skip that for now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that while we support the bill and the 
provisions of the bill, we also recognize that there are some 
serious questions with regard to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the minister and to all members in the House that 
something as significant as this, which deals with the national 
security of a nation, cannot be treated seriously enough. The 
threat can come from people giving information, technology and 
access to controlled goods.  This could fall into the wrong hands 
and be used against our nation, which would make us less secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the government for doing this.  At the same time, the 
record of this government does not give me the kind of assurance 
that the minister will be open and accountable for all the things 
that are in this act.  I have some doubt about this because of 
the results of the last report of the auditor general.  I begin 
to wonder sometimes just exactly how open and how forthcoming 
this government will be about information like this.  I wish it 
well and I certainly want to give it a try.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill S-25 amends 
the Defence Production Act.  It indicates in its summary that 
the Minister of Public Works and Government Services is 
responsible for administering the new regime, which requires a 
person to be registered or exempted from registration by the 
minister to have legal access to these goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One's first reaction to the bill is that it might as well have 
been written in Latin.  We need a translation for just about 
every sentence, because it is not exactly clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sections 26 to 29 are repealed and replaced. 
These referred to anyone committing an offence and making a false 
declaration, which carried a $500 fine.  The old act ended at 
section 34.  This one goes to 46, where it indicates rather 
flatly a list of controlled goods, that is, prohibited firearms 
and ammunition with a calibre greater than 12.7 mm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is moreover stipulated in subclause 37(1) that “No person 
shall knowingly examine or possess a controlled good or transfer 
a controlled good to another person”.  Subclause 37(2) further 
states, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person registered or exempt from registration shall knowingly 
transfer a controlled good to or permit the examination of a 
controlled good by a person who is not registered or exempt from 
registration. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall try to translate these provisions from Latin into plain 
English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, in subclause 38(3), it is stated that “The minister may 
deny an application for registration or suspend, amend or revoke 
a registration on the basis of a security assessment—”.  The 
minister may also designate inspectors.  In other words, the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services has considerable 
power as far as the import and export of military materiel is 
concerned.  He also has absolute power over the designation and 
selection of inspectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, absolute power without the imposition of regulations 
or criteria sometimes creates inequalities and opens up the 
possibility for patronage and for finding jobs for the party 
faithful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the weak point of the bill.  Is it necessary, in order 
to accomplish our objectives, to give so much discretionary power 
to the minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 43, under Regulations, states that the governor in 
council may authorize officers, directors and employees to 
examine, possess or transfer controlled goods.  It seems to be 
mainly the penalties that are changing.  Suclause 45(1) 
states, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every person who contravenes section 37 is guilty of 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) an offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to a 
fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding two years, or to both; or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) an indictable offence and liable to a fine not exceeding 
$2,000,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, 
or to both. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this is a warning to those thinking of diverting goods 
from their ultimate destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments will be very brief.  As I already said at the very 
beginning of my speech, Bill S-25 cannot be praised for its 
great clarity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked the powers of the Minister of Public Works 
and Government Services to be more clearly defined in relation 
to those of the Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also have liked the minister's powers to be a bit more 
limited, less discretionary and less conducive to unfairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, the tightening of controls on the middlemen in the 
import and export of these arms would seem to us to be 
appropriate. The penalties for offences become serious, where 
before they were merely symbolic.  I think that this will also 
be a valid measure that we will approve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important, because importing sophisticated weapons 
requires that middlemen be above any tampering. In future, 
however, bills having to do with national defence ought to be 
much clearer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these reservations, we are prepared to support in good 
faith the procedure for rapid passage of this bill, given the 
particular political circumstances in which we find ourselves. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to rise today to address Bill 
S-25, an act to amend the Defence Production Act.  At the outset 
I would reiterate a point made earlier by a colleague that we 
have some concern about this bill originating from the other 
place rather than coming through the House, with its duly elected 
representatives, and then moving on to the other place, which is 
normally the process.  That aside, the NDP will be supporting the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give a bit of background information on the bill for 
the sake of the people watching and listening to this debate. The 
bill is an attempt to establish a new regime for regulating 
access to certain controlled military goods or goods with a 
military application.  Persons involved in this kind of work 
would have to be registered by the minister or be exempt from 
registration under the regulations in order to have access to 
such goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-25 seeks to address a situation that emerged when the 
United States revoked Canada's special exemption from U.S. arms 
control regulations.  The bill reflects a new Canada-U.S. 
agreement on co-ordinated legislative measures to strengthen 
control over trade in defence related goods and technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically speaking Canada had been exempt from many of the 
provisions of the U.S. international trade in arms regulations, 
known as ITAR.  Permits for the export of defence goods and 
services from the U.S. to Canada traditionally have not been 
required except for a small category of particularly sensitive 
goods and technologies, including those pertaining to nuclear 
weapons, strategic delivery systems, nuclear propulsion systems 
and submarines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most defence technology and unclassified technical data from the 
U.S. could be exchanged freely between the U.S. and Canadian 
governments and private sectors.  As a result, Canadian and U.S. 
defence industries have operated more or less as a single market 
since World War II.  Many U.S. companies established subsidiaries 
in Canada.  Companies on both sides of the border frequently bid 
on contracts in the other country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 12, 1999, the U.S. state department made unilateral 
changes to ITAR that significantly narrowed Canada's 
exemption from the licensing of U.S. origin defence goods and 
services.  Until that time Canada was the only country granted an 
exemption under all but 5 of the 19 categories of goods and 
services covered by ITAR.  The changes required Canadian 
companies to obtain export licences for 11 of 19 categories, 
effectively ending the special treatment for the Canadian defence 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the U.S. government the new measures were necessary 
because of U.S. companies misusing the Canada exemptions and 
concerns regarding the effectiveness of Canadian export controls. 
The Canadian government denied that Washington's concerns were 
justified.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the procedural impediments, additions to ITAR caused 
restricted access to technological data based on citizenship. 
This is a very important one.  Let us take note of what was 
happening here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only personnel holding Canadian or U.S. citizenship to the 
exclusion of other nationalities could have access to the 
information or technology in question.  The U.S. does not 
recognize dual citizenship.  However, many Canadian high 
technology firms employ foreign born specialists because of the 
skill shortages in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, our Canadian human rights laws, including the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, would preclude government 
restrictions on the hiring of such persons purely on the basis of 
nationality or country of origin.  We certainly would have 
concerns about that restriction being placed on any relationship 
between the United States and Canada with respect to defence 
production and the goods and services involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 8, 1999, a Canada-U.S. agreement in principle was 
announced.  It recognized a shared commitment by both governments 
to protect against illegal retransfers of controlled goods and 
technology from North America and to maintain a strong, 
integrated North American defence industrial base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. provided assurance that it was prepared to reinstate 
many of the Canadian exemptions and enhance others if Canada 
harmonized its export control list with the U.S. munitions list 
and if Canada strengthened controls on these items within Canada 
and introduced appropriate legal sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 2000 cabinet agreed to the establishment of a 
strengthened transfer and access control system for certain 
controlled goods and technologies.  It directed the Department of 
Justice to begin drafting the legislative and regulatory 
framework conditional on a successful conclusion to bilateral 
negotiations.  On June 16, 2000, the two governments resolved any 
outstanding issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new agreement the U.S. agreed to reinstate most of the 
pre-April 1999 Canadian exemptions on the transfer of most U.S. 
origin unclassified defence goods to Canadians, including to 
Canadians of dual nationality and permanent residents with third 
country nationality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its part Canada agreed to establish a new regime that would 
require persons having access to controlled goods to be 
registered with Public Works and Government Services or to 
qualify for an exemption from registration as set out in the 
regulations.  The new access control provisions include 
significant penalties for breaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what Bill S-25 is all about.  It is a system of 
regulation and legislation that sets forth conditions to better 
control the export and re-export of defence goods and technology, 
particularly those of U.S. origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this legislation, by virtue of proposed section 36, the 
new regime would not apply to most Canadian public sector 
employees when acting in good faith in the course of their 
employment duties or to any member of a class of persons to be 
prescribed in the regulations.  Proposed section 37 would make it 
an offence for a non-registered and non-exempt person to 
knowingly examine or possess controlled goods or to transfer 
controlled goods to another person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that representatives from the affected industries 
in Canada, in particular the Aerospace Industries Association of 
Canada, have spoken out in favour of quick passage of Bill S-25 
and the implementation of a new agreement between the U.S. and 
Canada to ensure continued Canadian access to the U.S. defence 
market and related technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have indicated that we will be supporting the 
legislation, I want to make it clear that we are supporting the 
legislation because we recognize that certain aspects of defence 
production have spinoff effects beyond simple defence 
applications, such as various satellite communications, rockets, 
aircraft engines and navigational, gyroscopic, chemical and 
biological applications.  Quite often in the research and 
development around these items there is a spinoff benefit that 
goes beyond a military application.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to add another dimension to this debate.  While we 
support the legislation, I have grave concerns that when we look 
at the whole issue of defence production and the production of 
goods geared toward defence we sometimes are talking about 
nuclear weapons and other systems of mass destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there is a lot of money in the defence industry. Earlier 
an hon. member on the other side of the House talked about the 
importance of defence production to business and the economy in 
Canada and thus the importance of good relations.  I sometimes 
become very concerned that we might allow our concern about 
business and economy to overshadow the need to work hard toward a 
peaceful society that does not engage in guns and arms and the 
production of those types of goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It disturbs me to read in the paper or to see on television a 
boy of 12 years old being shielded by his father's arms to avoid 
bullets and in the end being shot dead because of the conflict 
between two nations.  There is so much of this happening 
worldwide.  There is so much conflict, destruction and death.  A 
lot of it is tied into and enabled by the arms involved.  That 
boy did not die because someone was handling a toy.  It was a 
deadly weapon.  It was probably from some arms trade or part of 
defence production in some way or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much of this is happening around the world.  We have to 
concentrate on building a society that looks at all the money 
spent on defence production, that big industry found worldwide, 
and on asking ourselves what kinds of things that money could do if 
we applied it to help the homeless who sleep outside, without any 
shelter overhead.  How much good would that money do if we 
applied it to child poverty, which is a curse in our society but 
has existed for so long and continues to exist?  How much good 
would that money do if we applied it to training and other 
programs to help the unemployed?  How much good would it do if we 
applied it to our aboriginal communities, which quite often have 
a lower social and economic status than the rest of our 
communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of money involved in the arms trade and the 
defence industry.  I am in no way taking away from the fact that 
every country must have an adequately resourced military to 
protect its borders and engage in domestic activities to assist 
its citizens.  I am saying, however, that sometimes we allow the 
economic interests associated with some of these industries to 
overshadow and overpower the need to get to the human and social 
concerns within our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make that point strongly because I think it quite often gets 
lost in the midst of debate.  We want things to go smoothly so 
that we can have greater trade, greater economic stability, and 
more money flowing in.  However, what is happening with all the 
money flowing in?  Where is it going? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read a piece in the paper a couple of days ago, probably 
the plane when I was coming here, about the fact that the term 
millionaire no longer means what it meant 30 or 40 years ago. If 
one was a millionaire then one was a member of an exclusive club. 
Now more and more people, numbering in the thousands, can claim 
to be millionaires, a lot of them at a very young age.  The 
article also mentioned that there are 300 billionaires in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at where that concentration of wealth is going. 
Much wealth and prosperity exists today but remains concentrated 
in the hands of a few.  A lot of that wealth comes from such 
things as defence production industries and various other 
industries where the money flows through big corporate interests 
from one country to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arms are getting into the hands of children and women.  I talked 
to the Eritrean ambassador last night.  She told me something I 
was unaware of.  A large number of the Eritrean soldiers fighting 
in the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia were women.  I asked 
specifically if there were any child soldiers involved and was 
told no, they protect their children.  However, women are 
fighting on the frontlines, laying down their lives in a conflict 
between nations.  What are they using?  They are using guns and 
arms off which someone has made money.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise it here in the House because we are elected people.  We 
are elected to represent our constituents.  We are elected with a 
responsibility to try to build a better society, to try to do 
something to elevate ourselves beyond the realm of the killing 
and fighting we see day by day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good part of that will come about if we start to look honestly 
at some of the things involved which we take for granted as being 
a natural part of our economy.  We can have a thriving economy 
but we can have an economy that is based on things other than 
weapons of destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make that point even though we are supporting the legislation 
to enable a smoother relationship between Canada and the U.S.  It 
is better to have some controls around this kind of technology 
rather than no controls at all.  I really would implore us to 
work for the day when the ultimate goal will be that we put less 
emphasis on the production of arms and weapons of destruction and 
things that kill people and more emphasis on the kinds of things 
that breathe life into our society and give our society a sense 
of purpose, meaning, and a true sense of destiny.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be very brief.  We are not allergic to a bill from the other 
place.  I would like to pay tribute to the work done by our 
party's team in the other place, which worked very hard on this 
important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things have been said about it.  I would like to provide a 
brief historical overview. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discussions were held prior to World War II, but later, in 
the mid 1940s, the U.S. and Canada decided to have a free 
trade zone for arms in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not really an economic free trade zone.  It was more the 
whole American and North American continental defence strategy. 
It was a far cry from the free trade agreement signed by the 
Conservative government and developed, I have to admit, by the 
Liberal government.  I have to admit that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the United States wanted to combine continental 
forces.  Canada, in the north, was politically stable.  In terms 
of the continental defence strategy, with Russia being so close, 
the Americans could ask certain favours of Canada, and would do 
some in return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arms industry was allowed to freely cross the border because 
it was exempted more readily than was the case for other 
countries, and this arrangement benefited Canada's economy. 
Canadian know how, which was developing at that point—they talk 
about the Avro Arrow, which the Diefenbaker government 
unfortunately dropped—could have benefited the Americans as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, Canada's technological efforts would have benefited 
the States before others, because there was a trading market. 
It was advantageous.  It did change.  Canada and the U.S. 
are special trading partners in a number of areas, but that 
started before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in 1999 the States said “Whoops.  We are starting to have 
some problems, including security problems”.  I would remind 
hon. members that it is not just with weapons, but also with 
immigration.  Last year, a bill had to be passed for Canada to 
keep illegal immigrants wanting to enter the U.S. through 
Canada.  Because the Americans do not want them, the legal 
responsibility is ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we did them a favour, in return for which we got Canadian 
visitors over the U.S. border quickly.  That was part of the 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In connection with Bill S-25, I wish to point out the 
contribution of the Canadian ambassador to the United States, 
the good lobbying by Canadian industry, and the excellent 
historical co-operation between the two countries, which have 
made it possible to design a bill and to convince the U.S. 
authorities that we would do what had to be done as far as 
security was concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the Americans are going to be pleased with this, 
as will our industry, because Canada has developed enormously 
since World War II as far as technology is concerned.

good work.  I also want to congratulate the minister responsible 
and the government for co-operating with the other parties in 
order to protect thousands of jobs in Canada.

have a question.  It was coincidental perhaps that as my 
colleague was speaking I was reading an excerpt from the press 
that says “Canada gets duty free zones” and talks about Liberal 
MPs supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of my own province of Newfoundland, we are the most 
easterly point in the country, the nearest point of entry into 
Europe from the western side.  We see what is happening in 
Ireland because of their geographic location, even though it is 
not necessarily duty free.  Does the member think that the 
creation of free trade zones would benefit specifically a place 
so strategically geographically located as the province of 
Newfoundland? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, my answer is yes.  The people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador are used to working in their corner of 
the country, to coming up with solutions and original ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Newfoundland says, I am sure that we can do 
so with government support.  Will the arrival of a new minister 
from Newfoundland help?  I suspect so, but that said, the people of 
Newfoundland must reap the benefit of these programs, just like 
the people of all the other provinces of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why a regional spirit, the spirit of helping the 
provinces, must be maintained at all cost, contrary to what the 
Canadian Alliance members say. 
We must keep the tools to ensure that in all of Canada's 
regions, from St. John's, Newfoundland, to Vancouver, by way of 
Quebec and Ontario, wealth may be spread around with the tools 
that belong to the elected representatives of the provinces and 
the people of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland is a province of the future, I firmly believe.

Mr. Speaker, I hope to be very brief with my comments, but I 
would like to make a connection here between an issue that I have 
consistently been bringing to the House, that is, the issue of 
Canada's national security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill comes about as a very direct result of the 
lack of attention that the government and its predecessor have 
paid to the issue of national security in Canada.  It is a 
concern to the people of the United States, to the people 
responsible for the defence industry of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember this.  Whether we like it or not, the fact 
of the matter is that in Canada we have the ability to have 
expenditures of many types on many things where we basically do 
not have to put out the money for the defence we are getting from 
the country to the south of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people of course have their own vested interest.  We act 
as a buffer.  We recognize to a certain extent that we are the 
meat in the sandwich between them and other people who would 
be adversaries to them.  They do have their own vested interest, 
but the fact of the matter is that we as Canadians have the 
ability to have a defence budget significantly smaller than we 
would need if we did not have the level of co-operation we have 
with the people in the United States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, they have a very legitimate concern and interest in 
the transfer of technology, information and intelligence.  Even 
within the confines of the lower 48 states, the United States has 
seen many of its facilities ending up being compromised by people 
who have come into its own territory.  As it tried to bring that 
into focus and regain control of that, the United States 
naturally took a look at the sources of these malevolent forces 
coming toward it.  Many of those sources were coming through a 
very porous 49th parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must pay far more attention to the entire issue of national 
security.  Interestingly, this issue of intelligence gathering 
and management has everything in the world to do with the 
difficulties that this nation and indeed many nations around the 
world are having with respect to organized crime and the fact 
that in many instances terrorism is bought and paid for by the 
proceeds of organized crime.  Organized criminals and terrorists 
have the ability to go across boundaries literally at the speed 
of light, at the flick of a computer switch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular agreement, which came about, I believe, in good 
faith between our nation and the nation of the United States, is 
a good example of how when we come across a problem we can work 
together and work our way around the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The necessity of this legislation is due to our charter of 
rights and freedoms.  The necessity of this legislation is due to 
the way in which our country is configured and the way in which 
we welcome immigrants to our country to be part of this great 
nation of Canada.  As we give those immigrants opportunities 
within our society and as they in turn help to construct our 
society, to build our society and to add to our intellectual 
wealth and the quality and fabric of our society, these people 
are building our society.  At the same time, because of the 
concerns that the defence industry was having in the United 
States, it felt that this was a step away from its ability to be 
able to control people who would have access to its very highly 
valued, highly confidential secret information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus had the opportunity, through the good auspices of our 
defence critic, to have two or three meetings with the defence 
industry while this was coming to resolution.  I thank the 
member, but I also thank the defence industry for taking the time 
and interest to inform us and our caucus as to what was going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the industry came to us, it was made very evident that there 
must be a connection.  There must be a management of information 
among the solicitor general, who would be responsible for CSIS 
and the RCMP, immigration, foreign affairs, industry and 
foreign trade.  All of these and more of our departments must do 
a far better job of sharing and managing information and 
intelligence as it is being gathered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that between the two nations we have arrived 
at this bill, at this accommodation.  As I say, it shows goodwill 
between the two nations, which bodes well for the future. 
However, I say to the government, we must pay attention to the 
fact that we had to do this bill in the first place.  The reason 
we had to do this bill is that the government unfortunately is 
not paying anywhere near the attention that it should be to the 
issue of information gathering and management in Canada for the 
sake of our national security. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I really appreciate the comments by my hon. colleague who 
said so much about the management and control of information.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of public works shall have the right, authority and 
responsibility to identify people and give certificates to them 
so that they have access to information on the goods and 
technology involved in the defence industry.  These people must 
then ensure that the provisions of the act are met, and there 
will be an inspection process as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member comment on the significance of the 
minister's authority respecting the control of information? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is part of what I have 
been speaking about.  At the moment I would say that we have a 
tremendous number of chimneys of information, a vertical flow of 
information from the information or intelligence gathering, up 
through to the top, where the top is concerned about the 
management of the vertical flow of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that the government is undertaking, on behalf 
of the people of Canada through this law, a process that requires 
more than a vertical chimney of information.  We do not have any 
effective way of creating it at this point, but we must create a 
horizontal pipeline of information.  In other words, there could 
very well be information that the minister of public works should 
have in his possession that is resident in a department adjacent 
to the public works ministry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That information, which could very well turn the tide as to 
whether he would certify an individual for access, could be 
sitting in the department literally right next door to the 
minister and the public works ministry could be unaware of that 
information.  That is what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of this act because it achieves the mutual 
objectives between our two countries, but my colleague, the 
critic for public works, and I are trying to drive home to the 
minister that because we can have intelligence in an adjacent 
ministry of which the public works ministry is unaware, he could 
indeed end up certifying people who perhaps should not be 
certified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within this government or the successor government, whether it 
is the Liberals, the Alliance or whoever forms the next 
government, the ability within government to access and manage 
intelligence sharing on a horizontal basis between departments 
must be created so that when the public works ministry, as in 
this case, makes a determination that a person is worthy of a 
certificate it will be making that determination on more than a 
simple rubber stamping.  It will be making it based on the very 
best information and intelligence available.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>INFORMATION COMMISSIONER—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is ready to give a 
decision on the question of privilege raised earlier today by the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough alleging 
interference with an officer of parliament, namely the 
information commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough noted, 
yesterday Mr. Speaker tabled the 1999-2000 annual report of the 
information commissioner.  In his report the information 
commissioner complained about the actions of the federal 
government, and in particular the Privy Council Office and the 
Treasury Board Secretariat, contending that these departments had 
challenged his powers and denied him resources to carry out his 
duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough argued that this 
interference constituted a contempt of the House and he called 
upon the Chair to rule it a prima facie case of privilege with 
the concomitant results. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to say that the Chair attaches considerable 
importance to the concerns expressed by the member.  I also wish 
to thank the Leader of the Opposition in the House, the member 
for Fraser Valley, the Leader of the Bloc Quebecois in the 
House, the member for Roberval, the Leader of the Government in 
the House, the member for Winnipeg—Transcona, the member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill, and the member for 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot for their comments on this 
matter.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I> makes it very 
clear at page 67: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the House also claims the right to punish, as a contempt, any 
action which...tends to obstruct or impede the House in the 
performance of its functions; obstructs or impedes any Member or 
Officer of the House in the discharge of their duties; or is an 
offence against the authority or dignity of the House, such as 
disobedience of its legitimate commands or libels upon itself, 
its Members or its Officers. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair must judge whether the complaints raised in the most 
unequivocal terms by the commissioner in his annual report 
constitute such an obstruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be little doubt that the information commissioner 
presents a colourful and impassioned case for the principle of 
access to information.  He recalls that his very first annual 
report to parliament set as his objective a policy of zero 
tolerance for government recalcitrance in complying with freedom 
of information legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this second report the commissioner notes that he has refused 
to retreat from this zero tolerance policy and he rails at the 
resistance his office has continued to encounter in carrying out 
its work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite his unforgiving assessment of the situation and his 
blunt annoyance, the commissioner concludes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some heartening evidence that his game plan is working. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair can well understand members' reaction to the cri du 
coeur of the information commissioner, especially in the opening 
section of the report entitled “Access—A Right Under Siege” 
and the title “Mayday—Mayday”, but the very fact that the 
report is couched in such bold language and takes such a strong 
position is in my view evidence that the commissioner has not 
been impeded in carrying out his work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may be frustrated by the attitudes he has encountered in the 
senior echelons of government.  He may even be outraged that the 
government does not take his mandate as seriously as he evidently 
does, but the fact that he voices those frustrations in no 
uncertain terms does not, in the view of the Chair, provide 
evidence of a prima facie case of contempt, especially when he is 
able to present his report unimpeded and obviously in his own 
words. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members also know that the enabling statute, the Access to 
Information Act, gives the commissioner various recourses when 
he is dissatisfied with a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the annual report is permanently referred to the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.  When examining 
the report, this committee will be able to consider the concerns 
expressed by members with respect to these issues. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee can hear the information commissioner and his 
officials.  It can call before it some of those mentioned in the 
report as less than fully co-operative and if as a result of this 
study the committee concludes from the evidence that the report 
does not merely document the frustrations of the commissioner but 
points to a climate of systematic obstruction, then the committee 
can report its findings to the House and ask the House to take 
appropriate action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rumours abound of a possible dissolution.  However, the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights has this permanent 
reference and a new committee in a new parliament may proceed, as 
the current one may do, and study this issue at its leisure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly in this particular case I find that there are 
various recourses immediately available to the information 
commissioner and to all hon. members.  I therefore cannot find 
that a prima facie case of contempt has occurred.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like once again to thank the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for drawing the commissioner's 
views and his own concerns to the attention of the House.  Like 
him, I look forward to the work of the justice committee on these 
important questions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to tell the House that, with respect to the request 
by the hon. member for Roberval for an emergency debate this 
evening, the Chair has decided that such a request is not in 
order at this time.  It does not meet the requirements of the 
Standing Orders. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I will take time to review your ruling in some detail 
when I see it in print. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point of order that I raised during that period was 
about the tabling of the report and when it was available to all 
parliamentarians.  I believe you said it was a problem of 
miscommunication between the commissioner and the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if you could explain that because I am not sure what 
miscommunication means.  It was tabled in the House.  It should 
be available to members.  I do not know whom I should point the 
finger at.  I am not pointing it at the government.  I am 
wondering what went wrong there because that information, once 
tabled here, should be available immediately, as I understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not want to tie the Chair down 
to an answer on this because I think we are looking into what 
exactly transpired, but the best information I can provide the 
hon. member with at this time is that the report was sent to the 
Speaker with the request that it be tabled at a particular time. 
The additional copies were sent to the distribution office with 
an embargo until another time later than the time requested for 
tabling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears the document got tabled at a time when the 
distribution office was not expecting to distribute the document, 
so when members contacted the office and asked for copies they were denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked that this matter be investigated.  I do not 
understand why there would have been two times but I understand 
there were.  I can report that far to the hon. member at this 
stage.  I believe I am correct in what I have stated, without 
being more precise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member would be happy to raise this matter with 
me in private.  I would be more than happy to do whatever we can 
to see that this situation does not continue in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an unsatisfactory way to proceed, in my view, and I 
sympathize with the position the hon. member was placed in, but I 
stress it was a matter of communication between the office of the 
Speaker, the table officers of the House and the information 
commissioner's office, and I believe two messages came from the 
latter.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA HEALTH CARE, EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER 
SOCIAL SERVICES FUNDING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK228">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-45, an 
act respecting the provision of increased funding for health care 
services, medical equipment, health information and 
communications technologies, early childhood development and 
other social services and to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to resume my speech on this important 
bill, a bill, as has been noted several times today, that is 
fully supported by the Canadian Alliance, although we do think 
improvements could have been made in this health accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health accord does re-establish some of the money that was 
cut by the Liberal government over the last several years from 
the health care system.  What it does not do is enshrine the 
health accord in the Canada Health Act itself so that stable, 
long term, five year funding is available for the provinces in 
order to plan their work and work their plan.  That is a weakness 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that we have now passed two bills today in 
their entirety.  When there is not a lot of controversy about a 
bill and it is in the best interests of the country we want to be 
co-operative.  We have already had a fair bit of discussion about 
this bill and we were given time to contact the people affected. 
All those things are possible.  We passed two bills today that I 
hope will get royal assent before the week is out.  It is nice to 
see that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that business should continue to go ahead.  However, 
this health accord, which should also go ahead, will be 
interrupted almost certainly by an election call on Sunday. We 
see an awful lot of crocodile tears on the Liberal side.  We hear 
them saying “We have to approve this bill in all stages this 
afternoon or else basically it will not go anywhere”, or, 
“Desperate measures are required”, or, “We have to interrupt 
the rules of parliament.  We cannot follow the rules of 
parliament”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is desperation in the health care system, it has been 
caused by the government.  Any desperation on the funding side 
has been caused by the cuts from the federal Liberal government. 
In its efforts to restore that, efforts that we approve of, it says 
we have to suspend the rules of parliament and pass all 
stages today or else the walls will come tumbling down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will get passed.  It will go through a proper 
examination in committee where we can talk about it.  Would it 
not be nice to talk to the Canadian Medical Association for a 
minute about this?   Would it not be nice to make sure that the 
way the money is going to be distributed is in the best interests 
of everyone in all provinces?  Of course it would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is going to spend a good part of the campaign 
suggesting that unless it can suspend the rules of the House and 
pass it all today in all stages the end is near.  Nobody is 
going to buy that argument.  Everyone sees what is happening 
here.  An election is coming and the government would like to 
have all the legislation disposed of in a couple of minutes here 
in the House as if the House does not matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just talk about what the government is going to leave on 
the table.  It will leave the health accord unfinished.  We have 
said that we are prepared to come back next week and the week 
after and get at it.  We want to do this properly and get it 
passed by Christmas but the government is going to call an 
election and suspend that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about some of the other things the government has left? 
What about the Financial Institutions Act?  The banks have been 
looking for Bill C-38.  The banks, the credit unions, the 
provinces, the consumers and other financial institutions want to 
modernize the Financial Institutions Act.  We are ready to go 
with it.  Let us debate it and get it passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not going to happen.  It will get lost.  The banks will 
be told “You are going to deal in an increasingly globalized 
financial world but you have to stick with the rules from the 
last century and that is just too bad”.  That is too bad for the 
banks, the credit unions and the consumers, but it certainly is 
not because the opposition is not willing to get on with 
business.  We want to get on with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the changes to the Young Offenders Act?  That bill 
was brought in as Bill C-68 in the first session of parliament. 
After prorogation, it was renamed Bill C-3.  It has been kicking 
around this place for years and it will die because the 
government cannot get its legislative act together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone know how many bills have actually received royal 
assent during this fall session?  I have the list here:  one 
bill.  The government feels that it might get another one passed 
so it might end up with two bills for the whole fall session. 
This health accord is certainly not one of them.  The government 
could have brought it back the first day and we could have had a 
good debate on it.  We could have gone right to work on it, but 
no, the government has been fiddling around with this, that and 
the other thing, with no idea of where it wants the country to go 
and no idea where it wants the legislative package to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if the government wants to get all the legislation out 
on the table and pretend it has all been passed so that when it 
calls the election on Sunday it can say that it has addressed the 
Young Offenders Act and that the financial institutions have been 
looked after.  Tomorrow it will give a mini-budget that will 
finally give the tax relief it has always promised. The 
government has not done it for seven years, but it will be talked 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some more bills here.  The international boundary waters 
legislation deals with the movement of bulk water sales.  We 
support that bill.  Let us bring it in and pass it next week.  We 
will not because government members just want to talk about it. 
They pretend to work at the business of Canada.  They pretend to 
care about these issues.  They pretend to care about the health 
accord.  However, when it comes right down to it, what do they 
do?  They are all talk and no action.  A title from the 
information commissioner's lament about the government is that it 
is all talk and no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going into an election without an act to amend the 
criminal code, dealing with cruelty to animals, disarming peace 
officers and so on.  That bill is not going to come before the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the bill respecting marine liability, something that 
affects our shipping industry?  We support that bill.  Let us get 
at it today, tomorrow or the next day.  Let us have it in the 
House for debate.  We are not going to get to pass that 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about changes to the immigration system?  The Liberals have 
been talking about it but it is not going to come.  They talk and 
talk but no legislative bill ever makes it through the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the shipping and navigation bill?  How about 
something as basic as the criminal code changes dealing with 
harassment, home invasion and the miscarriage of justice?  We are 
ready.  Let us bring that bill into the House today, tomorrow or 
the next day, sometime soon.  Let us deal with home invasions 
because it is a big problem on the west coast.  We want that law 
toughened up.  We were to support that bill but we will not have 
the chance because it will be left on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many bills have been passed this fall?  How many have 
received royal assent?  One bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has brought a lot of bills.  How about changes 
to the employment insurance system?  That was a priority of the 
government.  It brought in changes to the employment insurance 
system but it was not serious about that.  It should properly be 
renamed “my hope to improve my chances in a certain region of 
Canada act”.  The government has no intention of passing that 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government bring in Mr. Tobin to be the minister? 
Why did it go to the other place and pick a senator, an unelected 
official, to sit in here as the minister from Nova Scotia?   This 
is not about the issues or the legislation.  It is all about the 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the Eldorado nuclear limited reorganization act?  It 
is housekeeping bill but we could pass that quickly.  We could 
get on to business.  Next week would be perfect.  We could do it 
in a few days and it would be all over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could deal with the tax courts or with Bill C-43 which deals 
with income tax.  Those are important.  Let us deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about an act to establish a foundation to fund sustainable 
development technology?  We  could have a debate in the House on 
that legislation but, no, the government will not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the Manitoba claims settlement legislation?  We could 
finish that up.  The citizenship of Canada act legislation is 
something that the Liberals could talk about for a while.  They 
will talk about it.  They have tabled all this legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If one could get elected on tabling, this government would win 
in a landslide.  It has tabled everything but does not want to 
pass any of it.  It is not about passing legislation.  It is not 
about a vision for the future.  It is about putting little 
tidbits out there hoping that enough interest groups will think 
the government is serious about the talk so that when the 
election comes the government can say that it is really serious 
about the sales tax and excise tax amendments.  One might then 
say “Really?  The government must have brought it to the House 
early and championed it hard”.  The government would say “No, 
we just just tabled it”.  It can claim 100% in tabling.  If 
tabling were a university course these guys would get grade A in 
tabling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not passing this list of legislation.  They are only 
interested in the election.  That is why, when the government 
shuffled the cabinet the other day—oh, was that just this 
morning?  I thought I saw it being foreshadowed for several days 
in advance.   When the government finally shuffled the cabinet, 
when the famous deck chairs were shuffled, what did it do?  I 
actually watched it on TV.  The government had four people sworn 
into cabinet.  Two of them have not even been elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is Mr. Tobin the best idea for industry minister that Canada 
ever had?  It is not about that.  Who cares about that?  That is 
what the Liberals say.  It is not about picking the best elected 
member of parliament to take that position.  It is not even about 
expanding the gene pool, because that gene pool has been well 
worked over.  It is a genetically modified Liberal gene pool. 
The Liberals all come out like cookie cutters.  They do what they 
are told and they get a job like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the one outspoken member of cabinet, the 
guy we could at least count on to have a bit of backbone on 
occasion, is gone.  The former veterans affairs minister is no 
longer with us, as they say in the funeral business.  He has 
gone, not to the other place but to somewhere by the windows down 
there never to be heard from again.  Why?  Because an unelected 
person just took his place.  In the vernacular, he is now sucking 
slough water while someone else is slurping at the trough.  That 
is just what has happened.  It is all about the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill on implementing the health accord that we are debating 
today does three-quarters of what the government should have 
done.  Of course it should not ever have cut the funding to the 
extent it did to begin with, but at least the bill restores it. 
It is like kissing your sister:  it's a kiss but it ain't 
everything it's cracked up to be.  It is a little bit, so we will 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of playing around with parliament like this, here is 
what would be a pleasure.  I look forward to this, because in the 
byelection of our leader for the Canadian Alliance I was at a 
public meeting and one of the big cheers he got—and he has had 
many and he will get many more—occurred when he stood up and 
said that if he was elected prime minister it would be a 
pleasure, a week after the election at the press conference, to 
stand up and say “The next federal election will be held on 
October 30 of 2004”, whatever Monday that might be, four years 
from now.  Then we would not have to go through this charade of 
tabling endless amounts of legislation for political showmanship 
and brinkmanship, which the government is practising today, the 
brinkmanship of “do as I say or else” something terrible will 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be nicer for the government to say “We have a 
legislative package to go through but another six months to do it 
in, so you can plan your life around that because these are the 
bills that are important to our vision for Canada. We hope you 
agree.  If you do not, let us have a reasonable debate about it, 
let us pass the good stuff, amend the bad stuff and defeat the 
poor stuff, but you can count on it”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be four years to get through the business of the 
House.  The next party conventions could be planned around it. 
The Canadian people could make their election plans around it. 
Political activists who want to take time off work, and there are 
a few like that, would find it good too.  The House would not be 
stuck in the position in which we find ourselves today, with a 
whole package of stuff, of legislative initiatives, some good, 
some bad and some correcting past wrongs like the bill we are 
talking about today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At least then we will have it done in a structured way with a 
game plan and a House of Commons plan laid out for all Canadians. 
They will not have to come here three working days before the 
election call and say “If you do not give us everything we want, 
then it is the end of health care as we know it”.  That is what 
they are going to say in the days to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a lousy way to run the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a better way it would be to have a legislative package that 
the government is serious about, that spells out the vision for 
the country and that we have adequate time to deal with in the 
House of Commons.  It would be like this:  take it, win some, 
lose some, have some free votes on some things, and at the end of 
the day on a certain day four years from now the government would 
go to the electorate and say “Judge the record, this is the 
package that was completed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A half baked, half finished legislative calendar, like I have a 
list of here, is not the way to be serious about dealing with 
Canada's business.  This is a lousy half measure, introduced in a 
poor, ad hoc way that is not indicative of good government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will change and it will change when the Canadian Alliance 
forms the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during the hon. member's comments he referred to the incoming new 
minister from Newfoundland and the outgoing minister from 
Newfoundland.  I wonder if he would tell us what he thinks of a 
government who sends to the far corners of this House a minister 
who always looked after the people of Newfoundland and brings in 
somebody who has always looked after himself.  What does it say 
about a government that would do something like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it says quite a bit and 
most of what it says is not too complimentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to say, however, that the former minister of veterans 
affairs is not exactly as pure as the driven snow either.  A week 
or so ago he was promising $10 million to move some jobs from one 
part of the country into his riding.  This is the very sort of 
thing that we have been on about all day during question period, 
that is, it is the wrong way to run a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say this about the former veterans affairs minister, I 
think he is right.  When necessary, and it happened throughout 
his career from time to time, he stood up to the government and 
said the way things should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the health accord, as an example, it would be far better to 
have people on all sides of the House speak their minds in a way 
that moves the agenda forward rather than doing what they are 
doing over there today, which is political brinkmanship.  They 
are going to say, and I heard it today from the Prime Minister 
during question period, “If you do not pass this thing in all 
stages today, then you are against health care”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government would do everything we asked them to do today, 
we would have tax relief, parliamentary reform, a justice system 
that worked and equality for aboriginals.  On and on it would go. 
If the Prime Minister would do everything we asked for today, I 
guess we would be further down the road, but we would have a 
Canadian Alliance government if that happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not expect that he is going to do that.  What the Prime 
Minister is doing today is trying to paint a picture for the 
upcoming campaign.  He is going to hang his head in sorrow at one 
of these press conferences and say “Woe is me.  I could not get 
it through the House of Commons because I asked everyone else to 
suspend the rules of the House of Commons to get something 
through and they said that we should play by the rules”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are asking for is that the government play by the rules. 
Let us get this thing done, but we can finish it next week. There 
is no panic about it.  Everybody knows it will go ahead.  We are 
all going to support it.  I hope that today it will at least get 
through second reading.  There is no reason we cannot finish this 
bill and finish it easily next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we get to the 
next questioner, for a moment I did not realize what bill we were 
on.  This is Bill C-45, the health bill, so it would not be a bad 
idea to once in a while touch on the content of the bill, 
particularly in questions and comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for the member for Fraser 
Valley, within the context of health care spending, while other 
countries are using their taxation policy as a lever for economic 
growth, our current government is content with the status quo. 
The status quo gives Canada the dubious distinction of having the 
highest personal income tax rate in the seven most industrialized 
countries and the second highest corporate taxes in the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Liberal government's spending priorities do not rank 
any better.  In fact, its own pollster, Pollara, revealed that in 
a recent survey of 5,300 Canadians, 73% of those polled thought 
the government was spending on the wrong priorities.  We 
certainly have to look at the fact that without the EI surplus 
there would be a deficit of $6.8 billion in both 1999-2000 and 
2000-01.  It is about misplaced priorities:  wise health care 
funding versus the current Liberal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health care bill is before us today.  We must realize that 
any budget surplus comes not from the government but at the 
expense of overtaxed Canadians.  What should we be doing here 
instead of rushing this kind of spending bill through the House 
at the last minute, at the dying end of parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is all about 
priorities. When we talk about balancing the budget, it is balancing the 
budget at what level of taxation?  That is a good debate to have. 
We could have it here in the House.  Maybe it will start tomorrow 
when the minister makes his statement.  He is going to say that 
revenues are higher than expected so Liberals are going to find 
ways to spend it.  It is the old story.  The government takes our 
money.  We send our money to Ottawa, the government deducts 50% 
for handling and then spends it on pork-barrel projects we never 
asked for.  That is the government's idea of management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have said is that government has a legitimate role but 
it should be majoring in the majors, such as health care funding, 
research and development, higher education and certainly 
encouraging common education throughout the provinces as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to note the comments of the member when he 
talked about the EI surplus.  On the EI surplus there was just a 
little thing the government passed the other day, the tricky 
dicky move of the week.  The government passed a little order on 
the government side that said the EI surplus belongs to the 
government, that EI surplus the EI commissioner says should be 
given back to the workers and the employers who contributed to 
the EI plan in benefits and in reduced rates of levies against 
employers, that combination.  Instead the government says that it 
has just changed the rules and that it now owns the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just gone.  The surplus just went into never-never land. 
To be used where?  We will find out about some of it from the 
finance minister tomorrow.  Tomorrow the finance minister will 
tell us that he has extra money.  Some of it will be from the EI 
surplus.  It is interesting how the government says that all this 
extra money from the high level of taxation has given it a 
surplus.  The government says it will give us back a little of it 
in tax relief but then it has a whole bunch of government 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget the health accord, because the government is 
going to mention the health accord in every other breath for the 
rest of time, I would say, as if it is new money.  The government 
has that health accord but is forgetting to mention that the 
taxation level of personal income tax in Canada is the highest in 
the G-7. Have a nice day.  I wonder why 65,000 Canadians left 
Canada last year primarily for the United States and a fairer tax 
regime. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague read out a 
number of bills that the government has introduced but has done 
nothing about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my hon. colleague if he is aware of the 
various advertising programs that the government has gone through 
in the last three months, namely, a little booklet that went out 
to all seniors telling them about all the wonderful things the 
Liberal government has done.  I wonder whether or not some of the 
tabled bills that have not been passed and have not gone through 
the system have been alluded to in that little booklet.  I wonder 
also about the cost of that little booklet.  I am also wondering 
about the cost of the $8 million ad campaign telling Canadians 
how wonderful the government is for solving the health care 
problems that it created.  Are these costs also incurred through 
this multi-list of tabled bills that the government has put 
forth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if we will 
ever know the costs in this parliament because of course those 
costs will no doubt be picked up by the auditor general in the 
next parliament.  I expect that in the next parliament the 
auditor general is going to say that he has reviewed the spending 
bulge that took place during the pre-election period and that the 
advertising budget of the federal government suddenly had a giant 
need to communicate to Canadians in the month and a half 
preceding the federal election. 
It was practically a cosmic force that forced the Liberals to 
spend $8 million to advertise the Canada health accord that has 
not yet passed the House of Commons.  However, that never stops 
the government.  It spent $8 million to tell Canadians what we 
all read in the newspaper.  It is all couched in terms that the 
government loves us and the government is here to help us.  It is 
one of those things that no one really believes.

people got in the mail telling them about the 1-800 number they 
could phone if they had a problem with the government, because the 
government loved them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would expect that in the next parliament the auditor general 
will talk not just about the March madness, which is the spending 
that occurs every March when the government departments all have 
to feather their nests, but he will also talk about the little 
spending splurge of millions of dollars that the advertising 
department of the federal Government of Canada spent telling 
Canadians what they already knew from newspaper reports.  That 
will be a shame.  That money should have been spent on health 
care, education and research. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-45, the 
bill dealing with health care funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would ratify and implement the deal between the 
provinces and the federal government.  We respect the fact that 
the provinces did reach an agreement with the federal government 
to increase funding and we support that.  The Canadian Alliance 
supports increasing funding for health care, but we do not 
pretend that will solve the problem with health care.  We do not 
believe that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just because we support the bill does not mean that we will just 
let it pass all in one day.  The Prime Minister in question 
period today said that if the bill did not pass by Friday, 
because the opposition wanted to talk about it or maybe some 
government MPs wanted to talk about it, then we were against 
health care.  That is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members and government members want to speak on the 
bill because we have things we want to say on health care.  We 
want to make the point that more money will not completely solve 
the problem.  We want to make the point that the amount of money 
the government has agreed to put back into health care through 
the legislation and through its agreement with the provinces will 
not restore health funding by the amount it has cut over the last 
few years.  It is absolutely absurd for the Prime Minister to say 
that if we do not agree with the bill and if we do not pass it 
immediately then we are against health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the Prime Minister of a few facts about the 
legislation.  One fact is that a bill of this magnitude has 
received less than six hours of debate in the House.  Yet the 
Prime Minister said that if we did not pass it today we were 
against health care.  The Prime Minister really does not 
understand the democratic process.  He does not understand that 
the House is a place for debate.  This House is a place where we 
should bring out different views on issues, especially on 
important issues like health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debate on the bill was first called for on October 5.  This was 
less than three and a half years into the government's mandate. 
The government has been in place for seven years.  Yet the Prime 
Minister said if we did not let this pass we were against health 
care.  We will tell that to Canadians.  That is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is asking for the members of the House to break 
the rules of the House.  That is what he called for in question 
period today. 
That is not right.  We should have time to talk about the bill. 
We should not just pass it on through.  We should give Canadians 
a chance to know what this piece of legislation is about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is about ratifying the provincial-federal 
agreement on health care.  It is about returning only part of the 
funding that the government reduced over its seven year mandate. 
It is not as wonderful a thing as the government makes it out to 
be.  There is no increase in funding.  This only returns part of 
the funding that the government cut over the past few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that mean we will hold up this legislation?  Absolutely 
not.  In fact, as far as I am concerned we can allow this to pass 
second reading in the next few minutes and get on to the rest of 
the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason that we cannot pass this bill over the next 
few weeks.  We do not want to hold it up.  We respect the fact 
that the provinces have reached an agreement with the federal 
government.  The legislation would ratify the agreement so that 
the money could be paid out, but we are looking for proper debate 
on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that the Prime Minister said that if we did not 
agree to pass this legislation immediately we were somehow 
against health care.  If we look at the government's legislative 
calendar for the next three weeks, Bill C-45 is not even on the 
legislative calendar.  That is the level of priority the Prime 
Minister gives to this piece of legislation.  If the Prime 
Minister feels that the bill is important, as I think it is, and 
wants the bill to be dealt with in a quick fashion, then he 
should talk to the House leader and get him to put it on the 
legislative calendar as a top priority item.  He has not done 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we are here to talk about ratifying this deal.  Does the 
Canadian Alliance support passing Bill C-45?  Yes, we do.  We 
believe that restoring some of the funding which the Liberals cut 
from the provinces to fund health care is the right thing to do. 
We say they should restore all of the funding that they cut from 
the provinces over the past seven years of their mandate. We say 
this deal is not good enough.  We say it is only a start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we form the government it will only be a start.  We will 
not only focus on funding, we will focus on actual solutions to 
the problems in health care.  We respect the jurisdiction of the 
provinces in health care. Under the Canadian constitution the 
provinces have jurisdiction over health care.  We also respect 
the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in question period, the Leader of the Opposition 
said “Let us add a sixth pillar to the Canada Health Act”. 
That pillar would be guaranteed funding for the provinces.  The 
provinces could then rely on getting a certain level of funding 
committed to and guaranteed by the federal government so that the 
federal government could not decide some time in the future to 
cut back, slash and burn health care funding.  That is what the 
Liberals have done over the past seven years.  We want a sixth 
pillar to health care which says we will guarantee funding over 
the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many Canadians know that when medicare was first agreed to 
back in the 1960s, the level of funding of the federal government 
was more than 50%?  The provinces signed onto the deal because 
the federal government was committed to this level of funding. 
Have successive Liberal and Conservative governments respected 
that commitment?  No, they have not.  Now the federal government 
only funds somewhere around 13% of the cost of health care.  It 
has absolutely reneged on the deal that a Liberal government 
committed to back in the sixties.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals reneged on the deal that the Liberal government 
committed to in the sixties.  They reneged on the commitment to 
the Canadian people and to the premiers of the provinces back 
when the provinces agreed to publicly fund health care.  That is 
just not right.  That is why the Leader of the Opposition today 
stood in the House and said “Let us put that sixth pillar of 
health care in place”, and that would be— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to interrupt my 
friend's comments on health care but I think he made a serious 
error in saying that only 13% was covered by the federal 
government.  Surely his notes must be incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That was a sneaky 
point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I respect the comment of 
the hon. member from the New Democratic Party.  He is absolutely 
right.  In fact the level is not 13%.  It is only 11% right now. 
It will be 13% if this bill passes and if that funding is 
actually put in place.  I am sure that is what the member was 
referring to.  I was using rough figures and I know the reality 
is even worse than the picture I had painted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was really not a point of order and I appreciate your 
decision on that, Mr. Speaker.  I will try to get back to my 
presentation now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance really does respect provincial 
jurisdiction.  We think that when the provinces come up with an 
idea within the Canada Health Act that will improve health care 
they should be listened to.  I think every province probably has 
an idea that it can implement in its own province that will 
improve our health care system.  I do not think the federal 
government has all the good ideas when it comes to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear a lot of heckling from across the floor.  It truly is the 
arrogance showing through, with the Prime Minister, in his 
arrogance, saying “This is our bill and you should just pass 
it”.  We saw that in question period.  Now we see the members 
across the floor showing their arrogance and not even allowing us 
to make our points on the issue.  What they are saying in effect 
is that they have all the answers, that they are right, that they 
may have slashed health care funding over the last seven years 
but what they want to do now is to restore part of that, and that 
they are heroes for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan:</B>  What the member has dribbled over the 
airwaves is nonsense.  It is arrogance.  He has no respect for 
the Canadian people if he believes that they are going to believe 
what he put out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  The hon. member across the floor 
really ought to listen a little.  He could learn something.  It 
is really quite difficult for me to make my presentation with 
that kind of interference from across the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This arrogance flows way beyond this piece of legislation.  Let 
us talk a little about the Prime Minister's record— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Would you ask the member for Lakeland whether it is his intention 
to not allow the bill to proceed and to not allow the bill to be 
presented by this Friday to the other chamber so that we can 
reflect the will of the premiers and the Prime Minister as they 
have indicated in the agreement of September? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That also is not a 
point of order but it was an interesting way to get a point of 
view injected into the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is that kind of 
arrogance that we have seen from the government for some time 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stands and says “If you are not going to pass this by Friday 
then you are just not doing the right thing”.  Why Friday?  I 
think we ought to talk about this.  We ought to have the debate 
on it.  We could probably get this through the House in the next 
two or three weeks.  I do not see a problem.  Certainly that is 
not my intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this kind of rhetoric coming from across the House and this 
kind of interference, I do want to point out the Prime Minister's 
record in the House.  It goes beyond the bill and beyond the 
member saying that if we do not pass it quickly we are against 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what the Prime Minister has done.  What did he do 
on Bill C-68, the gun bill?  We had somewhere over a dozen 
Liberal MPs whose constituents told them to vote against the gun 
bill.  They were going to do that and some did at the earlier 
reading.  However, when it came to third reading what did the 
Prime Minister say?  I will never forget what he said.  He was 
in Atlantic Canada somewhere.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Prime Minister say?  He said “If you dare vote 
against our bill, even if your constituents want you to, we will 
punish you.  I will not sign your nomination papers the next 
time if you want to run in the next election”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that sound like a democratic Prime Minister?  No, that is 
not democracy.  It is that kind of arrogance we have seen over 
the past five years.  It is just not right.  We will not sit here 
and take this kind of arrogance, these anti-democratic feelings 
and expressions of the Prime Minister, and just let them go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the GST, the member for York South—Weston said “You ought to 
respect the promise you made in the 1993 election to eliminate 
the GST”.  That is what the Liberals promised.  The Prime 
Minister himself said on several occasions that he would get rid 
of the GST.  Probably that helped him win that election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it came time to do something about it, the member for York 
South—Weston in talking about it asked what happened.  He was 
kicked out of the party.  He is sitting as an independent now. 
That is the way the democratic process works in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In question and comment period another member mentioned the 
advertisements that are on television right now.  They are funded 
by taxpayers, not by members of the Liberal Party.  They are 
trying to say how wonderful their record on health care is when 
in fact it is dismal.  It is disgusting that they would use 
taxpayer money to fund partisan ads saying what a great job they 
are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brochures they sent out to seniors were disgusting.  That is 
not the democratic process working properly.  That is not an 
acceptable expenditure of taxpayer money.  We will not stand by 
and allow these kinds of things to happen without raising them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of Bill C-45, my colleagues and I are certainly willing 
to let it go through quite quickly at second reading.  We will 
get on to committee stage and third reading stage.  Let us see 
what we can do to have proper debate on it and make sure that it 
is implemented properly.  That is all we ask. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to raise a couple of issues about Bill C-45 
with my colleague from the Alliance Party.  Let me preface my 
comments by saying that I had expected by now we would be at work 
during committee of the whole trying to improve the piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So anxious was I that I almost amended the wrong piece of 
legislation.  It had been our understanding that we would be 
using this afternoon to consider the bill clause by clause to 
improve it as much as possible within the limitations imposed 
upon us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the concerns of my colleagues with respect to the haste 
with which the matter has been put before us and the lack of 
opportunity to have a comprehensive debate.  Certainly it is a 
very disappointing situation when we have had so little 
opportunity to debate health care in the House to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all understand that the legislation which implements the 
September 11 deal at the first ministers level is a small step in 
the right direction.  Certainly there has been an indication to 
all of us that the first ministers across the country would like 
to see this step taken so that we can get on with the further 
work required to improve our health care system.  Being uncertain 
about the time-line available to us, it is important for us to 
put that on record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Alliance have clearly expressed their concerns 
about the bill.  They have a platform document that does not go 
much beyond what the Liberals have presented, which is a base of 
$18.7 billion for health care.  Certainly it is hardly 
commensurate to the task at hand and needs to be addressed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, would members of the Alliance consider supporting our 
efforts to try to amend the bill so that at least the base level 
of funding moves beyond the $15.5 billion outlined in Bill C-45? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would they work with us to ensure that the increase in transfer 
payments allocated through the bill is at least added to the 
base so that by the year 2005, when the agreement is over, the 
base would have been raised to $21 billion?  This would provide 
us an increase in baseline funding and ensure greater 
responsibility on the part of the federal government for the 
overall burden of health care costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the amendment I was hoping to propose today.  I am not 
sure if I will have an opportunity in the near future to discuss 
this in committee of the whole, but I would like to know, given 
the previous Alliance policy statements and presentation of the 
issues during this debate, if it would agree to support us in 
advancing this improvement to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, just to answer the hon. 
member very directly, we would certainly support that.  The 
Canadian Alliance and the Reform Party before it called for 
increased funding to health care in every election platform we 
have ever run under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is important, we do not think that spending will 
solve the problem of health care.  We have to find some new and 
innovative ways to improve the system, to allow the provinces to 
do that and not stand in their way at every opportunity.  It is 
unfortunate the member is one of the people who has stood in the 
way of new ideas for improving health care along with the 
government.  That really does not lead to making things better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of her question on whether we would support their 
amendment, we do support it.  It is something for which we have 
been calling.  Let us go beyond that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been sitting here 
listening to this debate.  Members on the opposite side talk 
about the need to debate the bill, but I have not heard any 
substantive issues debated or any problems, proposals or 
constructive suggestions for the bill.  It has been rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg North Centre talked about her amendment 
which does not call for any additional cash compared with what is 
in the bill in front of us.  The member for Lakeland agrees to 
support that.  It provides no additional cash from what is in the 
bill as it stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from being on television, on CPAC and whatever, what are 
their motivations?  While Canadians are waiting for a billion 
dollars in a medical equipment fund that could buy needed medical 
equipment if the bill were passed, members opposite discuss 
abstract innuendo and rhetoric.  I have not heard one significant 
critique of the bill, not one decent suggestion, not one 
substantive issue raised about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to the member for Lakeland. If he is so concerned 
about the bill, I ask him to give us one constructive suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, talk about crocodile 
tears.  If the member had done his homework he would know that 
this amendment would increase funding beyond what is in the 
current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member wonders why he has not heard points of useful debate. 
It is because he has been too busy talking to listen.  He is 
still talking rather than listening.  If he would listen to what 
we are saying he would hear some points which are worth bringing 
out, which do add to the debate, and which will help inform 
Canadians about what is going on here and about what we are 
considering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government came to office in 1993, federal funding to 
the provinces for health care was $17.5 billion a year.  It 
gutted that so that in 1994 it cut funding to $14.5 billion a 
year with the plan it implemented.  That is what his government 
did.  Where has he been for the last seven years?

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If and when the legislation passes it will return the funding 
level to $15.5 billion a year.  That is all it does.  It does not 
even increase it to the level of funding when the government took 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has the nerve to say that what we are proposing will not 
increase spending from what they are proposing.  That is not 
true.  That is not accurate.  I would ask the member to do his 
homework in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have just a brief comment.  When the member talks about not 
listening, one of the main reasons we are moving so aggressively 
on the bill is that the vast majority of Canadians told us to 
forget our political alliances and get this thing done, get it 
fixed.  The member is also forgetting that tax points were 
transferred to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me close with saying why we want to move the bill forward. 
We are concerned about their position.  The member from Calgary, 
the finance critic, stated unequivocally that he supported 
private health care.  Their current leader, while a member of the 
provincial government, advocated private health care.  As long as 
we are in government that will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, where has the member 
been throughout this debate?  Why have there been no Liberals 
speaking in this debate, or very few, until just now when 
something they do not like to hear tweaks them?  The Canadian 
public is being told facts that they do not like to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The absolute fact is that since 1993 the government has cut $36 
billion in health funding.  The fact is that this deal returns 
only $23 billion of that amount.  Why are these members not 
standing up in the House and talking about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about tax points.  Why has he not been standing 
in the House explaining what these tax points are?  I would 
certainly welcome him doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the House ready 
for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The question is on 
the motion.  Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 18 consideration of the motion and of 
the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise in the House today to speak in support of my 
colleague's Motion No. 155 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should work 
towards incorporating a measure of proportional representation in 
the federal electoral system, making use of a framework which 
includes:  <I>(a)</I> a report on proportional representation 
prepared by an all-party committee after extensive public 
hearings; <I>(b)</I> a referendum to be held on this issue where 
the question shall be whether electors favour replacing the 
present system with a system proposed by the committee as 
concurred in by the House; and <I>(c)</I> the referendum may be 
held either before or at the same time as the next general 
election. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate my colleague, the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle, for bringing this issue forward.  The member 
has been a champion both of reforming democracy and of bringing a 
measure of democracy before the House ever since he first became 
a member I believe more than 20 years ago.  I want to say that it 
is this kind of outstanding work by one member of parliament that 
is a measure of what a person can do in the House and what can be 
accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it sometimes has been rather a lonely battle to take on 
this issue.  I congratulate the member for having the strength 
and motivation to keep plugging away at the issue of making sure 
our democratic system is more representative and fair.  It is an 
issue that perhaps Canadians do not fully understand, but when I 
talk to my constituents in East Vancouver and to other electors, 
I really understand that people feel alienated and very far 
removed from the political system.  We only have to look at 
federal election results and voter turnout to see what happens in 
terms of people's alienation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It used to be that when a federal election was called, 80% of 
those eligible to vote would actually go out and vote.  That 
number has dropped.  I believe in the last federal election it 
was down to about 67% or 69%.  In my own constituency of 
Vancouver East it went even slightly below the national average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are today, in the House, poised to deal with the issue 
of proportional representation and days away from an expected 
federal election call on whatever issue the Prime Minister has 
dreamed up he wants to campaign on, when the very issue of 
democracy and fair representation has not been taken up by the 
government.  I welcome the opportunity, days before what we 
expect to be an election call, to actually debate this issue. 
Hats off to the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle for having the 
strength to bring forward and never give up on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to explain to Canadian voters what proportional 
representation is all about.  Basically it is making sure 
representation in the House of Commons is proportional to the 
number of votes a party actually wins. 
That is the basic premise and that is the principle on which we 
are advancing this motion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it really means is that if a political party wins, say, 38% 
of the vote, which in actual fact is what the governing party did 
win, it would get only about 38% of the seats in the House of 
Commons.  That is not what our experience is today.  When we see 
what our system really does produce it is really quite 
astounding.  I think it reinforces people's cynicism about the 
political system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like hon. members to look at the numbers.  In the last 
federal election the Reform Party got 19% of the vote and so did 
the Conservative Party.  However, because of our system of 
basically first past the post, the Conservative Party got 19 
seats and became the fifth party.  The Reform Party, still based 
on the same kind of support within the Canadian electorate, got 
60 seats and became the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the other two political parties, the Bloc Quebecois 
and the NDP each got approximately 11% of the vote in the last 
federal election.  What was produced in the House was 
astoundingly different.  The Bloc Quebecois got 44 seats in the 
House and the NDP got 21 seats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians understand but they may not have thought it 
through in terms of the actual formula used.  It begs the 
question is this what democracy is about?  Is this what 
representation means?  To the hon. member who said yes, that is 
what it is about, I say he is dead wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at every other developed country in the western world 
there is some proportional representation.  Judy Rebick, a 
well-known commentator on CBC, wrote in her column in May 2000, 
when this motion was first introduced, that Canada is probably the 
least democratic country in the developed world when it comes to 
elections.  Democracy is defined in the dictionary as majority 
rule, and yet in all of Canadian history only two federal 
governments have actually won a majority of votes.  I agree with 
her view.  We are way overdue for a political debate on this 
issue.  Astoundingly it has not been debated for over 75 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I came to the House as a newly elected member of parliament 
I had strong ideals, which I still have, about working for my 
constituents and making a difference in this place.  I am sure 
all 301 members of parliament feel that way.  However, when we 
look at the system under which we operate and see how it is 
systemically designed to reinforce establishment party rule, I 
really think we have to challenge that status quo.  We have to 
say to ourselves and to Canadians that if we believe in democracy 
and true representation of what people are actually voting, we 
must have the courage to stand and change that system and move to 
a system of proportional representation where people can ensure 
that every vote counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely what the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle has 
designed this motion to do, to ensure that the voices of 
Canadians, no matter where they are in the country, are actually 
reflected in the House of Commons representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion actually talks about establishing an all party 
committee.  I suggest that this is a very important element.  My 
entire last community householder addressed the idea in “It's 
About Democracy”.  I talked about voting, the importance of the 
right to vote, and how in many places people have died for the 
right to vote.  I actually included a whole section on 
proportional representation to get people's feedback. 
I have been amazed by the interest and the feedback from people 
who say they want to know more about it and how they can make 
sure it happens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are days away from an election based on the old established 
rules.  As a consequence most people will be silent.  Their votes 
will not be counted in a truly representational way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House we have the opportunity to say we are 
willing to look at this issue, to make our parliament democratic 
and to make our voting system democratic.  The 75 years of 
silence on this issue, other than the work our hon. member has 
done, is far too long to wait for true democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members of the House to support the motion.  At 
least let us have a good debate on it to see what kind of support 
there is from the public, because I think it is there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I make the observation at the beginning 
that the reason why this has not been debated in the last 75 
years is that the debate concluded 75 years ago with the 
conclusion that proportional representation is not anywhere near 
as democratic or efficient for democratic societies as what we do 
have in Canada, which is the first past the post constituency 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I observe that the three most powerful democracies in the world, 
the three most efficient democracies in the world, the three 
democracies of which at least two of them have the greatest land 
masses in the world, have the simple plurality system that we 
inherited from the British parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we compare proportional representation around the world, the 
majority of countries that have that type of system, which 
basically involves a party leader being able to name people to 
seats based on the percentage of votes his parties received, we 
will find by and large that the countries whose democracies work 
most inefficiently and with the greatest amount of difficulty are 
those that have proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reason for this.  There is a very clear reason. 
Proportional representation is great in theory but terrible in 
practice.  The reason is that in the end it so slices up the 
result of an election that very rarely do we have anything but a 
minority government and too often we have a situation where not 
only do we have a minority government but the balance of power is 
controlled by a very few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that Israel, which is currently in the news right 
now, is a classic case of proportional representation.  What 
happens is that a legislative assembly or a parliament is 
fractured among many parties.  What constantly happens is that no 
single party can get enough of the seats by proportional 
representation, percentage of the vote, to form a government.  In 
the end, very small parties, often parties with very extremist 
agendas, form the balance of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think one of the barriers to peace in the Middle East, to some 
extent, has been the fact that successive Israeli governments have 
had a great deal of difficulty advancing agendas for peace when 
they have had very small splinter parties, which they are 
dependent upon to remain in power, that are very reluctant to 
advance the peace process, as the current government of Mr. Barak. 
I find he made a superb effort, but we do realize that he had to 
come to some very difficult alliances to even bring the peace 
process as far as it has gone now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us leave Israel.  We can go around the world and find 
countries such as Italy and many others in which proportional 
representation has led to successive governments that are 
extraordinarily weak and have constant elections. 
It is bad enough to have an election in less than four years 
around this place, but some of these countries with proportional 
representation have elections about every year, if not every six 
months.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate my point I do come prepared.  I do have an example 
that should strike great interest.  It is the results of the 1997 
election when the Liberals did form the government.  It was a 
very narrow majority.  In fact the Liberal government only 
received 38.5% of the popular vote but obtained 51.5% out of 301 
seats in the House.  So a government was formed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mover of the motion would find that unacceptable.  Let us 
just consider what would have happened had we had proportional 
representation instead of the by constituency voting mechanism 
that we have inherited from the British parliamentary system. 
Here is what would have happened.  I have a note here somewhere 
that I made.  Had it been proportional representation in this 
parliament based on the 1997 election, two alliances would have 
formed based on the percentage of seats they would have obtained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us suppose that one of those alliances would have been the 
Liberals and the NDP.  The Liberals obtained 38.5% of the popular 
vote.  The NDP received 11%, for a grand total of 49.5% 
entitlement for the number of seats.  In other words, had the 
seats reflected the popular vote, then the Liberal and NDP 
coalition would have been entitled to only 49.5% of those seats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly we had the natural alliance formed around the Canadian 
Alliance, the Bloc Quebecois and the Conservatives.  The figures 
are 18.8%, 19.4% and 10.7%, for a grand total of 48.9%.  Of the 
five major parties in the House, neither natural alliance would 
have been able to form a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where would the balance of the seats come from?  There were 
three independents.  In fact if the seats had been awarded 
according to the percentage of popular vote, enormous power would 
have been given to the two independent MPs who were sitting in 
this House.  They would have had it in their power to determine 
whether it would be a government based on NDP-Liberal values or a 
government based on the more conservative or the more 
decentralizing philosophy that characterizes the Bloc, the Reform 
Party and the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is unacceptable.  A country cannot be run when that kind of 
power is given to so few.  What we have in our system is not 
fair, in the most literal sense, but it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is talk about democracy we do not simply talk about 
what is fair or what seems good on paper.  We have to talk about 
what is good for the country and what is good for Canadians. What 
is necessary in any democracy is that we have a reasonable 
succession of governments that are able actually to carry out a 
mandate, if not for five years or four years, at least for three 
and a half years.  In a system where there are two MPs holding 
299 MPs to ransom, governments will rise and fall every six 
months, as indeed they do around the world with countries with 
this kind of problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another major problem with proportional representation 
which strikes near and dear to my heart.  One of the problems is 
that in our current system the reason why there is a skew in the 
percentage votes is that if I win in my riding and another person 
wins in another riding I may win by 30%, 40% or 50%.  It depends. 
Nevertheless I win in my riding and I come to the House 
representing the people in my constituency.  It makes it very 
difficult for the Prime Minister or any party leader.  If I come 
to the House I am not only here because of my party leader, 
I am also here because of the support I have received regionally 
in my constituency from my own electors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the proportional representation system there are no 
constituencies, not usually.  In the majority of them there are 
no constituencies.  What happens is that once the party leader, 
as in the case in Israel and so many other countries, gets the 
percentage of the vote, he determines who takes his place in 
parliament.  The difficulty is that means the party leader can 
hold his politicians together with an iron fist, whereas the 
reality here is that the Prime Minister has to be on a certain 
amount of good behaviour around here because he cannot easily 
fire backbench MPs like me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that he can dismiss people from cabinet but he 
cannot dismiss people from their House of Commons seats.  If he 
does, he may do it at his peril because—and the hon. member for 
York South—Weston is a good case in point—the leader may 
dismiss but the voters may return that person as an independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that I find most appalling about the very thought of 
proportional representation is that in that kind of parliament I would 
not survive 10 minutes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when I was at university, we had a debate on proportional 
representation in Canada and we had trouble finding people 
capable of justifying it within the system in which we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian parliamentary system, with all of its history, 
cannot be improved merely by introducing a new way of voting. 
What absolutely needs to be changed is the entire way the 
municipalities, the provinces and the federal government operate, 
and that cannot be done solely at the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the New Democratic Party's talk of pure proportional 
representation. Among my professors here in Ottawa, and they were 
fairly leftward leaning, there was not a one who talked about 
pure proportionality.  Technically, it is impossible to apply. 
Many impressive works have been written on this; I have looked up 
my old reading list.  There are some very good books on 
proportional representation and a pure proportional system can 
never be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recall that some decades ago a number of provincial 
governments, a number of provincial parties, including our 
friends in the New Democratic Party and the Parti Quebecois, 
proposed proportional representation.  I will not address the 
Parti Quebecois, but rather the NDP.  Some provinces are governed 
by the NDP. 
There are medium and large municipalities that are governed 
by parties that are more or less left wing. I have not seen any 
example of proportional representation. That simply does not 
exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other major problem with this private member's bill is that 
the Senate is completely overlooked. They do not want to talk 
about the Senate. It is like our friends from the Canadian 
Alliance who do not want to talk about the sovereignists in the 
House. They vote against motions because these motions are 
presented by sovereignists. There is respect for democracy, but 
that is another issue. The Senate is important. A few years ago, 
some discussions took place and some proposals were made about 
proportional representation for the provinces in the Senate. The 
Senate has a historical role that is not, of course, truly 
fulfilled. It must represent the territories, the larger 
territories such as the provinces, and the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of appointing friends as senators, we could use a system 
based on proportional representation to choose them. For 
example, the Canadian Alliance Party, the Bloc Quebecois and all 
the other parties could be represented in the Senate. Without 
really changing the role of the Senate, each province would 
submit a list of names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one solution but, here again, we are talking about lists 
and when we talk about lists it is as though we were 
undemocratic. What the NDP member told us earlier is that 
proportional is equivalent to democratic. It is not true because 
it is up to one person, the party leader, to decide whose name 
will be on the list. For example, in a riding, assuming we were 
to keep the same structure, if I lost the election it would mean 
that a clear majority, in a perfect system of proportional 
representation, had rejected me, their representative. 
That is not democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1990s, when the number of seats in the House was 
increased to represent Canada's demographic growth, there was 
talk of having a percentage, 250 members, for example, elected in 
the present system, and the remainder, some 50 members, elected 
proportionally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, with such a high risk of a minority government, and 
the set rules in the House of Commons on political party 
recognition—a minimum of 12 members of a party must be elected 
for the party to be officially recognized—the rule of a 
proportional vote could not be used. For example, if six members 
of the Green Party were elected, they would not have official 
status in the House. 
This is another problem of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of proportional representation must really be 
examined as a whole.  First, there must be the assurance that 
the representative elected in a given region carries some 
weight, carries some of the political will of his community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of proportional representation, could we talk of a 
second ballot?  Instead of proportional representation here in 
the House, each riding could hold a second ballot.  That means 
that every member would have to have 50% of the votes plus one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would still be the risk of government inefficiency, 
because the strength of Canada and the provincial governments 
lies in the fact that when government is elected and given a 
mandate for a certain period, and more often than not in the 
case of a majority government, the government has a majority to 
give it the time to introduce bills, to take major decisions and 
to reach difficult decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could a second ballot or proportional representation not be used 
in the case of the committees?  Perhaps.  It is done.  In that 
case, there is no list, but rather an ongoing system of 
appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly improvement is necessary.  I say this often.  It is like 
the Canadian constitution.  The constitution is not just a 
couple of pieces of paper we stick in a drawer or display in a 
museum. 
The Canadian constitution has a daily and real impact on the 
life of every citizen, except that we do not have to modernize 
it because people do not want to talk about the constitution. 
There is no wish for a weekend constitutional conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the country evolves, if people move with the times, perhaps 
this piece of paper should be updated as well.  Naturally, this 
includes the role of MPs.  It includes the way in which these 
men and women are elected.  This automatically brings us to the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People want to abolish the Senate.  Why?  Because they say it is 
ineffective.  Someone was telling me that two houses were better 
than one.  In that case, the Senate must be given a role. 
Perhaps it could perform the role assigned it by the 
constitution, which also provides certain protections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the constitution, Quebec is given special status through its 
number of representatives in the Senate.  This is important. 
What would proportional representation mean for the people of 
Quebec?  What effect would it have on the francophones of the 
country?  This has to be considered.   We are still a minority 
and will have to keep fighting to preserve our language.  That 
is where the Senate comes in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the House, I must admit that we lost out a bit.  In the 
constitution, Quebec has 75 seats, except that there is no 
section providing for an increase in that number, as Quebec did 
not then have the right of veto that it has in the Senate.  With 
every passing decade, Quebec is losing political clout because 
it is losing ground demographically.  Before anything is done 
about the little constitutional protection Quebec still has, 
there will need to be a constitutional conference in a lovely 
building surrounded by water and guarded by the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are therefore major constitutional changes and we need to 
think of present and future minorities.  We must think about the 
role of the ridings, the role of the provinces and the role of 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this motion is asking us to do is to discuss things.  That 
would be fun, but the motion does not go far enough.  There is 
no mention of the Senate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is conceivable that everyone could be elected by proportional 
representation and that there would still be an appointed 
Senate. Senators would be appointed by a government that would 
not be able to stay in power for more than six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system is not built that way.  It is, first of all, a 
two-party system.  There is a party in power and there is the 
opposition.  This has been the third time in Canadian history 
that the opposition has been comprised of three or four parties. 
It certainly will not be the last.  In our system, like that of 
Great Britain, the United States, like many major countries, if 
one really wants to talk about better representation, 
proportional representation cannot be applied to Canada at 
present.  It is impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I say yes to virtue, but also to realism. I invite hon. members 
to look at what goes on internally. First of all, how can 
improvements be made in the other place?  We could put in place 
certain improvements to the Senate without changing the 
constitution, because people want nothing to do with that. 
Unfortunately, it is a question of once burned, twice shy, 
particularly in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put in place measures that will improve the Senate, let 
us ensure provincial and territorial representation, and then 
later on improvements can be made to what goes on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle is challenging the House and 
the government to make use of proportional representation.  What 
I would invite him to do is to first meet with the provincial 
NDP governments.  He might have more luck convincing his NDP 
brother than his Liberal distant cousin.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour for me to participate in this important debate on an 
aspect of our electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks will begin with some observations on Canada's 
electoral system and tradition, then comment on the experiences 
of other countries and point out some considerations we should 
bear in mind on this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's electoral system is a model for democracies around the 
world.  It is a well functioning system with a long history that 
Canadians support.  Indeed, other countries have sought out our 
expertise in designing their electoral systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, Canadians elect members of parliament through a 
first past the post, single member constituency system derived 
from the British electoral system.  The first past the post 
system encourages pre-election consensus building within parties 
so they might present broad platforms to appeal to the majority 
of voters.  This also means that each of the 301 federal ridings 
is represented by the one candidate who receives the most votes 
in an election.  That means that individual Canadians at the 
local level can elect an MP and have someone from their area who 
they can identify and contact on issues of importance to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a tested election system that has provided us 
with strength in terms of stability and consensus building as 
well as local representation for individual Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has also been debate on the reform of the existing system. 
There has been little broad based public debate on possible 
changes to our electoral system.  Most of it has centred on the 
possibility of a directly elected Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1979 the Pépin-Robarts task force on Canadian unity proposed 
that 60 supplementary seats be added to the House of Commons and 
that these seats be allocated to parties in proportion to their 
share of the popular vote.  In the early 1980s the Quebec 
government considered and in the end rejected a regionally based 
proportional representation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, the MacDonald commission in 1985 and the 
Beaudoin-Dobbie committee in 1992 recommended that members of the 
Senate, but not those of the House of Commons, be elected by 
proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A system based on proportional representation in Canada would 
likely result in more minority governments, would make 
post-election coalition building a major step in forming a 
government, could give marginal parties disproportionate 
influence on national policies, and could exacerbate regional 
tensions by making it more difficult to build national consensus 
among all Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such fundamental change in the electoral system would require 
broad public debate and public support and possibly a 
constitutional amendment, which I will comment on in a few 
moments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now consider other countries' experiences.  A number of 
foreign countries have incorporated proportional representation 
into their electoral systems.  Several points are important to 
note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is a wide range of possibilities for proceeding 
with proportional representation.  Second, other countries' 
experiences vary.  For some, proportional representation has been 
costly and divisive, and in some cases, abandoned.  Some of the 
advantages of proportional representation cited by its advocates 
include higher voter turnout, more voter choice and more diverse 
representation, with more women and minorities in the legislature 
and in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a closer examination of the facts shows that these 
advantages are in fact not as clear-cut in actual practice. 
Indeed, proportional representation can be a complicated and 
costly system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have to take a look at constitutional considerations. 
Canada's constitutional provisions must be considered when 
assessing possible changes toward greater proportional 
representation.  First, the constitution, sections 37 and 55, 
requires that provinces be proportionately represented in the 
House of Commons.  Second, the Canadian tradition of one member 
representing one geographically defined constituency would 
probably be hard to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any major public debate on changes to the electoral system which 
considers a greater degree of proportional representation could 
be expected to open up many other issues including:  the question 
of representation of aboriginal peoples; distribution of seats, 
by province, by region, and urban versus rural; Senate reform; 
and roles, responsibilities and accountability of MPs elected 
from a party list.  These issues suggest that a constitutional 
change might be required to proceed with proportional 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I want you to know, for me particularly, that I am 
very concerned about the distribution of seats by region, urban 
versus rural.  We should be well aware of the fact that it is 
important that our rural areas in Canada are well represented in 
the House of Commons, as they are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particularly in a province like Ontario it is very important 
that we continue to have diversified representation, that we 
continue to recognize the different issues in northern Ontario 
and in southwestern Ontario, the different issues that we have in 
urban centres versus rural centres, and the different issues in 
Burlington, as the member has just pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every area has different issues and every area needs to have 
someone there who can respond to those issues, represent those 
issues, bring them to a national consensus and bring them to an 
area where we can work together to resolve these issues and 
define what they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be tremendous public debate on that very issue.  I 
do not know how we would resolve it to the satisfaction of a 
minority of people who need representation.  We cannot allow them 
to not be represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to look at the importance of provincial 
representation and provinces, the distribution of seats and why 
and how the constitution was written, why certain guarantees were 
made, and we have to encourage development in those areas where 
they may not have large populations, such as the Atlantic 
provinces.  We need to encourage and ensure that those provinces 
grow economically and grow in population.  It is important that 
we look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at other countries' experiences, it just does not 
hold up.  One of the advocates says that it includes higher voter 
turnout, more voter choice and more diverse representation of 
women and minorities, but the facts say that is not happening. 
There are not those clear cut examples.  They are not there in 
reality.  In fact, it is a more expensive system.  We have to 
look at what is working well in Canada, at why it is working well 
and at why would we want to change from what we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an opportunity after every national census to make 
representations on the boundaries of each riding and to discuss 
what should be included and what should not.  Sometimes members 
of parliament themselves will go forward to make suggestions that 
would make their area larger or that would give their boundaries 
a higher population because they recognize that there are 
communities or centres of communities that need to be connected 
and need to be together. 
They need to be represented in a way that reflects the way in 
which they live and work together.  We cannot just put a line 
down the middle of a community and expect them not to be insulted 
by that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we continue to talk about and debate the 
system but it is important that we continue to have 
representation.  I thank the hon. member for raising this issue. 
I know it was raised during the procedure and house affairs 
committee's consideration of election issues.   I believe it 
would be premature of the House to pronounce itself on an issue 
as complex and far reaching as proportional representation or to 
have a national referendum on it at this point in time.  I am 
therefore calling upon all hon. members to oppose this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would thank you for your wonderful job as Speaker in the House 
of Commons over these past few years.  I have very much enjoyed 
having you in the chair and having the opportunity to work with 
you.

very kind words. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to stand in the House of Commons to speak on the 
issue of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle for bringing 
forward this initiative.  Frankly I am surprised.  He has been 
reading our book.  Is that not incredible? If one looks at the 
75 principles on which our party was founded and the principles 
that now give us direction on how to represent our constituents 
in this wonderful House of Commons, one will read, in item 74 of 
those 75 guiding principles, the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To improve the representative nature of our electoral system, we 
will consider electoral reforms, including proportional 
representation, the single transferable ballot, electronic 
voting, and fixed election dates, and will submit such options to 
voters in a nationwide referendum. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is really a closet Canadian Alliance member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  My motion came before your book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  The hon. member claims that his motion came 
before our book.  I rather doubt that.  This happened quite a 
while ago.  This is very similar to policies to which I have 
aspired ever since I was first elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is democracy?  That really is the question here.  To me 
democracy is that system whereby we reflect, in the rules of our 
country, the will of the majority of the people as much as 
possible.  There are times when that is not possible.  Sometimes 
the majority of people simply do not like something when in fact 
it is a necessity.  However, in a true democracy, if we come up 
to those kinds of situations I believe we need to be able to 
persuade the Canadian people, based on sound argument, that the 
measure is supportable.  I have observed in my short lifetime 
that in those countries where a majority of the governed do not 
support the decisions made by their government the society 
usually deteriorates.  We see sometimes total chaos in those 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have in Canada?  Do we have democracy?  As I said, I 
am proud to stand in the House of Commons as representative for 
the people of Elk Island.  In my party, the one I very proudly 
belong to, I have a mandate to represent the people of my 
constituency, whereas the other parties by policy have to vote 
the way they are told by their party leadership.  In our party 
the rule is that when a clear consensus can be found among the 
people of the riding it is the duty of the member of parliament 
to represent the wishes of those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrast that with other parties where individuals who act 
contrary to party wishes get kicked out. 
They need to be represented in a way that reflects the way in 
which they live and work together.  We cannot just put a line 
down the middle of a community and expect them not to be insulted 
by that.

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that comes to mind with respect to a democratic 
system is that we are so far from it.  It is incredible the 
amount of power we have vested in one person, the Prime Minister 
of the country.  Right at the grassroots level the Prime 
Minister, as the leader of the governing party, can actually 
choose candidates in different constituencies at election time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not required that the candidate be the person chosen by 
the people in the constituency.  We have a number of situations 
where people aspiring to run to become members of parliament have 
been rebuffed by the Liberal Party or the Conservative Party. 
They have been told they cannot run even when they have won the 
majority of votes at their meeting. Instead, the party in power 
states what people it wants.  In some cases an election is not 
even held.  The candidate is simply appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We experienced this in Canada just last week when the Prime 
Minister effectively chose the member of parliament for one of 
the ridings in Newfoundland.  It basically gave the people there 
no choice at all.  He has been appointed to the cabinet of Canada 
without even having won an electoral seat in this country.  To me 
that is not democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister who chooses the candidates in the ridings is 
also the one who controls the members of parliament and tells 
them how to vote during each vote held in this place, that is, 
with the exception of the odd private member's bill, where 
members express themselves individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister controls the Senate.  He appoints the members 
of the Senate, especially when there is a change of party in 
power, after a short length of time.  We have experienced this 
since 1993 when the Conservatives held the majority in the Senate 
and when it served a very useful function, frankly.  From time to 
time the Senate maintained a bill was not good for Canada and 
sent it back with amendments.  However, after a while senators 
retired or passed away.  They were replaced with Liberal 
appointees or liberally appointed.  They now do the bidding of 
the Prime Minister in the other House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no democracy in that. The Prime Minister appoints the 
candidates, appoints the Senate, and controls how they vote in 
both Houses.  One could say that is really more of a dictatorship 
than a democracy.  We must add to that the ability of the Prime 
Minister to appoint judges and commissioners to all the different 
commissions in the government.  It goes on and on.  We do not 
really have representative democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to proportional representation, the specific motion 
before us today, there are different kinds of proportional 
representation.  The model I like the best is the one in which 
each constituency has a first past the post candidate.  To me it 
seems fair that the person who got more votes than anyone else, 
not the one who came second or third, should represent the people 
of that riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a better way to do even that.  In votes we 
should seriously consider having people express themselves in a 
preferential ballot and have the votes counted by computer.  The 
person who has the fewest votes on the first level of choice 
would drop off the ballot.  Every ballot with that person as a 
first choice would then go to the second choice.  The process 
would continue until the person had a majority of the people in 
the riding.  In that way we would not have a situation where 
there is a minority member.  Eventually he or she would have the 
majority of the votes based on the first, second, third or fourth 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second model I like a great deal is the one in which we have 
the first past the post system, as now, but also members at large 
for perhaps each province.  I do not think we would want to do 
this right across the country.  It would cause a bit of a 
problem.  However, in each province there could be a set-up in 
which each province has so many members of parliament elected 
from the constituencies plus so many at large. 
That number could be used in the proportional system to top up 
representation for each province.  It would serve very well to 
balance out the powers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the ultimate, and this was the argument from the Liberal 
side, was that we would have a minority government. A number of 
people have told me our best governments have been minority.  In 
minority governments legislators have to actually engage in a 
fair amount of give and take, negotiating and accepting 
amendments to improve bills.  We thus get better legislation.  I 
think we would be much better served if governments had to do 
that negotiation on the bills and motions they brought forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds—Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank you for giving me this opportunity to address Motion 
M-155, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should work 
towards incorporating a measure of proportional representation 
in the federal electoral system, making use of a framework which 
includes: (<I>a</I>) a report on proportional representation prepared 
by an all-party committee after extensive public hearings; (<I>b</I>) a 
referendum to be held on this issue where the question shall be 
whether electors favour replacing the present system with a 
system proposed by the committee as concurred in by the House; 
and (<I>c</I>) the referendum may be held either before or at the same 
time as the next general election. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to the eloquent speech by the hon. member 
for Regina—Qu'Appelle on his Motion M-155, and while I find his 
arguments very interesting, I do not agree with his proposal. 
There are, in my opinion, very good reasons to keep our existing 
electoral system. That system is based on ridings, with each 
riding electing a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that a member of parliament has a great 
responsibility toward his constituents, who can vote against 
him the next time around. Similarly, voters can get rid of the 
government in office if they no longer trust it. The verdict is 
decisive in the case of a majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, as the only representative for his riding, a member of 
parliament is responsible for representing his constituents 
regarding any issue that comes before parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current system, a member of parliament must take into 
account a whole range of opinions. He does not speak only on 
behalf of his party. 
As the sole representative of his riding, he must try to correct 
all sorts of wrongs and he must take into consideration the 
interests and opinions of all his voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the role of a member of parliament is to fulfil the basic 
function of any political system, which is reconciling a large 
number of views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also saw that in some countries using an electoral system 
based on proportional representation, it can sometimes take 
weeks after an election before the government is formed. Also, 
once the government has been formed, often under a coalition 
integrating small specialized parties—not to say extremists—it is 
not in a position to maintain the confidence of the legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electoral systems based on proportional representation often 
require the establishment of a coalition between parties of 
diverging political views. 
A plurality system tends to lead to the formation of broad based 
parties bringing together members from different regions and 
linguistic and ethnocultural groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proportional representation is likely to lead to a coalition 
government formed following in camera political negotiations and 
not as the result of balloting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries have realized that proportional representation 
exacerbates regional differences and rifts within societies and 
that the search for a national consensus on vital issues is 
accordingly complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in our electoral system, voting is a simple act.  The 
voter simply indicates the name of his preferred candidate. 
This permits the reduction of the number of spoiled ballots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vote count is quick and simple. 
Generally, only a few hours after the polls close, Canadians 
know which party will form the government and which will form 
the opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to rise on the matter before us.  When we work 
internationally as Canadians on issues particularly related to 
getting better representation in houses of parliament around the 
world, it has been interesting to compare systems of government 
and whether proportional representation can improve the lot of 
women, for instance, in certain countries where the lists are 
very clear that it is male-female throughout the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have in Canada a fine tradition of very clear 
responsibility for certain ridings.  It was interesting that the 
member for Elk Island suggested that was our first and only call 
when it has always been my understanding that a Canadian member 
of parliament is not responsible only to his or her constituents 
but to all Canadians.  People in the riding of Elk Island have 
just as much right to call me.  I hope everyone does not start to 
call me.  My staff is very busy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the aspect that when I make decisions or think about 
voting in parliament I also think about the impact of my 
decisions and the decisions of the government on people in Elk 
Island, men, women and children from all walks of life.  That is 
a very important aspect of our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the debate is quite interesting and we should certainly 
take the time to review whether our system of government is 
working for Canadians and how to improve it, if people take an 
objective look and try to avoid some of the silliness that we 
have heard in at least one speech tonight, they will say that 
Canadian members of parliament represent Canadians well, that 
there is a check and a balance in place, and that there are good 
reasons for our system to continue to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members look around, in 1993 this was the most multicultural 
parliament in a long time.  We had far greater representation 
from the different founding nations and people who made up our 
country, new citizens, people who came to Canada for the first 
time.  I am a child of immigrants.  It is interesting that the 
Reform Party, which supports the motion, has the worst 
representation of women in parliament with just 3 of 50 or 
whatever seats it has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth it for us to examine different systems of government to 
see what works best in different countries, but our Canadian 
system works very well.  Another challenge in looking at 
proportional representation is that there is no single system 
internationally.  Perhaps there are other ways in which we can 
improve our institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly there has been a lot more support for motions.  Just 
today most members of the House voted for a Bloc motion, although 
the Reform Party voted against it.  There has been much more 
liberty, especially on this side of the House, to encourage 
members to live up to their expectations and the expectations 
that Canadians have of them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will be dividing my time with the Minister of 
National Defence.  I am pleased and honoured to have the 
opportunity to address the House for the first time in a role 
which I have now held for approximately eight hours.  I feel it 
is an important opportunity as well to address the issue of 
peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government fully supports the practice of parliamentary 
consultation on significant Canadian military deployment outside 
our country.  In this context we are raising the question of 
Canadian participation in the United Nations peacekeeping mission 
in Ethiopia and Eritrea, known as UNMEE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I discuss the merits of Canadian participation in this 
mission I would like to offer a bit of background information. On 
June 18 of this year, following two years of periodic and bloody 
warfare, the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea signed the 
cessation of hostilities agreement under the sponsorship of the 
Organization of African Unity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two years of fighting came at a heavy cost.  It is 
difficult to give an exact figure, but it is estimated that at 
least 120,000 people were killed.  The hostilities forced some 
1.4 million people to leave their homes during a drought.  Canada 
cannot ignore the sad fate of these people. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OAU called on the United Nations to play a vital role in 
ensuring that both sides respect their security commitments.  The 
agreement further asks that a United Nations peacekeeping mission 
monitor a temporary security zone between the opposing armed 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The request from Ethiopia and Eritrea to the United Nations 
comes at an important time for peacekeeping.  The recently 
released findings of the Brahimi panel point to major issues that 
need to be addressed by the international community to ensure 
that peacekeeping practices are effective and Canada will 
continue to be in the forefront of such reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do in support of UNMEE is an important demonstration 
that we are prepared to support, in real terms, innovative change. 
It is equally important that we demonstrate our support for 
Africa, underscoring that African states can expect our help in 
achieving a measure of security for our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada believes that the United Nations should be central to the 
maintenance of international peace and security.  This belief has 
prompted us to support, again and again, UN peacekeeping 
operations.  Canadians understand that for the United Nations to 
play a central role in fostering global peace the UN member 
states must step up to the plate and swing the bat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also understand and demand that when our forces go 
abroad in the service of peace they do so under the aegis of a 
coherent game plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>UN missions must have achievable objectives.  They must have a 
mandate sufficiently broad to achieve those objectives, and they 
must have the human and financial resources necessary to operate 
effectively. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, in this debate on whether or not to send troops 
into Ethiopia and Eritrea, we must ask ourselves how this 
mission will help Africa and how it will strengthen UN 
peacekeeping, as well as take into account specific features of 
the mission's mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since June, the UN security council, of which Canada is an 
active member, has recognized the need to deploy a peacekeeping 
force in the region in order to prevent the resumption of 
hostilities.  It therefore adopted, on July 31, Resolution 1312 
creating the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resolution authorizes the deployment of 100 military 
observers with the mandate to ensure on site initial liaison 
between the parties, establish the mechanism for verifying the 
ceasefire and help with overall planning for the peacekeeping 
mission. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of the assessment mission, the UN secretary-general 
recommended the establishment of a peacekeeping force of 4,200 
personnel; roughly 4,000 troops to establish and maintain the 
security zone, plus an observer force of about 220 personnel and 
associated support resources.  The security council adopted a 
resolution authorizing this phase on September 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting that since the signing of the cessation of 
hostilities agreement there have been no reports of significant 
military skirmishes.  In short, there is a peace to keep and both 
sides appear genuinely to want the agreement to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, UNMEE has a clear and achievable mandate.  Its role is 
well defined and appropriate, and it will have the resources to 
do its job right.  However, there is another aspect of the UNMEE 
mission that affords an important opportunity to bolster the 
capacity of the UN to advance and effect peacekeeping in line 
with the Brahimi recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, in conjunction with several like-minded countries, has 
worked to create a new rapid deployment mechanism, the standby 
high readiness brigade or SHIRBRIG.  The United Nations request 
for Canada to provide troops to UNMEE came within the context of 
deploying a SHIRBRIG battalion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SHIRBRIG is a multinational brigade to be held at a high state 
of readiness and activated as required for chapter 6 operations 
with the United Nations.  Reflecting our long held desire to 
build a capacity within the UN to deploy peacekeepers where they 
are needed in a timely fashion, Canada has participated in 
SHIRBRIG from its inception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNMEE provides the first test case for SHIRBRIG.  The proposal 
before us is to send one Canadian company of about 400 troops 
within a Dutch battalion that would go to Ethiopia and Eritrea as 
part of a SHIRBRIG deployment.  This battalion would be joined by 
two battalions from other troop contributing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I noted earlier, as envisaged, an expanded Canadian role in 
UNMEE would be as part of a Dutch led SHIRBRIG battalion.  The 
Netherlands has signalled that it would consider providing one 
SHIRBRIG battalion on the condition that a reliable and 
experienced peacekeeping partner would also participate in a 
significant way.  The Netherlands therefore approached Canada and 
asked us to join it in a SHIRBRIG deployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that the Dutch government has approved this 
proposal and the matter is currently before parliament in the 
Netherlands.  Obviously Canada believes that the successful 
deployment of a Dutch led SHIRBRIG battalion would provide both 
concrete proof of the viability of the SHIRBRIG concept and 
momentum in the further deployment of a UN rapid reaction 
capacity called for by the Brahimi panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that Canada has already played a role 
in the initial stages of UNMEE.  Canada contributed one Canadian 
forces lieutenant-colonel as UNMEE's chief operations officer and 
a further five officers as military observers, but now the UN has 
asked us to consider a greater involvement.  The government 
proposes that the Canadian armed forces provide a mechanized 
infantry company group, a necessary national command and engineer 
and logistics support, estimated at 400 personnel.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may also involve a requirement for an initial engineering 
surge of up to 200 personnel to help establish infrastructure. 
The Canadian contingent would operate as part of a Dutch led 
battalion under the UN field headquarters.  The headquarters 
would have as its core the SHIRBRIG headquarters staff to which 
Canada has committed seven officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exact Canadian troop numbers would be determined following 
further discussions with Dutch authorities and a strategic 
reconnaissance mission to the area.  Variables include the nature 
and scope of Dutch logistical support, the precise location of 
Canadian deployment, the quartering arrangements Canadian 
personnel would use and the extent to which costs would be offset 
by UN funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, endorsement of this proposal before us will allow 
Canada to accomplish several things.  First, it will allow us to 
contribute in a meaningful way to regional peace in East Africa. 
Second, it is an opportunity to demonstrate that the UN can 
achieve its peacekeeping objectives when a mission is given an 
appropriate mandate and sufficient resources.  Third, it will 
underscore the ability of the international community to support 
organizations such as the OAU in developing African solutions to 
African problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be in good company doing a necessary job for a fixed 
period of time, and then coming home.  Canadians should embrace 
this opportunity to show we are serious about helping African 
countries in need and supporting the UN's role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to leave the House with this thought from Benjamin 
Franklin, who said “There was never a good war or a bad peace”. 
Let us act as agents of peace in the Horn of Africa.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

possible Canadian peacekeeping activities on the border between 
Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has spoken about the diplomatic efforts in the 
United Nations and the Organization of African Unity with respect 
to bringing peace to this region.  I would like to further 
discuss the matter in terms of supporting our interests as well 
as our values as long standing participants in peacekeeping 
efforts with the United Nations and around the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peacekeeping speaks in a concrete and active manner to the 
values most dear to Canadians: peace, democracy, human rights 
and compassion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been and remain prepared to join other nations to 
better the world, whether in Africa, Asia, Central America, the 
Balkans or the Middle East.  We want to participate in helping to 
bring peace and stability in the world.  This is in our interest 
as Canadians to continue to help the United Nations to 
carry out these missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years ago Canada completed a study on how to improve the 
United Nations rapid reaction capability.  A key recommendation 
is materializing in the form of SHIRBRIG, the standby high 
readiness brigade.  The concept behind SHIRBRIG is to provide the 
UN with a readily deployable brigade to support UN operations. 
Its job is to react quickly to get a UN presence established and 
then to make room for a UN follow-on force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, UNMEE for 
short, would mark the first deployment of SHIRBRIG.  The core of 
the UN mission's headquarters planned for UNMEE would consist of 
military headquarters staff from SHIRBRIG.  Canada has committed 
up to seven officers to the planning element of this staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN force commander is expected to be the Dutch 
brigadier-general currently in command of SHIRBRIG.  We now have 
an opportunity to advance our goal of enhancing the UN's rapid 
reaction capability.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to the mandate of this mission.  The UN security 
council resolution 1320 of September 15 authorizes the 
peacekeeping mission to monitor the cessation of hostilities in a 
temporary security zone along the border between Ethiopia and 
Eritrea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNMEE would consist of up to 4,200 troops, including up to 220 
military observers.  The resolution also authorizes the 
deployment for a period of six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces can make a meaningful contribution to this 
mission.  Our contribution would consist of a mechanized infantry 
company, including a company headquarters and three infantry 
platoons equipped with armoured personal carriers.  It would also 
have engineer and logistics support and other combat services 
support units.  It may also include a reconnaissance platoon 
equipped with our Coyote vehicles.  All of the equipment we will 
be sending on this mission will be the best state of the art 
equipment that can be provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total number of personnel will be about 400 and they will be 
there for a period of no more than six months.  The United 
Nations is well aware of our commitment with respect to the six 
month timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces would be deployed within a Dutch battalion 
and under the operational command of a Dutch battalion commander. 
Canada has worked closely with the government of the Netherlands 
on this proposed mission.  I have met with my counterpart on two 
occasions with respect to this, and the Dutch parliament, as the 
foreign affairs minister has indicated, is currently considering 
this matter.  Our approval is tied to their approval since the 
battalion is a joint effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have discussed with the chief of defence staff, General Baril, 
the risks involved in this mission and the impact on the Canadian 
forces.  While the military risk is assessed as low, the health 
and environmental risks, including the threat posed by land mines 
and unexploded munitions, are of greater concern.  To better 
assess these risks we are sending a strategic reconnaissance 
mission to the area.  Before the government deploys Canadian 
troops on this proposed mission, the chief of defence staff must 
be satisfied that logistics, medical and security arrangements 
are acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that members of the House are concerned about the impact 
of the high operational tempo of the last few years on the 
quality of life of the Canadian forces. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Minister of National Defence, I have made improving the 
quality of life of the men and women in the Canadian forces one 
of my main priorities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure members that we have taken this into consideration 
in our planning.  With the reduction in our personnel overseas, 
from over 4,000 a year ago to some 2,500 today, the pressure is 
certainly much less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having carefully weighed these and other factors, and pending 
the final military advice of General Baril, I believe that Canada 
should make available the mechanized infantry company group of 
about 400 personnel as I have outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a real opportunity and the capability to make a 
difference in Africa.  We have an opportunity to enhance the UN's 
reputation as a force for peace and we have an opportunity to 
build on our peacekeeping legacy.  In short, we have the chance 
to do justice to our words, our values and our policies.  That is 
why I ask the House to support the proposal to deploy the 
Canadian forces to a UN mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to reflect on the comments of the chief of 
defence staff.  I think he spoke with some bluntness this week, 
saying that the Canadian forces will have to cut personnel further and 
cannibalize its own operations to purchase new equipment. 
That is just to keep things afloat.  Looking at the auditor 
general's report that came out today, it is very clear that there 
will be substantial reductions again in military capability.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a history of deploying troops and stretching 
them to the limit every time a conflict comes up.  One has to ask 
whether it is the defence minister or the foreign affairs 
minister who actually gives direction to the military on whatever 
he decides should happen.  This is not to say that there are not 
conflict areas in that world that do need attention, but I am 
concerned about our troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about the number of deployments they have had.  I 
have not heard much as far as assurances from the minister that 
those concerns will be addressed other than making this 
commitment.  We are in the middle of a take note debate but the 
decision to send them has already been made, which does concern 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the minister plan on doing?  Does he plan on 
stretching the troops even further, to the point where something 
else will give?  The chief of the defence staff has made clear 
note that there are problems with the budget as it sits and now 
the minister is committing our men and women even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member 
has once again misread the comments made by the chief of the 
defence staff, or even the auditor general for that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has noted in his report that we have made 
substantial progress in providing the kinds of equipment and 
resources needed by the Canadian forces.  The chief of defence 
staff also said, in the same articles that the hon. member seems 
to be reading, that we are more combat capable today than ever 
before and that we are ready for these kinds of missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should also listen to the remarks I made a few 
moments ago in terms of the operational tempo of the Canadian 
forces.  We had over 4,000, a very high operational tempo a year 
ago.  It is down to 2,500 today, to a great extent because of our 
rationalization of our forces in the Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is at a much more manageable level because the government is 
concerned about the quality of life of our troops and wants to 
make sure that in fact there is a period of time between these 
rotations, so that they are not being stretched and over 
stressed, as we are all concerned that they not be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Alliance Party only talks about matters, we have taken 
action.  We have put more money into the defence budget this year 
to help make sure we do have the equipment.  That is why when 
they go to Eritrea and Ethiopia they will have the best equipment 
that anybody could have, modern, up-to-date equipment.  It is 
because of the actions of the government while the Alliance Party 
only talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, the concluding point in 
the auditor general's report—and I believe this is incumbent 
upon government to inform the House of exactly the state of our 
military—is this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, there is a need to provide Parliament with a more 
complete picture of the capabilities of the Canadian Forces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To listen to the rhetoric coming from the minister one would 
think otherwise, but the truth of the matter is that the auditor 
general, as are many Canadians now, is very concerned about the 
state of our military and the deployment of our troops overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Madam Speaker, we have new 
Coyotes, new armoured personnel carriers and new combat clothing 
for an environment such as Eritrea and Ethiopia.  We have 
provided so many new things to our troops that it is a very clear 
demonstration of our commitment to make sure that when we send 
our troops there they will be properly equipped.  Parliament is 
being consulted on this occasion and will be consulted on many 
occasions with respect to meeting those particular needs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Calgary Northeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to welcome the new foreign affairs minister to his 
position.  I have no advice to give him other than to read deeply 
for several weeks before he wanders into that portfolio.  As 
somebody who is fairly new to this, I have discovered how 
complicated it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not suggest that I am going to edify the House greatly 
with what I have to say tonight, but I do want to issue a few 
cautionary notes about what the government is proposing to embark 
upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is proud, and rightly so, of its record in peacekeeping. 
As a Canadian citizen I am very proud of what Canadian soldiers 
have done in their role as peacekeepers over the last 44 years 
since former prime minister Pearson invented the idea of 
peacekeeping.  Soon I will be able to present a peacekeeping 
medal to one of the people who works in my office in my riding. I 
am quite proud of that fact and he is very proud of the role he 
has been able to play as a peacekeeper in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something that Canadians generally support.  We like the 
idea that Canada has played a very productive role around the 
world as peacekeepers in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, Canadians are rightly concerned about some of 
the things that have happened in the past and which give us pause 
when we consider moving into some of these new trouble spots such 
as the mission that the government seems ready to embark upon, 
the mission where we would essentially patrol the buffer zone 
between Eritrea and Ethiopia, which is 25 kilometres wide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a situation where there has been, as the foreign affairs 
minister pointed out, tremendous bloodshed over the last few 
years.  There have been somewhere in the neighbourhood of 100,000 
or 120,000 people killed and 85,000 to 100,000 displaced.  In 
some cases people are in jeopardy of not having enough to eat 
this fall.  It is a pretty desperate situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that in the past when we have gone into the 
continent of Africa we have had huge trouble in some cases.  I 
think of Zaire, where peacekeepers sat on the tarmac for a month 
trying to figure out what exactly they were doing there because 
seemingly on a whim the Prime Minister decided that peacekeepers 
should be sent there.  I think of course of Somalia.  Who could 
forget Somalia and the disaster that was?  It spawned an inquiry 
that ultimately never did get to the root of the problems, an 
inquiry that the government cut short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most tragic of all, of course, was Rwanda.  That was a terrible 
situation.  Roméo Dallaire sat helplessly and watched the 
genocide that took place there while he tried to alert the rest 
of the world to what was going on.  Ultimately the UN failed him, 
frankly, in that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I raise some of these cases is not to suggest that 
Canada should not go on peacekeeping missions into Africa but 
that we should go with our eyes completely open.  We have 
challenges that I am not certain the government has considered 
yet.  I do not think it has addressed some of the questions that 
have been raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend who just spoke and questioned the defence minister has 
pointed out that Canada has been involved in a lot of 
peacekeeping over the last many years, at a time when the 
government has cut deeply into our ability to provide equipment 
for our personnel, at a time when the government has cut the 
number of personnel dramatically.  There were about 10,000 people 
out of uniform in the last seven years and about $10 billion to $11 
billion removed cumulatively from the defence budget over the 
last seven years.  That is a lot of money and a lot of personnel 
to remove and still maintain the same levels of peacekeeping that 
we have been maintaining.  It was not very long ago that we 
consolidated our troops in the Balkans because we were 
overextended.  It was hurting morale in the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems like we cannot say no to missions.  We are just now 
starting to get back on our feet.  We are just now giving our 
military personnel a chance to collect themselves and get used to 
having a bit of time to spend with their families in many cases. 
Right away again, though, the government is committing us to 
another mission.  It commits us without answering some 
fundamental questions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We point out that Ethiopia-Eritrea in the Horn of Africa is a 
tremendous distance from Canada.  How do we support these people 
when they are that far away?  Let us remember that we do not have 
the airlift or sealift capacity we should have.  We do not have a 
lot of capacity in our military because we have let our military 
run down so much.  How do we reinforce those people?  How do we 
support them?  How do we withdraw them if there is trouble? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there can be trouble in Africa.  That is one thing 
we have learned over the last many years.  Even when we do not 
expect it, all of a sudden there can be trouble.  When we talk 
about trouble in Africa we are not talking about skirmishes but 
about the sorts of things that have happened in Somalia and 
Rwanda and the sorts of things that happen today in Congo.  We 
are talking about terrible messes, terrible situations, so we 
need to be assured that we have the ability to reinforce those 
troops, to supply them and to get them out if there is the type 
of trouble we are talking about.  We have heard no reassurance 
from the government that we have that capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, as I have already mentioned, we are in a situation where 
we are already extended about as far as we can go.  What happens 
if we are asked to intervene in places like the Congo?  Are we to 
send more people over?  How will we deal with that sort of 
situation?  It is not clear to us what the government's 
intentions are.  Obviously this is something that is on the 
government's radar screen, but we need to have that kind of 
information before we can say yes.  The government has said 
clearly that we would not be involved in the Congo, that we would 
therefore commit these troops only to Ethiopia-Eritrea.  That is 
an important thing, which we need to know.  We have not heard 
that yet from either one of the ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point is that while I appreciate the chance to speak 
tonight to this issue, I resent the suggestion that somehow we 
are influencing the government's policy on this issue and somehow 
influencing their decision on whether Canada will go.  It is all 
but assured that Canada will go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned a moment ago that the Dutch parliament 
will consider this.  Maybe in that system members actually do 
consider it.  That would be a great thing, but I have a niggling 
suspicion, which is borne out by past experience, that this 
debate really will not influence the decision very much. That is 
regrettable.  A lot of people who are here have some valuable 
points to raise.  We would see this place full if people thought 
they could influence the government's decision making. 
Unfortunately they do not, and that is reflected in how many 
people will speak to the issue tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my remarks with that.  I urge the government to 
consider some of the questions I have raised.  It is for those 
reasons that the Canadian Alliance is very reluctant to suggest 
that Canadian peacekeepers should go to Ethiopia-Eritrea to be 
involved in this mission.  We need more information.  We do not 
have it.  It is for those reasons that we would oppose that 
action at this time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is not just the discussion of Canadian 
peacekeeping deployment to Ethiopia but other conflicts in the 
world that have given rise to a take note debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always interesting that the feedback from the government 
side to the opposition and to the Canadian people does not appear 
to lend itself to a true debate on this issue or any others when 
it comes to deployment.  The decision has been made, pure and 
simple, so in a sense all we are really doing is offering a 
viewpoint that will not go much further than the statements made 
here in the House and which certainly will not influence any 
decision on that side.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the Liberal government continues to commit 
our troops to overseas duty despite almost daily warning signs 
that the Canadian military is on the verge of collapse when we 
talk about combat capability.  The chief of defence staff was 
uncommonly blunt this week, declaring that the Canadian forces 
will have to cut personnel again and cannibalize their own 
equipment to purchase new equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to the auditor general's report, because I 
think the Canadian people should be well aware of what in fact 
will happen and what is presently happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about the navy issue.  It is going to lose part of 
its operating budget and will cut back on two Kingston class 
maritime coastal defence vessels.  It will retire minesweepers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The air force has already removed eight of its 14 Challenger 
jets.  In addition, two Dash 8 aircraft were declared surplus. It 
has called for a 10% reduction in infrastructure from its 
component parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business plan of the individual services for the 2000 
planning year indicates that additional reductions are planned. 
The air force faces the largest cuts.  The CF-18 fleet will be 
reduced from 122 to 80.  Overall, the air force will shrink from 
460 aircraft to 257. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in the army has not been addressed yet.  The army 
has not yet determined how it will restructure itself, but it 
could also face significant reductions in its order of battle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the complete picture.  Of course there is no indication 
of downsizing, but that is on its way also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  It all comes down to the issue of funding.  The government 
really refuses to address that point of keeping our forces combat 
capable.  If that is the purpose of having the military, the 
government has reneged on its duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The limited cash infusion contained in the last budget was just 
enough to pay off some of the backlog of bills.  The vicious 
cycle of defence planning and spending continues in the country, 
yet the government continues to ship more troops overseas.  Quite 
a number just came back from East Timor not too many months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the government how much planning, both of a 
tactical and a strategic nature, has been invested in this 
mission.  We have committed ourselves to UN missions before 
without considering the long term requirements or expectations, 
like the list my colleague from Medicine Hat clearly pointed out, 
with some situations like Zaire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government just does not get the picture when it 
comes to what our military is all about.  In fact, it has 
insulted our military from time to time, even to the point of 
referring to our peacekeepers as boy scouts.  I think that is an 
insult.  Really, they are far from being boy scouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point remains that the government continues to support 
peacekeeping missions because we have always supported 
peacekeeping missions.  No consideration is given to the fact 
that there are half as many people in uniform in 2000 as there 
were in 1970.  We are deploying beyond our means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has worked hard to promote and project an image 
of peacekeeping and our peacekeepers that is blatantly false and 
that needlessly places our military personnel in harm's way if 
they do not have adequate equipment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peacekeeping no longer follows the Cyprus model where Canadians 
stood in observation posts with binoculars and surveyed the 
uneasy but verifiable peace.  For the past decade the UN has sent 
peacekeepers into countries where there is no peace to keep, or 
where the one that does exist is exceedingly vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been sending our soldiers into war zones and blithely 
asking them to keep the peace, and it has not happened.  The 
government's insistence that these operations are peacekeeping as 
usual has created a sense of false comfort as Canadians think 
their military personnel are enjoying six months in some foreign 
land with little or no danger.  Moreover the government has 
failed to equip the troops it does send. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings us to the point of clothing the soldier.  It is far 
from complete and well behind its deadline, leaving them without 
even the basic kit requirements.  They have been forced to beg 
supplies and material from our allies in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The larger equipment requirements have also proven a constant 
source of failure and embarrassment for the government.  Our lack 
of sealift and airlift capability has meant that we cannot move 
our personnel or our equipment on scene without relying on 
contracted out services.  All we have to do is reflect back to 
the <I>GTS Katie</I> to realize how unreliable some of those 
services can be, with disastrous implications to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is consistently late in regard to deployment because we 
lack the necessary deployment resources.  Our military personnel 
are forced to work with equipment that is often not interoperable 
with our allies.  Kosovo was an example.  We just barely fit into 
the communications band with our allies and they were required to 
adjust to meet our lower standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no extraction capability, and this is becoming more and 
more important.  If our troops were involved in some conflict and 
needed to be removed, there would be no opportunity to do that 
because we just do not have that capability.  There are no 
resupply options.  There is no reinforcement plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been fortunate thus far that our international friends 
have been so willing to lend us a hand under these circumstances, 
but surely a country such as Canada should not have to rely on 
military charity for its military forces to function.  There must 
be a limit somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to answer UN deployment calls within the context of 
national interests.  The member for Medicine Hat clearly pointed 
out what should be our national interest.  Is it every conflict 
which comes along that we are asked to participate in and we do 
it in an ad hoc fashion?  Or, is it something that we define as 
our basic interest and that is where our priorities lie?  That 
has never come from that side of the House, and it is high time 
it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot respond to every crisis, especially given the 
government's complete lack of resolve to provide consistent 
funding to the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of our forces have been deployed in some of the most 
difficult of situations and have never complained.  It is the 
responsibility and moral duty of the government of the day to 
look after those needs, and I would have to say it has failed to 
do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I find it 
indispensable to take part in this debate. I must say that I have 
just heard some surprising words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My new colleague from Medicine Hat, the foreign affairs critic, 
seemed more concerned with adding to the argument of his 
colleague, the defence critic, than giving the foreign affairs 
point of view.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is true much needs to be done here, but much is indeed 
being done, and we know that at this time there is one 
fundamental issue for peace: that the UN regain its credibility. 
This is something that affects all countries that have the means 
to participate, and Canada is among them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people on the other side of the floor with all their 
surpluses are not going to say whether the means need 
re-examining.  I know that they do not. What is the government 
asking?  Compliance with the UN request to provide 400 military 
personnel, under chapter VI, to this mission, that is, to send in 
some Blue Berets, infantry and armoured equipment in a context 
in which there would not be any peace if the UN had not 
guaranteed to occupy the disputed border area between Eritrea and 
Ethiopia.  The peace agreement was signed on June 18.  We were no 
longer sitting by that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been a good idea if the question had been 
submitted to us before the UN accepted.  Perhaps the UN committed 
itself without knowing the direction this mission would actually 
take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pretty well convinced, however, that Canada would have 
agreed to participate in this mission after it weighed the 
situation. 
It is more than participation, since the UN is asking Canada to 
take on the responsibility of managing the mission, along with 
the Netherlands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to tell my colleagues who are concerned about 
these issues—and we are also concerned about the plight of 
Canadian troops—that since the ceasefire, since June 18, we have 
found, based on our research, that the ceasefire has been 
respected by both sides. In a way, this is a peacekeeping 
mission that meets requirements that had not been met in a long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a peacekeeping mission that is not at all like the one in 
Sierra Leone, not at all like the one we need to have in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, where fighting is taking place 
everywhere, and also not like the peacekeeping mission in East 
Timor. 
It is a situation where the ceasefire will be respected. Even 
the end of the rainy season did not result in renewed violence. 
There has been tension, but no violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we assessed the situation, when we looked at the troops 
available, when we took into consideration soldiers who had 
returned from a mission and had already had a respite—because 
that is important—we realized that we were able to take part in 
this mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to the UN's credibility, to this notion that 
is based on what happens in the area of foreign affairs. 
We must remember the failure of UN troops in Sierra Leone, the 
dismal failure of peacekeepers in Sierra Leone. We must remember 
what happened in East Timor, where a referendum held under the 
aegis of the UN left the population at the mercy of 
mistreatment, fire, destruction and abuse from adversaries who 
had not accepted the clear verdict of that referendum. The 
population is still waiting for the reconstruction process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who followed what happened in Rwanda? Of course, we do not even 
talk about it. However, in these new missions, the UN must 
demonstrate that it can be effective.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is the UN, if not all the countries that make it up?  It is 
the member countries, ultimately.  We cannot point a finger at 
Kofi Annan.  Of course there are problems of administration in 
the UN.  We can single out examples of overspending, yes, but 
the collective responsibility of the member countries with 
respect to peace lies ultimately with each individual nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak briefly about Africa in connection with 
what is going on in the world.   Africa is the poorest 
continent, the one which is now the stage for terrible conflicts 
in countries that are poor and growing poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where eight 
African nations are battling each other.  It is being called 
Africa's first world war. 
Africa is in a terrible state and the UN has frankly done little 
to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps help is not possible, but that was not the impression 
given by General Dallaire at the time.  On the contrary, the 
poor man is now personally tormented by what he experienced of 
the UN's failure to act.  He says that what has become a 
terrible human tragedy, this genocide, could have been avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the request being made, once again, I repeat 
that it does not come under chapter VII, which provides for 
armed troops who can defend themselves, but chapter VI 
concerning peacekeepers.  This is in a situation where there is 
already a ceasefire.  Canada's commitment is not an unlimited 
one.  As I understand it, it is limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is it limited because the defence minister has said he 
made that clear to the UN, but it appears to be limited by the 
situation itself.  What this peacekeeping force will allow is a 
negotiated peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permit me to recount some of the troubled history of this 
region.  Eritrea is a new country.  It became a country as the 
result of a referendum on self-determination overseen by the UN 
in the spring of 1993.  At that time, it became an independent 
country.  We knew at the time that there was a border problem. 
Let us say that cartography is not the best equipped department 
in a country that lacks everything, one of the poorest countries 
on the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The borders were not a big problem for several years.  The 
region is sparsely populated and has no natural resources.  In 
any case, relations between the two countries, Eritrea, which I 
have just mentioned, and Ethiopia, which it separated from, were 
more or less satisfactory. 
Trade disagreements arose, but it was in 1996 that there were 
new disagreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, the Ethiopian parliament declared war. We all saw the 
terrible images because these countries found themselves at war 
in this situation. Because of this war, and not because Eritrea 
is not self-sufficient in food, the land 
could not be cultivated as it ought.  This war just ended in 
June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being asked to allow peace to be negotiated and agreed 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, members will have understood from what I 
have said, supports this mission.  We support it because our 
general council adopted a resolution this spring calling for the 
UN to agree to act as a buffer between the two borders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I neglected to mention the importance of understanding that 
there is a zone 25 kilometres wide and more than 1,000 
kilometres long that both parties want to see protected by the 
UN peacekeeping mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Because the border between the two countries, the one being 
preserved by the UN, which was the original line at the time 
Eritrea was separated from Ethiopia, is not well known.  It is 
being discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this border is being marked out, the mission in which we 
are going to take part, I hope, will make it possible to 
preserve the peace.

of such a resolution, we are pleased to see Canada participating

done.  This land, which is poor and in many areas dry, and 
lacking in natural resources as well, has been mined.  There is 
much work to be done to remove the mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I accompanied the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the time 
to Kosovo, I saw with my own eyes how soldiers were helping out, 
helping groups, companies or community undertakings that were 
going to do the de-mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore our understanding that there is a considerable 
humanitarian aspect to the UN mission.  For those who may be 
watching, I should point out that the UN mission is going to be 
called UNMEE, which stands for United Nations Mission in 
Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it seems extremely important to us that the UN and 
Canada, which was invited to participate and which has the means 
to do so, take part in that mission, precisely because this new 
country, Eritrea, has become a country following a referendum 
held under the aegis of the UN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is not possible for the UN not to help that 
region, that new country called Eritrea, which separated from 
Ethiopia, define its borders. It is important not only for that 
country but also for the future. It is the UN's duty to 
intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, it is interesting to know that the ceasefire agreement 
provides for the implementation of a peaceful dispute settlement 
process, including arbitration if necessary, to define borders. 
This means that the conflict will be limited in terms of its 
duration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should add something that is more comforting. The two sides 
agree on one thing: under international law, Eritrea's border 
will have to be the same as it was when it achieved 
independence, and this excludes any partition, whether through a 
referendum or armed intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, as a history teacher and a committed individual when 
it comes to the right of peoples, I am pleased to see that both 
sides agree on that, under the UN's authority. That country 
comes all the more under the responsibility of the UN, and of 
Canada, which was invited to take part in that mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, I repeat that, unlike most conflicts where peacekeepers 
are present, this conflict has every chance to be limited in 
terms of its duration. As soon as the peace accord is reached, 
the UNMEE will no longer have any reason to exist.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is much simpler—and it has seldom been possible in recent 
missions in which Canada took part—to say that the mission is 
limited in duration.  The Canadian army is now in a position to 
participate in the mission.  There are 2,500 Canadian Blue 
Berets in the world.  With the exception of the 192 on the Golan 
Heights, Canada is not very involved in the most difficult 
missions right now.  There are ten Blue Berets in Jerusalem, 
five in Iraq, five in Sierra Leone, two in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, and three in Timor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The largest contingent is in Bosnia where, despite everything, 
there is relative peace, particularly since the recent election 
in Serbia.  UNMEE is therefore coming at the right time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, and I hope the member for Medicine Hat 
will come around, I say on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois that we 
hope that Canada will take part in this mission.  I would, 
however, emphasize that prior consultation would have been 
preferable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the circumstances, however, I think that the government 
should perhaps have recalled us during the summer in order to 
consult parliament, but I understand that there were 
circumstances in which Canada was being pressured and that it 
was urgent to reply to the two countries concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been told of the terrible situation they faced, of the 
more than 100,000 dead, of those who were displaced, and of all 
those of whose suffering we were not reminded but who faced 
starvation and other woes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever Canada comes to us with a responsible decision which 
bolsters the credibility of the UN and is consistent with the 
health and safety of troops from Quebec and from Canada, we will 
be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, during my first term of office, before my riding 
boundaries were changed, the Longue Pointe military base was in 
my riding and I met with a number of officers who were very 
proud of Canadian skills and very unhappy about all the 
disappointments that had befallen the army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that our troops are proud when they can demonstrate 
their skills.  The Canadian army needs this pride given what it 
has gone through as an organization.  I am not talking about 
responsibilities to be distributed, but troop morale.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased and welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of 
the NDP to the issue of Canada's role in the peacekeeping mission 
to Eritrean-Ethiopian border.  Like other members of the House, I 
am very proud of Canada's record in the world of peacekeeping and 
what our men and women have accomplished and will continue to 
accomplish in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this past week I had the honour of attending a reunion of 
the veterans of the Princess Louise Fusiliers regiment.  It was 
very encouraging to attend their special ceremonies.  I had the 
honour of presenting Mr. George Cameron, one of the veterans in 
my riding of Halifax West, with a special service award, a peace 
bar for service he performed in Korea, and to see the pride and 
joy on his face with which he accepted that medal, even though it 
had come many years late.  There were some problems in getting 
the medal to him, but we were finally able to do so and he was 
very pleased with it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also pleased to see at the ceremony the current regiment 
of the Princess Louise Fusiliers on parade.  I was quite 
impressed with the composition of that reserve unit. Minority 
group people and young women were represented in that unit. Young 
women were marching proudly.  It shows we have made some advances 
over the years and that we are gradually improving the situation 
with respect to our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was particularly encouraging when the regiment called up the 
veterans and they stood side by side on parade.  The younger and 
older generations were side by side, proudly displaying their 
feelings of having provided service to our country in a very 
meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the particular mission, I underscore that on this 
occasion I am quite pleased to see that this is a UN sponsored 
mission.  It is somewhat different from the conflict in Kosovo 
which was primarily NATO driven and dominated by U.S. 
intervention.  I made the point forcibly during the debate on 
that issue, but on this issue I am pleased to see that this is a 
UN sponsored mission, which is where I think these kinds of 
international conflicts should be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, I believe that all Canadians involved in 
this effort must be properly equipped, clothed, supported, 
trained, led and organized.  I pray that the government has 
learned from the extreme hardships encountered by peacekeepers in 
Croatia and is ensuring that our peacekeepers on this mission are 
provided with every opportunity to fulfil their mission safely 
and securely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada owes a debt of gratitude from the outset to every 
Canadian involved in this effort.  I think about their families 
and their communities.  I recall this past June taking a trip to 
Edmonton, Alberta, to speak to a group about health care issues. 
When I finished my talk I asked if there were any questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was asked a question, not by one of the members of the 
audience, but by a young lady far in the back who was working the 
bar in that establishment.  She asked me when I would bring her 
husband back home.  There was a note of desperation in her voice 
as she told her story of how due to the operational tempo of the 
armed services her husband was away from home time after time. 
She hardly saw him.  She was left behind with two small children 
to support.  She was holding down two jobs trying to support her 
children and was going through a terrible time.  When I talked 
with after the meeting she broke down and cried.  I hugged her 
for a moment and we talked a bit more.  Then she told me that if 
things did not get better she would have to leave her husband. 
She did not want to but she could not take it any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the high operational tempo is doing to families. 
This was back in June.  I am glad to hear the minister in his 
remarks acknowledged the problem with the operational tempo.  He 
is apparently concerned about it and is doing something to 
address the issue.  It is important to families to know when 
their men and women are away on service that proper supports are 
available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also during the summer I visited a family resource centre.  I 
was impressed with the amount of work and the kind of work the 
organization was doing to support military families.  It was 
there in their time of need to help them through the many 
problems they faced while their spouses were on active duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also with respect to this mission, I am glad to see that we are 
becoming more involved on the African continent.  I have raised 
that point as well.  I was pleased to hear my colleague from the 
Bloc Quebecois point out her concern that perhaps in the past our 
involvement in the African nations has not been as desirable as 
we would like or has not accomplished as much as we would like.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good to see that this particular mission is going to an 
area that has been torn by strife and where the need is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last evening I was speaking with the ambassador from 
Eritrea.  We talked a bit about the difficulties in that country 
and the devastation that the war has caused.  I was quite 
surprised to learn that a large number of the people who fight in 
the Eritrean army are women.  There are a large number of women 
soldiers fighting in that battle.  I asked in particular whether 
or not there were child soldiers involved.  She said that there 
were not, that they protect their children, but that women are out 
on the front lines fighting and dying for their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This conflict has had an enormous cost for both Eritrea and 
Ethiopia in terms of lives lost.  We are told that in a two year 
period up to June 2000 almost 100,000 lives have been lost.  Just 
picture that.  That number would wipe out a good portion of the 
core city of Halifax and is larger than the population of many 
towns and cities across Canada.  So many lives have been lost in 
the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been very difficult for both countries with respect to 
food, security and property.  I asked the ambassador from Eritrea 
what her views were with respect to this upcoming peacekeeping 
mission and I could see the joy on her face and her appreciation 
of the fact that we were going to send peacekeepers to help them 
in their time of need.  She said that we would be very much 
welcome in the role of peacekeeping in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past year, successive poor crops in Eritrea combined with 
recent Ethiopian attacks in agricultural regions have brought 
more than one million Eritreans to the brink of starvation.  That 
is a lot of people.  Sometimes we think about the poverty and the 
starvation right here in our own country, but look at a large 
number like one million people.  Quite often it is seen on TV. We 
can see the bodies that are being racked with hunger, the bones 
coming through the flesh.  It is hard to imagine that when many 
of us can sit down at a table and sometimes eat more than we 
should eat.  We have to go on diets sometimes because we are 
overweight, yet one million people are on the brink of 
starvation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope that this peacekeeping effort can play a role 
in creating conditions whereby the famine in Eritrea can be 
addressed.  On that issue, Canada should be front and foremost in 
providing food aid to Eritrea over and above the $500,000 
recently provided for displaced persons.  We need to do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 15, 2000 the UN security council passed resolution 
1320 authorizing a full mission of 4,200 troops, including 220 
observers, with a six month mandate.  The United Nations mission 
will monitor the implementation of the cessation of hostilities 
agreement in a temporary security zone along the border.  A 
combined Canadian-Dutch battalion will take responsibility for 
the central portion of this region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is looking at sending a mechanized infantry, including a 
company headquarters, three infantry platoons, a reconnaissance 
platoon, supporting engineers and logistics and combat service 
personnel, amounting to about 400 troops in all, and possibly 
another 200 engineering and logistics personnel as needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report on Canada's peacekeeping efforts in Croatia produced 
a troubling picture.  In that situation our peacekeepers lacked 
lumber and sandbags to adequately protect themselves from the 
regular shelling and gunfire.  They lacked proper medical support 
and sufficient advance surgical team support.  The UN refused for 
weeks to examine complaints from our peacekeepers that the 
drinking water was contaminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to hear the minister indicate in his remarks 
tonight that in this particular mission our troops will be well 
resourced and well supplied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our peacekeepers, their families and communities deserve to know 
that the government has addressed all these issues and is doing 
everything possible to ensure that our peacekeepers are provided 
with all the support possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our thoughts and prayers will be with our peacekeepers and their 
families over the weeks and months to come.  I pray for their 
safety and for their safe and healthy return.  On behalf of all 
Canadians and many beyond our borders, I am both proud and humble 
in offering sincere thanks to our peacekeepers for their efforts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with a mixed sense of both pride and concern that I rise to speak 
tonight on the issue of sending Canadian armed forces 
peacekeepers to Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to advise you, Madam Speaker, that I intend to 
share my time tonight with my colleague for Richmond—Arthabaska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the history of the United Nations' peacekeeping efforts, few 
countries share the type of legacy earned by the people of 
Canada.  Our Canadian peacekeepers are the most requested in the 
world, known for their fairness, their dedication and their great 
skill and ability.  Our peacekeepers have challenged those who 
would challenge freedom and liberty, whether in Europe, Asia, 
Africa or the Middle East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At no time in our nation's history has our service to global 
community or our sense of duty and responsibility ever been 
questioned.  Whenever human rights and democracy were threatened, 
Canada has stood in their defence.  Whenever tyranny and genocide 
have ruled, Canada has sought them out and ended their reign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the importance of this debate tonight, let me be perfectly 
clear.  I will not dispute the merit of sending Canadian armed 
forces peacekeepers to Ethiopia or Eritrea, but I will oppose 
with my very last breath sending our armed forces to any point on 
this globe if they are either unprepared or ill-equipped.  As my 
colleague from Nova Scotia has stated, many of our men and women 
in uniform have been sent before as peacekeepers and they have 
been ill-equipped and unprepared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at a family resource centre on one of the bases in Nova 
Scotia.  I want the Minister of National Defence to know that I 
was really impressed with that family resource centre, but they 
had to have a place for little children so they could feed them, 
because our men and women were taking them to the food banks. 
They had to have counselling there because the fathers were away 
for months at a time.  The government did not give one penny to 
that resource centre.  The people on the base had to go out into 
the community and raise the money in order to put that family 
resource unit together.  It was unbelievable.  When they told me 
about this I was really in shock to think that we had allowed 
this to happen in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often stood in the House and said that when we order our 
men and women in uniform into harm's way, we must not increase 
the risk by supplying them with resources and equipment that are 
insufficient for the tasks we have assigned them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that hon. members are aware of the uncertain 
state of our armed forces.  In the last seven years Canada's 
defence budget has declined steadily as the operational tempo of 
our armed forces has risen.  When I speak of our military's 
operational tempo, I speak of the ratio of time spent in deployed 
missions by our men and women in uniform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is at the very heart of what we debate here tonight.  In 
the 1993-94 fiscal year, the Department of National Defence had a 
budget of $12 billion.  Perhaps this was not ideal but it was 
respectable.  Tragically, by the 1998-99 fiscal year the 
department was cut to a shameful $9.4 billion.  In this past 
decade the defence department's budget has been cut 
substantially, by 23%.  In this same time our military has been 
called upon to battle both the worst of mother nature's arsenal 
and the worst of the world's tyrannies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, the cuts to the military's budget have been unavoidably 
followed by cuts to the numbers in their ranks.  The number of 
CAF personnel has been reduced by about 20% in the same period as 
the budget cuts.  The reduction in the number of civilian 
employees at the Department of National Defence has been a 
staggering 40%.

<A HREF="#LINKT119"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, fewer people with fewer resources are being assigned 
a greater number of missions and more work.  The House knows as 
well or better than I that when we use terms such as missions and 
work we mean risk and danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this past weekend the chief of the defence staff, General 
Maurice Baril, confirmed in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> that there 
was likely to be an additional reduction of 2,000 to 3,000 men and 
women in a process that he called readjustment.  General Baril 
alluded to a grave prediction that up to 10% of all the bases in 
Canada will either be shut down or sold off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best training in the world for young people is in the cadets 
reserve and then right into the military.  They learn respect 
for their fellow Canadian, their fellow man, and they learn respect 
for their country.  If we wanted to turn our country around, we 
would put more of our people in the military.  We would give the 
military more money for the budget.  We would give the minister 
more money for the budget.  We would give Maurice Baril and 
whoever needs it more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those men and women can never come up on this Hill with placards 
when in uniform and fight for what they need, but 
never do I want to see any of our people in the military taking 
their children to a soup kitchen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is with the understanding that about 50% of the defence 
department's infrastructure is aging rapidly and will need to be 
replaced within the next 10 years, at a heroic estimated cost of 
about $1 billion.  That is why they talk about closing bases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are just the details that are known.  Those are just the 
facts and figures that any Canadian can learn by picking up the 
newspaper.  Imagine what might be hidden away beyond the reach of 
the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was around this time last year that we began to see the very 
real need for our help in East Timor.  The House will recall the 
flurry of activity on the part of the Minister of National 
Defence at that time, when out of pure uncompromising necessity 
he had to limit our commitment to other parts of the world to 
make Canadian participation in East Timor possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a proud member of the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs.  It is very close to my heart.  I 
attended committee meetings late last year when the chief of 
defence staff and his officers came and told us of the need to 
limit our international commitment until we had the resources to 
afford them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague for Richmond—Arthabaska is more knowledgeable than 
I in matters related to foreign affairs.  I am certain he will 
have a greater understanding of and appreciation for the 
desperate situation now facing the Ethiopian people, but my duty 
here tonight is to speak for our armed forces and my 
responsibility to the House is to defend the best interests of 
the men and women in uniform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the merits of this mission are outweighed by the risks to our 
troops, then the cost is too great for our country.  If the 
branch of peace can be extended to those desperate people, if a 
better life can be afforded to them by our action, it would be 
cruelly un-Canadian to turn our backs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will finish my remarks here tonight as I began, by praising 
the hard earned and well deserved reputation of Canadian 
peacekeepers.  Here tonight it is under the watchful eye of a 
protective God that we dispatch them to help plant a Canadian 
seed of freedom in a land scorched by the fire of war and soaked 
by the tears of a crestfallen people.  We pray for their safe 
return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Godspeed and good luck.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
evening, two ministers started off this debate, and I would like 
to pay tribute to the tenacity of the Minister of National 
Defence, who has remained with us.  It is greatly appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening we are to debate and vote on the deployment of 
troops with our allies from the Netherlands to a corner of the 
world we rarely hear about, except from journalists who are 
braving the war to show it to us in the papers and on 
television.  There were over 100,000 dead in two years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took some marketing and publicity to get the nations of the 
world to deal with this war.  It is true that not all problems 
can be resolved; still, there are 100,000 dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were one or two UN resolutions.  Yet there are 100,000 
dead.  Why did intervention not come as quickly as in the case 
of Kosovo, for example?  Was it because no aggressor could be 
identified?  No one wanted to take sides.  One hundred thousand 
dead.  What lesson did we take from Rwanda in this?  None.  We 
have let things be.  Men, women and children killed, massacred 
and tortured: 100,000 dead and we did not intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not blame this government. 
I believe that all of parliament, all of Canada and all of the 
world must share the blame.  But 100,000 dead, that is 
unbelievable.  We moved more quickly in Kosovo.  Why?  Was it because 
economic interests justified a western presence there, while 
Canada has virtually no economic ties to that part of the 
African continent?  Who knows? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the government, however.  My colleague from Saint 
John has always been ready to support any peacekeeping 
initiative by the government in power, while pointing out the 
budgetary complications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that the prayers of my colleague from Saint John for the 
men and women over there will be granted.  I hope that the 
wishes of the Minister of National Defence will also come true: 
to get the funding necessary to really have a quality military 
force over there.  That is our wish as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to point out is that there has not been enough 
said about this.  No aggressor has been identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the various UN resolutions, whether it be 1312 or 
earlier ones, what I conclude is that as of July 31 the 
decision was made to send people to set up a human rights unit. 
There is a co-ordinator, and he or she—I do not know which—is going 
to look into the charges of atrocities, abuses, by either side. 
I think that is a good thing, to be honest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we send our men and women from Canada and from the 
Netherlands to that part of the world, there will also be people 
over there who will have to look into the charges and prepare 
files on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is this: are there going to be charges?  Canada is a 
leader in international law.  There has been Louise Arbour, and 
Canada has done a great deal. 
Yet the fact remains that 100,000 persons were killed over a two 
year period. Will charges be laid? My prediction is that, 
unfortunately, no charges will be laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If charges are laid on one side rather than the other, people 
will refuse to let the international community get involved. Who 
will deal with those who killed 100,000 men and women? A report 
will be prepared, but it will be hidden away, because those 
involved will feel that it is better not to accuse anyone than 
to resume the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like some bargaining negotiations that fail. They break 
everything in sight—I am not naming anyone—and then they say it is 
all right, as long as the strike comes to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But here we are talking about human lives. I know that the 
government, parliament and all Canadians are receptive to that. 
We are leaders. If one commits a crime, there should be no haven 
for that person.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no havens, except that unfortunately in this 
specific case, those responsible for these atrocities will 
probably not be charged by the international criminal tribunal. 
It is not the fault of the Department of National Defence, not 
at all. I do not put the blame on the new Minister of Foreign 
Affairs. I cannot do that. It is a joint responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will continue to exert proper pressure. I 
know the limitations of international diplomacy. I know that 
when we sign a treaty or a peace agreement, we must make 
sacrifices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under international law, will rounding up those responsible for 
atrocities be part of the peace negotiations?  If so, all of the 
work Canada, other countries and Madam Justice Arbour have done 
will be for naught.  It is said that 100,000 people were 
massacred in this war between two countries alone.  Millions and 
millions of people have been massacred and mutilated in Africa, 
and the west has done nothing.  I am not talking about the rest 
of the world; I am talking about the African continent.  To get 
something done, journalists equipped with cameras would have to 
be sent to every corner of every country on the African 
continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I draw attention to the efforts by the minister of 
defence.  However, it is said that there can be no negotiation 
with terrorists.  But sometimes, negotiation is necessary. 
Should we negotiate with the people responsible for the 
massacres?  For peace, perhaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we say perhaps, we scrap all the efforts at ensuring 
accountability in international law.  I know that the people in 
the government know this.  They know very well that the people 
in this party also know about the basic right that applies to 
the world as a whole, which is the right to life.  When this 
right is taken away, international law must come into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join with my colleague from Saint John in the hope that the 
men and women who will be there will be absolutely safe and that 
the six month mandate is a success.  It will probably be renewed 
with other countries.  Canada has a truly magnificent 
international reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House, in this party, we support this 
initiative of the Minister of National Defence or the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs or the government to have Canada maintain and in 
fact increase its credibility and not simply observe massacres 
or the aftermath of war and indeed be a country that ensures peace 
ahead of any armed conflict.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the 
member for Hillsborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased and proud this evening to participate in this 
debate and obviously to support the government's position to send 
peacekeepers to Ethiopia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister responsible for the Canadian International 
Development Agency, I have been dealing with this area for some 
time, both with respect to the disastrous effects that the famine 
has had, which is a natural disaster as a result of drought in 
this region both in Eritrea as well as in Ethiopia, compounded 
with the war that exists between these two countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have suffered on both sides.  In Eritrea there are about 
one million people who have been displaced within the country as 
well as in Ethiopia.  The war has caused a tremendous amount of 
hardship which was compounded by the famine.  Safety in the area 
to provide assistance has been very difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very thankful and very proud that my department, together 
with other departments in the Government of Canada and other 
partners, have managed to finally negotiate a peace agreement 
in this area.  I congratulate the two countries and hope that 
this of course will hold.  That is why I support wholeheartedly 
Canada's participation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian peacekeepers are, from what I saw when I travelled to 
Kosovo, a group of soldiers who are not only welcome but who 
become part of the community.  In Kosovo they have become loved 
partners of the children of Kosovo.  They have helped to rebuild 
the schools as well as doing their jobs as peacekeepers and 
keeping the young people away from mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIDA has already announced $200,000 to the UN mine co-ordination 
centre, $100,000 for Eritrea and the other $100,000 for Ethiopia. 
Unfortunately both sides have laid an untold number of land mines 
in the area and this has to be addressed very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month Canada made an important investment in peace in a 
broader sense.  I am referring, of course, to the International 
Conference on War-Affected Children which was held in Winnipeg. 
Children and women are very much the people who pay the highest 
price in these circumstances.  The conference was attended by 
Eritrean ministers and I urged them to sign and ratify the land 
mines treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to note that Ethiopia has signed the treaty and we 
still look forward to its early ratification.  First and 
foremost, however, we look forward to both governments taking a 
leadership role in removing the mines laid during the conflict, 
which are major threats to Ethiopian and Eritrean people, 
especially children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both countries have a responsibility to utilize the strength of 
their soldiers who are no longer involved in hostilities and 
hopefully will continue to not be involved in hostilities but 
who will direct their energies toward the removal of the land mines 
with the assistance of the UN mine action committee which can 
certainly train, supervise and assist together with Canadian 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the UN human development index, these two countries 
rank among the 15 poorest countries in the world.  Already this 
year, in order to assist with the disasters that have occurred in 
that country, natural disasters, famine, as well as having the 
situation compounded by the war, Canada has provided $25 million 
in assistance to meet the needs of the drought in war affected 
populations in the Horn of Africa.  Most of that was provided to 
both Eritrea and Ethiopia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last conference on war affected children, I made a 
commitment that from now on when peacekeepers go into an area we 
will also finance a child protection program that will be part of 
the peacekeeping unit.  It is very important to understand that 
when peacekeepers move into an area there are people in various 
camps to separate the children and women.  We want to be able to 
assist and to protect children from any situations that might arise 
and ensure that they are assisted with rehabilitation, education 
and nutrition.  Most children in this situation have suffered 
tremendously from malnutrition, from fear and, quite often, are not 
just physical abused, but as a result of war are injured in 
many different ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, I have asked my department to be very much 
involved.  One of my advisers in this area is General Dallaire 
who will be working with me to define and shape some of the 
programs that we will be delivering to this region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, General Dallaire is someone who has a great 
deal of expertise in the field with respect to peacekeeping.  He 
also has a great deal of understanding of what happens to 
children and people when they are affected by war and when they 
have gone through a very long period of hostilities.  He knows 
about the kind of assistance that is required to assist people to 
rebuild their lives slowly and be able to function again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My department and CIDA will be looking to working very closely 
with the peacekeepers in terms of protecting the children, 
providing the medical health care they require, the food aid, the 
nutrition, the education, the rehabilitation and possibly 
assistance in the area of shelter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very critical to understand that we must begin to push 
very hard for the elimination of land mines.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the land has not been tilled as a result of the war and 
the drought.  The land that could be tilled and could be planted 
is full of land mines.  If we do not de-mine as quickly as we can 
and with the assistance of the two military groups that were 
involved in laying many of these land mines, crops will not be 
planted.  That means yet another season of crops will be missed, 
which will exacerbate the famine and the food shortage in the 
region as they exist today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to say that the staff at CIDA and our partners, 
the NGOs that we worked with, have been in the field for a very 
long time to assist with the famine as much as they could and 
with some of the displaced people in the camps.  They will now be 
in a position to go in with our peacekeepers and make a much 
bigger difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud today to support the Minister of National Defence and 
the Government of Canada with the initiative.  I believe in it 
very strongly, having seen what happens to people when I visited 
some of the areas of conflict in Africa.  I believe that Canada 
should be there.  CIDA will be there to assist side by side in 
ensuring that people can get back to some normalcy of life. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as 
a Canadian and as a parliamentarian I am very proud to rise in 
the House tonight to speak in support of the motion before us on 
possible Canadian peacekeeping activities in Ethiopia and 
Eritrea.  Indeed it is an historic moment every time Canada 
deploys in an international operation such as this one.  It 
reaffirms in no uncertain terms our steadfast commitment to world 
peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By supporting the proposal before the House we will be 
continuing in the fine Canadian tradition of coming to the aid of 
those in need.  By participating in the United Nations mission to 
Ethiopia and Eritrea we will be showing the world that we not 
only speak of peace but we act on it as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard today from some members of the House why this 
mission is important.  After years of bloody war, an estimated 
100,000 or more dead and about 1.5 million displaced, the 
fighting has finally stopped.  What is more, the parties are now 
looking for help in their bid to establish a lasting peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a moral standpoint there are very good reasons to 
participate in this mission.  Furthermore, from a military 
perspective this mission is well within our means.  In other 
words, we have both the will and the military potential to 
successfully contribute to this UN operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditions on the ground in Ethiopia and Eritrea are ready 
for a peacekeeping force.  The parties have signed the agreement 
on cessation of hostilities and have called for a UN mission to 
monitor and ensure this agreement.  The parties are prepared for 
peace and we are well placed to respond to their call for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With an end to open hostilities there is now little threat posed 
by the warring parties.  In fact, the greatest dangers that our 
forces anticipate on this proposed mission are the harsh 
operating conditions, disease and unexploded munitions.  These 
are threats that with proper precautions can be minimized and 
effectively managed by professional forces such as ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Canadian forces personnel would be well prepared for 
any possible contingency.  They would receive thorough 
pre-deployment training, enabling them to deal effectively with 
everything from land mines to refugees.  They would have the 
necessary equipment and support required to carry out their tasks 
effectively and safely.  They would be physically prepared for 
the harsh conditions on the Horn of Africa with all the requisite 
medical support and attention this entails.  The military 
preconditions are right for this mission.  Furthermore, the 
proposed concept of the operation is sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian soldiers would be there for six months only.  This 
would ensure that our expertise is used at the most critical 
moment in the initial months of the mission.  It would also 
ensure that the Canadian commitment of soldiers and resources 
would be temporary and would not place unreasonable long term 
demands on our forces. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT124"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada would be in good company.  The proposed mission calls for 
the Canadian forces to operate alongside an experienced and 
professional allied force, that of the Netherlands, and under the 
operational command of the deployed standby forces high readiness 
brigade, better known as SHIRBRIG, from its headquarters.  This, 
along with robust rules of engagement, would ensure that deployed 
Canadian forces are provided with the full support, leadership 
and authority required to effectively carry out their mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members may know, the proposal before the House calls for 
a company group of approximately 400 personnel to be committed to 
the United Nations mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.  Given the 
Canadian forces current operational tempo, this deployment is 
achievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's rationalization of overseas commitments is 
largely complete.  The high operational tempo experienced just a 
year ago when close to 4,500 Canadian forces personnel were in 
operation is now behind us.  This being said, the Canadian forces 
remain busy currently with about 2,500 personnel on overseas 
deployments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed commitment of approximately 400 personnel is 
therefore within our means.  By providing a company group to the 
Dutch battalion, Canada would be making a substantial 
contribution to the overall success of the mission, while at the 
same time guarding the quality of life of its military personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to call once again on all members of the House to 
support the government's proposed involvement in the UN mission 
in Ethiopia and Eritrea.  Our help is needed.  Our soldiers are 
prepared and our objectives are achievable.  Let us not fail to 
respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a few moments to thank and say farewell to my 
colleagues on the last time that I will be speaking in this 
glorious Chamber.  Over the last 12 years in parliament I have 
met some wonderful people on all sides of the House.  My 
opposition colleagues, even in the toughest of times, have shown 
me non-partisan respect.  I certainly appreciate this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to recognize my own colleagues.  I have met 
some lifelong friends that I will always hold close to my heart. 
I thank both the staff and members I have worked with in my 
capacity as parliamentary secretary to both veterans affairs and 
labour.  I also thank those I have worked with in the Canadian 
NATO Parliamentary Association and on the Standing Committee on 
National Defence and Veterans Affairs.  I thank them all for 
their help, for their advice and for their friendship.  I have 
had the most remarkable 12 years in the House and I have been 
privileged to serve the people of my riding of Hillsborough and 
the people of this great nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of the motion before us 
respecting possible Canadian peacekeeping activities in Ethiopia 
and Eritrea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the government's position in this regard.  As a member 
of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade I have followed this conflict.  I have followed it as my 
friends in the Ethiopian and Eritrean community spoke to me about 
the loss of lives and the agony of the situation in those two 
countries.  Since the parties are prepared for peace, as 
Canadians we cannot but support this effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reinforce some of the points mentioned by the Minister of 
National Defence in describing Canada's proposed military 
contribution to the UN mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.  It is 
important to restate some of the major points, bearing in mind 
that the final number of troops, the cost, et cetera, remain to 
be determined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many of us know and as we have heard here tonight from 
various speakers, the conditions and opportunity for a UN 
sponsored peacekeeping mission to Ethiopia and Eritrea began to 
take shape this past four months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 18 Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a cessation of 
hostilities agreement sponsored by the Organization of African Unity.  This 
agreement called upon the UN to establish a peacekeeping mission. 
In response, UN security council resolution 1312, adopted 
unanimously on July 31, authorized a mission consisting of up to 
100 military observers to deploy to Ethiopia and Eritrea in 
anticipation of a larger peacekeeping operation.

<A HREF="#LINKT125"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tasks of this initial mission are:  to establish and 
maintain liaison with the parties; to visit the parties' military 
headquarters and other units in all areas of operation of the 
peacekeeping mission; to establish and put into operation the 
mechanism for verifying the cessation of hostilities; to prepare 
for the establishment of a military co-ordination commission 
provided for in the cessation of hostilities agreement; and to 
assist in the planning for a future peacekeeping operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The security council has called on Ethiopia and Eritrea to 
provide this advance mission with access, assistance, support, 
and protection required in the performance of its duties.  Many 
of my constituents underlined that these are tremendously 
important:  access, assistance, support and protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two countries are also called upon to facilitate the 
deployment of mine action experts and the assets under the UN 
mine action service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The security council has stressed the importance of a rapid 
delimitation and demarcation of the common border between 
Ethiopia and Eritrea in accordance with the Organization of 
African Unity framework agreement of 1998 and the cessation of 
hostilities agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six members of the Canadian forces are already committed to this 
mission.  One lieutenant-colonel is already in theatre as the 
chief operations officer in support of the UN mission 
headquarters there.  He has already been heavily involved in the 
initial deployment of military observers throughout the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through discussion we know that we have five of our own military 
observers about to deploy.  A Canadian major was also briefly 
deployed as part of a UN team that helped to train the initial 
cadre of observers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 15, following a technical assessment by the team of 
observers, the UN security council adopted resolution 1320 
authorizing the establishment of a UN mission to Ethiopia and 
Eritrea.  This resolution precipitated our current proposal to 
make further Canadian contributions to the UN mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main Canadian forces contribution would be a mechanized 
infantry company group.  This would include a company 
headquarters and three infantry platoons equipped with armoured 
personnel carriers.  It would also have engineering and logistics 
support and other combat service support.  It may also include a 
reconnaissance platoon equipped with our Coyote vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that we as Canadian peacekeepers are equipped to carry 
out this mission.  With regard to the total number of personnel 
deployed, as I said earlier we are still uncertain at this point, 
but there is an approximate number of 400 suggested.  In 
addition, we are prepared to deploy, if needed and for a brief 
period, a surge of up to 200 engineers and logisticians to 
establish the initial basic infrastructure such as shelter and 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will know more after we have conducted our reconnaissance 
mission.  It is hoped that the Minister of National Defence will 
be notifying the House and Canadians as to the progress of this 
mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also pointed out that the Canadian mechanized 
company group would be deployed as an integral part of a Dutch 
battalion operating in the central region under the UN mission 
headquarters.  They will be joining other battalions from Jordan 
and from Kenya under the UN mission headquarters in the eastern 
and the western regions. 
The mission headquarters would have at its core the military 
headquarters staff from the standby high readiness brigade, or 
SHIRBRIG.  Canada has committed up to seven officers to the 
planning element of this staff.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with any deployment Canada would have its own national 
command and support elements in place in the combined 
Dutch-Canadian battalion.  We have learned lessons from other 
peacekeeping areas we have been in and recognize that being under 
our own national command is important to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deploying alongside the Dutch forces is a particular point of 
strength in this proposed peacekeeping mission.  Our forces would 
be in very good company, operating alongside professional, well 
equipped and well led soldiers.  We also have been working very 
closely with the government of the Netherlands on mission 
planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would not be a long term commitment for Canada.  The 
Canadian company group would be deployed for a period of no more 
than six months.  The UN is well aware of our intent to hold to 
this six month commitment and to thereafter return our forces to 
Canada.  Other speakers tonight mentioned the importance of our 
going in, getting the job done and safely coming out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following pre-deployment preparations and training, the company 
group could be ready to leave Canada in 45 days to 60 days from 
the time the government decides to deploy.  Initial preparations 
are already under way.  If a decision is made to deploy, Canadian 
and Dutch troops would start arriving in theatre at the end of 
November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once in Africa, Canadian forces would complete any necessary 
collective training with the Dutch contingent before commencing 
operations.  It could take up to 25 days to get equipment.  We 
know we have not only to fly in equipment but sail it in from 
this region to the African region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on our initial planning, the department estimates that the 
incremental cost of this proposed operation will be about $60 
million for the six month period.  I would imagine this is $60 
million Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling upon the men and women of the Canadian forces to 
demonstrate our resolve in maintaining peace and stability in a 
troubled region of the world.  Not many times do we see the 
western world running to the assistance of Africa, but this is 
one instance where I must commend the decision we are taking 
tonight to support that peace effort.  Such decisions are not 
taken lightly by the government and the House.  Everyone's 
support today is important to Canada and to our common goal of 
peace building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with and ask hon. members to support the government's 
proposal to deploy the Canadian forces to a UN mission in 
Ethiopia and Eritrea.  Let us all pray that this six month 
mandate will be successful and that at the end of those six 
months we can say with the old psalmist “Peace at last”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  There being no 
further members rising, pursuant to order made earlier this day, 
the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
