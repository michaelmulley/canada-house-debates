</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to remind my colleagues and all Canadians 
that June is seniors' month pretty well across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an opportunity for all of us to reflect on the positive 
aspects of population aging and to recognize the contribution 
seniors make to the life of the family, the community and 
society in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role seniors play is irreplaceable.  Within the family, they 
provide care and support.  They provide advice.  They provide a 
continuity and pass on knowledge and values from one generation 
to another. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, many seniors volunteer their fine efforts to good causes. 
In fact, seniors represent the age group that spends the most 
time volunteering.  Next year will be another opportune time to 
pay them tribute, since 2001 has been declared the International 
Year of Volunteers. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this context that I invite Canadians to pay tribute to 
seniors throughout the month of June.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, six months ago we sat in the House 
vigorously debating the Nisga'a Final Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party argued that the Nisga'a treaty was poor public policy, 
that it would be a flawed model for the more than 50 treaties 
still to be signed in British Columbia, and that the final cost 
would be beyond reason and beyond the capacity of Canadian 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, these predictions are already coming true.  Last 
week we learned that the Sechelt Band in British Columbia is 
reneging on its treaty agreement in principle, believing it can 
obtain more now that Nisga'a has set the standard.  Other bands 
will legitimately wish to reopen treaty agreements to obtain what 
Nisga'a promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After seven years in power this government has demonstrated no 
competence to deal with aboriginal issues.  A Canadian Alliance 
government would provide aboriginals with the same rights as 
other Canadians, including private ownership of property, 
democratic accountability for finances and transparency in treaty 
negotiations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
marks Clean Air Day 2000 in the middle of Canada's Environment 
Week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this year's theme, “Community Action on Clean Air and 
Climate Change”, Canadians across the country are doing their 
bit for cleaner air and to reduce climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today 18 communities joined Canada's “Commuter Challenges”. 
They are adopting healthy and environmentally sustainable 
transportation alternatives to the single passenger car and 
reducing harmful air emissions.  They are walking, cycling, 
telecommuting, carpooling, using public transit and making a huge 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 61 transit companies are involved in the campaign and 
it culminates today with activities to encourage the use of 
public transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just think, one busload of passengers takes 40 vehicles off the 
road during rush hour, saves 70,000 litres of fuel and avoids 175 
tonnes of emissions a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations to all those who are participating today and to 
Canada's Minister of the Environment for delivering on our Speech 
from the Throne commitment for action on environmental issues.

have the privilege and pleasure today to honour a young Canadian 
entrepreneur who is making a difference in the world of high 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Paul Atkinson is a local St. Catharines boy who, at the age 
of 35, has just sold Solect Technology Group Inc. for $1.15 
billion, making it the largest acquisition of a technology 
related private company in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paul Atkinson has become a local hero and respected entrepreneur 
in a region where economic success has been achieved by utilizing 
our human capital:  the dedicated business people, entrepreneurs, 
educators, investors and government officials who work together 
to make things happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These same people got together last week to honour Paul Atkinson 
and to launch the Atkinson Centre for Entrepreneurship.  The 
centre will be chaired by Mr. Atkinson and will focus on 
enhancing opportunities for e-commerce and Internet centred 
businesses.  It will be a major boost for high tech and 
e-commerce entrepreneurs in Niagara, and a welcome addition to 
our small business infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations to Paul Atkinson on his successes to date and on 
the continuation of his work and dedication.

is at the wheel, the governments of Canada and Quebec are 
putting people squarely at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments are agreeing to lengthening rest time to 10 
hours, but are also lengthening the work period to 14 hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most accidents charged to truck drivers occur after 12 hours of 
driving.  In the case of Canada's major trucking firms, the 
period is 12 hours of work that includes a rest break of two 
hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments will have to listen carefully to the 
recommendations by the truckers and by Canadian and Quebec 
unions.  For a trucker to drive 14 hours a day is too much.

acute care beds at the Princeton Regional Hospital.  That is a

caregiving activities.  Acute care patients will now have to 
travel at least an hour and a half to receive the medical

care system reeling from $21 billion in federal Liberal 
government cuts since 1993.  The Liberal government's token 
effort in the budget to increase funding over five years is only 
a fraction of what is actually needed.

it not?  The HRD minister continually claims that she is being 
really open about the disaster that she is responsible for.  The 
facts do not lie.  The executive summary of the billion dollar 
bungle audit, dated last August 9, funnily enough states:  “An 
additional 29 transitional jobs fund files were reviewed bringing 
the total TJF files to 49” but “only 20 were included in order 
not to skew the global results”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know just how bad were those files that removing

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

some details here.  Indeed, if the hon. member would take the 
time to understand what the internal audit was all about, it was 
not just about one program.  It was about seven different 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we found was that in all of those we had administrative 
failings.  What we were looking at was the work of all the grants 
and contributions in the department.  What we found was that we 
had to do a better job.  We made it public and we are improving 
the system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

you can just simply exclude 29 files.  Obviously the worst news 
of all was just simply excluded from that audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that 29 files were removed from the audit report 
because they would “skew the global results”.  That comes right 
out of the document.  Is it not something that the taxpayer is

off.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

that we reviewed 17,000 of all the active files in the department 
and still indeed found that there were $6,500 in overpayments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really was not about money.  It was about administration and 
the internal audit gave us the right direction.  It said it was 
about paper, very important paper that was missing, and we have

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

for, nothing to worry about.  She said there was really nothing 
for anybody to sweat about.  She says it is about paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found that the audit deliberately left off 29 files.  I am 
sure they were just full of paper.  Funny they did not make it 
into the audit.  I would like to ask her again:  How bad were 
those 29 files that she left off so that they could make this 
billion dollar bungle look good? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

reviewing was the administration of those programs.  Indeed we 
did find some shortcomings, some significant shortcomings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this is all about is a government that is prepared to make

through my department that 10,000 pages, 10,000 pages, listing 
all the grants and contributions from my department into ridings

happy with what Ottawa is offering, and that he will not let

third way?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Government of Quebec is free to top this up, if it is very

that.

open to all, provides higher benefits and has a maximum of

not closed the door a bit too hastily, and does he not think

to ask the Minister of the Environment what the government is 
doing about its environmental responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1970 parliament passed the Canada Water Act.  It requires 
that the government table an annual report on water quality.  Yet 
four years in a row the government failed to do that.  It has 
ignored the law.

has the government refused to table the annual water quality

<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the water quality standards in Canada are set by a

federal government.  Health Canada chairs that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standards that are set are for a number of potential

parts per million; in other words a total ban on the release of 
any water that might be affected by E. coli.

still waiting to hear why the government has not tabled its

of the world's leading experts in water, condemns Canada's 
cavalier attitude to water and its lack of a national water 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the minister spoke about factory farms and their 
effect on water quality.  Let me say we agree.  That is why we 
tried to amend the Canadian Environmental Protection Act to

Mr. Speaker, it is customary in the House when legislation is 
being debated for all points of view to be put forward.  If the 
hon. member was not here, or did not hear when she was here, 
perhaps there would be an explanation for why she does not know 
what was said when this legislation was debated.

the parental leave program is an excellent one.  If there are 
other problems with social development policy in Quebec, the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today is the second annual Clean Air Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment met with his provincial 
colleagues earlier this week to discuss among other things the 
air in Canada.  In Windsor—St. Clair we are very concerned about 
the air we breathe. Can the Minister of the Environment tell the 
House what action we can expect which will improve the air that 
Canadians breathe? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, after two days of discussions with my provincial and 
territorial colleagues in Quebec City, we made substantial 
improvements with respect to air quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the province of Ontario's change of 
position.  It has altered the schedule for reduction of the ozone 
problem in Ontario.  We now will have a 45% improvement over the 
next 10 years rather than 15. In addition the province has said 
that it will drop that date to 2005 if I, as Minister of the 
Environment, and my colleague the Minister of Foreign Affairs are 
successful in negotiating an effective ozone annex to the clean 
air agreement with the United States, which we fully intend to do 
before November.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we just heard the Minister of the Environment claim 
that the government is taking responsibility in the area of 
drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. minister, what has the government 
done to clean up the water systems on the 171 aboriginal reserve 
communities, systems which were identified in 1995 by Health 
Canada as defective? 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Briefly, Mr. Speaker, over the last five years some $400 million 
of federal money has been devoted to that problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian

there has been $400 million spent to address that problem. Let

the problem has been corrected. 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member mentioned, I think the number he 
used was 171 different reserves.  Mr. Speaker, as you know, I 
only have 35 seconds but I would be glad to provide him—

in Toronto.  It is a perfect opportunity for the government to 
back up its big talk finally with some action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the minister again, will she come to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

gaseous emissions over a very important issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for seven years the government has watched while the 
combat capability of our armed forces went into decay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First the government produced a white paper and then refused to 
fund the forces to fulfil their missions.  Then it began to slash 
personnel levels to a point where they can no longer even 
function as a force because they have been overtasked.  They had 
to sell off aircraft and they mothballed ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister acknowledge that the infusion of $2

avoid the eventual collapse of the Canadian armed forces? 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

in the last election, those members were saying there should be 
$1 billion in further cuts to defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to take it seriously when that party on the one hand 
says we should cut, cut, cut our tax revenues and on the other

is for the minister responsible for Canadians with disabilities. 
Currently if any recipient of CPP disability does limited 
volunteer work for any community agency, there is no action taken 
by CPP because volunteering is recognized as a useful and 
necessary experience.  But if a recipient receives any payment of 
any kind for his or her efforts, CPP is immediately cut off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister tell the House why her ministry encourages 
those with disabilities to volunteer, but punishes them for 
trying to work? 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would remind the hon. member that the 
CPP disability pension is like a pension.  It is a pension of 
last resort as if a person is retired.  Having said that, it is 
extraordinarily important for us to work with Canadians with 
disabilities to find effective ways of ensuring that they can 
participate in the Canadian economy and that they can contribute 
to their country and to their own needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the work of the hon. member and those on the

yesterday Hon. John Fraser's report on land forces reserves

states a $30 million cut in reserve pay this year and next year a 
$30 million input in equipment and rerolling.

restructuring.  We want to revitalize the reserves.  That is why 
I commissioned the report from Mr. Fraser and his team.  I think 
he has come in with an excellent set of recommendations that will

this bill with the co-operation of all members of the committee

government is paying just 13.5% of health care costs and that the 
federal Liberals opened the door to two tier American style 
health care by cutting a secret deal with the province of 
Alberta, which in turn paved the way for Alberta's bill 11.

public health care in Canada and, therefore, they call upon

Ontario, where the loss would be multiplied.

Mr. Speaker, discussions have taken place between all parties and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want refer to a matter of privilege that was raised on 
Monday of this week by the Chair and, more important, by the 
Canadian Alliance member for Fraser Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was about to head over to the doctor to have my foot looked 
at as a result of a very good game of soccer last night with the 
pages.  They were a little zealous in their duty and I believe 
their aim was to reduce the number of members who played in that 
event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here because I want to give some clarification on Bill C-201. 
To understand this, Bill C-201 is at the report stage.  It was, 
however, sent back from committee as a blank piece of paper. This 
is the first time the House has ever dealt with a situation 
wherein a committee has deemed, in its wisdom, to do what the wider 
parliament did not do and to return a blank piece of paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, for a variety of dates, circumstances and 
other reasons, we have been trying to find an amenable way to 
restore through amendments the effect of Bill C-201. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that those who raised this issue are somewhat 
incognizant of the fact that their own party, the Canadian 
Alliance, stood four square behind the destruction of Bill C-201, 
a bill that ironically deals with changes in the Competition Act 
for predatory pricing, the very thing that Microsoft will be 
facing in the United States in the next little while.  The subtle 
differences between our two jurisdictions are important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a parliament are dealing with rather new territory.  We 
are really creating a new path as far as Private Members' 
Business is concerned.  I believe this is an important bill and a 
good bill.  We have taken measures, on a number of occasions in 
the past, to ensure that notice was given so that Private 
Members' Business could be substituted with other more ready 
bills.  I remember one instance when there was an illness. I 
hope to have a resolution in the near future on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that we are dealing with a 
situation that we have never seen before wherein we have those 
who are concerned about debating this bill actually having had a 
hand in gutting the bill in the first instance through the 
industry committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that is satisfactory, and I would hope that those who have 
any questions about Bill C-201 in the first instance will explain 
why they want to bring up the issue of Bill C-201 beyond the 
question of simple privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for his 
comments.  I know the Speaker, who has taken this matter under 
advisement, was looking forward to hearing from the hon. member. 
His comments will be noted and the Speaker will render a decision 
on this matter in due course.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  I agree 
that summer is knocking at the door and that the government is in 
a hurry to get things done, but I want to make sure I understand 
things properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you asked if we were ready for the question, five Bloc 
Quebecois members rose to express their disagreement.  I would 
like to know your decision on this point or hear it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I regret to inform the hon. member that, 
when the Chair put the question, I asked the House to answer yea 
or nay according to its pleasure.  I then said “In my opinion, 
the yeas have it”.  Five members had not risen at that point.  I 
am sorry, but I counted the members and there were not five. That 
is the only reason I asked “When will the bill be read the third 
time?”  And that is how it went.  We are now at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  With all 
due respect to the Chair, we were five members, and it is the 
prerogative of the members to call for a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in parliament and we would not understand that you impede 
our ability to vote.  We were five members, and I ask you to 
reconsider your decision so that we may continue our debate 
calmly as we ought.  We were five members and we want to vote on 
this question.  This is the prerogative of the Bloc Quebecois to 
request it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do not agree with the hon. member that 
it is the prerogative of just anyone in the House to call for a 
vote.  However, five members of this House must rise, and five 
had not risen when I put the question.  I am sure that, while I 
was saying “I declare the motion carried”, other members 
arrived, but it was too late.  The decision has been made and 
that is the end of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. To 
help those who are watching us and the members opposite 
understand what is going on, I wonder if the Chair or the clerk 
could clarify under the standing orders whether when a vote is 
called it is necessary for a member to be in his or her own 
seat? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary to be standing and to say that we want to vote. 
I believe this is what happened earlier when five Bloc Quebecois 
members stood up asking for one. The hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve told the Chair that he was present and he 
was indeed present. I would not want the call of summer to make 
us proceed too quickly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, if you will give me a few 
seconds, I first want to say that I understand very well and I 
think you were right in how you interpreted the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also appreciate the fact that the Bloc Quebecois still 
continues to co-operate regarding Bill C-25. Even if we did not 
have the opportunity to ask for a recorded division, under the 
rules that were properly interpreted by the Chair, I always 
appreciate their co-operation and that of the other parties 
because it allows us to go ahead with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I appreciate the comments made by all the 
members on this issue but I would like to find the applicable 
standing order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. If you 
agree, I propose that we carry on with the business of the House 
and that the Chair gets back to this issue later on. We do not 
want to delay the House in its proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. When I issued my 
ruling, there were not five members who had risen. This is the 
only reason why I made that ruling. I am aware of course that 
five members must rise. If five members rise, there is a recorded 
division. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the 
House today at third reading of Bill C-25, the 1999 income tax 
amendments act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members are familiar with this legislation so I will not 
take up valuable House time discussing the bill in any detail. 
Instead, I will briefly review the highlights of the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill brings into force many of the tax 
measures that were announced in the 1999 budget, together with 
some non-budget tax measures.  For those hon. members wondering 
about the tax measures in the 2000 budget, they will be 
contained in separate legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one of the government's budgets to date have provided 
targeted tax relief designed to achieve key social and economic 
goals.  With the deficit eliminated in 1997-98, the door was 
subsequently opened to the introduction of some broad based tax 
relief measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax measures in the 1999 budget build on those that were 
introduced in previous budgets.  Most important, as members of 
the House know, for the first time since 1965 the 1999 budget 
provides tax relief for every taxpayer without the government 
having to borrow money to pay for it and, as with the previous 
relief measures, low and middle income Canadians benefit the 
most. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will be aware of the government's commitment to 
provide ongoing tax relief to Canadians as we can afford it. Hon. 
members will also know that the Minister of Finance followed 
through on the promise he made in the fall fiscal and economic 
update and announced a five year tax reduction plan in budget 
2000. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan will provide real and lasting tax reductions for 
Canadians and ensure that all taxpayers will see their taxes 
reduced in a manner consistent with the government's tax-cutting 
principles.  These measures, however, will be introduced under 
separate legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we did in eliminating the deficit, the tax reduction plan 
will be achieved as quickly as possible—and further expanded as 
resources permit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we pass this bill without delay. Let me 
continue my remarks by outlining the measures in this bill that 
stem from the 1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 includes three general tax relief measures which, 
subject to this legislation being enacted, all took effect on 
July 1, 1999.  The amount of income Canadians can receive tax 
free is increased.  This amount is increased further in the 2000 
budget, a provision that will be contained in separate 
legislation.  The supplement to personal amounts provided for low 
income taxpayers in the 1998 budget is extended to all taxpayers 
and increased by a further $175.  Bill C-25 eliminates the 
general 3% surtax for all taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing to benefit the most from these measures are low income 
earners.  A single filer with an income of $15,000 for example 
will pay 15% less federal tax, while a similar person earning 
$30,000 will pay 6% less tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Income splitting with minor children is also covered in this 
bill.  Income splitting occurs when high income individuals 
divert income to low income earners, generally family members, to 
avoid tax.  In most cases only high income individuals with 
dependants reap any tax benefits from income splitting. Bill C-25 
rectifies this situation by introducing a special tax that is 
specifically directed at structures designed to split income with 
minors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals age 17 and under will have to pay this special tax 
on any taxable dividends or any benefits on unlisted shares of 
Canadian and foreign companies that they receive from a trust or 
partnership.  In addition, income they receive from a partnership 
or trust that comes from a business carried on by a relative will 
also be subject to this special tax. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 also deals with the taxation of retroactive lump-sum 
payments.  These payments are taxed in the year they are 
received, even though a significant portion may relate to prior 
years.  Because of the progressivity of the tax system, an 
individual's tax liability on these payments may be higher than 
if they had been made, and taxed, year by year as the income 
arose. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will now be a special relieving mechanism in place to 
compute the tax on qualifying retroactive lump sum payments where 
those payments are $3,000 or more in a given year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 also effects a change on the tax treatment of 
Hutterite colonies.  For tax purposes, Hutterite colonies are 
viewed as communal organizations and subject to section 143 of 
the Income Tax Act.  The intent is that their income be taxed at 
roughly the same level as farming income earned outside these 
organizations by allocating colony income among adult members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now, income in a communal organization was allocated to 
only one designated spouse in a family.  To allow for the tax 
burden on communal organizations to be reduced and more fairly 
distributed, Bill C-25 provides for income to be allocated to 
each spouse in the family.  This change will help maintain 
roughly equivalent taxation on income earned by Hutterite 
colonies and other groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 also contains a number of other tax provisions that 
were included in the 1999 budget. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third parties making false statements that could be used for tax 
purposes will now be subject to two new civil penalties.  One 
deals with tax shelter and other tax-planning arrangements; the 
second concerns advising or participating in a false tax filing.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will now be a culpable conduct test—consistent with what 
the courts have used in the past when applying civil penalties 
to taxpayers—along with a “reliance in good faith” exception to 
the test. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some discussion about the culpable conduct test. 
I would like to briefly describe for the House and for Canadians 
what it is and what it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Culpable conduct as defined in the act means conduct, whether an 
act or a failure to act, that (a) is tantamount to intentional 
conduct, (b) shows an indifference as to whether this act is 
complied with, or (c) shows a wilful, reckless or wanton 
disregard of law. I am sure members of the House will agree that 
conduct such as this is truly not acceptable.  Honest errors of 
omission or commission will not be applicable under the culpable 
conduct test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 also addresses the tax situation that arises when an 
individual dies and the value of their RRSP or RRIF is included 
in their income for the year of their death.  When there is a 
surviving spouse but RRSPs and RRIFs have been left to dependent 
children, it is the children, not the deceased's estate, who will 
now be responsible for any resulting income inclusions.  With 
income tax rates for dependent children usually lower, this 
provision will help them when a parent dies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the bill the care of people with severe disabilities 
living in a group home, therapy for those with severe 
disabilities, and tutoring for the learning disabled will now be 
covered under the medical expense tax credit. In addition, 
talking text books for people with perceptual disabilities who 
are enrolled at educational institutions will be included on the 
eligible equipment list for persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporations producing electrical energy for sale or steam for 
use in such production will now be eligible for the manufacturing 
and processing profits tax credit.  This measure will help the 
electricity generating sector to become more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next measure will also help corporations. Faced with 
multiple taxation years being reassessed at the same time, 
corporations are often caught in situations where refund interest 
is taxable while arrears interest is non-deductible.  There will 
now be a relieving mechanism in place so corporations can ask for 
such amounts to be offset for interest calculation purposes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another component in Bill C-25 is designed to help the Canadian 
investment services industry compete more effectively 
internationally.  A new rule will ensure that, subject to 
conditions, if a non-resident hires a Canadian firm to provide 
certain investment services, the non-resident is not, for that 
reason alone, considered to be carrying on business in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian firms serving offshore clients will continue to pay tax 
in Canada on their profits.  Non-residents who receive income 
from Canadian sources will continue to be subject to Canadian 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other measures in the bill will encourage labour sponsored 
venture capital corporations to focus more on small business 
investments under the 12% part VI surcharge on large deposit 
making institutions.  The 12% part VI surcharge on large deposit 
making institutions is being extended further to October 31, 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated at the beginning of my remarks, this bill also 
contains some non-budget tax measures.  One exempts the income of 
the trust that has been established by the federal, provincial 
and territorial governments to provide compensation to hepatitis 
C victims from income taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill ensures that for tax purposes cash 
demutualization benefits are treated as dividends and therefore 
are subject to the low dividend rate.  While there is no 
immediate tax benefit associated with a policyholder receiving a 
share as a demutualization benefit, a capital gain would be 
recognized once the share is sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I encourage my hon. colleagues to support the 
bill.  Each of these measures improves the operation of the tax 
system and each adheres to the principle of tax fairness. 
Together the measures introduced in the 1997, 1998 and 1999 
budgets reduce the income tax burden of Canadians by some 10%.

<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we have heard the smoke and mirrors from the 
government side on Bill C-25 in all the things those members have 
been saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the area of Okanagan—Coquihalla.  The people in my 
riding of Okanagan—Coquihalla are hard working and diligent. 
They want to have families and create an environment in their 
communities that is good for themselves and for their community. 
They want to prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you probably knew this, but in my riding there are 
two communities with interesting names. One is Merritt and the 
other is Hope, British Columbia.  I often say that the people of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla reflect the names of those two communities. 
They are hard workers.  They give meritorious service to their 
communities.  They have hope. They have hope for the future. They 
have hope that they will prosper.  But that hope has been dashed 
by the Liberal government over the last seven years because it 
has failed to deliver to Canadians the things that make people 
prosperous, the things that encourage entrepreneurship and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 is an omnibus bill that contains amendments to the 
Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act and implements certain 
provisions of the 1999 federal budget.  Canadians are not in 
support of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on a point that preceded this debate.  That is 
the issue of the two amendments that were proposed by the finance 
critic for the Canadian Alliance.  Both of those amendments would 
have seen increased accountability to the powerful revenue 
agency. Both of those amendments have been disregarded by the 
House.  The excuse was that they were not accompanied by a 
Governor General's recommendation. We hear all the time from the 
government how it has broad based consultations, that it speaks 
to Canadians and tries to find out what Canadians are really 
after.  Let us look at what these two amendments did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was broad consultation.  We talked to people in the 
financial services industry, the accounting industry, the life 
underwriting industry.  These were people in the professional tax 
field. They came to the finance committee to give testimony. They 
talked about how the bill is too broadly based, how it does not 
offer a neutral appeal process. That is pretty serious when we 
are talking about taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the revenue agency goes after a Canadian with the allegation 
of a problem with his tax return, there has to be an appeal 
process, does there not?  We think there would be. The amendments 
the hon. member for Medicine Hat brought forward did that, but 
they have been disregarded by the Liberal government. It is 
outrageous.  However I am used to it and I think Canadians are 
used to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not sit idly by and watch this continually happen time 
and time again.  In the next campaign the Liberal government is 
going to feel the wrath of the Canadian people when it comes to 
taxation. I assure the Liberals that they are plummeting now, but 
they are going to plummet even further in the polls the day we go 
to the people of Canada and ask them what they think of the 
Liberal government's record on taxation over the last seven or 
eight years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to look at payroll taxes for a minute.  In 1999 the 
increased payroll taxes taken to fund the Canada pension plan 
removed any savings Canadians expected to see on their paystubs. 
Canadians will be faced with increases to the Canada pension plan 
for the next four years.  In fact the increased payroll taxes 
taken to fund the Canada pension plan is the single biggest tax 
increase in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Liberal government talk about that?  No, it does not, 
but the fact is that its increases to payroll taxes are the 
biggest that Canadians have ever seen, the largest tax grabs in 
the history of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the Liberal claims in the 1999 budget, Canadians are 
still faced with the highest personal income taxes of all the G-7 
states, a major factor in the continuing brain drain of skilled 
Canadians to lower tax regimes like that of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government claims that the 2000 budget will change 
the distinction we held in 1999.  Budget 2000 proposes a five 
year tax reduction plan that is supposed to create the most 
important structural changes to the federal tax system in more 
than a decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all remember the finance minister in his speech in the House. 
He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are setting out a five year plan so that individuals, 
families, small businesses and others will know for certain that 
their taxes will fall this year, next year and in years to come. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister stated that Canadians could expect tax 
relief equalling $58.4 billion over the next five years.  He even 
admitted that tax dollars were not the property of the federal 
government, which was quite a revelation for the Minister of 
Finance, but really the property of Canadian taxpayers.  He said 
“It is your money after all”.  That is exactly what he said in 
the House.  Can Canadians really expect to receive $58.4 billion 
in tax relief from the federal Liberal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Hardly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  My hon. friend says “Hardly”.  Let me 
explain.  The answer is no.  He is absolutely right.  After all 
the hoopla died away it became clear that new spending 
initiatives combined with tax increases from previous budgets 
like those in Bill C-25 would wipe out the vast majority of the 
$58.4 billion tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next five years spending on programs will increase by 
$7.5 billion.  This brings the supposed tax cut down to just over 
$50 billion, but there is more.  It is kind of like buying one of 
those vegamatics on TV:  “But wait, there is more”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subtract from this $50 billion the whopping $29.5 billion 
payroll tax hike caused by the multi-year increase to Canada 
pension plan premiums.  As I mentioned earlier, every January for 
the next four years Canadians will have to pay more of their hard 
earned dollars to bankroll a public pension plan that for all 
intents and purposes is broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the tax cut is down to about $20 billion, but wait, there is 
more.  Some $13.5 billion of this amount are nothing more than a 
cancellation of scheduled tax hikes.  Is cancelling a scheduled 
tax hike a tax break?  I do not think so, and judging from the 
response from my constituents they do not think so either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leaves a grand total of $7.9 billion for tax relief or, to 
put it another way, $107.60 per taxpayer per year.  We could put 
it another way, $8.97 per taxpayer per month, or we could take it 
down even lower to $2.07 per week, enough to buy a medium size 
Tim Horton's coffee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayers are getting no meaningful tax relief from the 
Liberal government.  Each Canadian is still paying over $2,000 
more in taxes than they were in 1993 when the Liberals formed the 
government. 
That is quite a different story from what we have heard from the 
Liberals.  They keep telling Canadians that there are tax cuts. 
It is absolute smoke and mirrors.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Not to mention rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B> It is rubbish.  This is a real blow to 
Canadians like people in my riding who work hard.  At the end of 
the year they try to have some disposal income left over so that 
maybe they can send their children through university, take a bit 
of a holiday or make renovations to their homes. There are a 
number of things they could do, but their disposal incomes have 
shrunk so much that they cannot do many of those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government policy of high taxation is a blow to 
Canada's economy as a whole.  In Toronto last March a summit of 
200 chief executive officers, brought together by the council on 
national Issues, tried to come up with remedies for Canada's poor 
economic performance compared to a number of other new economic 
jurisdictions.  While Canada fell behind during the 1990s, 
Ireland, a nation that traditionally had a lower standard of 
living than that of the United Kingdom and much lower than that 
of the European community, has become an economic hot spot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might ask ourselves another question.  Why has Ireland, but 
not Canada, been able to draw in so much high tech wealth and 
talent, when high tech companies in Canada continuously loose 
many of their brightest and best employees to the United States 
market?  The answer is taxes.  During this past decade Ireland 
has acted decisively to lower taxes, creating a pro-business 
atmosphere.  Ireland now has one of the lowest tax rates and, as 
a result, one of the most buoyant economies.  The standard of 
living of its citizens has also increased dramatically vis-à-vis 
its neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time Canada's standard of living under the regime of 
Liberal governments has decreased dramatically vis-à-vis that of 
the United States.  Ireland has achieved financial prosperity for 
its people partly through a conscious policy decision of a 
government not afraid to cut taxes.  Our government does not 
believe that but I will continue anyway.  I know its members are 
making notes on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are not as fortunate as people in the United States or 
in Ireland.  The modest tax cuts in the current Liberal budget 
will do nothing to stem the slide of our standard of living or 
the flow of skilled Canadians to lower tax jurisdictions in the 
United States.  Like Ireland, Canada must act decisively through 
conscious policy decisions.  This is what Canadians expect of 
their Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have gone out of their way to make it difficult for 
small businesses to conduct business in Canada.  Any contractor 
who subcontracts work to others is now forced by the government 
to police them by filing a summary of contract payment forms with 
the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency.  This is an additional 
burden on small businesses with serious fines of up to $2,500 for 
those who fail to file their summary of payment forms on time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Liberal budget also fails to make serious inroads 
into paying down debt.  The Liberals have totally forgotten about 
the debt.  I think their strategy was that they would try to 
confuse the public with relation to balancing the books, the 
deficit and the debt, which are two different things.  The 
Liberals do not like to talk about the debt any more, which is at 
approximately $580 billion.  This has remained steady for the 
last two years with only a minute reduction of $6.4 billion 
scheduled over the next five years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the rate we are going it could take 100 years.  You will be a 
very old man, Mr. Speaker, before our national debt is paid off. 
We should contrast that to the United States which intends to pay 
off its national debt in 12 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a feasible game plan to pay off our national debt in a 
timely manner, the standard of living of Canadians will continue 
to decline.  At the same time the lower taxed, debt free U.S. 
market will continue to attract Canada's best and Canada's 
brightest.  It is called the brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister does not believe it exists.  In fact it does. 
It is happening in my riding.  It is happening in your riding, 
Mr. Speaker.  It is happening right across the country.  Our 
brightest university students are finding high tech, medical and 
research jobs in the United States and are leaving our country. 
That hurts our productivity and it hurts the country's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse, Canadians are also deeply concerned about 
the way the Liberal government spends their hard earned tax 
dollars.  Instead of offering Canadians tax relief, the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Human Resources Development have 
spent the last two months demonstrating to Canadians why they 
should not trust the Liberal government with their money.  It is 
reflected in the polls.  We see the Liberals plunging in the 
polls, and that will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scandal surrounding grants and contributions for a variety 
of ill defined and unproven job creation schemes clearly shows 
that the Liberal government has no sense of financial 
accountability.  The scandal does not stop at the Department of 
Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has pointed out that numerous other 
departments mismanage billions of dollars in grants and 
contributions.  Our tax dollars are being spent on make work 
projects designed in effect to re-elect or try to get Liberals 
re-elected, not to serve the best interest of all Canadians coast 
to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That fact that real permanent jobs and economic prosperity can 
only be created through a combination of real tax relief, not 
disguised tax relief like the Liberals try to give us, and 
business friendly policies is of no consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ireland is an example that is ignored by the government.  The 
Liberals are so out of touch with the average Canadian taxpayer 
that they were actually considering giving subsidies to NHL 
hockey teams last January. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberals mismanage billions of dollars in one 
portfolio, they grossly underfund other portfolios such as 
health.  Health care, for example, is the number one concern 
shared by my constituents and I am sure every one across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2004, the Liberal government will have starved the 
provinces of $35 billion for health care at a time when the 
population is rapidly aging.  New technologies are advancing 
which come with a very hefty price tag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the Liberal government's contribution to health has 
been slashed by 28%.  The Liberals claim they will put $2.5 
billion back into health care every year for the next four years. 
That sounds pretty good, but the reality is there is still a 
serious funding shortfall of $25 billion.  The provinces are up 
in arms, and rightly so.  While the Liberals would rather funnel 
this money into the ridings of the Prime Minister or senior 
cabinet ministers, hospitals across the country are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding the hospitals are suffering.  The people of 
Princeton, B.C., were recently told that they would lose eight 
acute care beds at the Princeton General Hospital.  That may not 
sound like a lot, but it is a 45% reduction.  At the same time 
the demand for those acute care beds is increasing.  There is a 
nursing shortage which means that the hospital is unable to carry 
out its caregiving activities.  Acute care patients will now have 
to travel at least an hour and a half to receive the medical 
attention they need.  It is clearly unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the Prime Minister can funnel money that should 
be spent on priorities like health care into pet projects like a 
water fountain in the Prime Minister's riding?   How can the 
Liberal Party justify these actions?  Members opposite should be 
absolutely ashamed of what is happening.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example from my riding is the case of the Okanagan 
Similkameen Neurological Society, the child development centre 
that helps children with neurological disorders.  It is a very 
prestigious institution and does excellent work but it has a 
budget shortfall of about $200,000 each and every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last two years, I have had the privilege and opportunity 
of hosting a golf tournament where we get businesses, community 
leaders and people from the area to sponsor and make donations to 
this one day fundraising effort.  It has become quite a great 
event.  In fact, this year the charity golf classic raised about 
$17,000 for the child development centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $200,000 shortfall that institute experiences each and every 
year should not have to be made up by golf tournaments and 
fundraising activities like that.  These people are doing 
necessary work that benefits the community.  It is part of the 
health care system but it has a shortfall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time the federal government ponied up to the table 
and started to put back into health what it took away.  The 
people of Okanagan—Coquihalla demand it and people across the 
country demand it.  What the government is doing with Bill C-25 
is not good enough, despite its best efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other areas of concern in my riding when we talk 
about how taxes are collected and the implementation of the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years we have had problems at the Penticton airport. It is 
all part of the nationalization of the airports policy where the 
federal government was going to transfer the operations of the 
airport to the city of Penticton.  Unfortunately, there is a land 
claim involved in this and an agreement cannot be reached. It is 
at a stalemate.  It has been going on for years, and it is 
frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that happened was that a Liberal senator came 
out to Penticton one bright morning and arrived without any 
announcement.  He did not even tell the mayor of Penticton that 
he was coming.  In his hand he held a cheque for 650,000 taxpayer 
dollars.  A couple of flags were flying and a podium had been set 
up on the runway at the Penticton airport so he could tell the 
people of Penticton that the federal government was going to put 
$650,000 into repaving the Penticton airport.  It needs to be 
done but why was this done in secrecy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that happened was that the Penticton Indian Band 
came out and stopped the work from proceeding.  The federal 
government knew there was a problem yet it came in under the 
cover of darkness, trying to put one over on the people of 
Penticton and the Penticton Indian Band.  It is absolutely 
outrageous what the government is doing with taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make the point very clear that this budget 
implementation bill, Bill C-25, is 100% pure balderdash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go to the gas pumps and fill up our gas tanks, we pay 
taxes.  Canadians have heard for years that the tax money was to 
improve highways.  Does it ever get to improve highways? I do not 
think it does.  As a matter of fact, I know it does not because 
we have a stretch of highway between Peachland and Summerland in 
my riding that is a very dangerous highway.  The coroner has said 
that it is one of the most dangerous highways in Canada. 
Almost every week there is an accident on that highway, some 
minor but some have also fatal.  The people of the Okanagan area 
are saying that they want that highway to become part of the 
national highway system.  There has been no action by the 
government whatsoever, even though Highway 97 is a key 
transportation link from Alaska all the way down through the 
United States.  Highway 97 is very important to the economy not 
only of the people of the Okanagan but the economy of the entire 
province of British Columbia because it is used to transport 
goods and services.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that the people of Okanagan—Coquihalla are 
fed up with the Liberal government.  They feel isolated because 
they do not get the things they need.  When the government 
finally comes through with something it is something that is not 
a priority item for the people of the riding.  The government 
just continues on its merry way doing these crazy things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of B.C. will soon feel the effects of the Nisga'a 
agreement.  The B.C. ministry of agriculture of the NDP 
government has admitted in a memo that it was a template for 
future land claims agreements.  When we passed the Nisga'a 
agreement in the House what we in effect did was allow the 
creation of some 1,600 other sovereign nations in Canada.  We 
should think about the devastating effect that will have on our 
country and British Columbia in particular because most of those 
will be in the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we start connecting forestry, natural resources, the 
economy of British Columbia and what the Nisga'a agreement has 
done, we will feel more and more severe effects from that 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and people in my constituency are also concerned about 
our criminal justice system.  I had a terrible thing happen in 
Summerland, my hometown, where a person who was on day parole 
murdered two women in front of one of the woman's pre-school 
children, a two year old and a four year old.  The fellow was on 
day parole from Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules say that Correctional Service Canada is supposed to 
put a Canada-wide warrant out within 10 minutes.  Twenty-four 
hours had elapsed in which time this person allegedly travelled 
to Summerland and murdered, execution style, the two women.  It 
was horrific.  That same person is now playing with the court 
system, using every legal option available to him, firing his 
lawyers and using all kinds of delaying tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done to improve the criminal justice 
system?  Where is the money that should be allocated to do that. 
We will not find it in Bill C-25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem the federal government created across the 
country, with the impact being felt particularly in British 
Columbia, was when it negotiated the softwood lumber agreement. 
In Boston Bar just outside Hope, British Columbia, there is a 
large sawmill and lumberyard employer by the name of J.S. Jones 
Holdings Inc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the softwood lumber agreement was being negotiated, the 
government looked at a mill's production and the amount of wood 
it was transporting to the United States over a two year period. 
J.S. Jones was in a situation where it was re-tooling its shops. 
Half of the mill was shut down while it was putting in new 
equipment.  It was upgrading its equipment because it wanted to 
produce a good quality product in the best possible way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the quotas were finally handed out, J.S. Jones did not have 
enough quota to continue operations.  Workers are on lay-off 
notice right now.  That agreement will shut down the largest 
employer in the Hope and Boston Bar area and put 200 people out 
of work.  What does Bill C-25 hold for those folks?  Absolutely 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The softwood lumber agreement negotiated by the Liberal 
government has to be scrapped.  If we are a free trade country, 
and we are supposed to be, then let us put the free trade 
agreement in place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard something from the parliamentary secretary about hep C 
victims and Bill C-25.  The only people who have to worry about 
income tax implications when it comes to hep C victims are the 
lawyers because they are the only ones who have been paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I meet with the victims of hep C in my riding of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla.  Leslie Gibbenhuck and her family have been 
in my office in Ottawa and I have been helping them all the way 
along.  There is no relief for these folks in sight but the 
Liberal government has made sure that all the lawyers have been 
paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to Bill C-25 and hep C victims, this bill falls 
short again.  Why can we not ensure that those victims are paid? 
It is very sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that is important to the Okanagan region is the 
wine industry.  We have some of the best produced wines not just 
in the country but in the world.  We have award winning wineries. 
I have more wineries in my riding of Okanagan—Coquihalla than 
any other constituency in Canada, yet this federal government has 
failed to recognize the vintners quality assurance, the VQA label 
we see at the top of all Canadian produced wines.  The best wines 
have the VQA symbol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture Canada and this government will not endorse the VQA 
as the standardization of wines for Canada.  That seems like a 
simple thing.  Do members know what that means for our 
industry? It means that the Europeans will not accept our wine. 
Last year they imported about $1 million worth of Canadian wine. 
Do members have any idea how much wine we imported from the 
European community? Canada imported $385 million worth of wine 
from Europe.  As a matter of fact, the Europeans have totally 
banned our ice wines. I think that is terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wine industry is growing and jobs are being created in the 
Okanagan Valley, but this federal Liberal government will not do 
one small thing for these people and all the wine industry in 
Canada, which is to accept the VQA.  The government has known 
about this issue for years and it has done nothing to address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite Liberal promises in Bill C-25, the Canadian Alliance is 
the only party in the House today with an effective financial 
plan to increase the wealth of Canadian families while allowing 
businesses to thrive in a competitive environment.  We call it 
solution 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solution 17 is a tax system with a single income tax rate of 17% 
for all Canadian taxpayers combined with a number of progressive 
deductions.  Every single Canadian would benefit financially from 
our plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Highlights of solution 17 include an increase to the basic 
personal and spousal credits to $10,000 from $7,131 and $6,055 
respectively.  RRSP limits would be significantly increased to 
$16,500 from $13,500.  Businesses would thrive in a solution 17 
economy.  The corporate tax rate would be reduced from 28% to 21% 
while the small business tax rate would be reduced to 10% from 
12%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solution 17 would encourage success and risk taking by reducing 
the capital gains tax to 20% from 40%.  It would remove 1.9 
million low income Canadians from the tax roles altogether.  That 
is so good I want to say it again.  Solution 17 would take 1.9 
million low income Canadians off the tax roles completely.  That 
would benefit families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solution 17 eliminates the current discrimination against single 
income families vis-à-vis dual income families.  Currently, a 
single income family of four earning $45,000 per year pays 136.5% 
more in federal tax than a dual income family of four with the 
same income level.  Is that what the Liberals call fairness in 
our tax system?  I do not think so.  This is an absolute fact. 
This is not the smoke and mirrors of the Liberal government. When 
we get into it, it is terrible what the Liberal government has

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
1999 budget presented by the Minister of Finance was terribly 
disappointing, given the immense possibilities for intervention 
that we calculated were available, even as far back as 1998. 
The surplus, which he estimated at a minimal figure, was in fact 
far larger than he implied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give the taxpayers, who are entitled to know the true state 
of this country's finances, a bit of an idea of the situation, 
in the three years between 1997 and 1999 the Minister of Finance 
made a forecasting error of an average of $15 billion. He was an 
average of $15 billion off in forecasting the surplus. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year in and year out since 1998, the Minister of Finance has 
been forced to revise his forecasts on the surplus.  Again 
recently he told us in the 2000 budget that his forecast surplus 
for the next five years was $95 billion in all.  Knowing him, it 
is far more than that.  The Minister of Finance is, once again, 
being sneaky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the forecasts are looked at by anyone, whether by 
specialists or by the Bloc Quebecois, we expect as a minimum 
over the next five years, conservatively, a surplus of $140 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the minister could have done far more in 1999 to help those 
who are worst off, the most disadvantaged, and could have taken 
a different tack as far as tax reform is concerned, particularly 
by decreasing the income tax.  He could have re-established a 
proper employment insurance program, but he did not either then 
or in his budget 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, I read a document which the Prime Minister of Canada 
presented in Germany.  In this document, <I>The Canadian Way in the 
21st Century</I>, he said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success we have achieved as a nation has come not only from 
strong growth but from an abiding commitment to strong 
values—caring and compassion, an insistence that there be an 
equitable sharing of the benefits of economic growth. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little later, page 5 of the document states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a society of excellence with a commitment to success— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking of Canadian society, the Prime Minister added: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a society where prosperity is not limited to the few, but is 
shared by the many and where every child gets the right start in 
life. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, when this government came to office, the third way, 
the Canadian way, has primarily consisted of cutting everywhere, 
particularly in the Canada social transfer and in the employment 
insurance program. The government also constantly displays 
inertia with regard to tax reform to lighten the burden of low 
and middle income taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's document presents a picture that is just 
the opposite of reality in Canada. 
It says that children must get the right start in life, but 
since this government has been in office, the number of Canadian 
children living in poverty has increased from one million to one 
and a half million. There are 1.5 million children who are not 
all getting the right start in life, to use the expression found 
in the document entitled <I>The Canadian Way in the 21st Century</I>. 
In this document, the Prime Minister describes a theoretical 
reality, a utopia, a picture that is totally different from the 
true picture in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister talks about an “equitable sharing of the 
benefits of economic growth”. For the past seven years, the 
economy has constantly been growing. This is unprecedented. The 
economy is continually growing. How is it that we find ourselves 
with figures such as the ones I just mentioned, with 1.5 million 
children living in poverty, while there were one million in 
1993, before this government took office? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that, for all categories, particularly single mothers 
with children, poverty has increased so steadily?  How is it 
that, for the first time in 30 years, it was noted—by the 
National Council of Welfare—that the income of seniors had 
dropped?  This is something not seen in 30 years, since measures 
such as old age pensions, and so on were introduced to help old 
folks, as they were then called, out of their poverty.  How is it 
that we have reached this state of affairs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation for female seniors living alone is even worse. 
They are one of the poorest categories in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government is talking about sharing, equity and 
compassion, how is it that—the Prime Minister is going to say 
this in Germany, but he would not dare to say it here—the 
situation in Canada is actually the opposite?  If the government 
has so much compassion, how is it that, when it tabled its budget 
in 1999, and again last February, it did not restore the Canada 
social transfer that has been so drastically cut since 1994?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that this situation is allowed to continue and that, 
in 2001-02, there will be cuts of more than $30 billion in the 
Canada social transfer to the provinces to fund health, 
postsecondary education and social assistance, and income 
security for the poorest Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 
2000, this government, with all its compassion, has not set aside 
one additional dollar for the construction of social housing, 
when people growing poorer and poorer are spending over 50% of 
their income on accommodation?  Already at 30%, people are 
considered badly off and unable to afford to put a decent roof 
over their heads, buy food and clothing, pay for drugs, and so 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that this compassionate government has been working 
since 1993 to make people poorer?  How is it that for about the 
past four years the new employment insurance plan has 
marginalized some 60% of the unemployed?  How is it that such a 
compassionate government is allowing a situation to go on in 
which, according to its own figures, only 43% of the unemployed 
are entitled to employment insurance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this government, with the Canadian way, the third way 
of the Prime Minister, let the situation happen?  How is it 
that, despite the huge surpluses of the past three years, the 
government has given no thought to the disadvantaged? Is this 
the Canadian way?  Is this the third way?  Is this a vision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois think it is, because, since this 
government came to office, the only way it has shown us is the 
way of further centralizing powers in all areas of jurisdiction. 
It involved keeping taxpayers' money in its pockets.  It 
involved stealing money from the unemployed and putting it in 
its own pockets.  It involved stealing money from the most 
disadvantaged.  It involved taking money from the poorest 
families in this country.  It involved stealing bread from the 
mouths of the 500,000 children who have been added to this 
government's record of poverty since its arrival in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Minister of Finance is doing.  That is what 
this government has done since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Finance forecasts a surplus of $95.5 billion 
for the next five years, it means that some of the 30 million 
Quebecers and Canadians will have less in their pockets. 
This means that those who already did not have enough have just 
had some of what they did have stolen from them by the Minister 
of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next five years, the plan is to take still more from 
them.  Their money will be taken from them.  What little they 
have in their pockets to meet their basic needs will be taken 
from them.  That is what is being announced to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister tells us that there will be a surplus of $95.5 
billion—that is a very conservative minimum, because our 
estimate is $140 billion, and our forecasts have not been a 
single percentage point off since 1994 when we started doing 
them—this means that he is going to get it somewhere, and that 
somewhere will be our pockets, as it has been since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the large surpluses that have accumulated in the past 
three years, and will continue to accumulate in future, comes 
essentially from three sources: cuts to the Canada social 
transfer, which goes to provide sick people with a decent health 
care system, cuts to the Canada social transfer for income 
security—those poor children I referred to a while ago—and cuts 
to post-secondary education.  This is the first major source: the 
Canada social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next is the employment insurance surplus, which is some $6 
or $7 billion every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance helps himself to that. Already a $32 
billion surplus has accumulated in the employment insurance fund, 
and the Minister of Finance has helped himself to it.  Most of it 
comes from small and medium size businesses and from workers.  He 
also helps himself from the pockets of the unemployed who are not 
eligible from employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Canadian way.  That is what the Canadian way has 
meant to us since 1993.  There is no compassion; they go after 
the most disadvantaged, they cut transfer payments to the 
provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government leaves it up to the provinces, which provide the 
first line of direct services to the public, to deal with 
problems that have their roots here. In the meantime, the Prime 
Minister travels all the way to Germany to talk about the 
Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with taxes. The situation is so serious that the 
federal tax has become a major contributing factor to families 
getting poorer. This is unprecedented. Originally, federalism 
meant policies based on fairness, compassion, redistribution and 
equalization. We now have a situation where, from a tax point of 
view, instead of helping poor families and families saddled with 
huge responsibilities, the government is crushing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families—and I am talking about families with two adults and 
one child—start paying federal tax as soon as their income 
reaches $13,700. By comparison, families begin to pay tax to the 
Quebec government only when their income reaches $30,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal level, because of the tax structure and the lack 
of indexation during all these years, a family with two adults 
responsible for a dependent child starts paying federal tax when 
its income reaches $13,700. Of course, this is hard to understand 
for a millionaire, for the Minister of Finance, for a shipowner 
who does not pay tax in Canada but, instead, pays a minimal 
amount to tax havens. It is difficult to understand that an 
income of $13,700 is well below the poverty threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poorest find themselves in that category: $13,700, two 
adults, one income and one dependent child. 
They pay federal income tax in order to fatten the surplus of the 
Minister of Finance, to cover the income tax he does not pay 
because his ships fly the Panamanian flag, because he does 
business in the waters off tax havens.  As the Minister of 
Finance, he takes money from couples with one child when their 
income reaches $13,719, whereas in Quebec it is at $30,000—a bit 
better—that this family starts paying income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not reformed taxes, as we have been asking it 
to do since 1993.  The aim of such a reform is to re-establish 
some balance and fairness in the federal tax system, which now 
adds to poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the tax paid at this income level, it means that the people 
Statistics Canada and others call the poorest people, the most 
disadvantaged, who spend probably more than half their income on 
housing, who have a hard time making ends meet, are beginning to 
fill the pockets of the Minister of Finance, a millionaire 
shipowner, the owner of ships flying the Panamanian flag, who 
pays tax elsewhere than in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why, up to now, people have not rebelled 
more against this.  It is an absolute scandal to find ourselves 
in such a situation. And the federal tax system is not unfair 
solely for a family of two adults and one child. It does not add 
to the poverty of just this one socio-economic category; it also 
adds to the poverty of a single parent family with two dependent 
children.  This family too starts paying income tax at $13,719. 
It is already having trouble—because it is usually headed by a 
single mother with children—making ends meet.  There is never 
enough at the end of the month to feed and dress her two 
children, keep them warm and pay the rent.  This government, with 
the Minister of Finance at the helm, will drain them of the few 
resources they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, then, is the Canadian way, the Prime Minister's third way: 
crushing the weaker members of society, who can barely manage, 
crushing the most disadvantaged, those who are already 
discouraged and depressed, who have perhaps lost the will to 
fight.  And all to help the rich get richer.  The opposite of 
Robin Hood is what the Prime Minister's third way is.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1999 budget, the one that we are interested in, there was 
one tax relief measure, and one only, that made sense.  I should 
say that it was consistent, because in my view, it did not make 
sense, but perhaps it did to the millionaire friends of the 
Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 3% surtax was abolished.  This was a surtax introduced in 
order to reduce the deficit.  The thinking was that, since there 
was no longer a deficit, they would abolish the tax.  What is not 
mentioned is that the category that has benefited most from the 
elimination of this 3% surtax is those with incomes of $250,000 
and up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These guys, the Prime Minister's friends, people like Mongeau 
and company who are getting their palms greased with our 
money—you know, the buddies—got a $3,700 tax break in one shot, 
whereas single families with two children earning $13,719 a year 
got nothing in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2000, they will not get much more. A few years down the road 
we might hope that, with full indexation of the tax tables, they 
might start paying taxes on a slightly higher income of $14,000, 
$15,000 or $16,000. Nevertheless, they are below the poverty 
level and federal taxes are making them poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is compassion, according to the Prime Minister of Canada, 
who goes to Germany to deliver his speech. He is afraid to 
deliver it here, because he is afraid that people will point out 
to him that the only tax break in 1999 was for the rich, and that 
it is the same thing in 2000. The only significant tax break was 
the lowering of the surtax from 4% to 3% in 1999, and its phasing 
out in 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, those who benefit from the bulk of this tax break, which 
amounts to more than $4,000 in the 2000 budget, are people making 
over $250,000 a year. This is what the Prime Minister calls 
compassion and a fair redistribution of the dividends of economic 
growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxation is one of the reasons retired couples over 65 years of 
age are getting poorer. I mentioned earlier that for the first 
time in 30 years the welfare council found the elderly were 
getting poorer. 
This is happening for the first time in 30 years, because 
measures had been taken to allow senior citizens who had worked 
all their lives to have a decent retirement income. Yet, retired 
couples over 65 start paying federal tax when their income 
reaches $20,000. An annual income of $20 000 is not much. It is 
below the poverty level, yet federal income tax makes those 
people even poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With surpluses coming out of his ears, the Minister of Finance 
could have made a small effort in 1999 and in 2000 and reduced 
income tax, given back what he took to the poor, made the 
employment insurance system somewhat fairer, invested more money 
in social housing and restored some balance in the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he believes that surpluses are still not high enough, when he 
is strangling us with income tax, crushing the neediest and 
raising all statistics on poverty, the minister might have 
changed the corporate tax system as well. He could have forgotten 
his cronies. He could have said to Thomas d'Aquino and others, as 
well as to large companies, that the time has come for them to 
pay income tax like everybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics are alarming, at least the ones we know about, 
because the Minister of Finance stopped publishing this type of 
data several years ago, the statistics on taxes deferred by large 
corporations and due to Revenue Canada. This is alarming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Figures were published by the Canadian Labour Congress, figures 
which we had ourselves compiled in 1994 when we arrived. In 1995, 
we could no longer compile these numbers because the Department 
of Finance had asked, by order of the Minister of Finance, that 
the data no longer be published. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some large corporations, which make a profit year in and year 
out, have paid no income tax for the last ten years. In 
1994-1995, it was estimated that the federal government was 
losing $35 billion a year. 
The situation has not changed considering the fact that, since 
1994-1995, our economy has been growing and businesses, 
especially large ones, have been making record profits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe it or not, even the most profitable businesses never pay 
taxes even if they owe taxes to the federal government. For 
example, Bell Canada, whose chairman, Mr. Monty, has been 
appointed as head of the millennium scholarship foundation, owes 
Revenue Canada $2.1 billion. These taxes are deferred year after 
year, but it is money owed to Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>BCE, Bell Canada Enterprises, which includes all of Bell 
Canada's communications businesses, owes Revenue Canada $2.3 
billion. 
I see that the secretary of state is smiling over there. I do 
not see anything funny in the fact that businesses such as Bell 
Canada and BCE, which are worth billions and are making money, 
and whose chairman, Mr. Monty, has stated that he wanted to buy 
CTV for $2.3 billion, are not paying taxes. That is exactly the 
amount he owes Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, Bell Canada Enterprises wanted to buy CTV with 
our money, the money it owes us. Let us not forget that, when 
BCE does not pay its taxes to the federal government, that money 
has to come from somewhere. It is taxpayers like you and me, the 
single parent with dependants, who have to make up in part for 
the taxes not paid by Mr. Monty and Bell Canada. They will also 
have to make up in part for the taxes not paid by the Minister 
of Finance. They will have to make up in part for the taxes used 
for patronage, for contracts awarded by the CIO, the Canada 
Information Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw that this week. 
The Bloc Quebecois leader and House leader have raised these 
questions with my colleague for Chambly.  People's palms are 
being greased with our tax money.  It is already hard enough to 
earn a living, to have to file our income tax, because doing 
so—excuse the expression—irks us, but what is even worse is to 
know that these people are using our money to butter up their 
friends.  The Mongeau affair is just the tip of the iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Human Resources Development Canada scandals, the CIO 
scandals, with communications contracts being awarded for the 
monkey business of having federal ministers traipsing about 
Quebec spreading propaganda, trumped up contracts for checking 
spelling and punctuation to the tune of $250,000 and other such 
stupidities, we can see where our money is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see a grant intended for the riding of our colleague 
from Rosemont end up in the riding of the Prime Minister, when 
the invoices supporting this are not forthcoming, there is a 
problem.  We can now see that the scandals, the propaganda, the 
buddy system, the sloppiness in administering public funds, have 
become systemic.  We have, to use Fabienne Larouche's term, 
become a banana republic.  This is totally senseless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance, with surplus money spilling out of his 
pockets, is announcing some very bad news at the same time.  It 
is very human to behave that way: the more money a person has, 
the less attention a person pays to it, especially when it is 
someone else's money.  The Minister of Finance will have a big 
surplus over the next five years, a lot of money but not his. 
In time, the financial administration will become still 
sloppier.  The Minister of Finance has surplus money coming out 
of his ears but it is not his money, so what does he care? 
This government's sloppiness will increase, that is a sure thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Minister of Finance is announcing the very bad 
news for Quebecers, who pay $32 billion in taxes to this 
government, that their hard-earned money, part of which goes to 
the federal government, is being used for propaganda, choosing 
political friends, greasing the palms of party friends, providing 
grants so as to arrange under the table for donations to the 
Liberal Party of Canada.  This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget is like the other ones; it is just like the 
others.  It is, in any case, just like the 2000 and 1998 budgets.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a totally heartless budget, compared with the third way, 
supposedly the Canadian way, as presented by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These budgets contain no provision for lightening the burden of 
low and middle income taxpayers.  Like the others, this budget 
offers nothing to ease misery in Canada.  On the contrary, it 
contains the seed of what appeared in the last budget and what 
may well appear in future budgets, the failure to restore the 
Canada social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to dip blithely into the annual 
employment insurance surpluses of $6 billion to $7 billion by 
keeping contributions high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for tax cuts, we can forget about those, because every time 
the Minister of Finance makes a dramatic announcement about 
lowering taxes, a closer look reveals that he has done nothing. A 
closer look reveals that he is taking away with one hand what he 
is giving with the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mention was made of cost recovery for expanding government 
services, particularly for agricultural SMEs.  The government 
lowers taxes a bit and increases indirect taxes by implementing 
cost recovery for expanding federal programs, which was recently 
criticized by the Canadian Federation of Independent businesses 
as one factor cutting into the competitiveness of SMEs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make one further comment about this budget. The 
1999 budget contained a sad piece of news.  It had to do with the 
level of compensation for victims of contaminated blood, of 
hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will remember, as the Bloc Quebecois has done since 
the beginning of this issue, in connection with the work done by 
the member for Drummond and continued by the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, that victims who contracted the disease 
before 1986 and after 1990 are still not entitled to any 
compensation, although they contracted the disease in exactly the 
same way as everyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad to be talking again about the 1999 budget when we know 
that there may be thousands of people who deserve compensation 
because they have suffered serious health consequences.  Some of 
them may already have died. With surpluses of $95.5 billion, this 
government is not even thinking about revisiting this issue and 
providing compensation for victims who contracted the disease 
before 1986 and after 1990, who have still not received anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that, for all the reasons I have given 
and because of the fact that there has not been adequate 
compensation for hepatitis C victims, the Bloc Quebecois will be 
voting against this bill, with our usual vigour.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say a few words in this debate in terms 
of some of the important tax issues that are being implemented by 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the taxation system, Mr. Speaker, I think you 
would agree even from the Alberta perspective that the tax system 
must be fair in how it treats ordinary people. I also hope you 
would agree that the tax system should be very progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have a tax system that taxes people on their ability 
to pay. We have moved away from that a bit in the last few years 
in terms of what the Mulroney government did when it reduced the 
number of marginal tax brackets from seven to three. Now we have 
a 16% tax bracket, a 26% tax bracket and a 29% tax bracket. The 
26% would be rolled back to 23% which will make it a bit more 
progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I have been advocating is that we should make it a bit 
more progressive.  If I had my way on the drawing board, I would 
return to maybe not seven tax brackets, but five marginal tax 
rates.  There would be a bit more progressivity in the system. 
The United States has more tax brackets than we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also raise the basic exemption for Canadians to an 
amount much higher than what it is today. 
Today I think it is $6,700 or $6,800 for Canadians across the 
board.  I would like to see it go up to $10,000 or $12,000 in 
terms of making it more progressive.  Also, lower income people 
would not be taxed to the same extent as they are today.  It 
would take many more people off the tax rolls.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to speak for too long.  My friend in the 
Conservative Party from Nova Scotia wants to say a few words 
before we adjourn, so I will try to keep my comments to about 10 
minutes. Perhaps you could give me the nod at that time, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of things which I think should be talked 
about a bit more in this country.  Often the comparison is made 
by more conservative minded politicians, in particular the people 
in the Canadian Alliance, that taxes in Canada are so much higher 
than in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study came out in the news today which compares income tax 
rates in Canada and the United States.  I am sick and tired of 
comparing apples and oranges, just comparing tax rates in 
isolation.  The study says that in general the tax rates in the 
United States are lower than those in Canada.  I will give a 
couple of examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 a family with an income of $40,000 paid about $6,900 in 
income tax in Canada.  In the United States they paid about 
$5,200 in income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look across the board we find that the percentage in this 
country is a bit higher in every bracket, high, middle or low 
than it is in the United States.  What is forgotten are some of 
the other costs of living in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the United States if one is lucky enough to get 
health care, one may have to pay $1,000 U.S. a month.  Health 
care in Canada is paid through general revenue and general taxes. 
That is one of the benefits of our taxes. The taxes are a bit 
higher and one reason for it is we do not have health in the 
private sector.  We do not have private premiums.  We do not have 
a user fee or a user tax on health care.  In the United States it 
costs perhaps $1,000 a month to get health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in that country around 40 million people or more are not 
insured. There are about 100 million people who are underinsured 
in the United States for health care. That is a radical 
difference between our country and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the average family is paying an extra $2,000 or $3,000 in 
taxes a year, health care by itself will more than eliminate the 
gap between the American taxpayer and the Canadian taxpayer.  If 
one is paying $1,000 U.S. per month in premiums for health 
insurance, that adds up to $12,000 to $13,000 U.S. or about 
$18,000 Canadian per year for health insurance.  Our health 
insurance comes out of general revenues from the provincial 
governments in the main but also from the federal government 
under a cost sharing plan. That is one of the benefits of being 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to throw two other arguments on the table as well.  It is 
rather facetious just to compare the tax rates of the two 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a much lower crime rate than the United States.  That 
makes our cost of living lower than that of the United States in 
terms of policing costs.  It makes insurance costs in Canada 
lower because the crime rate is radically lower. We do not have 
to carry a handgun or weapons or have the insecurity in most 
parts of the country that we see in the United States.  Again, 
when making tax comparisons, an issue like crime is not factored 
in in terms of the higher costs south of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area is education.  Everyone knows it costs an awful 
lot more to send a young person to university in the United 
States than it does here.  Tuition fees are too high here; we all 
agree on that.  Many of us are lobbying the federal government to 
put more money into post-secondary education and are lobbying the 
provinces to make sure they put more money into it and tuition 
fees are lowered to make university education more accessible to 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States tuition fees often are around $15,000 U.S. 
per year.  For a unique university such as Columbia it could be 
perhaps $25,000 U.S. a year for tuition.  We are looking at 
$15,000 to $30,000 Canadian and more in tuition per year for a 
student in the United States. Someone told me today that the 
average student debt in the United States is probably over 
$100,000 U.S. 
My recollection is that the average student debt in Canada is 
between $15,000 and $25,000 Canadian.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again one reason that the student debts and tuition fees are 
lower in this country is that the money comes out of taxes to a 
much greater extent than in the United States of America.  We are 
getting some benefit from the taxes that Canadian people are 
paying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear the arguments by members in the Canadian Alliance 
that our taxes are so much higher than the United States, they 
are really comparing apples and oranges.  They are not comparing 
some of the benefits that we get from the taxes we pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very strong argument that we be concerned that there 
is enough taxpayers' money to ensure that we do have good 
progressive programs, that we do have social programs, that we do 
have an infrastructure.  There is a role for government and for 
the mixed economy in this country.  The economy should not be 
left totally to the free market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at some of the leadership candidates of the Canadian 
Alliance, like Tom Long and others, who believe that almost 
everything should be left to the so-called free market, that 
there should not be a role for government.  That party is almost 
anti-government in what it advocates, not so much the former 
leader of the opposition as Stockwell Day and Tom Long who are on 
the far right, the extreme radical right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a role for government.  If there is a role for 
government, then we have to have a fair taxation system so we can 
fund the government programs. The whole issue in Canada is fair 
taxes and making sure we have a tax rate based on the ability to 
pay, so that the ordinary citizen pays less in taxes, so that the 
poorer people do not pay taxes and the wealthier people in some 
cases pay even higher taxes than they do today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of what I mean.  The Bronfman family is 
one of the wealthiest families in this country.  In 1991 the 
Bronfmans moved a lot of their assets, I believe it was stocks, 
to the United States from Canada.  Officials in the Department of 
National Revenue, under the previous government, made a ruling 
that the Bronfmans would not have to pay capital gains tax on the 
appreciation of their assets when they moved them out of the 
country to the United States. According to the auditor general 
and according to information that has now come out in court 
cases, the Bronfman family basically got a $700 million gift when 
they moved that money out of Canada into the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, if an ordinary bus driver in Kingston, 
Ontario owes $200 or $300 to the federal government, the 
Department of National Revenue will track that poor bus driver 
down and demand that he pay the bill and that he pay interest on 
top of it, but not the Bronfman family.  They got a $700 million 
tax holiday, a tax gift, because officials in the department of 
revenue were able to write it off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need tax fairness.  Four years ago the current government 
said that it would bring in legislation to change this.  That did 
not happen until a ways and means motion was tabled in the House 
yesterday.  That will bring in some legislative changes promised 
back in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I mean when I talk about tax fairness.  The 
Bronfmans with a family trust can get away with a tax gift of 
$700 million, and the ordinary citizen who owes a few hundred 
dollars on a tax bill is hounded, searched down, charged a 
penalty and interest. That is not fair.  It is unjust.  That is 
what I mean by tax fairness and equity in terms of how we treat 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people say we should not do it that way, that we should 
have a flat tax where everyone pays the same tax rate. The Peter 
Pocklingtons and the wealthier people would pay the same tax 
rate, such as 17%, as the middle class.  That would increase the 
burden on the middle class or would cut back on government 
programs, or a combination of both.  I do not believe that is tax 
fairness either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the issues I wanted to raise.  Before I cede 
my place on the floor to a member of the Conservative Party, I 
conclude by saying that the main issue is fairness when it comes 
to taxes.  There should be no special status and no special 
exemptions for wealthier people or bigger corporations, like the 
family trusts we have had in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in tax fairness.  I believe lower income people need 
to get a tax break.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe there is a role for government.  We need a 
government that is proactive, a government that will provide 
leadership in terms of stronger social programs.  There is a role 
for a mixed economy in this country.  I think that is the 
direction most people want to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I read public opinion correctly, I think the ordinary working 
families believe that large corporations have too much control 
and too much influence over the agenda of our country.  Canadians 
see the Liberal Party as being a bit wimpy in terms of standing 
up to the agenda of large corporations. Canadians want the 
government to have more spunk and more backbone.  They want a 
people's agenda, where people are put first and there is a more 
equitable distribution of wealth and power.  That is the way the 
ordinary people of Canada want to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tremendous opportunities.  One way to give people 
opportunities and to build a strong country is to make sure that 
we have a very fair and equitable tax system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-25, an act to amend the Income Tax 
Act, the Excise Tax Act and the Budget Implementation Act, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada to succeed in a global, knowledge based economy we 
must be more innovative, productive, invest in skills and 
development and seek out new opportunities around the world.  The 
Liberal track record, however, has been declining productivity 
and investment, with record levels of taxation, and punishing 
regulations and red tape.  The government is not providing Canada 
with the leadership and the vision it needs to maintain our 
competitiveness and our place in the world as we head into a 
difficult era of global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has the second highest corporate tax rate in the 
industrialized world.  I am sure the House is also aware that as 
a percentage of our economy Canada has the highest personal 
income tax rate.  Some individuals may look at that and say that 
we are perhaps getting a good bang for our buck.  We are able to 
maintain these taxation rates and still maintain our position in 
the global economy.  The fact is that those individuals are 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that we have a very valuable society.  Our health 
care system is a treasure.  It is a valuable program which 
Canadians hold very dear. I prefer Canada's health care system to 
that of the United States.  I do not know if the House is aware, 
but I know the new member for St. John's West is aware that half 
the bankruptcies in the United States are created because people 
get sick.  Thirty million Americans do not have access to any 
health care system whatsoever.  If someone gets sick it should 
not result in economic hardship or economic ruin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is an export driven country.  We need to remain so to 
keep our competitiveness.  Canadians have always valued our 
capacity to build prosperity, to build a stronger nation.  It was 
the Progressive Conservative government of 1984-93 that was 
indeed a prosperity builder.  I want to illustrate that fact by 
talking about not only privatization and deregulation issues 
brought forth by the Progressive Conservative government, but 
also the fact that we really led the G-7 in terms of winning the 
war on inflation between 1984-93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is best illustrated with the free trade agreement.  In 1988 
our trade with the Americans was approximately $90 billion.  The 
members from St. John's East and St. John's West both know that 
our trade with the Americans now is $260 billion each and every 
year.  Our growth has come from the economy.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also coming through one of the most buoyant periods of 
economic growth in the industrialized world.  Growth in the 
United States was 18% between 1992 and 1998.  In the U.K. and in 
Germany, in the same time period, their growth was 14%.  The 
Finns had very similar growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at the Irish economy.  They took very bold, 
progressive steps in terms of getting their corporate tax rates 
slashed in half and exponentially lowering their personal tax 
rates.  The Irish economy over that same period doubled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada is advocating 
is that we need to do with tax what the Progressive Conservative 
Party did for trade in order to build a more prosperous society. 
We set leadership.  In fact, just recently a study by very 
learned economists and political scientists at the University of 
McGill, which ranked former prime ministers, stated that our 
government between 1984 and 1993 did far more to prepare Canada 
to take its appropriate place in the world as a world economic 
leader than any other government before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some initiatives that we want to put forth at this 
point.  We think it is wrong that individuals who make $14,000, 
which is less than the poverty line, should have to pay any tax 
at all.  As a first step, our tax task force report, which was 
voted on by the membership of the Progressive Conservative Party 
in Quebec City, stated that the basic personal exemption should 
be raised to $12,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That fundamental initiative on its own would take two and a half 
million Canadians off the tax rolls overnight.  Those two and a 
half million Canadians simply should not have been put there in 
the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of getting our economic fundamentals in order to 
maintain our world competitiveness, we need to address the 
national debt.  Quite simply, it is a mortgage on every Canadian, 
in particular a mortgage on every young Canadian.  I have 
referred to the national debt as being fiscal child abuse, as we 
are mortgaging the fiscal competitiveness or the economy of every 
generation yet to be born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government will say that it has made a payment on the 
debt or lowered taxes, it is taking baby steps while the rest of 
our trading partners are taking giant leaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of our conference that we held in Quebec City, 
where the membership of the Progressive Conservative Party said 
that, at a minimum, our party would pay down the national debt by 
an aggressive legislative format.  That is the minimum that we 
owe every young Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I advocate lowering taxes it is not simply for the sake of 
lowering taxes, it is to maintain our world competitiveness and 
to instil more growth and investment in our economy overall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about another issue that I am very 
concerned about, and that is the issue of brain drain.  In order 
to keep our best and brightest within our borders in this global 
economy, our most entrepreneurial, the individuals who invest, 
and the risk takers, we need to provide them with a tax regime in 
which their initiative and their intellect will be rewarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that vein, let us ensure that Canada's taxation rate can fund 
the economy which we need.  The Progressive Conservative Party 
believes that a strong economy is the root of providing a healthy 
and educated society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we do anything else, when it comes to income tax 
implementation or the focus of the budget, let us do the 
following fundamentals properly.  Let us pay down the national 
debt in a legislative way.  Let us ensure that our tax regime in 
terms of our personal taxes and corporate taxes becomes more 
competitive. Let us put money back into our priority spending 
areas in terms of post-secondary education. 
We know that the average student debt of $30,000 is wrong.  We 
want to fix that.  We also want to put more money back into our 
health care system.  Let us pay down the debt.  Let us lower 
taxes.  Let us invest in health care and post-secondary 
education.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the opportunity to speak for a few minutes to 
Bill C-25.  Primarily what I want to do in the few minutes that I 
have is to debate some of the misconceptions that are out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, when I asked the Minister of Finance a question 
the other day about a plan for debt reduction, he went on and on 
about how the debt is in fact going down as a ratio to GDP. 
However, he failed to answer the real question, which is, why not 
reduce the debt itself, because it is not going down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget documents of the last couple of years indicate very 
clearly that the Liberal plan is to keep the debt constant in 
terms of dollars and to hope that the GDP goes up and the ratio 
of debt to GDP goes down, which in fact it is because our economy 
is growing, so the GDP is going up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague from the Conservative Party just said, the 
debt is a huge load on our country because of the interest 
payments required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point concerns the misconception about our solution 
17.  NDP members in particular keep talking about this as being a 
tax reduction for the rich, saying that it would be unfair to 
poor people.  It is really quite the opposite.  I find it very 
difficult to defend against what they are accusing us of, because 
what they are accusing us of is exactly the opposite of what it 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan would be more progressive than the one we have now, 
which, because of its steps and different rates, takes huge 
leaps. In some instances Canadian citizens who earn more money 
actually take home less because of the change in the rates as 
they go from one category to another.  There is a tremendous 
disincentive to being successful, to working and earning money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one rate plan which we are proposing would make a smooth 
transition and would be truly progressive.  By example, a single 
mom with one child, under the present Liberal government, pays 
$1,700 in taxes.  Under our plan she would pay $170.  In other 
words, she would get a 90% tax break, a 90% reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the many Canadians who are making less than $20,000, the 
government takes between $6 billion and $7 billion from them in 
taxes.  Our plan would take them off the tax rolls completely, 
giving them a 100% tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compare, for example, another single mom, this time a rich mom 
who has an income of $240,000 instead of $24,000.  Ten times as 
much income.  She would pay $36,890 in income tax.  In other 
words, 10 times the income, but 217 times as much tax.  That is 
progressive.  The Liberals have their system going so that it is 
even more abrasive than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I would like to make is that it is not tax rates 
that pay for things like health care.  There is this 
misconception out there that if the tax rates are cut, there will 
be less money for health care.  That is not true.  NDP members 
keep saying that we will take it away from the middle class or we 
will have less money for programs.  That is not true. Anybody who 
knows any economics at all has heard of the Laffer curve, which 
shows that there is a maximum rate of income which is produced at 
certain percentage rates of income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are past that point.  Reducing the tax rates would almost 
certainly increase total government revenue, giving us more 
money.  That is the misconception that I wanted to correct.

<A NAME="LINK228">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 11 consideration of the motion and 
of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I 
want to thank the member for Churchill River for presenting to 
the House a motion which increases our awareness of the various 
issues concerning Canada's and Quebec's circumpolar community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did it through Motion No. 237, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
recognize the 55th parallel as the identified Canadian boundary 
for participation in the international circumpolar community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain the substance of this motion. Right now, Canada 
uses the 60th parallel as the boundary of its circumpolar 
region. However, most countries bordering on the Arctic use the 
55th parallel as the boundary of their circumpolar region. In 
other words, for them, the international circumpolar region is 
north of the 55th parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost 30 years ago, Louis-Edmond Hamelin, the founding director 
of the Centre d'études nordiques at Laval University, a unique 
research centre in Quebec, said, and rightly so: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Definitions of the north mainly depend on the criteria used to 
assess the situation. 
Many tests have shown that the boundaries and the main elements 
of the north are not perceived the same way by those who live 
there. Some still believe that the north can be confined within 
specific isolines, such as the arctic circle. As for the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments, they are using, 
between Alaska and the Hudson Bay region, the 60th parallel, 
which has little natural meaning and makes little sense. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hamelin then proposed to set a number of criteria to define 
what would become the “Hamelin line”, which defines the 
boundaries of the north according to various factors such as 
climate, population, latitude, precipitation, means of 
transportation and economic activity. That boundary is generally 
well below the 60th parallel.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that political relations in that area have been deeply 
affected by the cold war. Since the end of the cold war, 
co-operation mechanisms have been developed to improve relations 
between different countries in the circumpolar region and 
address various issues on a multilateral basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking here about things like the Canadian initiative to 
create the Arctic Council, the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, the 
strategy to protect the Arctic environment, the Nordic Forum, 
the Canadian Polar Commission, and the International Arctic 
Science Committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian communities in the northern part of our provinces, 
beyond the 55th parallel, cannot take part in these great forums 
where are being discussed issues that are their concern in many 
ways. Like the hon. member for Churchill River said, we have 
forgotten people in that part of the Canadian north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these communities very often share the same concerns and 
aspirations. They have the same environmental problems generated 
by the south. The arctic environment is particularly vulnerable, 
and many dangers are already present there, like transborder air 
and water pollutants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why could these people, who know their territory so well, not 
take part in these discussions, offer solutions and make their 
views known? We have a lot to learn about sustainable 
development from the traditional knowledge of the people who 
live in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, north of the 55th and 60th parallels, there are 
important mineral and mining resources, and the economic 
development of the Arctic is vital to better living conditions 
of people in these areas. Why could they not be full 
participants in the dialogue on resource management? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to speak about international co-operation 
in science and technology, which started afresh after the end of 
the cold war. 
The International Arctic Science Committee, or IASC, is made up 
of the national scientific organizations of the eight Arctic 
countries, including Canada, and other countries engaged in 
research in the Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be unfair, to say the least, if the provinces' northern 
regions between the 55th and 60th parallels could not be 
included in the research carried out by these organizations 
because, territorially speaking, they are not considered part of 
the circumpolar region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the sponsor of the motion, the member for 
Churchill River, intends to survey the far north and put markers 
or stakes every six feet. Nor is it his intention to alter the 
borders of the provinces through a possible change to the 
circumpolar territorial limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, the noble principle behind the motion by the member for 
Churchill River is rather to allow communities living between 
the 55th and 60th parallels to be full members of the 
international circumpolar community. If passed, the motion will 
mean that Canada will finally accept the limit internationally 
recognized by the northern community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to point out that we are debating a motion, not a 
bill. As I said at the beginning, the great merit of Motion 
No. 237 is to raise the Canadian and Quebec circumpolar issue, to 
evaluate the challenges involved, to solve the existing problems 
and to promote sustainable development in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I want to stress once again the importance of 
adopting the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Mercier 
to replace, in the French version of the motion, the term 
“frontière” by the words “limite territoriale”. At first glance, 
the nuance may seem subtle, if not insignificant. Yet, there is 
a clear difference between “frontière” and “limite 
territoriale”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the French dictionary <I>Le Petit Robert</I> partly defines 
“frontière” as a “ligne idéale, au tracé arbitraire, 
généralement jalonnée par des signes conventionnels (bornes, 
barrières, poteaux, bouées”. The word “limite” seems much more 
appropriate, since its first meaning is “ligne qui sépare deux 
terrains ou territoires contigus”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore imperative, so as to avoid any confusion, to 
adopt the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Mercier in 
the French version of the motion. As she said so appropriately, 
we completely change the meaning of his motion if we change the 
border of the provinces. Tis is not at all what the member for 
Churchill River intended with his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During their study on Canada and the circumpolar region, all the 
members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade came to realize that the communities living 
north of the 55th parallel have a unique environment and 
culture. 
There can be no sustainable development and economy without 
their contribution and without the concrete knowledge that these 
people have of their milieu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois will support Motion M-237, with 
the amendment we proposed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Motion No. 237, brought forward by my 
colleague the member for Churchill River, which deals with the 
international circumpolar community.  I will read the motion for 
those who are not familiar with it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
recognize the 55th parallel as the identified Canadian boundary 
for participation in the international circumpolar community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion sounds a little complicated but I think for those who 
read it carefully its meaning will be fairly clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois and her 
amendment to the motion.  She raises a valid point and an 
interpretation for a greater understanding of the honourable 
intent behind Motion No. 237. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for leadership and a vision for the future of 
this country.  Canada is a large country with diverse regions and 
economies.  This diversity includes our varied cultures and 
histories.  One need only look at the House, at some of the 
artwork and some of the names of the members of parliament to 
understand how diverse and rich our culture is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This land is based upon shared values and a common sense of 
purpose in the face of geographic challenges.  This point is 
often missed by those who would compare us to our neighbours to 
the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate on this motion we have listened to the different 
policy spins and an apparent refusal for parliament as a whole to 
demonstrate leadership and vision in this new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do acknowledge and thank the members who have spoken 
in favour of this motion.  The members recognize this motion for 
its intent to include a very marginalized sector of Canada, the 
northern regions between the 55th and 60th parallels. Broadening 
the participation and opportunities for these northern regions 
and communities can provide a better socioeconomic future for 
current and future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to ask the question, why should these northern areas of 
Canada be delegated to base resource extraction where material 
shipped south is processed and value added goods and services are 
repurchased by the north?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from the east, from the island of Cape Breton, I 
understand all too well what happens when raw materials are 
shipped to one part of the country to be processed and sent back 
for us to purchase again. It is ironic that we should talk about 
that on the night that we will vote on the Devco bill, which was 
an attempt to diversify the economy after years of doing exactly 
what has been happening to the people in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House surely can recognize an opportunity for a region to 
find greater self-sufficiency and move forward on its own.  In 
turn that would create less dependency on traditional revenue 
sources and greater equality.  There are pockets of the country 
which are extremely wealthy and are doing extremely well, and 
there are other regions, and certainly the north is one, where 
that wealth is not shared.  It is time to allow the people in the 
north greater self-sufficiency and to move forward in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listened as the government commits to one progressive 
northern circumpolar policy and then does the exact opposite in 
action.  As I have said in the House over the last few days, the 
government's actions certainly speak louder than its legislation 
and its words and rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at some of the findings on file, the government's 
response to the 1997 report of the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade is almost 
exclusively in relation to DIAND definitions of the north, that 
being north of the 60th parallel. The response includes the 
following points at page 10, recommendation 32: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to involving northern stakeholders, 
especially aboriginal peoples, in international discussions of 
Arctic issues and Canada has played a lead role within the Arctic 
Council to ensure that this commitment is met. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This landmark committee report was based on an overall 
circumpolar community, not on a limitation to a 60th parallel 
boundary of convenience. The standing committee recommended: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—an explicit goal of federal government circumpolar affairs 
policy should be to facilitate community based local, and 
regional level contacts, in close co-operation with provincial 
and territorial governments and their Arctic constituencies— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about involving the people who live in the 
communities in decision making. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—as well as in ongoing consultation with indigenous peoples' 
organizations, the private sector, and NGOs working on 
circumpolar sustainable development issues.  A concerted effort 
should be made to avoid the duplication of initiatives, while at 
the same time assisting co-ordination among the various Canadian 
actors working towards common circumpolar objectives. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That recommendation is exactly what this motion is intended to 
expedite.  This is not some flighty idea; it has come forward 
after real thought, consideration and a report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Decisions are being made not by the circumpolar communities and 
regions affected, but are based on multinational interests 
content with maximum development profits with as little 
interference as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1998 the Minister of Foreign Affairs published his 
vision for a northern foreign policy.  He postulated on core 
Canadian values and long term national objectives, and “a 
greater focus in the north itself on self-reliance and 
sustainable development”. Again we are asking the community to 
be involved in decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me return to the circumpolar community report.  I am quoting 
from page three of the government's response: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the most part, the Government of Canada accepts the 
recommendations of the Standing Committee, especially the 
underlying themes of renewing commitment to northern issues and 
circumpolar relations, and to the pursuit of domestic and foreign 
policies that will enhance sustainable opportunities for 
aboriginal people and for other northerners. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is what the government wants, then why should we not 
support this motion?  It is not a bill; it is a motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the 1999 World Summit on Nordicity held in Quebec City last 
February, there were open and frank discussions on the north and 
future options for northern communities. 
It was stated at the summit: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of the boundaries of the frigid zone has not yet 
been settled.  A proposed indicator comprising 10 factors 
establishes the limit of this zone at between 50 and 70 degrees 
north latitude.  Southeastern Russia and southeastern Canada are 
the two places in the world where polar conditions extend the 
farthest south.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Varying definitions for the north include temperature factors, 
geological indicators, and as many of my NDP colleagues have 
indicated, ecoregions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concrete answers and directions for northern participation 
and involvement in circumpolar affairs vary, as they shall in 
perpetuity.  It is a disservice and unfair to northern Canadians 
to place limits based on a federal government department's 
arbitrary boundary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Churchill River stated, the 60th parallel 
is a boundary of convenience drawn up by dominion surveyors 
without credence or comprehension of the peoples and the 
circumstances through Canada's great north. Shared international 
circumpolar community resources, culture and sustainable concerns 
should not be limited by outdated policies.  As my colleague from 
Churchill River, Saskatchewan, likes to say, the south forgets 
that Canada's north is indeed inhabited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During discussions with foreign affairs on this motion, the hon. 
member stated repeatedly that northern interests and stakeholders 
must be included and indeed encouraged to participate in northern 
and circumpolar activities and initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing radical in this motion.  It has been studied. 
It has been reported.  It is a call by northerners to be involved 
in making their own decisions and a call to recognize that they 
have a substantial contribution to make in developing their own 
economy.  I fail to see why anyone in the House could not support 
the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this issue is new to me.  I deliberately hesitated to 
get up early in the rotation to speak to this motion because I 
was hoping that by listening to the speakers ahead of me I would 
hear some reasonable argument as to why we would support such a 
motion. Unfortunately I have not heard anything except a lot of 
political blathergab in the discussion so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why we would consider supporting such a 
motion. My riding borders on the 60th parallel as does the riding 
of the member for Churchill River.  We are not below the 60th 
parallel within the boundaries of the northern frigid zone. We 
are clearly in the northern boreal forest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The northern provincial boundaries have been in place since 
1906. Certainly if we were to consider changing the boundaries, 
if it were to make any sense in my opinion at least, the 
boundaries would be moved north so that the boundaries followed 
the southern limit of the Arctic Barrens.  The Inuit people have 
occupied the Arctic Barrens for thousands of years and live in 
conditions that are similar to other aboriginal people in other 
barren regions around the pole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that the 60th parallel would be moved south and 
include that part of the province between the 55th and 60th 
parallels under some guise of being beneficial to the aboriginal 
people who might live in that area does not make any sense at 
all.  The aboriginal people who live between the 55th and 60th 
parallels are under the jurisdiction of the federal government 
now as are those north of the 60th parallel. 
I fail to see how moving the boundary down would have any great 
impact on the aboriginal people living between the two parallels. 
There can be some argument made for differentiating in either 
Canadian sovereign policy or international policy how we deal 
with the Barrens and the high Arctic where the environment is 
extremely fragile.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent most of my working years in that part of Canada.  Man's 
footprint on that part of the globe is not there today and gone 
tomorrow.  Once a footprint is made in the permafrost it is there 
for eternity.  The scars that man leaves on the landscape not 
only stay there, they are magnified over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a unique quality to Canada's Arctic that needs special 
consideration and a special policy.  There would be some merit in 
developing that policy in conjunction with our northern 
neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see nothing that would be involved in moving that parallel 
south except a huge fight with the provinces.  Immediately, and 
rightly so, it would be viewed by the provinces as nothing short 
of a resource grab by the federal government.  In my 
constituency, in my province, there are huge and valuable 
resources.  There is tar sand development, heavy oil development, 
mineral development, diamond exploration, with future development 
in the diamond mining industry, as well as forestry and other 
valuable natural resources, which I believe the provinces would 
be most hesitant to part with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at what we have already done with the Canadian 
initiative in the Arctic council, we have to wonder.  There were 
some serious questions raised about the benefits of the Arctic 
council and the cost of Canada belonging to it.  Instead of 
giving more territory, more bureaucracy and more dollars to it, 
let us look at and evaluate the value of the Arctic council, 
which has existed since 1996.  Let us see if we are getting value 
for our dollar from the investment we have already made in this 
Arctic initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I cannot understand what the benefit was for Canada 
or what was received in terms of value for our dollar.  I do not 
want to single out the Arctic council.  There are other 
international organizations to which Canada pays a substantial 
amount of money to belong that do not demonstrate great value for 
the dollars invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea lacks credibility.  From what I have heard in 
discussion and from what I have read in <I>Hansard</I>, it has no 
merit.  The people and the countries between the 60th and 55th 
parallels have little in common with the true Arctic regions of 
Canada and, for that matter, the rest of the world.  It would not 
make sense or add up to any benefit either for the people or for 
the territory.  Unless I am misinterpreting the whole issue, I 
cannot see how we would do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries, such as the United States for example, have not 
been particularly enthusiastic about the issue of the Arctic 
council, an international group formulating Arctic policy.  That 
may go back to the concern of the United States over national 
security and national defence and the fact that the Canadian 
initiative on the Arctic council does not extend to matters 
dealing with military and national security.  Of course Alaska is 
within the area, so the United States has a fair stake within the 
Arctic region, but it does not seem to be particularly 
enthusiastic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly important that we maintain friendly and 
co-operative relationships with our Arctic neighbours, those who 
share the Arctic with us, but I fail to see why we would enter 
into these kinds of agreements specifically to deal with an area 
that is not even identifiable as being separate from other areas 
of Canada, because, as I say, a good part of the area is part of 
the northern boreal forest and not the Canadian or international 
Arctic region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not advocating that we should not meet and maintain 
relations with our international neighbours, but I fail to see 
the worth of creating this bureaucracy and having it grow any 
further than it already has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not heard any significant argument in favour of this 
motion and, therefore, I would urge my colleagues in my party and 
my colleagues in the House to vote against it, simply because 
there are no substantive or valid reasons why we should go down 
the road the motion is suggesting, and because the bad will, the 
cost and all of the other things involved would not be worth the 
benefit which we would achieve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me as a New Brunswicker to have an opportunity to 
speak to Motion No. 237.  It gives me an opportunity to speak 
about a region of Canada about which I know little on a personal 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a very diverse country.  One of the things I would 
like to share with you, Mr. Speaker, and I know that you share 
the very same sentiment, is that one of the most distinguished 
privileges a member of parliament has is the opportunity to meet 
Canadians throughout the country in their own communities, 
like-minded and otherwise.  That is something which I greatly 
cherish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also cherished my opportunities to speak to the member 
for Churchill River, who is a very learned member of parliament 
and one who takes the development of public policy quite 
seriously.  I know this bill is brought forth with good intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from my role on the environment committee that the great 
north is a region of this country that quite often gets forgotten 
in the development of public policy.  Quite often decisions that 
we make in the southern regions of the country have a negative 
effect on the north.  The people of the north do not necessarily 
have a role in terms of changing those decisions, yet they have 
to live with the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best illustration that I know of is that of persistent 
organic pollutants and pesticides that, on occasion, because they 
are airborne, end up in the food chain of our northern 
peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The circumpolar community is where discussions of this nature 
take place among members of the international community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One good reason this motion deserves a high degree of positive 
scrutiny is that the rest of the international community who are 
members of the circumpolar community utilize the 55th parallel. 
Canada, as one of the largest members geographically, I believe 
is the only country that does not utilize the 55th parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One fundamental principle which defines how the Progressive 
Conservative Party believes this federation should work is that 
the rights of the provinces should always be respected in 
ensuring that they have an appropriate role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to reserve our opportunity to finalize a position 
here this evening on how the Progressive Conservative Party will 
vote on Motion No. 237. I do not think it would be wrong to 
consider that perhaps the provinces would want to send a 
representative to the circumpolar conferences where they 
establish public policy or international agreements that may 
affect their own regions. I understand the province of Alberta 
already participates as a member, despite the fact that it is 
below the 60th parallel, and that it participates on occasion 
within the circumpolar international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our perspective if we were to write this motion I do not 
think it is wrong for the federal government to tell the 
provinces that they have to participate at an international level 
at circumpolar conferences of this nature.  However if this 
motion were amended to include that if, after being consulted, 
the provinces thought it was something they wanted to join to add 
that representation with the federal government, I speak 
personally as opposed for the party in this respect, but I would 
be far more comfortable with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is twofold.  The rest of the international community 
utilizes the 55th parallel. The hon. member for Churchill River 
wants to bring Canada in line with that thought. Canada has 
always thought of the north as above the 60th parallel.  If that 
fits the services of the provinces and it is what the provinces 
want to maintain, I am comfortable with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces may want to have a greater role in the 
international agreements that are taken on by the federal 
government.  To illustrate, with respect to Kyoto the federal 
took on a target and time line and really had no idea how it was 
going to implement it.  It had no plan. To have a higher amount 
of provincial input in taking on these international commitments 
would be a step in the right direction to getting the job done. 
Nothing gets done in this federation unless the provinces are on 
side.  It is very difficult to implement things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier the Progressive Conservative Party would 
like the opportunity to consult some of its provincial partners. 
It would like to seek their input in terms of what their thoughts 
would be in having greater responsibilities in participating in 
an international venue of this nature.  It is fundamental that we 
consult the first nations as well and seek their input.

line with the international community versus perhaps putting too 
much responsibility on the provinces, a responsibility which they 
may not wish to take on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the motion has been brought forth in a very constructive 
manner.  It is something that Canadians will have to revisit as 
they continue to participate in international conferences from a 
circumpolar perspective.  It is because Canada is the one country 
that is out of step with the international community that we 
should ensure that if it needs to be revisited with our 
provincial partners, we do so. I applaud the member for bringing 
the motion forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Motion No. 237 calls on the government to recognize the 55th 
parallel as an inclusionary parallel of the circumpolar 
community.  In no way does the motion change provincial 
boundaries.  It does not ask that the 60th parallel be brought 
further down, dissecting the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my experience, from attending circumpolar conferences and 
circumpolar-related parliamentary business, and in 1996, with the 
Arctic council being created, we had an international community 
willing to work on northern issues, on the issue of nordicity, of 
health, of environment, of economic and resource development and 
of sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are major topics of international and domestic 
consequence. Academics and traditional land users should be aware 
of the potential risks of environmental impacts from northern 
Europe or Russia and the environmental impacts of persistent 
organic pollutants on the economies of the Arctic region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I am asking from this House is to agree, since the 55th 
parallel is recognized internationally as part of a community 
dealing with polar nordicity issues, to include those people 
within this country as part of that dialogue.  Let us not exclude 
the people south of 60. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By convenience, Canada has been sending delegates from the 
Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and the northern tip of 
Quebec which also touches on part of north of 60. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While living in northern Saskatchewan I was honoured to have 
been able to watch CBC North, a special channel featuring 
northern Canada.  However, northern Saskatchewan, northern 
Alberta, northern B.C., northern Manitoba, northern Ontario and 
northern Quebec were not part of the dialogue and are not part of 
that region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen the Arctic winter games on television every 
now and then.   One of my highlights was when I saw the games 
being played in my neighbourhood, right next door to my boundary

</I></B></P><P align=left>Fort McMurray hosted the Northern Arctic Winter Games one year 
and that was when my eyes were opened.  The northern half of the 
provinces have a special relationship with each other and with 
our brothers and sisters in the north.  We have a community among 
ourselves.  We are isolated.  We are heavily dependent on natural 
resources and on transfer payments.  We have high delivery costs 
and high cost services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To bring this common community together the federal government 
needs to recognize that the circumpolar community needs to be 
expanded as it is internationally.  Stockholm, Sweden, is part of 
the international community.  Its boreal forest zone is in the 
northern part of that country.  It is not only the frost region. 
The boreal forest is part of the circumpolar community.  It is 
the same with the Taiga forest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize to my colleagues who are proficient in French.  I 
personally did not choose the translated term for frontier.  The 
translators suggested the terminology limite territoriale as the 
term to use and we accept that.  We understand the French translation 
is different.  We support the amendment wholeheartedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our intention is not to make boundaries.  It is to recognize 
that there is a northern definition within our provinces.  We 
should involve the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, B.C., 
Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.  They should be part of circumpolar 
discussions as well.  They should be sending delegates to these 
dialogues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps my hon. colleague who spoke hesitantly will see the 
benefits of the north, not only for northern development.  Many 
of the northern solutions are southern solutions.  The pilot 
projects or the risk aspects they are taking on with new 
developments in the north may also reap benefits for urban 
centres in the southern regions or for agricultural regions. That 
is all I am asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an innocent motion asking that we involve people who 
reside in the northern half of the provinces in the international 
dialogue.  This would give them self-confidence in what they 
believe and the knowledge they hold.  They would also contribute 
to the betterment of Canada and the betterment of the 
international Arctic community.  I ask for the support of all 
members of the House for my motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Pursuant to order made earlier today, 
all questions necessary to dispose of the motion are deemed put 
and a recorded division demanded and deferred until Monday, June 
12, at the expiry of the time provided for Government Orders.
