      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international panel of some 2,000 leading scientists, is due to release its latest report. According to yesterday’s <i>Globe and Mail</i>, that report will conclude that the evidence on climate change is “unequivocal,” and that human activity is the cause of that change. The report finds that due to climate change, extreme weather  will increase; sea levels will rise; and the effects will be felt for more than a thousand years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnitude of this challenge is clear, economically as well as ecologically. The recent Stern report, prepared for the UK government by Sir Nicholas Stern, highlighted the risk of climate change to the global economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stern report found that if countries do not address this challenge, the cost of climate change could be equivalent to the cost of both world wars and the Great Depression. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the report, climate change could shrink the global economy by a staggering 20%—yes, 20%. Canada must not shrink from this challenge. In a country so blessed with immense natural resources, technological ability, and creative ingenuity, we have the ability to be a leader. Moreover, as one of the wealthiest countries on the planet, we have the responsibility to be a leader. </div>

    </p><a name="Para398334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the constant opposition of the Conservatives, the Liberal government renewed the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, passed the Species at Risk Act, amended the Migratory Birds Convention Act, established new national parks, ratified the Kyoto protocol, and played a prominent environment role on the global stage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998 the Liberal government signed Kyoto.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2000 we invested $625 million on climate change research and emission reduction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2003 we announced $2 billion in new climate change funding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These steps laid the foundation for Canada's fight against climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2005 the Liberal government passed a budget that Elizabeth May called the greenest in Canadian history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clean Air Renewable Energy Coalition said, “This budget is so green it should have been announced on St. Patrick's Day”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2005 the Liberal government introduced project green, a comprehensive plan to fight climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sierra Club of Canada called project green, “probably the most innovative approach anywhere in the world for a government to actually reduce emissions”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Environmental Trust said that, “With this first good step, Canada is proving that we can protect our environment and grow our economy”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2005 the Liberal government added greenhouse gases to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. This crucial step allows the federal government to regulate the chemicals that cause climate change right now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Environmental Law Association applauded this move, saying, “We are united in our support for the use of CEPA by the federal government as an appropriate regulatory authority”.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398364"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister eliminated the position of Ambassador for the Environment—a position created by a former Conservative government.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, adding insult to injury, this Prime Minister encouraged all the other climate-change deniers across the planet to do the same, by actively and deliberately undermining the Kyoto protocol—the only international process that is significantly tackling global warming.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I did hear the member opposite say something about preparing for an election. That came from the member who said that he would not vote for the budget, a budget he has not even seen. Clearly, the member is preparing for an election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398402"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as being ready, I have the honour to tell the House that not just myself but a number of colleagues on this side of the House have been working on this plan since before the last election. We were involved in developing a plan a long time ago and we are rolling out that plan as we speak. However, I guess the polls are suggesting that this is the thing to do today. I noticed that a number of the members opposite are wearing green ribbons which is their attempt at convincing the public that we are green. Maybe those green ribbons are actually living leaves because that would be a step toward cleaning the environment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398403"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member opposite, who just presented the motion, conceded that future Liberal governments would be unable to meet their Kyoto commitment of reducing greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels. That was said by the member opposite on July 1, 2006. Frankly, the member had 10 years to do this. This morning the member said that in 2008 “I will be part of Kyoto but I will say to the world I don't think I will make it”. He has been saying that for 10 years and he is still saying it, which is incredible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398404"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to ask the member a very simple question, although I know I will not get the answer. Could the member tell us what Kyoto will do to reduce the number of smog days for the folks in Ontario that went from four in 1993 to some forty-seven in 2004?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this plan we were ready to honour our Kyoto commitment. The plan was supposed to be improved every year. We have already asked to have it improved.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning my declaration this summer, I will repeat again that if we wait for a year of inaction by the Conservative government, in 2008 it will be very difficult to be on time for 2012.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also forgive the member for not understanding the difference between smog and greenhouse gas emissions. It has been said that we are talking about combustion. When we tackle greenhouse gas emissions it is not the same thing as smog. The countries that are doing a lot on greenhouse gas emissions are also doing a lot about smog. We do not need to choose. We need to do both.</div>

What happened after that? As usual, as in 2005, the NDP is putting its own interests before the interests of Canada and the interests of the planet.</div>

Lloyd Francis, the former member of Parliament for Carleton and Ottawa West, a riding I am privileged to represent. On behalf of my constituents, I wish to acknowledge his great service not only to our community but to Canada. Mr. Francis was a great man and was a great adviser to me on a number of key issues over the last year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was most fortunate to have met Mr. Francis and to have known him. I want to pass on my party's condolences to his wife and family. I attended the memorial service for Mr. Francis. It was not really a funeral but a celebration of not just one life well lived, but of probably about 12 lives well lived. He was a great man. I want to acknowledge his great contribution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin my remarks today by saying that I believe that climate change is a real and serious issue facing the world today. It is undoubtedly the biggest environmental threat we are facing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me also say that this government recognizes that the Kyoto protocol is all about a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions around the world and, most important, for us right here in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we share the disappointment of many Canadians and people from around the world that the former government did not meet its obligations or accept its responsibilities, let me indicate that Canada's new government will take real action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the same time as we make our air more breathable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to my next point. I am glad the Liberal Party brought forward this motion today because it is an opportunity to remind the Liberals of their shameful record of 13 years of inaction on the environment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make things worse, the track record of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A> is very regrettable on environmental issues. People do not have to go far to read about his party's record. Let us look at the quotes from the 2006 report of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development. It states:</div>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para398433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is from Chapter 1, page 10. The report goes on, stating that:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, this is a sad track record of failure on the environment from the party opposite. To have the Liberal Party now lecture the House on environmental policy is like a Liberal trying to lecture other members on ethics. That party has no credibility.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow, some of the world's leading scientists will gather in Paris to outline what will be some very significant additional scientific research, something that will only encourage us to do more, not just around the world but hopefully here in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to receiving the contents of that report. From what I have read so far in reports, we hope to learn from world renowned scientists, and regrettably, the news is not good. Global warming and climate change are serious issues. Not only do they face us here at home, but they must bring the entire world community together.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For far too long, Canada has not accepted our responsibility when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This government intends to do something about it. Clearly, the Kyoto protocol is a 15 year marathon to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. When it was signed in 1997, when the starter's pistol went off in that race, the Liberal Government of Canada began to run in the opposite direction. That is shameful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, we have a lot of catching up to do. It will not be easy. It will take focus. It will take Canadians working together. It will take members of Parliament from all political parties working together.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I believe the challenges of global warming and climate change are the challenges of the 21st century and we must respond. We must respond by also addressing clean air. We can do both at the same time. Let us respond without sending $5 billion of taxpayers money to Russia, to China and to India, which will not help the quality of air in Canada at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government will act. The government will deliver real results on the environment for Canadians. We owe it to ourselves and we owe it to the next generation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at issue is the notion of climate change and what our country needs to do about it.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the opinion of many people in the country that things could not get worse with respect to the environment and the federal government, when the Conservatives came into power things did get worse.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is very specific for the minister. At the same time we are talking about implications, he will be in Paris a little later this week to talk about the serious economic and environmental implications of dangerous climate change. At the same time, the government is refusing, as the previous government did, to put a halt to the tax breaks offered to oil sands companies operating in northern Alberta. It continues the plans for an expansion of those projects, despite the request for a moratorium from the people of Fort McMurray, their elected officials and also the first nations people of that area.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a seriousness about this issue, will he commit today to join in the call to halt progress on the rapid expansion of this until we can get control of the issue and stop driving emissions up in the country?

    </p><a name="Para398477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I begin by thanking the environment minister for the hard work and the great achievements he has made. The government, under the leadership of our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister </A> and our minister, is making headway. It is a shock to the former Liberal government that progress can be made on this file. It is ironic and hypocritical that the Liberals present this motion to us today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion presented by the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78331,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78331&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</A> calls into question the government's commitment to the environment. That contention is just plain wrong. The government is committed to delivering real solutions to protect the health of Canadians and the environment. The government is about action and real change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government has said before that it accepts the science of climate change. We understand that it is real and we know that it is here. That is why we are taking real action to preserve our environment and to protect the health of every Canadian.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians demand leadership from the federal government, and that is precisely what they are getting now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that to make real progress on the environment, we need real cooperation on all fronts, between all parties and all stakeholders. If the member opposite really cared about the environment the way he says he does, he would be looking to cooperate. Instead, we are mired in the minutiae when we should be pushing the agenda forward, making a real difference for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion brought forward today says, “the Canadian Environmental Protection Act is available immediately to launch the necessary action” Canadians covet on the environment. I can assure members it simply does not do enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A>, Canada's clean air act, is a necessary addition to CEPA. It would set in motion Canada's first comprehensive, integrated approach to tackle air pollution and greenhouse gases. In doing so, it would deliver better air quality for Canadians and it would take substantial aim at the issue of climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our proposed clean air act would create a new clean air part in CEPA that would provide a tailor-made approach to enable integrated regulatory approaches for the reduction of indoor and outdoor air pollutants as well as reduce greenhouse gases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to CEPA will require the ministers of environment and health to establish national air quality standards and to monitor and report annually on the status and effectiveness of the actions taken by all governments in Canada to improve air quality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, proposed amendments to CEPA will also strengthen the government's ability to enter into equivalency agreements with the provinces and their territories. This will prevent regulatory duplication by more clearly allowing for recognition of provincial permitting and licensing regimes for industrial facilities as equivalent, in effect, to federal regulations so long as they meet the same environmental objectives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member's motion states, “our government must reconfirm Canada's commitment to honour the principles and targets of the Kyoto Protocol in their entirety”. Had the previous government not left us in such a precarious position, perhaps we would have been able to do that by the 2012 deadline.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate is not on the merits of Kyoto; it is on the time required to achieve the objectives. The government must deal with the fact that we have lost 10 years due to Liberal inaction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Canada's new government took office a year ago, it quickly became apparent that our Kyoto commitments would be impossible to meet. Because of the previous government's inaction, today Canada stands at 35% above the Kyoto target, with only five years remaining to meet the imposed deadline.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some critics, including the member opposite, have said that we should simply push harder and make our mission to meet the 2012 reduction targets, no matter what the cost. They are wrong.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100">(1100)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para398491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we must act to put Canada on the path to achieving sustainable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but in reality, years of inaction between 1997 and 2006 have left Canada in no position to do so. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians can be certain, however, that this government is committed to reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, but we intend to do so prudently while promoting sustainable economic growth and prosperity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government knows that Canadians are concerned about poor air quality so we have made it a priority to clean the air that Canadians breathe. By introducing Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A> we have put forward a number of tools that will help Canada address its air quality by reducing greenhouse gas and smog emissions simultaneously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon we will announce aggressive short term targets for industrial greenhouse gas emissions with sector by sector regulations, all coming into effect between 2010 and 2015. This is the first time that Canada has regulated reductions in both air pollution and greenhouse gases. Internationally, we are the first country to regulate all sectors in an integrated and cohesive manner.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using existing authorities, we will regulate emissions from all major industrial sources: electricity generation, smelters, iron and steel, cement, forest products, chemical production, and oil and gas. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By giving clear direction we are providing industry with the incentive and regulatory certainty it needs to invest in greener technologies and to deliver early reductions in their emissions. While we have been listening to industrial concerns, we have also made it clear that the days for soft rhetoric are over. Making progress on the environment requires hard work and tough decisions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realize that the best way to reduce our global emissions is to address the issue here at home. Using taxpayer money to buy credits halfway around the world is not a solution. It is barely even a band-aid. So we have taken a number of steps and we have taken a number of approaches to be a constructive player in the international efforts to address climate change. We know it can be done because we have done it before. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987 the Conservative government was instrumental in pushing for the Montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. Twenty years later, with 191 nations now signed on to the treaty, atmospheric CFC concentrations have either levelled off or decreased considerably. The Montreal protocol is widely viewed as an example of exceptional international cooperation. Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has even called it perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our challenge has broadened since then. So too has our commitment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why in addition to the proposed clean air act, we introduced a clean air regulatory agenda which supports effective regulations on both indoor and outdoor pollutants as well as greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this agenda, we are providing stronger energy efficiency standards on consumer and commercial products. We have already established new emission standards for on-road motorcycles. We are paving the way for setting mandatory fuel consumption standards on vehicles that Canadians buy. We will also regulate 5% average renewable content in gasoline and 2% average renewable content in diesel fuel and heating oil.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help individual Canadians and communities do their part, we have already taken action by providing a tax credit to those who use public transit and by increasing the funding for public transit infrastructure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also announced a number of other initiatives that will help to reduce emissions at home, at work and even in our communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two weeks alone, we invested $230 million in the research, development and demonstration of clean energy technologies. We announced more than $1.5 billion in funding for the ecoenergy renewable initiative to boost Canada's renewable energy supplies. We unveiled our plan to invest approximately $300 million over four years to promote smarter energy use and to reduce the amount of harmful emissions that affect the health of Canadians. Without a doubt, action by our government on the environment has been driven by our goal to protect the health of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took action to help ensure that mercury switches are dealt with safely before cars are recycled and scrapped. This alone will prevent the release of as much as 10 tonnes of mercury being admitted into the atmosphere.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1105"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105">(1105)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para398506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that Canada's new government is committed to the environment by our action alone. It is clear that we are taking concrete action to address climate change. Quite frankly, by any standard of comparison we are moving quickly with action and not the hollow promises that we saw from the former government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a plan, we intend to stick to it and we will achieve the plan.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398510"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para398511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, will the government introduce a cap and trade system or not to achieve our greenhouse gas reduction targets?</div>
    </p><a name="Para398512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, could he help Canadians understand why his government's own officials in Environment Canada and Finance Canada recommended to the government that it not bring in a tax deductible transit pass because the economics simply were not there to justify it?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow—Friday, February 2—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was created in 1988, will release the first part of its fourth assessment report, which states that the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases has increased dramatically since the pre-industrial era, that is, since the 1750s. This increase is due primarily to human activity, including the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use in agriculture and forestry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provided the scientific basis leading to the adoption of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and, a few years later in December 1997, the Kyoto protocol.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear to the Bloc Québécois that human activity produces greenhouse gases and is responsible for emissions and climate change. The Bloc Québécois also recognizes how urgent it is to take action and has never stopped pressuring the federal government—whether Liberal or Conservative—to take significant steps toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting the Kyoto protocol targets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois has denounced the Conservative government's push to focus the debate more on air quality than on reducing greenhouse gas emissions enough to meet Canada's Kyoto targets. We therefore support the Liberal Party motion, insofar as the required, realistic plan includes the Bloc Québécois' demands, namely, full respect for the Kyoto targets, the possibility for Quebec to choose a regional approach—since Quebec already has its own plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the creation of a carbon credit exchange in Montreal and the $328 million that Quebec needs to meet its target of a 6% reduction compared to 1990.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the motion moved by the leader of the Liberal Party is little more than a copy of the motion presented by the Bloc Québécois and adopted on May 16, 2006, which called for an efficient and fair plan to adhere to the Kyoto protocol. That motion was adopted by the majority of the members of this House. With the motion, the Bloc Québécois was sending a clear message to the Conservative government on the eve of the climate change conference in Bonn. The government was asked to commit to respecting the Kyoto protocol, an international agreement to which Canada is legally bound and which a vast majority of Quebeckers support. In fact, 76% of Quebeckers still believe that the government must make the necessary effort to reach our Kyoto targets; otherwise, it risks jeopardizing Canada's credibility on the international stage. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the Conservative government stubbornly rejected the Kyoto protocol and lost face in front of all the countries that ratified it. This position is no surprise, coming as it does from people who deny the environmental impact of global warming and scoff at the Kyoto protocol.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois believes that the federal government must comply with certain basic principles: honouring international commitments, making an equal effort and fully respecting Quebec's jurisdictions. On the issue of climate change, these three principles have been repeatedly undermined by Ottawa, both by the Conservative party and by the Liberal Party. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the federal government ratified the Kyoto protocol on December 17, 2002 after a majority vote in the House of Commons, thereby promising to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 6% compared to 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012, Ottawa has a dismal record.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, Canada's greenhouse gas emissions were 26.5% higher than in 1990. Consequently, to reach the target of a 6% reduction compared to 1990 levels, Canada must now reduce its emissions by 200 megatonnes annually. Both the Liberals and the Conservatives are to blame for this sad state of affairs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec made different choices. Between 1990 and 2004, its greenhouse gases increased by just 6.1%, which is four times less than the Canadian average. Furthermore, Quebec is already showing leadership with its plan to combat climate change and is proposing a plan to remedy the situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have fundamental principles and these principles have been undermined by a Liberal government in the past and by the current Conservative government. When they were in power—it is all well and good for them to table a motion today—the Liberals dragged their feet instead of taking action to achieve the objectives of the Kyoto protocol. They increased the number of voluntary-based programs, which were not very successful, instead of opting for real solutions such as a territorial approach and the implementation of a carbon exchange.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did they not help Canada achieve the objectives—under their government, greenhouse gas emissions increased by nearly 30%—but they hindered Quebec's ability to fully achieve the targets by refusing to give it the $328 million needed for Quebec's green plan. In her last report, the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development described the government's efforts to achieve the Kyoto protocol objectives as too few and too slow.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120">(1120)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para398559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner was also very critical of the intensity approach, saying that it will not help achieve the Kyoto protocol objectives and could even increase Canadian emissions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is asking Ottawa for a plan to implement the Kyoto protocol that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 6% below 1990 levels and a series of measures that come under federal government jurisdiction: strict vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards; incentives for buying environmental vehicles; significant support for the development of renewable energies, such as wind energy; the elimination of tax benefits for oil companies; and subsidies for agencies that contribute to achieving the Kyoto protocol objectives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois wants to emphasize that the plan should include the creation of a carbon exchange that will compensate provinces, companies and agencies that show leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is also asking that the federal plan include—and I cannot emphasize this enough—a mechanism to allow the signing of a bilateral agreement with Quebec based on a territorial approach. This agreement should give Quebec the financial tools it needs to implement more effective measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on its territory. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe this is the most efficient, effective and the only truly equitable solution that takes into account the environmental efforts and choices made by Quebeckers in recent years, particularly with the development of hydroelectricity. In short, the Bloc Québécois concurs with the Liberals on the objective of the motion, even though the means envisaged by the Bloc Québécois to meet Kyoto targets are different.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak more about the territorial approach that we favour for the Kyoto protocol . The Bloc Québécois has always called for this territorial approach. Given the major differences between the economies of Quebec and the other provinces, as well as efforts already made, it is the only effective and equitable approach that will not require years of negotiations. The principle is quite simple: Quebec and the provinces may opt out of the federal plan and adopt their own measures to achieve mandatory reductions of emissions to 6% below 1990 levels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to allow Quebec and the other provinces to opt out, the territorial approach would include a system for the exchange of emission permits. The Liberals were adamant about developing a sectoral approach requiring several years of work and pegging 2010 as the reference year. We spoke out against this approach several times because it is inefficient and not fair to Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the deadline is looming, the federal government must opt for the territorial approach in order to accelerate, as much as possible, efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in Canada. Yet, on two occasions, the Conservatives rejected this promising approach and, at this time, do not seem any more receptive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need only refer to the debates of the parliamentary committee on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2181701,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2181701&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-288</A> when the Conservative Party, the government party, rejected a Bloc Québécois proposal and amendment that simply would have opened up the possibility of proceeding on a territorial basis by coming to an agreement with Quebec based on the principles of equity. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125">(1125)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para398568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But obviously the Conservative government, like the Liberal government before it, refuses to adopt this fairer approach for Quebec, which would also enable Canada, let it be said, to reduce and to respect the Kyoto objectives. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are in favour of this motion, of course, but we think some major changes are required in measures to reduce climate change. Fundamentally we believe that we should definitely ensure that the Kyoto objectives are respected; we agree. A change of approach is required, however, so that provinces, like Quebec, where a formal commitment has been made by its National Assembly and its government, to meet the Kyoto objectives, can be fully responsible for implementation of their own policies. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the approach actually that has enabled Europe to work towards the Kyoto protocol objectives and to comply with them. Europe made a commitment to Kyoto in 1997—and I was there—to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 8%. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in Kyoto and I saw how organized the Europeans were. I saw them ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and even to present to the international community a new strategy based on a territorial approach, whereas the federal government appeared in Kyoto without having talked with the provinces and without having established formal agreements. That is unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government should understand that, if this approach worked in Europe, it might well work here too. Europe, as I said, undertook to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 8%, but it distributed its reductions among the members of its community and among the sovereign member countries of the European Community—at the time, there were 15—based on certain parameters. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398573"></a><p>

I have questions to ask, and I will use two brief examples. First, our government will invest over $1.5 billion over 14 years in the ecoenergy renewable energy initiative. This initiative will encompass all forms of clean, renewable energy: wind, small-scale hydro, solar, biomass, geothermal and tidal. It will help us add up to 4,000 megawatts of clean electricity, enough to power a million homes and the equivalent of taking a million cars off the road.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the technology component of ecoenergy, it represents a targeted investment of more than $230 million over four years, for a total investment of $1.5 billion in energy sciences and technologies. We are working with industry and the provinces, including the Province of Quebec, to set our science and technology priorities, so that we can get the best results in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known about the programs and announcements he referred to for years. They were announced years ago by the Liberal government.

    </p><a name="Para398589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would rather see the member adopt a new approach. For example, he mentioned the WPPI program. He reminded us that the government is committing to allocating 1¢ per kilowatt-hour produced by wind energy, an amount similar to what the previous government promised. Why not double that financial incentive to 2¢  per kilowatt-hour produced rather than offer generous financial incentives to the Alberta oil industry? Since 1970, the federal government has invested $70 billion in Canada's oil industry. Instead of doing that, we should take the public funds allocated to the oil industry and improve programs for Canada's renewable energy sector. That is what the government should do to meet the Kyoto protocol targets.</div>

Quebec is ready and has every means at its disposal to enforce the Kyoto protocol within its borders and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1990, for the 2008 and 2012 periods.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what the government and the hon. member must recognize is that a coast-to-coast, Canada-wide approach will fail to make the most of every dollar invested in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Quebec businesses have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by 7% compared to 1990, but it is the transportation sector that has a dismal record. We are proposing that Quebec maintain its target of a 6% reduction compared to 1990—and there will be a firm commitment from the Quebec government and the National Assembly—and that Quebec receive $328 million to reach its target. Thus, Quebec could implement its own, more efficient policies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These funds for fighting climate change would very likely not be used in the industrial sector because it is doing very well in Quebec in the fight against climate change. In contrast to the rest of Canada, these public funds would likely be invested in transportation. This territorial approach is more effective and equitable and maximizes the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for each dollar invested. This is the approach that the federal government should adopt, and in this way we will certainly be able to achieve our Kyoto protocol objectives. </div>

    </p><a name="Para398598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite clearly, in Canada we are in an integrated economy and we still are in a country together. We have certain interests that play against each other and certain interests that we have in common. However, in energy, it is very important to realize that we are an integrated system. We supply natural gas across the country. We could supply more hydro electric energy across the country as well if we had a grid, but right now we are proposing to take on a new source of fossil fuels and that would be liquefied natural gas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the member's province of Quebec we are looking at a terminal right now for the importation of liquefied natural gas from Russia. Does this fit with the member's idea of how the future of Quebec energy should be developed, that we tie into international markets for a fossil fuel product that has a very high environmental cost in its development and transportation? Is this the answer that the member sees for Canada and for Quebec?</div>

    </p><a name="Para398601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hydroelectricity that was developed in the 1960s and 1970s and the Quebec government’s recent announcement of a hydroelectric development on the Rupert River in cooperation with the first nations are examples of the energy choices that Quebec made. In Quebec, 95% of our electricity is hydroelectricity. That is the reality and the energy position that Quebec has adopted. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before turning to natural gas, I would like to say that Quebec is one of the most proactive provinces on the Canadian scene with regard to the development of wind energy. We have 1000 megawatts tendered and there is enormous potential. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebec's choices are still the same today: develop its hydroelectricity and wind potential to provide clean energy not only to Quebeckers, but also to people in southern Quebec and the United States, if necessary, and thereby help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in North America as a whole. That is Quebec’s winning strategy, which it will continue to apply in the future. </div>

Our challenge is to grasp the ideas, the concepts and the actions that are required for our country to once again be proud of our standing in the international community, for our economy to change course, and for our communities to develop in such a way that we work within the context of this environment and this planet.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earth Summit at Rio in 1992, and some members in this place were there, brought together the world leaders. With great conviction, they produced much rhetoric and pronouncements, and announcements and press conferences. However, one of the substantive things that came from that debate, that crisis that the world was seeing with respect to our environment, was the decision to go on and negotiate an international pact, a treaty that would be binding, that would connect the countries of the world into a common cause, and that cause was to reduce the effects of climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, some of the more progressive climatologists and scientists in the world were saying that this is a serious matter, but the skeptics and the naysayers were far and wide. Yet over time, the debate has gained momentum and with the exception of some backward-looking members in this place and a few narrow pockets of self-interest in this country, the debate has been settled that human-caused anthropogenic climate change is a fact and a reality, and is having an effect on our world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the minister will be going to Europe later this week and will hear directly from the more than 2,000 leading scientists on this issue. They will claim the debate is over as to whether the effects are happening; the only question now is how much hotter is the world getting, and how much of a great change is facing us in our environment?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyoto was negotiated by a former Liberal government in December 1997. Parliament ratified that decision, under a Liberal government, in 2002. One would think with all that history behind it that when it was ratified in February 2005, after Russia ratified it in 2004, the government would have had plans in place. One would think that the government would have taken action, would have been making the systemic changes that are required in the way that we produce and use energy primarily in this country to allow us to fall into compliance to the agreements that we made, but there was more cynicism at play than that. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from Conservative members that protestations were made to executives in Calgary by the former leader of the Liberal Party to not worry, that Kyoto was more of a protocol and an exercise in public relations, but that it was not serious.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo and behold, the surprise came upon us and the protocol was ratified. Now we look to the record. The record is important to establish including the numbers and the comments that I am using here, none of which are under dispute.</div>

That is a direct quote. She also said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This again was stated by Johanne Gélinas, someone who members of the Liberal benches, the Bloc, and the NDP, all opposition parties praised her work as a true fighter for the environment and auditor of this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Liberals and Conservatives, the most recent numbers we have, and these are not disputed, say that we are almost 35% above the targets that we set for ourselves. For Canadians watching this that is a staggering number. It is a staggering condemnation of inaction and dithering that has gone on too long. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time for action is now. That action has been decided through agreement by all four parties in this place to take place in a legislative committee set up to redo, rewrite, and redraft Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A>, a bill that was misnamed as the clean air act.

    </p><a name="Para398623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo and behold, the New Democrats made a suggestion. I remember the day we made the suggestion. The NDP leader, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78385,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78385&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Toronto—Danforth</A>, stood in this place and asked whether the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> would give this bill to a special legislative committee and allow it to be redrafted from top to bottom. Some of my Conservative colleagues guffawed, laughed, chuckled, and said things I could not repeat on the record which were directed toward the NDP leader. It is true. It was incredible. The guffaws were loud. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, in a state of desperation, reminded us of similar times when the Liberals were in power and needed to have a budget rewritten because there was a massive corporate tax cut included that was not campaigned upon and the budget was redrafted. The NDP, pushing to redraft a flawed piece of legislation, got agreement from all the parties to do this. How quickly the parties have forgotten.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to go through the record because it is important. The Liberal leader voted with the Conservatives against mandatory fuel efficiency standards for cars in February 2005. This is not distant history. This is recent. He voted against an NDP proposal for mandatory fuel efficiency standards. He was absent from the vote in fact on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2181701,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2181701&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-288</A>, the bill we will be debating tomorrow to implement the Kyoto accord.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He voted against the NDP proposal to include the precautionary principle in CEPA in November 1999, a strange thing to do, the precautionary principle being something that is known and understood.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going in the wrong direction. Science warns us that a rise in the average global temperature of 2° by 2050 or sooner will have catastrophic impacts.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a suggestion by one of my staff some months ago that we may wish to screen <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i>, a film by the defeated former presidential candidate in the United States. I said it has been out for months, no one will come, but let us try it anyway. We showed it in five different small communities in my riding and there was standing room only in every single community. The most interesting thing was not that more than 500 people came out to watch it, but they stayed afterward because they wanted to talk about these issues. They wanted to talk about what was happening not only in our communities but at the federal level.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I would explain the process that the NDP had negotiated for Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A>, they were encouraged and told me to go back there and get it done and make the proposals. For months the NDP has had front and centre on our website, ndp.ca for those viewing at home with access to the Internet, those proposals out in the public domain so that the other parties can critique them or add to them. What have the other parties done? They brought forward nothing except an extensive witness list, more than 100 witnesses for something we have been studying for more than two and a half years. Let us bring more witnesses to discuss climate change. Let us talk about the nuance of the debate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every party in this place, every platform will claim to have the answers to climate change, and yet when we ask for those answers to be brought forward in amendments and suggestions, in concrete ideas, they are found wanting. Not a single party has brought forward an amendment other than the New Democrats. Not a single party has made a constructive suggestion of how to make this bill better. They have just said it is no good and that is not good enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A> was being tabled, the ministers of the Crown, one by one, it seemed there was a roll call, approached me and said this bill is going to knock our socks off, this clean air thing is going to be so good the NDP will have to support it. It was so disappointing to see the eventual reality for that bill was dead on arrival.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals and Conservatives have decided to stall on this. The sincerity of their action on this is found seriously wanting. The Conservatives delayed debating it in Parliament in December. The Liberals did not even name the members to sit on the committee until the 11th hour, the last possible moment. Only then did they slip in their member list. They were confused. They were not sure anyone wanted to be there and then they all wanted to be there. They got themselves in a snit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties refused to meet during the winter break as the NDP suggested. They were busy. At committee the Liberals refused to agree to a quick process. As the member from the Bloc has pointed out, members of the Conservatives and Liberals are interested in extensive debate. To their credit there is one thing the Liberals have been very good at throughout the entire environment debate and that is the ability to seek consultation and more consultation, and more meetings and further consultations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A> was minister of the environment, I would sit with him and say we need to get such-and-such done. He would shake his head and say, “I have a real struggle at cabinet with this, I cannot get that done. I cannot get mandatory fuel efficiencies. I cannot get any connection between research and development connected to the environment. I cannot get it done. The cabinet is resisting.”</div>
    </p><a name="Para398638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the Liberals will stand in this place and I am sure members will say it again, that we have the ability to do it right now, we could make these changes right now. That is incorrect. We have had that ability for more than five years, four of those years under the Liberals. They had that ability if they claim it to be true for all of those years and they could not get it done. The reason is they needed to return to the cabinet table. They needed to enter back into the political fray behind those closed doors to make the types of progressive changes for the environment that were needed and they could not get it done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could not do it, whether it was the minister of the environment, now the<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Leader of the Opposition</A>, or other ministers of the environment. I know Mr. Anderson from Victoria has made public statements about his inability to get it through cabinet. We have said join with us, have the courage of the convictions to put this into legislation, to draft this in such a way that it can no longer be done behind the closed doors of cabinet. It must be done in this place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament and the public must see what parliamentarians are up to when it comes to climate change and the environment. If there is no other issue that must be in the public discourse, it is this one, but instead we have had delay and dithering.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the very motion the NDP brought forward at committee and members of the House from the other three parties voted 11 to 1 against us for such a suggestion.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rush is on. Every day we ponder, consider, navel-gaze and have speculative conversations about the impact of climate change, but greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and the case becomes impossible. In fact, the Liberal Party might even be in collusion with the Conservative Party to ensure that nothing happens. Maybe they want to roll it all in to the debate around the budget. Maybe the Liberals want to roll it into confidence debates and perhaps at some point in some future imagined and wishful thinking, they will regain power, get it to cabinet and delay more. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The record is absolutely solid in this respect. The very member who was elected a short time ago to lead the Liberal Party claims a new conviction to the environment. I remember the green scarves fondly. My goodness, look at what he named his dog. It seems the solutions are found wanting. When his members show up at committee, they have absolutely no solutions as to how to reach the Kyoto targets or how to reset Canada back on the track. They come wanting. They come lacking.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must understand that we will be judged by future generations about our actions now. We have proposed a course of action to which all parties in this place agreed. All parties recognized it as a way forward and chose to involve themselves in the committee process. We must act beyond narrow partisan interests. We must act in a responsible way, in a way of leadership. We must take command and have the courage to seize the opportunity in front of us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At committee, Liberal members said that they needed to hear more plans from the government. They needed to understand the greater context of the plan. That is incredible. Waiting for a Conservative plan on the environment might even take longer than the time we waited for the Liberal plan on the environment. They need to put those partisan interests aside. They need to come forward with serious and honourable recommendations, solutions they all claim to have. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all intelligent members in the place. We have studied this issue for quite a number of years. We need to get tough. We need to make the hard decisions. We can make those decisions. The people in northwest British Columbia demand that we start to make changes. As Sir Nicholas Stern, former chief economist from the World Bank and who we have all quoted in this place, has said that the cost of inaction is significant, perhaps as much as 20% of the world's GDP. Perhaps worse in terms of economic catastrophes in the first world war and the Great Depression combined, he has called what has happened with pollution perhaps the world's greatest market failure.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that the amendment we just brought forward is one that works completely at purposes and in line with what the leading environmental groups in the country have asked for. The amendment to motion of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105459,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105459&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A> would bring it back in line, would call for that action that the Liberals so desperately want, and they just rejected it.

    </p><a name="Para398664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of the environment groups and the people whom they represent, the many hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of Canadians. They want speedy action on this, and the Liberal Party of Canada dismissed them with a wave. It said that it was not interested in their views. The Liberals will go to their receptions and they may go to their fundraisers and leave $5 in the kitty, but they will not help them when something serious is going on. When there is a legislative process that has been created, the Liberals dismiss them, and that is what they just did.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it remarkable that on an amendment calling for speedy action, calling for some of the things that are proposed by the Liberals in the debate, they want to delay it and take more time to get it right, as if they know how to do that. They did not do that when they were in power and I am not sure they have the capacity or the willingness to do it now, and that worries me. They need to change direction quickly.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If in fact the NDP and its leader were so firmly committed to immediate action, why did they not work with the Liberal Party and the official leader of the opposition at the time to compel the minority government to regulate greenhouse gases under the Canadian Environment Protection Act, all powers of which the new government possesses? In fact, as a reminder for Canadians, our government actually amended the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, against the wishes of the Conservative Party, the new minority government, to include greenhouse gases as toxic substances under the Canadian Environment Protection Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could he help us understand that?</div>
    </p><a name="Para398669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I put four pointed questions to the parliamentary secretary for the environment awhile ago. He was incapable of or refused to answer any of the four. He made a statement, which was quite astonishing, that it was the first government in the world to move to regulate greenhouse gases. Could the member help us understand what the European Union has been doing for 12 years?</div>

The Conservatives have been misguided. They have been wrong. They presented a bill before Parliament and I think they sincerely thought it was a good thing. I think they thought it would pass the mustard for Canadians. The groups and scientists, who were working on this issue, were a little stunned and surprised by the vehemence of Canadians, pushing back on them saying that it was dead on arrival.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working with the Liberal Party is not necessarily the easiest thing to do. An impression has been created by hon. colleague's question that the Liberal Party, when in power, needed the help of the NDP to regulate greenhouse gases under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Liberals had the powers right there all the time. After it was amendment, the capacity to do that was right there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked to the former environment minister about doing that very thing and his response was it was very difficult at the cabinet table because that was where it took place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are suggesting to the hon. member is let us take it from behind the closed doors of cabinet, the veils of secrecy and power, and put it in front of Canadians, here in Parliament. Would that not be a more progressive and enlightened thing to do? We and the environment groups believe so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Liberals were in power, we worked with them to get $1.4 billion for the environment that they did not allot. We rewrote their budget, which was the first time in Canadian history, and we were proud to do it. With a gun to the head, back up against the wall, we used what we could to get the job done on the environment, and we are continuing to fight for the environment from this corner.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, here in Canada, we do not want that, at least the NDP does not. Why not? Take the oil sands, for example. This will be a very important issue and the NDP will have to take a stand. Is it the responsibility of all of Canada to reduce greenhouse gases because there will be greater development of the oil sands? British Columbia has built hydroelectric dams. Should it pay to reduce greenhouse gases resulting from Alberta's oil production? Does this also apply to Quebec and Newfoundland?</div>
    </p><a name="Para398678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be unfair. We shall see if the NDP response will be a wish to reduce Alberta's oil production to avoid paying for the pollution. My question is as follows: is that what the NDP would propose?</div>

We have to be very careful in this debate to not pit province against province. Under that splitting of common interest, and I believe the interests on climate change are common, climate change does not identify provincial boundaries or notions of potential sovereigntist boundaries. Climate change works across this. It is a nation that must be seized with this issue, no less.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is confusing when my hon. colleague talks about choices.

    </p><a name="Para398684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to have been elected to keep the government accountable on the environment and to defend the Kyoto treaty. It is one of the things I ran on and it is one of the reasons I ran at all. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the great privilege, over the last 20 years, of working in the area of environment and energy and I am very privileged now to have been named by the official Leader of the Opposition as the environment critic and, in a sense, I have come full circle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been asking the government for a full year now a simple question: Will it table its plan to fight climate change? I have asked that question repeatedly and I have yet to receive an answer. Unless the government can show Canadians otherwise, now 12 months into a term, there is only one reasonable conclusion for Canadians to draw: there is no plan. The government is making it up as it goes along. It is, as I like to say, jumping from ice flow to ice flow, announcing programs, handing out cheques and organizing photo ops.</div>

It is now clear that it is worse than the fact that there is no plan. There is no vision from the government and no vision from the Prime Minister.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative platform almost did not mention the environment, except for a made in Canada plan.

February became March and then April. The Conservatives introduced a budget that froze or cut every major climate change initiative that our government had put in place, to the tune of $5.6 billion. Bureaucrats were told to take every reference to Kyoto off every government website, including our archives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October, environmental groups were beginning to think nothing would happen. The former minister said, “All targets, whether short, medium or long term, will be consulted with industry, provinces and territories”. Meanwhile, our party was pointing out that there was no need for new legislation. Every legislative power that the government needs is at its disposal under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. All the government needs is conviction, vision and political will.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior officials were sent to deliberately undermine Kyoto, while we, as a nation state, were chairing the international talks. Now we see a second Minister of the Environment in the young government, given that the first minister had taken too many bullets already for the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the PMO.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environment itself is not one of the top five priorities. It was not in the Speech from the Throne. It was slashed from the budget and was not in the fiscal update. Now we have a so-called clean air act. Knowing full well that it does not need any more legislative authority than that which it already possesses, the government creates a smokescreen, smoke and mirrors, photo ops.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had draft regulations in place. We had negotiated these and had achieved targets with the large final emitters before we were defeated. The so-called clean air act was met with condemnation from every quarter in the country.</div>

First, he brings back rebates for renovations that make homes energy efficient but he leaves out the part of the program that makes it affordable for low income Canadians, particularly our seniors, when it is the wish of all parliamentarians that seniors can reside in their homes independently and with dignity as they grow old in, usually, their older homes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low income Canadians spend 13% of their income on energy, compared with 4% paid by average households. Low income Canadians are being left out in the cold.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, a year later the minister also brings back funding for wind power and renewable energy, having first spuriously stated that it was wasteful spending and that it was not achieving its targets. This is cloak and dagger, behind the scenes, media manipulation where the minister disgracefully resurrects and re-gifts the programs which he had described only weeks earlier as wasteful spending.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why were these programs ever cut? If Canadians believe the government when it described the programs as wasteful spending, then why were these programs brought back exactly as is?</div>
    </p><a name="Para398700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the government has come back to the table on clean energy technology but the year of uncertainty has had a damaging effect on young Canadian companies. Investors know which party did not make the environment one of its top five priorities and they are not flocking back to put their money in solid Canadian technologies that they were investing in 18 months ago which need a real federal commitment to turn the corner and take off worldwide. Our green industries are being left out in the cold.</div>

In that letter he said that Kyoto was a “dangerous and destructive scheme”. He went on to say “we will do everything we can to stop Kyoto”, including, apparently, a taxpayer subsidized and disgraceful PR blitz against a proven environmental leader, the Leader of the Opposition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think Canadians buy that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> or the government has turned over a new leaf. Just days before Christmas, in the foyer of this building, he was still talking about so-called greenhouse gases. Before that, he was saying that we must redirect federal spending aimed at fulfilling the terms of the increasingly irrelevant Kyoto protocol. He clearly believed that the Liberal government was acting to fight climate change because he was so fiercely opposed to it.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, we signed Kyoto. In 2000, we spent $625 million on climate change research and emissions reductions. In 2003, we announced $2 billion in new climate change funding. In February 2005, Elizabeth May, the leader of the Green Party of Canada, called that budget the greenest budget in Canadian history. The Clean Air Renewable Energy Coalition said that the budget was so green that it should have been announced on St. Patrick's Day. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to this, of course, we see what has happened after a year under the new government. It cut $395 million from the EnerGuide program to retrofit houses. It cut $500 million from the EnerGuide for the low income households program. It cut $1 billion from our partnership fund for climate change projects with provinces and our cities that desperately need help from the federal government. It cut $593 million from our wind power production incentive and our renewable power production incentive. It cut $585 million from environmental programs at Natural Resources Canada. It cut $120 million from our one tonne challenge which we now know has been judged to be a very effective program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are just some of the cuts, total cuts of $5.6 billion, effected by the government for the successful programs that were in place under our administration.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canadians, what do we spend an awful lot of time doing? Talking about the weather. We get in an elevator with complete strangers and we say, “Is it hot enough for you?”, or, “Is it cold enough for you?”, or, “How about that snowstorm?”, or, “What is tomorrow's forecast?” We are used to that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year especially we have been talking a lot about the weather because it has been an extraordinarily mild winter. It is not the first time we have had a mild winter, but this one has been especially so. Although I remember last year during the election, one particular Friday when I was campaigning in my riding of Halifax West in Nova Scotia, I was wearing a light fall jacket because it was 13° Celsius. I had never heard of a day in January in Halifax when it was 13° Celsius. My hon. colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78938,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78938&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">West Nova</A> would say that down in his part of the province, which is a little more south and people sometimes play golf there on New Year's Day, it is a bit milder, but I do not think it would be very often 13° on a day in January. That is extraordinary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing more and more reasons to be concerned about our weather and about our climate. We know from scientists who measure these things that the 10 hottest years on record since human beings started keeping records of the temperature back in the middle of the 19th century have all been since 1990. We should be concerned about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a friend who is a meteorologist and who is very knowledgeable and interested in issues of weather and also science generally. He was telling me last fall, and I believe he was talking about last winter, that there was a point at which the gulf stream was actually interrupted briefly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow the new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will be released. I saw reports earlier this week about that report and about things being said by the scientists at their meeting, which I believe is in Paris. They are concerned about whether the gulf stream will slow down. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, whether it is interrupted, slows down or whatever, any change in the gulf stream could have a dramatic effect on weather patterns in the northern hemisphere, particularly around the Atlantic. If we consider how much northern Europe depends on the gulf stream for its relatively warm climate, it could be devastated by that kind of change. It is not just Europe that could be affected. People who live in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, or any of the Atlantic provinces have to be concerned because the gulf stream has a very important impact on them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned a year or so ago, when I had the pleasure as minister of fisheries of visiting Sable Island, that the gulf stream is only about 50 miles, which I suppose is about 80 kilometres, from Sable Island. I could see how close it is to my province and my region and what an impact it obviously has. To see the gulf stream being interrupted is very worrisome.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para398735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are very concerned about the changes that are taking place in our north. For example, roads and buildings constructed on permafrost are all at risk today. Even the migration routes of the caribou now appear to be in danger. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The caribou encounter problems because there is not enough ice. That represents a danger for them and forces them to change their route. Based on the way ice is formed in the north we know that polar bears are also at risk. All of this is very unsettling. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know already that the report we are going to see tomorrow from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is going to be bleak and sobering news. It causes us great concern, and it should cause us great concern. But it is not the first time we have heard this. We have seen in recent years an increase in what scientists and meteorologists call extreme weather events, things like hurricanes, cyclones and large winter storms. In fact, within 12 months we have had in my province both hurricane Juan and what we called white Juan, a huge winter storm which dumped a metre of snow in 24 hours. I certainly had never seen that in my lifetime. It was pretty dramatic. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurricane Juan was devastating for a big swath of Nova Scotia. The impact was dramatic. I remember a few days afterward the defence minister at that time and I had the opportunity to fly over Halifax in a helicopter and to see the impact on Point Pleasant Park in Halifax, a beautiful park full of wonderful trees, many of which were downed like matchsticks. It was a dramatic and very troubling sight to see from the air.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also seeing rising sea levels. They are already impacting some countries. There are island countries in the Pacific that have already been inundated where people have had to be evacuated. They are the first examples of ecological refugees that we have seen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard a scientist just last week talk about climate change and global warming. He explained that if one has a glass of water, as the temperature in the room rises, the water actually expands and fills up more of the glass. He was pointing out the concern we should have about our ocean levels. The rise in sea levels is not just because of glaciers and ice caps melting, which we should be very concerned about as well, but if there is a one degree increase in water temperature worldwide, it means that the water is going to expand and sea levels will rise for that reason alone. We also have to be concerned about the effect of the ice caps, both north and south, as a radiator for our climate, as a way of cooling off our climate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging that a lot of Canadians, a lot of people in the U.S. and hopefully elsewhere have seen the movie that Al Gore produced and starred in, <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i>. It certainly had an impact on me when I saw it last year. It was one of the reasons that my wife and I decided to buy a hybrid vehicle. The fact is it has been a benefit. With a hybrid vehicle the maintenance costs actually go down. Over a five year period it has been shown that hybrid vehicles have much lower maintenance costs, and obviously, one is going to pay less for gas. We are certainly paying less for gas even though there was a little more initial capital cost and that is a concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a report in the <i>Globe and Mail</i> today that refers to a survey by Maritz Research in Canada. It said that when buying a vehicle the consideration of whether it is environmentally friendly ranked 23rd among 26 reasons for buying a vehicle. The top three considerations were value for money, fuel economy and reliability. It is good that fuel economy is one of those considerations because clearly, with a hybrid vehicle one will benefit from the fuel economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am making is that we all have to get engaged in this issue. We all have to find ways to do better. I certainly want to keep doing better. We have done something but we have to do more things it seems to me in my home and in all homes across the country to help combat climate change. The government has to do more in terms of the variety of measures that it can take to improve the situation and to combat climate change. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is as we know a very narrow range of conditions in which human life can exist. We see that when it gets cold. When we go outside on a day when it is -15° or -20° we realize that we cannot stay out very long without being warmly dressed. It is amazing how quickly it goes from a temperature that is reasonable, livable and comfortable to one where it is not comfortable. It is a pretty small range. Once we go outside that range, things become unlivable if we go to extremely low temperatures, unless we are in the Antarctic and we are really prepared for it, but in reality, for most people we cannot survive in those extreme low temperatures or in extreme hot temperatures if they are above 140° or 150° for example.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that under his party's watch, Canada was 35% above its Kyoto targets. The fact is that under his party's watch, Canada slid to 28th out of 29 OECD countries in air quality rankings. The fact is even according to the deputy leader of his party, the Liberals did not get things done on the environment. Clearly in 13 years they did not get it done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of being 28th out of 29 OECD countries, to use a hockey analogy which I like to use, I think about an NHL team near the bottom of the standings. This NHL team has a dismal power play and is ranked, let us say, 29th out of 30 teams, second from the bottom. So bad is this team that the coach resigns and the general manager identifies the power play as the number one problem. The Liberals are like that hockey team. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is puzzling is that when the Liberals had the chance to get a fresh start, they chose to promote the power play coach, the environment minister, who had been responsible for the astonishingly low performance in the first place. That is who they promoted as head coach, the person who had led them to second last place in the league. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the Liberal Party's dismal record, do you not agree that it is refreshing to see some actual action on environmental issues? Would you not agree that this motion and what is happening in the environment committee are real efforts to change the channel on Canadians and deal with your political--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may not agree with his comments, and I do not, but if he looked at the record he would see something quite different from what he suggested. In fact, there was a whole series of measures that the Liberal government brought in, which the Conservative government over the past year cancelled. It has brought in a few weak facsimiles of some of those programs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the EnerGuide program was cancelled by the Conservatives. They also cancelled the one tonne challenge program. On the Thursday before Easter last year the Conservatives cancelled 17 different initiatives all at the same time. They are going to claim that the programs were all terrible and not one of them was any good. That is a little rich. It is like the suggestion that none of these measures that were in place had any impact whatsoever or ever could have any impact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Conservatives want to say the programs were not perfect and point out concerns or problems, that is fine, but it is not credible to suggest that there was nothing there at all.

It was a very important program to assist those households that could not themselves afford the costs of upgrading their homes, households that needed assistance with the cost of upgrading their homes to make them more energy efficient, to lower the heating costs, and to lower the amount of greenhouse gases produced. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we heat our homes, not enough of us use solar heat, and I suppose more of us should. I am fortunate that my house has it. The house I bought happened to have it for heating water. However, I think we have to do more. Many of us heat our homes with oil, wood, electricity or natural gas. All of those of course produce greenhouse gases. We ought to look for ways to reduce them. That was the idea of both the EnerGuide for low income households program and the EnerGuide program, both of which I think were important programs.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the environment today, as it is an issue that is extremely important to my constituents in Simcoe--Grey and of course to all Canadians and the international community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need for action on climate change has strengthened with each passing year. It is too bad that the former Liberal government turned its back on the subject and on Canadians. After 13 years of inaction, $40 million talkfests, champagne parties and promises, we are 10 years behind because the Liberals chose to do nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the science that underpins the climate change issue, we see that there are several things we can agree on. Greenhouse gases are increasing in Canada's atmosphere. In fact, under the previous Liberal government, they rose a staggering 35% over a very short period of time. We also know that the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will continue to increase unless we do something to reduce our emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ask the question of why this is: could we have been in a different position? Here is what the former environment commissioner had to say about the inept Liberal government's record on the environment in her 2006 audit report:</div>

However, it does not yet have an effective government-wide system to track expenditures, performance, and results on its climate change programs.

To date, the approach has lacked foresight and direction and has created confusion and uncertainty for those trying to deal with it. Many of the weaknesses identified in our audits are of the government's own making. It has not been effective in leading and deciding on many of the key areas under its control. Change is needed.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former commissioner was right when she said change was needed. Canadians were fed up with the Liberal scandals and broken promises, so what did Canadians do? They kicked the Liberals out of office and ushered in a new Conservative government to clean up the mess the Liberals left behind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only did we clean up years of corruption, scandal, mismanagement and waste, we are now cleaning up the undeniable environmental disaster the Liberals left behind for Canadians. Today, we have record smog days in Toronto, and Canada ranks near the bottom of industrialized countries when it comes to air quality. We have to ask ourselves: what were the Liberals doing for 13 years? Why did they not get it done?</div>
    </p><a name="Para398775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new Conservative government has taken action on the environment. As has already been mentioned, in the last two weeks alone, we have invested $230 million in the research, development and demonstration of clean energy technologies. Also, we announced more than $1.5 billion in funding for the ecoenergy renewable initiative to boost Canada's renewable energy supplies, and we unveiled our plan to invest approximately $300 million over four years to promote smarter energy use and reduce the amount of harmful emissions that affect the health of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last fall, we introduced Canada's first clean air act. By introducing the clean air act, we have put forward a number of tools that will help Canada address its air quality by reducing greenhouse gas and smog emissions simultaneously. This is the first time that Canada has regulated reductions in both air pollution and greenhouse gases. Internationally, we are the first country to regulate all sectors in an integrated and coherent manner.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also introduced a clean air regulatory agenda that will regulate both indoor and outdoor air pollutants as well as greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are providing stronger energy efficiency standards on consumer and commercial products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have already established new emission standards for on-road motorcycles.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are setting the stage for mandatory fuel consumption standards on the vehicles Canadians buy.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250">(1250)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para398781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Liberals do not want to see any progress on the environment. They are pulling every trick in the book to stall the special legislative committee looking at the clean air act. They want to drag out hearings for months, which is interesting in that it is coming from the former Liberal government that, when in power, said it had a plan to address the environment. But we never saw it. Consequently, what has Liberal inaction meant to Canadians?</div>
    </p><a name="Para398782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of temperature, the changes in Canada have generally been higher than the global average. This is particularly true in our northern regions. The “Arctic Climate Impact Assessment” was published not long ago and received wide media coverage and public attention, as it should. The report served to highlight the rapid changes occurring across the Arctic and concluded that the Arctic has been warming at about twice the rate of the rest of the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole suite of changes is evident across the Arctic, which has led many to consider the Arctic the canary in the coal mine, an early indicator of what may come to other regions of the world. In particular, the observed reductions in sea ice have been much commented on, since the implications of this trend, were it to continue, are very significant for Canada and for the globe.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Inuit, the reductions in sea ice put in jeopardy their traditional hunting and food sharing culture, as reduced sea ice causes the animals on which they depend to decline and become less accessible. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reduced sea ice, shipping through key routes such as the Northwest Passage is likely to increase. This could bring new opportunities, but it is also an additional environmental concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also seen impacts of the changing climate in other parts of Canada. In B.C., infestations of the mountain pine beetle are wreaking havoc on the forest industry. In recent years, prairie drought has cost the agricultural economy billions of dollars. On the west coast, we have seen several extreme storm events in recent months. In eastern Canada, we have experienced an unusually warm early winter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These events, while not individually traceable to climate change, are consistent with expectations of more extreme weather in the future. These impacts are a threat to our citizens and to our environment and have enormous economic impact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Canada's new government is extremely concerned. That is why we are taking concrete actions to deal with climate change and air pollution to improve the health of Canadians.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, everyone should be aware of the enormous opportunities for Canadians in this country. We are blessed with an enormous amount of natural resources. We have the second largest oil reserves of any country in the world. We have the largest amount of uranium. We produce an enormous amount of natural gas. We are one of the largest producers of hydroelectricity in the world. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these opportunities also come responsibilities. It is our responsibility as a government to ensure that we look after all of these resources. They are the backbone of the Canadian economy, which is very important to our quality of life. We also need to put the economy in balance with the environment while ensuring that we have our energy security. That is why, in one year, our first year in office, our government came out with very decisive, focused leadership that is going to deliver concrete results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in our term of office, we brought in new funding and new tax incentives to increase public transit ridership. We committed to increasing, for the first time in this country, to a 5% average for biofuels on fuels right across the country. It is good for the environment to ensure that we have this average. The biofuel industry is taking off. We will be there to support it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my first actions as <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78751,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78751&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Natural Resources </A> was to announce over half a billion dollars to clean up some of the nuclear legacy liabilities at Chalk River that have been there for decades, something on which the previous government refused to show leadership. It would not make the commitment on something that was urgent. It was one of our first actions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course our government took a very bold approach to bringing in Canada's clean air act. When we move past all the partisanship and actually read the act, we can see what it will deliver. It is the first time that any government in Canadian history has undertaken to regulate every single sector, the oil and gas sector, the automotive sector, the industrial sector, and to reduce not only greenhouses gases but also pollutants that create smog and have a direct impact on our health. The previous government refused to do this. The previous government never mentioned it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also heard my colleague from Nova Scotia, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78752,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78752&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Foreign Affairs</A>, make a very significant commitment to clean up the Sydney tar ponds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our government is taking concrete action that will deliver results.We want to engage all members of Parliament in this House to work with us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the new leader of the Liberal Party wants to pretend he is a great environmentalist. I noted yesterday that he and his entire caucus showed up in the House of Commons wearing green ribbons. Putting on green ribbons does not make us environmentalists. Putting on a green ribbon will not reduce greenhouse gases; it is going to take concrete action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous old Liberal government had 13 years in office. In their dying days in office, the Liberals actually started to suggest that they cared about the environment. By that time, not only did the old Liberal government lose the confidence of the House, it went on to lose the confidence of the Canadian people because of a lack of leadership and a lack of action. We have done more in one year than the old Liberal government even came close to.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are laughing and saying that I should not read from talking points. This is not a laughing matter, I would put respectfully to the Liberals across the way who are heckling. This is from the Commissioner of the Environment.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in the year 2000, but let us go on to her next report. She had many volumes. I met the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development numerous times. She is an individual who was very committed. She kept trying to make concrete, positive suggestions to the old Liberal government. She wrote another report on sustainable development in 2001. What did she have to say in that report? It reads as follows: </div>

    </p><a name="Para398806"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the words of the environment commissioner. I know that Liberal members do not like to hear this. They had a chance. Not only did they have a chance to show leadership, which they failed, but they had a lot of people telling them they were failing, getting an F, and not getting the job done. That was in 2001. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development wrote another report in 2002, desperate to get action and desperate to see some progress on this file. What was her first sentence? She stated that the federal government's “sustainable development deficit continues to grow”.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year after year, the environment commissioner was begging the old Liberal government for action. She was pleading with the Liberals. Their record was abysmal. Greenhouse gases in this country skyrocketed under their leadership.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They signed an international agreement, the Kyoto protocol, and then did nothing. The Liberals signed this protocol in 1997, 10 years ago, saying that in the next 15 years we would reduce greenhouse gases by 6%. That is what they said. They had to reduce greenhouse gases by roughly 1% a year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those greenhouse gas levels have skyrocketed year after year. They are 35% above the targets, so how does anyone with any credibility have the gall to come in sporting a green ribbon and thinking that suddenly they actually believe in the environment? The Liberals had 13 years to deliver results and all they want to engage in is partisan criticism, while our government is committed to delivering actual results. </div>

There is no question that we have an enormous amount of heavy lifting to do on the environment because of the mess we inherited.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if greenhouses gases had held the line, or if they had gone up by even 5% by the time we took over the government, we would have had a fighting chance, but they went up 35%. The Liberals did nothing. In less than one year, we have committed $2 billion on energy programs that will directly reduce greenhouse gases. That money will be invested in new technology to clean up conventional energy. We will be putting clean renewable energy on the grid, more wind energy and things like tidal energy, and we are encouraging Canadians across the country to do their share as well through energy efficiency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government did not get the job done. We are delivering with concrete results and real action.</div>

In our first year of office, let me reiterate, we have made a huge investment to increase public transit ridership. We have brought in mandatory renewable fuel content. We have brought in $2 billion of energy efficiency programs. We have brought in half a billion dollars to address nuclear liability cleanup. We have put money into parks and we have restored parks. We have put $30 million in British Columbia toward the rain forests. We put in $300 million over four years for a chemical management plan, which is something that has never been done.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues in the Liberal caucus and the Liberal Party have supported the Kyoto protocol since it was first negotiated in 1997. In a nutshell, the Kyoto protocol represents an international treaty that recognizes the scientific fact that increased emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases are causing global warming. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally occurring greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane and water vapour, are present in the atmosphere due to both natural processes and human activities. Greenhouse gases help to regulate our climate by trapping heat from the sun in the lower atmosphere, warmth that would otherwise escape back into space. This greenhouse gas effect keeps the average temperature on earth at approximately 15°C. However, over the past 200 years increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have accumulated as a result of human activity, mostly from burning fossil fuels, oil, coal and natural gas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, the growth of greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to increased coal consumption for electricity and steam generation, growth in fossil fuel production that is largely for export and increases in energy consumption arising from transportation needs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398866"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para398873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, 40% of Canadians rate the Conservative government's track record on the environment as poor. Why is that? It is because one of the first acts of the Conservative government was to dismantle all the environmental initiatives launched by the previous Liberal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, we had a comprehensive plan set in place but the Conservatives quickly cancelled project green. They cancelled the one tonne challenge that asked ordinary Canadians to do what they could to reduce their consumption of energy. They cancelled the popular EnerGuide program that gave homeowners grants to improve their energy efficiency. They cancelled funding for scientific research aimed at sustainable development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Conservatives love to repeat the monotonous mantra that the Liberals achieved nothing on the environment file in 13 years of government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the Conservatives that it was a Liberal government that joined with 168 other countries in the world to sign the Kyoto protocol in 1997. It was a Liberal government that introduced the Canadian Environmental Protection Act in 1999. It was also a Liberal government that ratified the Kyoto protocol in 2002.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last October, the former environment minister introduced the clean air act which quickly went over like a lead balloon with Canadians. In fact, less than two months after introducing this flimsy document, the environment minister was quickly sacked by the Conservatives. The so-called clean air act is completely unnecessary because the federal government already has all the legislative authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we collects information on greenhouse gases through three departments and three key pieces of legislation: Environment Canada under the authority of the 1999 Canadian Environmental Protection Act; StatsCanada under the authority of the Statistics Act; and the Alberta environment department under the climate change and emissions act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians know that the clean air act is nothing more than a political ploy. The fact is that the Liberal government had an eight year, $10 billion plan called project green. The Conservatives, in a zealous pursuit of their ideological rhetoric, cancelled everything.They have been in office now for more than one year and Canada still does not have a plan to reduce greenhouse gases or deal with climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By abandoning the Kyoto protocol, the Conservatives have severely damaged our international reputation by ignoring international law and our international commitments to 168 other countries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot afford to waste another year playing politics with the environment. Canadians will not tolerate this kind of behaviour and will remember the Conservatives dithering on the most important challenge facing the planet.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member talked about a time of minority government in the House, but from 1993 to 2004 the Liberals had an absolute majority in the House. They could have done anything it wanted. They were unstoppable, other than the fact that they did not know how to move ahead.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a number of plans on which we clearly want to move ahead. We recognize that we are a minority government but we have already been able to move ahead on these plans. We have invested $1.6 billion in the ecoenergy renewable initiative over 14 years which will open up all forms of clean, renewable energy, such as wind, small scale hydro, solar, biomass, geothermal and tidal. It has the effect of adding up to 4,000 megawatts of new, clean electricity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same result would be had if a million cars were taken off the road in terms of us implementing this plan. The ecoenergy technology initiative, $230 million over four years, a total investment in S and T and energy related areas to $1.5 billion, and $300 million over four years in the energy efficiency initiative dealing with increasing energy efficiency in homes and buildings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member opposite could help us by putting aside the rhetoric of who said what when. These plans are on the table now and we would like to move ahead on them. For some reason, which we do not understand, for the 11 years that the Liberals had an absolute majority they did nothing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398888"></a><p>

I thank my colleague from Don Valley East for her important remarks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add to this debate by speaking positively about the future. We have had many accusations back and forth, and that is understandable I suppose. This is, I think, the meta-issue of history, of a degradation of our climate and our planet. Never before have we been so exposed to danger for actually deteriorating human life and all life on earth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can recall those first Apollo pictures of the earth and the images they have created in our minds of a blue and green gem floating in, for all we know, an endless infinite universe of rock and fire. That gem is unique to our knowledge, and yet we are taking a risk with it because it is not actually a gem. It is actually only an eggshell; it is not solid. It is a tiny eggshell of blue and green over rock and fire. To think that we as a species would put at risk that extraordinary unique piece of magic floating through the universe is really an existential march of folly more than we have ever seen in society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased that whatever shortcomings or inadequacies the government or previous governments may have taken toward environmental degradation, that we are all coming together. This motion focuses us on the opportunity to state the absolute imperative of dealing with this in the most serious possible way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was interesting to hear a panel of people speaking about climate change on CBC Radio's <i>The Current</i> this morning after the 8:30 news. These people came from business, the environmental sector and from the scientific sector. Mr. Thomas d'Aquino, who is the CEO of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, not generally known as an eco-freak but rather known as someone who takes a very serious business-minded approach to matters, quoted Michael Porter, the Harvard competitive guru seen as the person who has the best grasp on why competitive economies are competitive around the world. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990 he was commissioned by the Mulroney government and produced a report on the competitive nature of Canada. His main recommendation was that the lack of competitiveness and productivity in the Canadian economy was because our environmental standards were too low and that northern European countries, where they had higher environmental standards, were the ones that had the most competitive economies. Companies working under that sort of regulatory and fiscal regime were more competitive and more creative. They invested more in research and development. They protected themselves, for instance, from consumer boycotts that are against environmental practices that are damaging in other countries. They created spinoff technology industries that they could sell to the rest of the world. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world focuses more and more on the dangers of climate change, those technologies are going to be immensely important. We in Canada should be investing in those companies, as Mr. d'Aquino was recommending, and in those technologies, so that we can lead and supply the world with what is going to become and is increasingly being seen as an absolute historical imperative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Nicholas Stern, in his report that was issued a few weeks ago, compared the vastness of the economic damage that will be done if we do not deal with climate change to being greater than that of both the first and second world war. That is the scale we are talking about. It is absolutely breathtaking and it is something that we altogether as parliamentarians must take on the responsibility of solving.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330">(1330)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para398904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need regulatory and fiscal powers to do that. There are two critically important principles in environmental science and in fact in the whole issue of sustainability. One is the precautionary principle. I hope all of us in this House now have gotten over whatever our hesitation may have been in the past, that we have gotten beyond the notion of questioning the science of climate change. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of risk assessment and dealing with risk, the precautionary principle would cause us to act positively. The consequences of severe climate change will be catastrophic even if the chance was fairly small, but in fact it is the overwhelming preponderance of scientific evidence in the world that sees this as a rapidly changing climate in historical terms, with the acceleration being caused by human activity. The precautionary principle says we must act. Now it is coming into all of our consciousness that we have not acted fast enough and we are going to have to do it together.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other principle is polluter pay as a basic bedrock principle of environmental stewardship. We simply cannot have companies or individuals any further using the atmosphere as a toxic waste dump, and we can set the example in this country. It simply cannot happen. We know, and any economist will tell us, that if we are going to have a sound working economy, we have to internalize any negative externalities that the activities of those companies or persons cause. We simply have to cost out the price of pollution. We can call it a carbon tax or costing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. We can call it internalizing negative externalities. We can call it whatever we want, but the point is, it is paying for the damage that is being done as we go. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonderful thing about that, and we have suggested in this motion a cap and trade system, is that we can actually let the market work in a way that is most efficient and effective by costing those greenhouse gas emissions. They can be capped at a reasonable point to start and then those caps can be dropped, so that people and industry have to successively reduce them over time as they develop the technology, as they rebuild their manufacturing plants, and as they add new processes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can use the market to cost it and then a trading system can allow companies that can easily reduce GHGs, because of their procedures or because of their technologies, to get credit for it and to sell that credit to other companies that can take longer times perhaps to replace their capital equipment. That is a reasonable way to do it, but it can actually start accelerating very quickly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also, and this is immensely important, use fiscal mechanisms to determine behaviour and incent proper behaviour. We can have tax shifting. We want to make it neutral but we can do it in a fair way. We can take away incentives that cause bad behaviour, polluting behaviour by taxing it, or removing the tax benefit and putting the tax benefits on the development of renewable energy technologies. We can use incentives and disincentives in a very effective way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, in North America and increasingly in China and India, we know that vehicle emissions are a major cause of pollution and greenhouse gases. California has just announced the highest levels of vehicle emission standards in the world. We can go to that level. If they can do it in California, we can do it here. There is a way that we can actually do that without crippling or damaging the automobile industry and of course that is an important part of the Canadian economy. By what is called niching, we can cause automobile manufacturers to make a certain proportion of models of their automobile production low or no emission vehicles, but they can spread the cost of developing that technology across their whole manufacturing units. And over time, of course, those percentages would have to increase.</div>

We have the technology today and the costs are manageable to go into carbon capture and sequestration on an industrial scale. This could be done immediately.

It applies to a $42 billion deficit that has to reverse over two, three, four years.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to speak today to the motion addressing climate change and the Kyoto protocol, particularly because I am a member of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and we have spent the last three months examining the question of oil sands development in Alberta. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We did a serious study of this, in the course of which we held 29 meetings and heard nearly 100 witnesses. As part of that committee's work I even had an opportunity to visit an oil sands development site, Fort McMurray. I was able to get a concrete idea of the scope of that development and its effects on the environment in that part of the country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now know clearly that accelerating the development of this resource will increase greenhouse gases exponentially, and this will take us even farther from meeting the objectives in the Kyoto protocol, which is binding on Canada as a result of its ratification on December 17, 2002.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, Johanne Gélinas, told us, on January 18, it is very doubtful whether the reduction we have committed to under the Kyoto protocol can be achieved, unless the oil sands issue is considered a high priority and tackled head on. She also said that whatever measures the federal government may put in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, if the question of the oil sands is not addressed, all these efforts will have no effect, because the increase will continue exponentially. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before proceeding, I would like to add a brief comment more directly related to Quebec. While the oil industry is said to contribute significantly to the economy of Alberta, its contribution to the economy of Quebec is less obvious. That industry alone is responsible for half of the increase in greenhouse gases since 1990. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rising exports are causing the dollar to go up, and this in turn causes problems for the manufacturing industry as a whole. The never-ending increases in the price of fuel cost our economy dearly. In other words, what happens is a transfer of wealth from the economy as a whole to the oil industry, and the best way to remedy that problem is to make the oil companies contribute, through the tax system.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before proceeding, I would like to remind this House of what this motion says: </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that the Liberal motion before us today is in many ways a duplicate of the Bloc Québécois motion, which called for an effective and equitable plan for complying with the Kyoto protocol, and was passed in the House of Commons on May 16, 2006. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is unfortunate that, in less than a year, two motions addressing the Kyoto protocol have been debated in this House. This is a rather clear sign that the current Conservative government refuses to recognize climate change and does not feel bound by Kyoto. These debates are necessary because the Conservative government does not get it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the break, I met several primary school students and the first questions they asked me were: Why doesn't the government like the Kyoto protocol?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does he not understand that this is about our future, and that the most important thing we have to do is protect the environment?</div>
    </p><a name="Para398943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens have also contacted me about this issue. It makes no sense to them that politicians are still debating the importance of environmental issues, because it is perfectly obvious to everyone that climate change is threatening our planet and that the environment is in trouble.</div>
    </p><a name="Para398944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perfectly clear to the Bloc, and that is why we made this issue a priority years ago. It is clear to us that humans are playing a major role in greenhouse gas emissions and that we are therefore very much to blame for climate change. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we recognize that we have to act immediately and that is why we are constantly pressuring the current government—as we did the former government—to take concrete action. Speeches are all well and good, but our fellow citizens are demanding action. Seventy-six per cent of Quebeckers think that the government should do whatever is necessary to meet the Kyoto targets. We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet the Kyoto targets. Period. The people know it and the Bloc Québécois knows it, but the current and former governments do not seem to be clued in.</div>

I wonder what her party did in 13 years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, since emission levels rose by 35% during that time. If her party really wants to take action on the environment instead of supporting endless motions, what is she willing to do?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is there is a significant change in the mix of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada particularly as it relates to the oil sands. The production of oil in the oil sands has increased dramatically, whereas in the United States it has been relatively flat and in the Middle East it has gone down. Relative to other countries, our performance on Kyoto targets relative to the targets of 6% below 1990 levels continues to grow. That is the fact, but does the member and her party believe that Kyoto is still a target worth pursuing with all of the energies that we have in the best interests of our children and grandchildren?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year Canadians are invited to take part in festivities that commemorate the legacy of black Canadians past and present during Black History Month. This is a time to celebrate their many contributions which have allowed Canada to become the multicultural and diverse nation it is today.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us all join together this month and celebrate Black History Month.</div>

Given the urgent need for action and the planetary challenge that climate change represents, I invite you to take part in a broad mobilization to make our environmental concerns known. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398996"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The action is simple: today, from 7:55 to 8 p.m., give the planet five minutes of respite by turning off our electrical gadgets and lights. Not only will we save electricity, but doing this will have a symbolic effect so that we can make the world's great decision-makers aware of the urgency of the situation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para398997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I invite all members of the public to take part in this, a big initiative that calls for a very small action. The way for us to preserve our planet is to stand together and make ourselves heard. After all, this is a planetary problem, and the environment knows no borders.</div>

    </p><a name="Para398999"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Canadians have long been at the forefront of Canada's successes as a nation at home and abroad. Ordinary hard-working Canadians, such as the railway porters, have played a major role in the struggle for equality and black rights. Through their unions black porters were at the forefront as community leaders fighting for employment equity and human rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399000"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hometown, Hamilton, has seen many important milestones for black Canadians over the years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399001"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John C. Holland was the first African Canadian to win an award for his humanitarian work, receiving the City of Hamilton's Citizen of the Year award in 1953.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's first vice-regal appointment of a person of black heritage was Hamilton's much respected Lincoln Alexander in 1985. Linc, as he is warmly known in Hamilton, was also the first black member of Parliament and Canadian cabinet minister. Black Canadians are musicians, athletes, civil rights champions, writers, bankers, politicians, workers and philanthropists.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399003"></a><p>

Maurice “Moe” Huard was the Assistant Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms since 1993. He passed away at the beginning of January after a very brief illness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us knew Moe because he sat at the end of this great House in that fine chair. He served with professionalism. Moe was a professional to the core, reflective of the 21 years he served with honour in our Canadian Forces as a medic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was a professional, Moe had a contagious joie de vivre about him and dispensed great humour to all who engaged him. Moe was a part of the professional cadre of men and women who serve our House and all of us so nobly in providing security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the Liberal Party and all members of the House, may I extend to his wife Maria and his colleagues our deepest condolences. Parliament lost a great friend in Moe Huard and in this we are all at a loss. We will miss him deeply.</div>

    </p><a name="Para399016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, he cannot even manage his own Liberal senators. His deputy leader and his environment critic have criticized him more than the Conservatives do.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is, what is Kyoto to the Liberal leader? Is it his dog or an international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions? He had 10 years to make Canada's environment a priority, yet greenhouse gas emissions went 35% beyond even his own targets.</div>

    </p><a name="Para399029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 10 days in a row there are all sorts of shows, sporting events, plays, traditional meals and a wide range of family activities. For many, the centrepiece of the carnival is Bonhomme Carnaval, the mascot of the event, whose identity is never revealed until the last day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North Bay Carnaval des Compagnons is a magnificent festival that celebrates francophone culture.

He could go down the hall and tell his senators to do what he says, but I bet he cannot get it done.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to reiterate what I asked the minister, which was about the fact that the CTF was in crisis. Certainly that has been proven.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member has raised a point of order. He has said the minister used words that were incorrect in her answer by suggesting that the hon. member had misled the House. Now he is putting another set of facts here, which could go on for some time. I respect the fact that he may be interested in doing that, but there are ways he can do it. He can arrange for a late show, for example, in respect to the question he asked today, and have a much more extended debate on the subject then. In terms of the facts, that is exactly what he should do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the statement the minister made that the hon. member misled the House, I point out to him that the Chair has never ruled, that I am aware of, that stating that a member has misled the House is out of order. “Deliberately”, yes, but members mislead the House for various reasons. Members may make a statement that is perfectly correct, but the person hearing it is perhaps not thinking straight, gets things mixed up, is misled, and therefore thinks the House has been misled because the person thinks everyone thinks like that member. Misleading the House has never been unparliamentary that I am aware of.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I respect the hon. member's objection, I do not believe he has a valid point of order in that the minister, and I listened very carefully, did not say that he deliberately misled the House, which of course would have invoked all kinds of censure from the Chair. I respect the hon. member's view, but in the circumstances I do not believe he has a valid point of order.</div>

    </p><a name="Para399273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion from the Liberal Party is divided into five broad statements. The first of these statements is that the world's climate is changing as a result of human activity. In my opinion, the government should immediately recognize this statement and accept this as a fact. In addition to accepting it, the government has a duty to disseminate this message by all available means and to publicly promote in our schools and universities the message that our planet is changing as a result of human activity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This government has the very important responsibility of alerting the public with the help of tools such as films, including, for example, the film by Al Gore, the former vice-president of the United States. It is readily available in all good video outlets. As the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79026,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79026&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</A> proposed in his remarks, panel discussions and other activities surrounding this film also constitute a very significant factor that has to be considered. Scientists and upper-atmosphere chemical analysis confirm to a large degree that our planet is changing as a result of human activity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second main statement in the Liberal motion declares that the most serious ecological threat of our time is climate change caused by greenhouse gases. I do not need to remind members of the observations that have been made recently in the north, showing melting glaciers and the threat of higher sea levels. Let us also consider the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, along with the risk of losing certain wildlife species. In Canada, the species most at risk is the polar bear. That could result in a very significant ecological imbalance in our north and that imbalance could have repercussions on Canada’s fishery. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third statement in the Liberal motion is that the government must reconfirm Canada’s commitment to honour the principles and targets of the Kyoto protocol. The Bloc Québécois is very clear on our approach. We want a territorial approach and that way, we know that Quebec can achieve its reduction objectives by targeting the biggest producers of greenhouse gases. Quebec does not need a reduction plan for its coal-fired generating stations. There are none in Quebec. Less than 3% of Quebec’s energy is produced with fossil fuels or nuclear power. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the latest government information, Quebec’s electricity is 97% hydro. In 2002, 60% of Canada’s electricity was hydro, thanks to the 97% share in Quebec. The second largest power source was coal. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The picture is different in the United States. Fifty per cent of its production is coal-generated, followed by nuclear at 20%, natural gas at 18%, and barely 7% for hydro. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399279"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mexico too is heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Taking together oil, which generates 40% of Mexico’s electricity, natural gas at 33%, and coal at 8%, we find that 81% of Mexico’s electrical production comes from fossil fuels, in comparison with only 12% from hydro. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515">(1515)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para399280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These three countries therefore have different problems. The best way to reduce greenhouse gases differs, therefore, from one to the next. The same is true of Canada itself, since the provinces do not emit greenhouse gases in the same way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We feel, therefore, that the sectoral instead of territorial solution proposed here, which the government wants to adopt, is inappropriate and unfair. It overlooks the polluter pays principle. Quebeckers have made wise choices. They did so in the past by investing massively in hydroelectricity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The table illustrating the increase in greenhouse gases shows that Quebec saw its emissions rise by 6.6% between 1990 and 2003. This increase was due largely to the transportation sector. The increase here was 19.9% between 1990 and 2003. At the same time, industry cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 6.8%. During this same period, the residential, commercial and industrial sectors also saw their emissions rise by 19%. These figures show very clearly what area Quebec should target in particular: transportation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Quebec has included the transportation sector in the plan of action it has given us for 2006-2012. It focuses on achieving reductions in the transportation sector by promoting mass transit. The $328 million that the government is asking the federal government for is specifically for mass transit, commuter trains, improved subways and more priority traffic lanes. Urban transit and mass transit are very important in the Government of Quebec's plan of action.<b></b></div>
    </p><a name="Para399284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is also addressing the automobile sector. It wants fleets of ecological vehicles for its staff, its government and its many ministries. It will move swiftly in this area over the next six years by investing in hybrid cars with low fuel consumption. The $328 million will be well used. The objectives are clearly focused and well outlined.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Quebec has a well-structured plan and its objectives are well known. They can be found in a document prepared in 2006 entitled, “Quebec Action Plan for Climate Change”. In order to reduce greenhouse gases it is very important to reduce fuel consumption in Quebec. The best way to do so is to promote mass transit.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now talk about the credible plan that the government is asked to create. The former government had a green plan that had disastrous results, as we know, since it was based on voluntary programs. Environmental groups regularly propose credible plans to solve the problem of greenhouse gases.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government itself, in its draft clean air plan, had set targets out to 2050 in achieving some sort of long term targets, so there seems to be a contradiction.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see the figures for the current government's action plan. The figures are clearly set out in Quebec's plan.

    </p><a name="Para399295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec's plan, which is very well laid out, as I mentioned, also sets targets. The federal government's green plan has no targets. We are waiting for these targets, which will tell us where the government plans to direct its efforts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blame is laid on Canada or the policies of the previous Liberal government and people talk about a 30% to 35% increase, but we also need to look at the different provinces and where this 30% increase is coming from.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I explained earlier that the target in Quebec is 6% and that we can reach it or reduce emissions to 1990 levels and by a further 6%, which was the Kyoto target. But I think that the other provinces need to apologize and say where they are going to target their efforts.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this most important issue, there are solutions the government can adopt based on existing technologies, and I will give two of them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the most effective way of reducing the burning of fossil fuels and the production of greenhouse gases is how we build our homes and buildings. We can use existing technologies in fact to reduce, by up to 70%, the utilization of fossil fuels and how we heat buildings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing we can do, as an example, is have vehicular emission standards. We could remove vehicles that were built pre-1986, which produce 47 times the emissions of those built after 1996.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my hon. colleague not think that the government has an obligation and a responsibility in the House to articulate very specific solutions to reduce the burning of fossil fuels and the production of greenhouse gas emissions and that those are two solutions that would work?</div>

    </p><a name="Para399306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise today proudly representing my constituents in Thornhill who wish to make their voices heard loudly on this compelling issue of our time. The residents of Thornhill want a sustainable environment, one where they can breathe clean air, where their children will have a healthy long life and ensure that their children's children have a healthy planet they can call home.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399307"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many of my constituents, I am deeply concerned that our environment is deteriorating at a rapid rate before our very eyes under the current minority Conservative government. By not charting a course that will put Canada in the lead, the Conservatives are abandoning our environment, the health and welfare of Canadians, the need to combat climate change and map out a strategy for the transition to clean energy, putting our future well-being and prosperity in jeopardy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is worldwide recognition, backed up with concrete scientific evidence and wisdom, that the climate is changing at a rapid rate as a result of human causes that require man made solutions. This is a global, borderless problem. The IPCC report, which is due to be released tomorrow in Paris, states “the warming of the climate is unequivocal”. A solution will require the efforts of all citizens of the globe and all countries to do their parts. This can only be done with strong leadership and multilateral action. Canada has an absolute obligation to future generations and to all citizens of the planet to make the fight against global warming a top priority.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399309"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are already feeling the effects of climate change as extreme weather has become the phrase of the 21st century. As each summer gets hotter, we see the number of severe storms and floods increase.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global warming is a real and serious threat to our planet, which cannot be ignored. The Conservative government's role is to work on behalf of Canadians. It cannot afford to abandon Canada's commitment to the Kyoto protocol. What I do not understand is, with this knowledge, why does the Conservative government have its head stuck squarely in the sand, which has cost Canadians one full year of progress on this most pressing issue of our time?</div>
    </p><a name="Para399311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under programs set in place by the former Liberal government, we already had a made in Canada approach and a plan to ensure that future generations would enjoy clean air, water, land and energy. Project green, the climate fund, the partnership fund and the EnerGuide program were all made in Canada. We had a progressive, collaborative and multilateral approach to achieve our goals and worked hard toward meeting our commitments to the Kyoto protocol.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Liberal government signed on to Kyoto as a partner in a global commitment to take action on global warming and the environment. How can Canadians trust the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> to take charge of the environment when the very same Prime Minister has said that the science of climate change is “tentative and contradictory”. He ridiculed the Kyoto accord as nothing more than a “socialist scheme” and “environmental fraud”. It is comments like these that make the House, and in fact all Canadians, seriously question the credibility of any plan or hastily put together announcement put forward by the government on the environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that the government gets the environmental policy out of reverse, put us back in first gear and reconfirm Canada's commitment to Kyoto. The clean air act has done nothing except undermine Canada's long-standing commitment to protecting our environment. The act allows for greenhouse gas emissions to rise until 2025, delaying action for decades, decades in which a firm commitment and action on environmental protection is critical to our planet and future generations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only has the Conservative government called into question Canada's commitment to the environment on the world stage and caused international embarrassment with its isolationist approach, it has also cut important federal partnerships with the provinces and territories, increasingly narrowing our capacity to lead and diminishing our national potential. Last year the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> refused to honour a $538 million agreement between the governments of Canada and Ontario to shut down coal-fired electricity production plants. Further, the minority government refused to honour commitments in the partnership fund to fund climate change programs undertaken by provinces and municipalities, for example, resulting in a $328 million loss to the province of Quebec alone for its Kyoto plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provinces want to effect change in the environment and so do Canadians. Why is the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> ignoring these clarion calls and sending successful programs to the cutting room floor? The proof is loud and clear in the Conservative's swift actions to arbitrarily gut 92% of the program funding for climate change programs based strictly on ideological reasons and not in what is in the best interests of Canadians.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives cancelled and shut down successful climate change programs in Canada like the one tonne challenge, EnerGuide, the wind power production incentive and the renewable power production incentive and then, a year later, they turn around and reintroduce many of the same programs, watered down and wrapped with a big blue ribbon and try to pass them off as their own.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know first-hand that the residents of Thornhill do not need to be woken up by polls to the importance and urgent need to take steps proactively to protect the environment. I have met with and have received letters and e-mails from Thornhill residents of all ages, backgrounds and professions. The message is consistently clear. They are calling for a federal government that will be responsible on climate change and the environment and not sit on the sidelines. Canada needs to be at the table internationally. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians also want to know what they can do. The way they see it is that the more we can do now, the more their children and grandchildren will benefit down the road.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents want a federal government that will take steps toward protecting their health, their safety and their infrastructure, the fate of all which rests squarely on a sustainable environment. Thornhill residents value deeply our quality of life like all Canadians. They want a more energy efficient and sustainable economy that will provide and ensure a better quality of life for themselves and for generations to come.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous government, under the leadership of the Liberals, did set in place a multifaceted foundation, a plan with a mission: to combat the damage done and prevent further damage from occurring through education, conservation and refocusing our need for energy through the development of renewable and clean energy sources and innovative technology. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one tonne challenge provided funding to grassroots organizations in their efforts to educate and engage Canadians to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as to launch a national educational program and campaign to make Canadians more aware of our habits, our energy use and encourage, by virtue of that, our conservation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, the previous Liberal government committed $4 billion in the 2005 budget for its climate change plan, which included expanding the one tonne challenge as well. Programs, like the EnerGuide for houses retrofit and the EnerGuide for low income households, were exactly the positive, cost effective, made in Canada energy efficiency programs the Conservatives themselves endorsed in the last campaign.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hearing of the cancellation of these programs, the York Regional Municipality, among others, immediately passed a motion outlining the detrimental and far-reaching effect this decision would have in our community and our country. It requested the federal government to reconsider its faulty decision. For low income households that were struggling with the 60% rise in home energy costs between 1992 and 2005, this program achieved two important goals: conservation and real savings for Canadians who needed it most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These programs were oversubscribed. The Liberals set in place a program that was well received. It was engaging Canadians who wanted to contribute and who wanted to be part of the solution of preserving our natural environment, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and offered them the great opportunity to save their hard-earned money by reducing their energy bills at the same time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no logic in systematically dismantling programs and then resurrecting them a year later when the government realizes the horse has left the barn and it needs to quickly show some action. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of climate change, as I have said before, is a borderless issue and one where strong leadership and a will for collective responsibility is a prerequisite for making progress on climate change. The Conservative government, with its ill- conceived clean air act, is abrogating its responsibility, just as it has demonstrated with its short-sighted cuts to other areas such as literacy and women's programs. It illustrates definitively a complete disconnect between Conservative members and the needs of Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must fully honour our commitment to Kyoto. The Liberals have laid the groundwork and now we must move forward decisively. We must rejoin the battle on climate change, not retract. We must return to Kyoto. Reducing greenhouse emissions and cleaning up our global environment with our international partners together is critical to the future of our planet and to all of us. Instead of playing politics and focusing attacks on the opposition, the government should be attacking the issue head on. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no silver bullet and no single policy or program that will immediately solve the challenge we face in protecting our environment. We need to take action now, together. We must be fully committed partners. We must take action on all fronts in developing energy efficiency, encouraging and supporting innovation and renewable energy sources so that we and future generations can enjoy clean air, clean water and clean land.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are global citizens and we must not turn our backs on our collective responsibility. Canada needs to recommit to fully honouring the principles and targets of the Kyoto protocol now in their entirety. The government must create and publish a credible plan to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions to meet Canada's Kyoto commitment.</div>

    </p><a name="Para399331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear time and time again that Ontario is shutting down its coal-fired plants. Ultimately, that was a promise made and another promise broken by the provincial Liberal government. It made that bed and it should sleep in it. I would like to ask the member a question about the silliness of such a suggestion because, obviously, that would require the Ontario government to simply purchase more power to replace the lost power from coal-fired plants in Michigan that produce even more pollution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology exists and has existed for quite a while for clean coal which would reduce the pollutants by 90% but the federal Liberal government did not get the job done. Whatever will get votes is what the provincial Liberal government does.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ontario, on the hottest days when power usage is at its peak, the government sends out a brownout warning and factories shut down their consumption and fire up diesel generators to produce their own cogeneration. On the hottest days of the summer in Ontario the answer is to not to use technology but to shut down the coal-fired plants, which means using thousands of generators that pollute the air even worse.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the member aware of any other technology, for example, tidal turbine? This government put a tidal turbine in the ocean--</div>

It sent the message of retraction, as I said before. Its naysayer attitude is undermining the capacity and the great drive of many as we speak now to develop this new technology. It is precisely because of the 13 years that the member's party was a government in waiting that it did not come up any clear alternatives to Kyoto rather than repackaging our ideas as its own.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one thing to build on improvement but it is another to do nothing at all and set the wrong tone. The government is sadly lacking in leadership and stewardship on this most important issue. It is very disingenuous for anyone from the Conservative government to talk about moving forward when all it has done is steadily move us backward and lost time.</div>

It said, “We are very positive. We are working with industry. Voluntary emissions will get the job done”. Now of course we are 30% higher.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time I thought that voluntary emissions was sort of like voluntary drinking and driving regulations with the Liberals saying not to worry, they will be able to buy sobriety credits so that for people who get caught once driving drunk, they can buy a sobriety credit. That seems to me to be the emissions trading scheme that they were floating. No wonder people are cynical. We have seen this tossed around like a political football for years and nobody has moved forward.</div>

We can actually get something done for the Canadian public.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As New Democrats, we are pushing to get this act in as soon as possible.

One of them is very much inspired by the intervention by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105835,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105835&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of the Environment</A> this morning who described Kyoto as a distraction from better ideas like Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A>. He said, as well, that Kyoto was a 50 year marathon.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I want to do three things. The first is to show why Kyoto is not a distraction; far from it. It is a crucial and essential component to any climate change plan in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I want to say that if we are going to have a 50 year marathon we need to get out of the starting blocks sooner rather than later and now is the time to do it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to describe what the elements of a real climate change plan would look like as opposed to the dribble of reannouncements in a weakened form of things that we introduced, as well as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A>, which, as the member from Timmins pointed out, is one of the worst pieces of legislation ever to hit this House, even though he decided to bring it back for reasons that are not entirely clear to us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If time permits, my third point will be to set out four criteria by which any climate change plan can be judged for its effectiveness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin with the necessary connection between Kyoto and a climate change plan in Canada. By definition, climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution. The Kyoto protocol is the only global forum in which the world can come together. Despite the imperfections of the protocol, it is the only global forum in which we can collectively advance this file.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that Canada's greenhouse gas emissions are only 2% but if we expect others, as the government does, such as India, China and the United States, to do their part, we need them to join in, not for us to leave Kyoto or to ignore Kyoto. We need to stay in and we need to stay in in good faith, as we did under the previous government, to do our part and to help others, particularly developing countries, do their part as well. A global problem demands a global solution and the only global structure for doing that is the Kyoto protocol.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyoto will help a Canadian climate change plan. First, it puts our targets and goals into an international framework. It gives us a sense of deadlines, a sense of urgency. If we do not set these targets and these deadlines we will take no action whatever.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if we in good faith attempt to meet our targets and timetables, we leverage our success and results to get other countries to do their part. It also sets in perspective what is our fair share of this problem. We cannot do this in isolation for a global problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the Kyoto protocol is the only one which gives us access to international mechanisms, like the clean development mechanism, to help other countries, particularly developing countries, meet their targets. It also has the effect of making life easier for Canadian industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We forget that when we agreed to international mechanisms, like the clean development mechanism, which allows us to work with other countries to get credits, it was at the request of the Canadian business community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that in one of today's newspapers Stavros Dimas, who is the environment commissioner for the European Union, said this of the clean development mechanism:</div>

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>This [mechanism] allows national governments to meet part of their Kyoto target by financing emission-reduction projects in the developing world. One tonne of carbon dioxide has the same effect whether it is emitted in Montreal, Mexico or Mumbai. Currently, 168 countries, covering over 90 per cent of the global population, can engage in this emerging carbon market. </small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we need to be in the Kyoto protocol and that is why there are these references in the motion today that we must do our part within that framework.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I asked was: What were the elements of a plan B, a serious plan, as opposed to dribs and drabs of announcements in a feeble form of projects that were cancelled a year ago, and of a bill which confuses climate change with air pollution?</div>
    </p><a name="Para399362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem we face in reducing greenhouse gases can be divided into more or less six equal components. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenhouse gases are produced by electrical generation, upstream oil and gas, heavy industry, residential and commercial, transportation, and agriculture and waste. Each one of those, if we are going to have a solution, takes a treatment and a set of projects, and a set of programs to deal with. They are interrelated, but they are also separate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399364"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we imagine undertaking this great enterprise?</div>
    </p><a name="Para399365"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that if climate change is the problem which every scientist in the world describes and has the economic consequences which Sir Nicholas Stern has described if we do not take action, we need to imagine ourselves mobilizing as we did during the second world war, mobilizing our economy, mobilizing our industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth noting that we did that in a five-year period. We went from zero military production to full military production in a five-year period. We knew how to do it as Canadians. That happens to be exactly the same time that remains between now and 2012, the first Kyoto implementation period. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we did it in World War II, it had the effect of totally transforming the Canadian economy, of creating a great industrial power. That is the way in which we need to view our tackling of the six great challenges, the six more or less equal slices that will require our solution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need, in effect, is to couple our meeting of Kyoto targets, a response to global warming as a new industrial and, I would add, agricultural strategy which will transform Canada's economy for the 21st century, based on energy saving, innovation, and new techniques for agriculture and natural resources.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a great project for Canada. It is never a mistake to undertake measures which save energy, and a great deal of what we are talking about, five-sixths of those slices, are directly about energy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I said that there were four criteria by which any plan which addressed these six issues would be judged. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, does it actually lead to measurable greenhouse gas reductions?</div>
    </p><a name="Para399372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, is it efficient economically? Does it help us to be competitive and innovative? Do we undertake measures which are the cheapest way of getting there, as the European commissioner suggested?</div>
    </p><a name="Para399373"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, which is of concern to all of us, is, is it politically saleable? Is it socially just? Are we being unfair to certain segments of the population? That political test, which is our business, is hugely important, but I think the Canadian people want us to show political will. I think the climate, in every way, has changed not only the natural climate but the political climate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, whatever measure we undertake, is it administratively feasible? Is it the simplest way of getting there? Which leads us to market-based regulation solutions like cap and trade which is probably, as we have learned in the fight against acid rain, the simplest, most elegant way of bringing around real reductions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that if industry is set a target, given a cap, it will find a way, without our telling it what it is. It will be incented to produce surpluses, to trade and sell to other industries. This is the success, to date, of the European model.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, with those words, I heartily endorse this motion and wait for questions.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing the impacts this winter, certainly in British Columbia in the Vancouver region.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the NDP forced a parliamentary committee to be put into place that would actually draft the legislation that Canadians are calling for. The Conservatives are of course trying to delay the legislation. The member has made a presentation that very effectively shows that perhaps the Liberal Party has learned something. Why are the Liberal Party members on the committee pushing for delay? Any work coming forward would come after the budget is presented. We do not know if Parliament will even be in session after the budget is presented.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the hon. member is quite simple. Will the member convince his colleagues and push himself for a timeline that will bring this legislation that is sorely needed by Canadians back to Parliament within four weeks as the NDP proposed and as the NDP has been pushing for? It is a very simple question. I hope the member will have a simple answer.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to focus on three areas where perhaps he can enlighten us. First, does he not see that the government is employing a tactic of essentially taking our old ideas, dressing them up, watering them down, and reintroducing them as its own? For example, there is the EnerGuide program that he was involved in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, does he not see that tax shifting is something that could be utilized by the government now with existing legislation in order to use economic and financial carrots and sticks to move both industry and non-industrial polluters into utilizing alternative sources of energy and reducing their production of fossil fuels?</div>
    </p><a name="Para399387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, does he not see that the impact of reducing our fossil fuels is intimately entwined with our security sector? By reducing our dependence on fossil fuels from the Middle East, we will be able to have a lessened dependence on this very volatile area and, therefore, disengage ourselves from an area that is fraught with all manner of security problems that is impacting upon Canadians today?</div>

That would be short. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the first point which is the rehashing of the previous Liberal government's programs which were dropped a year ago without evaluation and which were praised, by the way, by the late, lamented, Commissioner of the Environment, who said that they were effective. What we see now is a feeble simulacrum of those programs. They are a shadow of what was proposed. No one believes the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the second point of tax shifting, this must be part of the package. I would remind members of the House that we had a binding deal with the large final emitters which had a regulatory regime which was going to be in place by 2008. It was not voluntary. It would have yielded 45 megatonnes of carbon dioxide.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399391"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the fossil fuel point, where Canada unlike Europe is less dependent on foreign fossil fuels, the point is that we do as a world society need to make the shift from a diminishing resource, both in terms of natural gas and oil sooner rather than later, both because the cheap stuff is running out. The longer we use it the more we add to the burden on the atmosphere.</div>

Lawrence Cannon (Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, CPC)</A>: </b>&nbsp;<span class="nextIntervention"><a class="nav_link" href="#Int-1872528"><img src="/common/images/arrow2_right.gif" border="0" alt="next intervention"></a></span></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak today to this motion and to highlight the efforts of Canada's new government to undertake and deliver real environmental improvements through targeted infrastructure investments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague from Louis-Hébert. I will outline for Canadians and parliamentary colleagues how this government is delivering true environmental benefits across Canada through its targeted infrastructure spending efforts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also highlight how the government is working extensively with partners at the provincial and municipal level to focus our efforts on infrastructure priorities. These priorities include improvements to Canada's water supply and improvements to mass transit that are paying immediate dividends in improving the quality of life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, first, I think it is important to provide some background on Canada's infrastructure needs. The former government did not focus its resources on closing the infrastructure gap and that has resulted in significant challenges and pressures on this country's infrastructure.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para399396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, according to a study by Transport Canada, the economic cost of traffic congestion in Canada’s large urban centres is estimated at about $3.7 billion a year—close to $1.7 billion alone in the greater Toronto area. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This calculation does not include the financial impact on our health and our quality of life. Transportation is one of the largest sources of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in Canada, and this sector will play a major role in our efforts to improve air quality for all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we know, today’s economy requires major movements of goods and people, and this has impacts on the environment such as air and water pollution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These environmental impacts are transformed into real social and economic costs, and have an impact on Canadians’ health and quality of life.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para399400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth in trade and the continued dominance of just in time delivery models in the freight sector are also leading to significant increases in activity. Overall, freight movement is expected to increase by an incredible 60% between 1990 and 2020, with the largest growth in the aviation and trucking sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1995 to 2003, the freight moved by truck measured by tonne-kilometres increased by 63%. What do those numbers mean? They mean major air pollutants from transportation activities including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and volatile organic compounds have been increasing, leading to the formation of ever increasing amounts of smog. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399402"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation has been linked to 81% of Canada's total carbon monoxide emissions and to 60% of Canada's total nitrogen oxide emissions. Transportation is also the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. Total transportation related greenhouse gas emissions increased by 20% between 1990 and 2003. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399403"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately two-thirds of these transportation related greenhouse gas emissions occur in urban areas. Smog has been linked to numerous health related problems including cardiovascular ailments and respiratory diseases, notably increased asthma rates particularly among children.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para399404"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will try to give you an idea of what this represents in costs for Canadians. The Asthma Society of Canada estimates that more than $12 billion is spent annually on asthma care and treatment. Close to 12% of Canadian children suffer from asthma and every year nearly 150,000 Canadians go to emergency rooms because of an asthma attack.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399405"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is reducing traffic congestion the only solution to the problem? Unfortunately not, but reducing traffic congestion by promoting the use of mass transit will improve our living conditions in the long term. And if that means that fewer Canadian children will suffer from asthma, it will be even better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399406"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this end, we have presented measures to encourage the use of mass transit, while investing in the growth of mass transit programs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399407"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the government, we believe that we should provide the necessary means to ensure that Canadians use mass transit more. So we have, for example, dedicated $1.3 billion to mass transit in order to relieve congestion in our urban centres, reduce carbon dioxide emissions and improve the quality of life in our cities—$900 million in a trust for mass transit infrastructure, and $400 million in the form of agreements with the provinces and territories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was chairman of a transit corporation, I was able to see not only how important public transit is in a growing community but also how urgent it is to provide stable, foreseeable funding for it. When we talk about transportation, however, we must not think solely in terms of big money and big projects. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a lot of people, going to work or other places and then getting home is an everyday concern and accounts for a significant share of their personal budget. It has been calculated, for example, that in 2003 a Canadian household spent an average of $8,353 on transportation—less than on housing, but more than on food. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why the new government is giving public transit users a federal tax credit to cover the cost of their monthly transit pass.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This investing in helping Canadians with the cost of bus passes is a tangible effort to provide them relief from the burden of transit costs. Our priority is clear. We will help Canadians by helping the Canadian economy, and we will help the Canadian economy by investing in environmental improvements that enhance the lives of Canadians. This vicious circle has at its core the recognition that this is a joint effort and the federal government must partner with and support other levels of government.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para399412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As well, all of the infrastructure programs announced by the new government include environmental objectives, such as reducing greenhouse gases and improving water and air quality.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para399413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this government's first budget and economic update and forecast make clear, we are committed to long term investments in infrastructure. We are developing an infrastructure plan now.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para399414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In developing this plan, we consulted the provinces, territories and municipalities and a number of stakeholders about the most effective way to use our investments in infrastructure to promote a more competitive and productive economy, improve the quality of life in Canadian communities, make concrete improvements to the environment, ensure transparency and be accountable to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the near future, and with a view to the commitment we have made to restore the fiscal balance in Canada, we will be announcing how we intend to cooperate with our partners to ensure that Canadians benefit from the money allocated to infrastructure. We have already made concrete investments in improving the environment. Members will certainly understand if I offer them a few examples from my own province to illustrate the approach being taken across Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, we are investing up to $36.5 million in the St. Charles River water remediation project , near Quebec City. This initiative will involve the construction of retention ponds, among other things. We are investing up to $58.5 million to upgrade the Atwater water treatment plants in the Montreal region to standard. Throughout Quebec, from Lac-au-Sable to Magog to Chelsea and Rawdon, money is being invested to improve and remediate water quality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could also talk about the effort being made in respect of the gasoline tax, but I will leave it to my hon. colleagues to ask me questions about that.</div>

The first is that I am a little puzzled that in a debate which is essentially about climate change and the Kyoto protocol he would continue as it were to muddy the air and indeed the water by continuing to confuse climate change, air pollution and water pollution. They are all important questions but they do demand different solutions and they have totally different consequences. One is local by character and another is global. I wonder why he introduced that diversion on water treatment plants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on transit passes, where the advertisement claims that so many cars will be taken off the road and so many drivers will be induced to join the subway system, how does he deal with the inefficiency of that since the people who are most likely to claim transit passes for tax purposes are people who are currently using the system, not people who will be induced out of their cars? It is known in economics as literally the free rider problem. </div>

    </p><a name="Para399432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 19, 2006, the government introduced Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30, Canada's Clean Air Act</A>, which gives the government additional, greater powers to take the necessary action to protect the health of Canadians and our environment. The bill strengthens the government's ability to regulate air emissions, including greenhouses gases and other air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is currently before committee and I am eager to work with the opposition to move forward with this important piece of legislation. Immediately after introducing Canada's clean air act, the government published a Notice of intent to develop and implement regulations and other measures to reduce air emissions, which clearly establishes the government's plans to reduce the greenhouse gases and air pollutants caused by industry, transportation, and commercial and consumer products, as well as to adopt measures to improve indoor air quality. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notice of intent highlighted the importance of regulating industrial greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution given that industry produces about half of all emissions in Canada, both greenhouse gases and air pollution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will propose mandatory targets for the reduction of emissions in the short, medium and long term. We also plan to adopt an integrated approach to emission reductions so that measures adopted by industry to reduce one type of emission, such as air pollutants, will not lead to an increase in another type of emission.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to short-term targets for greenhouse gases, we are committed to targets that will produce results that are better than those proposed prior to 2005. For air pollutants, we plan on establishing fixed emission ceilings that will be at least as rigorous as those of governments that are leaders in environmental performance. This is an important measure that no previous federal government has implemented.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are attempting to find the best means for industry to achieve the targets. We wish to ensure that we are putting in place a regulatory system that will allow industry to choose the most cost-effective means of attaining emission targets while continuing to meet environmental and health objectives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also strongly believe that it is important to support the development of transformation technologies to reduce greenhouse gases—technologies we need to achieve the necessary reductions so we can prevent irreversible climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399439"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting climate change and reducing air pollution is not a short-term undertaking, and these problems will not be solved by short-term policies. Fighting climate change and air pollution requires long- term solutions. That is why we have asked the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy to advise us on specific emission reduction targets for the medium and long terms for Canadian industry so that we can reach our health and environmental goals while maintaining a stable economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of last year, officials from my department, Health Canada, Natural Resources Canada and Industry Canada travelled across the country consulting the provinces and territories, industry, aboriginal groups and environmental groups about how best to establish such regulations. We also received over 800 comments from the provinces, industry, environmental organizations and private citizens about the proposed regulatory regime. Nearly all of the comments supported the government's short term measures to fight climate change and air pollution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasize the fact that we are currently putting all of our efforts into developing that regulatory regime, which will establish realistic short term emissions targets for industry, as well as compliance mechanisms. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620">(1620)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para399442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this framework is to set short-term targets that will put us on the right track to achieve our long-term objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45% to 65% by the year 2050, which would improve air quality all across Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working relentlessly to complete this regulatory framework. For example, we reviewed the standards set by other governments regarding air pollutant emissions for all industrial sectors, in order to identify primary environmental standards in the world. We organized workshops with experts to discuss two main compliance options: an investment fund to support the development of technologies, and the exchange of emission rights. The discussions that took place at these workshops are helping us make an informed decision on the development of compliance mechanisms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures clearly illustrate the government's intention to regulate the industry's emissions. We have made a lot of progress and we will soon release our proposed regulatory framework. We will be the first federal government to make regulations to help the industry reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to continue cooperating with the provinces and territories, the industry and other groups as we develop the regulatory framework and the regulations themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not doing this in an unreasonable fashion. We have emission reduction targets that are logical and that will not jeopardize our country's economic growth. Indeed, experience shows that environmental protection can also generate economic benefits.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry is not the only source of emissions, but it is a major one. My colleagues will talk about recent announcements on programs and measures to reduce greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions in other areas, including the residential, commercial and transportation sectors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the government has already taken the first steps towards regulating greenhouse gases and air pollutants, and other measures will be taken in the coming weeks. Through Canada's Clean Air Act, we are also working to strengthen the government's ability to implement such regulations in a cost-effective fashion. We are looking forward to working with opposition members to further this critical issue.</div>

    </p><a name="Para399454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a case in point. Two years ago, we ran out of letters in the alphabet to name hurricanes in the Atlantic ocean. Last summer, there were no hurricanes to speak of, only a few tropical storms. But our focus was on the year when Katrina caused considerable ravages, not so much because of its force, but because the levies keeping the water out of New Orleans were very old and failed. Had these levies not failed, the damages in New Orleans would never have been that extensive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not enough to watch weather reports for one day or one week. We have to be careful not to make mistakes. Yesterday, the temperature was minus 20.

    </p><a name="Para399464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to speak to the motion today. Like many colleagues here, I think some votes are more memorable than others. The vote on Kyoto, which happened in December 2002, was a very memorable one for me. I was sitting in the corner to the right of me and a group of pages were lined up along the wall on both sides. They were not working because it was after hours. I asked them why they were here. They said, very clearly, that it was a very special day in Canada's history and they wanted to be here for that. I will never forget that vote and that is why I am very proud to speak to the motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue is probably one of the most critical right now, not only for Canada but for the world. It has become a priority in the world as a whole, and 168 countries signed the Kyoto protocol. Every MP has to take this very seriously. The first step when we try to find a solution is to admit there is a problem. I believe that is at the core of what is going on today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are way beyond the point of having to convince people that global warming is a problem, but it seems that we still are. We must believe in the science. We must believe in our experts who are giving us the proper information. Every report that has come out lately has unequivocally indicated that we are in a global warming phase and it is caused by human beings. However, it seems the governing party does not necessarily agree with it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as yesterday, when the Conservative members were coming out of their caucus, some of them were asked whether they believed in global warming. They indicated that they had to reserve judgment on that, which I cannot believe. We are not talking about three or four years ago when there was no information available. We are talking about yesterday. It is absolutely unacceptable. We have to believe that climate change exists if we are to believe there is a solution for it. How can Conservative MPs be the last people on earth to acknowledge that this exists?</div>
    </p><a name="Para399468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am not mistaken, I saw a program the other day about a poll in rural China. As we can imagine, not a lot of those people have access to a lot of information. However, the number one priority with peasants in rural China was the environment. Probably for obvious reasons, people in China are having huge issues with the environment and it is probably affecting their daily lives. However, if it is the number one priority for people in rural China, it seems to me that members of Parliament on that side of the House, who should be aware of what is going on in the world, should be aware that it is a major issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems I see is the difficulty for the troops to be on board when the leader is not, and that is quite obvious. We saw it yesterday in the House of Commons. We asked the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> 18 times what he thought about Kyoto and would he reinstate it because he had put it totally aside. We did not get a clear answer. With those questions were 18 quotes from the Prime Minister indicating his disdain for this international accord. The Prime Minister called it a socialist plot. He still speaks about the so-called global warming issue. It is absolutely ridiculous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite that, we seem to be seeing some movement on this. There seems to be a bit of a born again environmentalist movement happening right now. We wonder if it has anything to do with the latest polls, which show that it is the number one issue with Canadians. It bothers me, as a member of Parliament, that a government would react only when it sees a poll. Before that, the environment was probably number 86 or 87 on the list of the Conservatives. It was not even in the top 20. That is a very bothersome indication.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It certainly begs this question. If the Conservatives had a majority government right now, would they make this total about-change right now? I think the answer is no. It is pretty obvious that if the government had a four year mandate, it would not be reinstituting some of the policies brought in by the previous government. I think that is a scary thought for most Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> seemed to indicate that he prefers a made in Canada solution. It is quite obvious that his clean air act was an absolute bust. Even the <i>National Post</i> criticized it. The <i>National Post </i> never criticizes the Conservative government. That probably gives us the extent of how bad it actually was and how bad a policy it was.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all realize that greenhouse gas emissions have no borders. The made in Canada solution is not the solution, and that has been quite obvious. This is why 168 countries have signed on to this international agreement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak briefly to Canada's reputation in this whole thing. Our country has taken one heck of a shot in the last little while because of our abandonment of Kyoto. There are other issues as well. The government's policy on foreign affairs has also been quite radical and disturbing. However, where we probably have been affected the most is with regard to the environment. I believe it is the first time in the history of our country that we have failed to honour its obligations to an international treaty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have constituents who have come back from Europe, one from France. People are asking what is happening in Canada. They cannot believe what is going on here. Obviously we are not the only people who are aware that there is a problem. Other countries are very much concerned with Canada's attitude toward the environment and other issues as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has always been a leader on the world stage. We have never had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to attend events or to lead them. We have always been a world leader when it comes to this. The conference in Montreal last year, chaired by our new leader, is a classic example of optimism when it comes to the environment. Canada showed its leadership and on the world stage, it picked up our image. We were a leader, not a follower, when it came to Kyoto.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to build our credibility in terms of the damage that was done by the previous minister of the environment. The meetings in Bonn and Nairobi were outright disasters. At the same time, I really do not blame the previous minister of the environment. She was not given anything with which to work. She was told to go out there, stall and pretend that we liked Kyoto but not commit to anything. I feel badly for her. She was hung out to dry. We know that all the policy comes out of the PMO.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important to know that Canadians want us to respect our obligations to Kyoto. That is pretty obvious right now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all had our personal experiences with climate change. Last year I had the pleasure to visit Churchill. It was my first trip there. People here have indicated that the north is probably the first and the most obvious place to be hit by climate change. I did not think tundra melted, but in fact we saw 100 year old buildings that were tilting and falling apart because of that. The science is there, but also we are seeing it with our own eyes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also had the privilege of visiting the icebreaker, the CCGS <i>Amundsen</i>, which is an icebreaker that has been converted to an environmental laboratory. Dr. Barber from the University of Manitoba, along with his colleagues from the Université de Sherbrooke, talked to us about the north. He showed us the polar ice caps and the degree to which they have been reduced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are facts, and the experts in the world are confirming exactly what is going on out there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also talked about the disappearance of certain species of fish and the overabundance of other species. Global warming is changing things around to where it is denaturalizing nature as we used to know it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the opening of the Northwest Passage, some people may say that economically this is not a bad thing for Canada, but we have to find other ways to build our economy. We should not count on global warming to be melting our northern passages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all seen green Christmases. We are there almost every year now. It was 16 degrees in Montreal around Christmastime this year, which is totally abnormal. We have all seen the severe storms around the world, which is something that did not happen 10 or 15 years ago. These days it happens more frequently.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak quickly to two things that we in Manitoba should be supporting to achieve our objectives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east-west power grid is something our party supported wholeheartedly the last time. We have 5,000 megawatts of power right now. Ontario needs 25,000 megawatts. It is clean energy. We should support this wholeheartedly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second project is a $200 million investment in wind power in St. Leon, a small town. This is a huge investment which is very important for that town. Farmers also get an economic spinoff because they receive $4,400 per windmill on their property. It added 100 megawatts of power to the grid in Manitoba.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind power and developing new hydroelectic power is absolutely critical. There are ways to achieve Kyoto.</div>

    </p><a name="Para399490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have made very meaningful strides in the first year of government to improve the environment. That is opposed to the record of the former Liberal government, which saw an increase of 35% in emissions, showed no plan and had no regulations. Its plan was to send $5 billion to Russia for hot air credits and not change a thing environmentally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how the member opposite thinks that sending money to Russia for plants that have already been closed down and allowing Canadian plants to continue to pollute is helping the environment. This may be Liberal thinking, but I certainly cannot follow it. It does not make any sense at all to me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have actually made a difference. Look up the kinds of things that have happened. It is very clear that we made mandatory rules rather than voluntary rules. We have taken mercury out of the air. We have gone as far as banning items found in any Canadian household that are causing diseases. We have looked after the cancer issue or are well on our way to doing that. We have received support from the Canadian Medical Association. We have a thumbs up from environmental groups that actually care about what is happening in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing nothing for 13 years is what has given Canada its black eye internationally, as the member referred to it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only has the Conservative government failed to build on the success of the first phase of the Liberal program, but it has actively taken steps to dismantle and hamper progressive work that had begun under Liberal governments.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this because of some conversion on the road to Damascus? No, it was a conversion on the road to new lows in the polls for the Conservative Party, as my friend from Manitoba mentioned earlier. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government is being particularly misleading with seemingly effective yet empty rhetoric. On the one hand, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> harps on the point that “science has evolved several times in the last” several “decades”. On the other hand, he has re-established proven Liberal programs of the past to deal with his political problems of today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government's ideological view with respect to the environment has been on display for all to see for the past year. A new minister with new talking points who is re-implementing Liberal programs is not going to change the reality of the disaster that is the Conservative record on the environment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should take its cues from the citizens of this country who have been trailblazers in protecting the environment, people like Eliza Olson from my riding of Newton—North Delta, who is a tireless advocate for environmental issues and this year received Earth Day Canada's hometown hero award for her work as the president of the Burns Bog Conservation Society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to follow the lead of people like Eliza and not seek to actively undermine the work of everyday citizens who know better.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going to get into speaking to the science of climate change today as it is clear that climate change is a reality.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not the Liberal Party that filibustered the ratification of the Kyoto protocol. It was not the Liberal Party that dismantled the Government of Canada's climate action plan, going so far as to even shut down the climate change website.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called made in Canada plan, designed in the White House, assumes the environment stops at Canada's borders. The bizarre nature of this approach is almost as bad as believing that climate change is not happening in the first place. Even worse, the excuse that we should not act because others are not sets a terrible example.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a parent, the question I ask my children when they follow a bad example is, “If your friend jumped off a bridge, would you?” The Conservative government's answer to that, unfortunately, is yes.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Prime Minister</A> said, “I don't think we should consider signing on to a deal that makes us virtually the sole country in the world that is going to take any action” on climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government must create and publish a credible plan to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions to meet Canada's Kyoto commitments and it has not even tried to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it incredible that the government introduced an act that does not even have the word Kyoto in its preamble. It is an act that was such a massive failure upon tabling that it was panned by every credible environmental group in Canada, and it cost the former minister of environment her job.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it beyond belief that the NDP members even think they can pass a few amendments to a fundamentally flawed bill, in one month, no less, and then claim it will be a credible bill. What is credible is the plan of our Liberal leader, an individual with a tremendous record in advocating for and delivering results on the environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it amusing when the Conservatives try to attack the credibility of our leader on this issue. They mistakenly believe that Canadians will take the word of the party whose leader has demonstrated verbally and through his writings that he is a climate change denier.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more amusing are the attacks on the Liberal's project green, which the Conservatives are re-implementing piece by piece. If proof is demonstrated in action, then the Conservative government is acting in a way that endorses the plan of our Liberal leader.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government can take immediate action by once again following our Liberal leader's plan and regulating greenhouse gases under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, CEPA, which exists right now. The previous Liberal government listed all six greenhouse gas emissions as CEPA toxic. In refusing to do so, the Conservative government is demonstrating that it is a climate change denier.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important, also, to note that CEPA is jointly administered by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105835,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105835&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Minister of the Environment</A> and, more important, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Minister of Health</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know how the Conservatives said in the last election campaign, and even before that, that they were going to work on a made in Canada solution, but when we are dealing with a world problem, we have to get the whole world onside.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that instead of being Kyoto climate change deniers, the Conservatives are trying to paint themselves as Kyoto climate change disciples, but before they get there, they really are going to have to do penance. They have to stand up and explain to Canadians why they were confusing them and why they were using the issue of stopping Kyoto to raise money. I think that is very important in terms of getting back Canadians' confidence in the government. The Conservatives have hard work to do.</div>

The Conservatives are always saying the Liberals did nothing for 13 years. I think my colleague would agree with me that in the 13th year since 1993, with the 13th year belonging to the Conservative government, nothing has been done on climate change.

My friends on the other side keep talking about the 13 years of the Liberal record. I can tell members that I am very proud of the Liberal record.

Even before we signed the Kyoto agreement, we included, in budget 2000, $625 million for programs to accelerate climate change research and science and to reduce GHG emissions. In 2000, the Liberal government announced its five year action plan, with some $500 million toward concrete measures to reduce greenhouse gases by about 65 megatonnes each year.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were in the House when we heard the present Liberal leader's plan for the environment. That was voluntary emission standards. We were pushing, saying that we would never get to our targets if we simply allowed industry to self-regulate. That was the Liberal plan: self-regulation, no worries, everything would be fine. We did not meet any of the targets. They have been abysmal targets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of this dismal, bitter back and forth between the Liberals and Conservatives, what I want to say is that we have the question before us and an opportunity to take action in this House. That means more than simply putting on a green scarf. We have an all party committee and we can put in serious long term commitments that would be binding on the present government and the next government. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Liberal Party have been waving around a five year old letter from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> when he was leader of the Alliance Party. In this letter the Prime Minister made statements about Kyoto being a socialist plan to export Canadian wealth. Yesterday it was the only question the Liberals could ask in the House, but both the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the Liberals are wrong. Shipping Canadian dollars to other countries as the Liberals would have done to meet Kyoto is actually a capitalist plan. It is a plan to ensure that corporations can continue to expand their markets and find a way to deal with Kyoto at the lowest possible cost without any worry about the effect on the global environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around the world the successful countries that have dealt with climate change are social democratic countries which have values which the NDP also has. We have a plan to meet Kyoto and it is a plan based on social democratic principles which will build the Canadian economy, create jobs for average Canadians and save working families money on their energy bills.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key elements in the NDP plan is to change how we deal with energy. Canada needs an energy strategy. We need to ensure there is clean energy available not just for today but for our children and grandchildren, not a plan that allows a laissez-faire system to exist in this country to recklessly produce and sell off our fossil fuel resources. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would a strategy look like? The primary goal of an energy strategy must be to provide a secure energy supply sufficient to meet our needs. However, these needs primarily must be reduced. By reducing the needs it will enable the most rapid transition as possible to an energy regime based on conservation and the sustainable use of renewable energy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of an energy policy must definitely not be merely to produce as much energy as possible to meet a growing global demand with no regard for social and environmental impacts. Conservation and reduction of energy consumption must be one of the pillars of an energy strategy. Consuming less energy will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce air pollution and save ordinary Canadians money. Those are all laudable goals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second pillar of an energy strategy is to replace non-renewable energy sources with renewable ones. To do this our strategy would include actions to develop a thriving renewable energy industry in Canada, particularly wind, small hydro, solar and biomass. All of these are possible. All of these are important and all of these can happen in our system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need the creation of a crown corporation to assist communities, commercial and industrial interests at the community level, to help create these kinds of energy which are not transported mainly by pipes or transmission lines but really deal with how we use energy at home and in the community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to install 100,000 solar roofs to get our solar energy program going. We are falling behind the rest of the world. Our country has an abysmal record of supporting solar energy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to invest in cogeneration. One of the simplest and most fundamental ways that northern countries save energy is cogeneration; use the waste heat that is produced in industrial and electrical processes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need investment in sustainable public transport.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to provide funding to support the development of community groups and non-profit organizations to promote activities which have these values and put these values in front of Canadians which allow small businesses, individuals and community governments to make the best of the energy systems that are available to them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gradual transition to a sustainable renewable energy regime allowing maximum use of attrition and ensuring planned decreases in production can be accomplished and can save jobs, and can provide a reasonable transition to a new economy.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, any strategy for Canada would be incomplete if it did not address fossil fuels. When we talk about addressing fossil fuels, I do not think we only want to talk about bringing liquefied natural gas into this country to replace a rapidly declining resource that was so mishandled through the 1980s and 1990s by successive Liberal governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP strategy would conduct a complete assessment of federal subsidies and incentives to the energy sector, with input from relevant stakeholders, accompanied by the establishment of a specific timetable for the rapid elimination of environmentally harmful subsidies and incentives, particularly those associated with the oil and gas industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to share my time with my hon. colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78359,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78359&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Victoria</A>, I will bring my debate to a conclusion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, an energy strategy for Canada must put Canada's energy needs first, not those of the United States, not made in Washington with the North American energy working group giving direction to this country. We need our own energy strategy. We need it in conjunction with the Kyoto plan. Without that energy strategy, we will not get to Kyoto.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is an equally disturbing game being played by the Liberal Party. When we ask the Liberals what actual steps they will take to get something done in terms of working on an all party committee to bring in clear regulations, they throw the question around and say that it is the NDP or something else.

    </p><a name="Para399587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to tell our children what we did about this issue while we still have the opportunity. We have seen today how difficult it is to get past this appalling partisan debate, this ping-pong back and forth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eminent scientists, like climatologist Dr. Andrew Weaver, have sounded the alarm and have called for immediate action if we are to prevent the feedback loop that is inherent in the climate change process. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. John Robinson from UBC has said that the barriers to moving forward are not technological. He said that the fundamental things we need to do are policy changes that focus on the rules of the game with regulatory mechanisms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to try to deal with the motion at hand and what can be done to combat climate change. The issue of CEPA as a tool against climate change versus having legislation that would enforce action of the government has been raised several times by members of the Liberal Party. We have heard that CEPA allows government to act, and that is precisely the problem. It only enables government action. To actually get the action, we need to trust the government to act behind closed doors to do something.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once heard a former environment minister lament that he could not get his cabinet colleagues to act on climate change, as he put it, to act in the public interest. That is what happens if we leave the process behind closed doors. To say that CEPA could be used to tackle climate change is asking Canadians to accept that the fight against climate change happens at the whim of government behind closed doors in cabinet. We need legislation to set concrete objectives on absolute reductions of our greenhouse gas emissions. We need legislatively binding targets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of talking about who is worse on the environment, let us talk about what needs to happen because, frankly, we have done a poor job. We need to look primarily at how we produce and how we consume energy. We cannot gloss over just intensity based targets or even look, as the Minister of Natural Resources seems to, at ways to clean up the dirty energy. He seems to have boundless enthusiasm for nuclear energy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at absolute reductions of our energy production and consumption and we need to decouple economic growth from the consumption of fossil fuels, as both Liberals and Conservative seem reluctant to do in reining in the accelerated exploration of the tar sands. When we do get honest answers about why the Liberals have not acted on climate change in an effective way, they confess that they did not want to hurt the economy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to take a lead on new technologies, look at solutions toward the bioeconomy and look at green technology, green energy. Thanks to the loud voice of Canadians, the government is finally starting to get it. While the government talks about taking action, we have proposed a legislative committee and invited all parties to bring their best solutions to allow us to come away from this Parliament having taken action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I invite my colleagues to think seriously about what they will tell their children if we miss this opportunity.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, Newfoundland was strategically located with respect to air travel. Geographically, of course, we were a stepping stone for air travel between North America and Europe. People in places like Gander, Stephenville and Goose Bay earned their livelihoods on Newfoundland's strategic location. However, that is not the case today because modern jet aircraft no longer need these locations for service and, therefore, bypass these communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with that reality is the fact that Air Canada is no longer truly a national carrier. These days Air Canada is just another commercial airline that happens to carry the country's name. It only goes where it will make money and very often it will go only where it can make an awful lot of money. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada also plays a large role on the world stage and, in competition between domestic and international air travel, our province is generally the loser. However, that is enough on Air Canada, which is an ongoing battle, and I will now talk about the gulf ferry service. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gulf ferry service is our constitutionally guaranteed sea connection with the rest of Canada. For us, the gulf ferry service is an essential part of the Trans-Canada Highway, linking our section of the Trans-Canada to other sections crossing the nation. It is essential for getting fresh produce from all over North America to the supermarket shelves. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaints about the service are legion. It is usually crowded and messy, it is hard to get good sleeping accommodations and often it is unpredictable as well. Needless to say, numerous studies have pointed out the inadequacies of that system and there is hardly a Newfoundlander or a tourist in the country who cannot give chapter and verse about the shortcomings of that service. Therefore, an improved and upgraded system is very much in order, which is why this motion has been presented today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all heard about the fixed link, which is mentioned in the motion, the fixed link between the island and southern Labrador connecting to Quebec's North Shore Highway and on to central Canada. That is an excellent project to pursue in the long term but we need to look at the fact that it costs $1.7 billion to even talk about a fixed link. In the long term, it is a very good project to talk about but even if the project were started today, that kind of a project would take approximately 11 years to finish. However, in the short term, we need a vastly improved gulf ferry service.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised the issue with my colleagues in caucus and I have received a very encouraging response. I am very pleased that the minister of transport is committed to improvements in that service and judging from the conversations that I have had with the minister, I feel confident that these improvements are on the way to being initiated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister of transport should be commended. I am so pleased that he has an intense interest in my motion, that he was very quick on the draw to say that he supported the motion, and I want to thank him for it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am encouraged by the fact that the minister is going to bring forward a long term strategy on the future of Marine Atlantic, which would allow for input from people all over Newfoundland and Labrador.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told, as well, that a fleet renewal would be part of that strategy. Given the fact that we now have a new chair of Marine Atlantic and five new directors with business experience, I believe that there is hope for that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to congratulate Mr. Robert Crosbie on his appointment. He is one of my constituents and I feel confident that, given his background, we are going to make some progress in improving that service.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I could mention other modes of transportation in the province; however, I only have 15 minutes. So, Marine Atlantic is my main focus.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the province of Newfoundland and Labrador cannot become the tourist mecca that it is capable of becoming if we do not have a top notch marine Atlantic ferry service. We have only begun to scratch the surface of the tourism potential in our province. However, what we have to remember, when the tourist travelling by car arrives in North Sydney, is that we have to give that tourist every good reason to get on a ferryboat to cross that 90-mile expanse of water and come to the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is very important that we have a good service. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By coming to the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, let me tell the people of Canada, they are going to have a great experience. The people are second to none in our country, in terms of friendliness and wanting to welcome the tourists. When we look at the province itself, in terms of scenery, it is second to none anywhere in the world. We have to encourage the tourists to come to Newfoundland.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are somewhat disadvantaged in that regard if the tourists are hearing that the ferry service is not what it should be for the modern day tourist. It must not be messy. It must not be crowded. Sleeping accommodations have to be excellent. When they get on board the ferryboat, it has to be a good experience for them. That has not been the case in the past. I think, and I hope, and I know, that is going to change. I am confident it will change under this government and I am confident that the minister is on the right track.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important area of concern to me and to, I am sure, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, with respect to any new policy that might be developed for Marine Atlantic, is the stabilization of rates. We need a stable rate regime to ensure that the service does not become cost prohibitive, not only for the tourists, however important the tourists might be, but for the consumer as well.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725">(1725)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para399621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the people of Newfoundland and Labrador feel that the ferry rate should be approximately equivalent to the cost that would be incurred travelling the same distance by road. I heard that roughly 15 years ago when I was the provincial minister of transportation. I am looking across at my colleague from the Burin Peninsula who is smiling, but people would say to me that the rate has to be equivalent to what it would cost if we drove a car on that 90-mile stretch of road.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was less important 15 years ago, I suppose, rates were down somewhat. However, today we have to look at rates and we have to make sure it is not going to become cost prohibitive because rates tend to sneak up and it becomes cost prohibitive for the consumer generally as well as tourists. After all, it is an extension of the Trans-Canada Highway, I agree, and it is a constitutionally guaranteed service. It was part of our Terms of Union in 1949, so it is reasonable given that we are an island province, that we should not be discriminated against in that regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tourism industry is dependent upon a reasonably stable rate. A reasonably stable rate is also very important for the average consumer because in a supermarket the price of virtually every item on the supermarket shelf is reflected by the cost of crossing the gulf and trucking produce to the supermarket shelf. Generally speaking, the price is going to be higher than what it would cost on the mainland.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is saying for a moment that it should not be higher. That is expected when we have to use two modes of transportation to get produce to the supermarket shelf. However, if rates do not remain stable and if we were subject to the vagaries of rate increases to reflect the cost of the service, then the price of shipping goods to the supermarket shelf and to our province generally would certainly be out of control. I am told that virtually 90% of our produce comes in by truck. Therefore, that gulf service is an absolute must for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very sore point I hear quite often in our province is the lack of freshness in fruits and vegetables. I know that is unavoidable in some instances. However, the reliability and speed of the service is important. The turnaround time is important. Good maintenance is very important as well to ensure a minimum of breakdowns. All these things enter into making the service a top notch, 21st century transportation system. As I said before, I know the minister is aware of all these points and I am confident he is going to address them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only have a couple of minutes left and I will devote that to our roads system. About 15 years ago we let our railway go in exchange for a deal from the federal government of approximately $1.2 billion called “roads for rails agreement”. I was minister of transportation at the time who signed that agreement which allowed for an awful lot of road improvements. It allowed for the twinning of our Trans-Canada Highway and of course it allowed for a lot of infrastructure to be put into the city of St. John's and the neighbouring communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As important as that is, we have to remember as well that we have to have a good ongoing maintenance system in the province so it is imperative that we have an ongoing Trans-Canada Highway federal-provincial upgrading agreement. There are over 900 kilometres of road between St. John's and Port-aux-Basques where the ferry from Nova Scotia docks. In the winter and in rainy conditions that can be quite a nightmare. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My time is up and I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your indulgence.</div>

I was wondering what motivated him to bring this private member's motion before the House. I think he has explained that for us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very right in that this is a constitutionally protected service under the Terms of Union between the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador and the great country of Canada. He alluded to the impact that the Marine Atlantic service has on goods and services coming to our province. He also talked about some indications that he has obtained from his colleague, the minister of transport. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a couple of things I would like to ask him. Does he have any guarantee from his colleague, the minister of transport, that the users of Marine Atlantic will not be facing any increase in user fees? The previous minister of transport and the previous government froze those fees for a number of years. We were then interrupted by the last election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We froze the rates because we did not want the cost to the user and to the consumer in Newfoundland and Labrador to escalate. Therefore, I ask the member: does he have an undertaking from the minister of transport that those fees will not increase?</div>
    </p><a name="Para399633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the member is very much aware that the former minister of transport also appointed a committee that did a total analysis and assessment on the Marine Atlantic services, and the requirements to make Marine Atlantic more effective and more efficient. That was chaired by none other than a former chairman and CEO of Marine Atlantic, Captain Sid Hynes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member think the minister has enough information now without undertaking another consultative process to make the decisions that are necessary for Marine Atlantic and give it the money to purchase purpose built vessels for the service?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we know and as the hon. member said, what we need to do is look at all the measures that are possible and relate them to land, marine and other kinds of transportation. That being said, I clearly understood the hon. member's message. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As was very well explained and as all Canadians and people from Newfoundland and Labrador certainly know, the Canadian government has a constitutional obligation to provide ferry service. This ship link runs between North Sidney and Port aux Basques, Marine Atlantic, a crown corporation of the Government of Canada, fulfills this obligation of the Canadian government to provide a ferry service between Newfoundland and Labrador and the mainland.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at the situation with respect to this obligation. It is truly important for Newfoundland and Labrador to have a link with the mainland, especially for the transportation of goods and people. In order for a region to be properly developed, an adequate infrastructure must be provided. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, with regard to the obligation to provide transportation and the importance of it, the entire question of economic development is dependent on a number of things—as I said earlier—such as transportation of goods. This makes it possible to supply the factories of Newfoundland and Labrador with the equipment they need to develop and provide good jobs for their workers. It also enables the province to continue to progress. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also the whole issue of tourist diversification. If we want to identify the problems and provide assistance, we also have to be able to offer different options and solutions. One of these solutions is to ensure that tourists can get to Newfoundland and Labrador, because they are necessary for the province's development. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to understand each other here this evening. I respect the hon. member’s motion, because I believe that it is very important to look at the different options in order to ensure that we are able to provide the people of Newfoundland and Labrador with the tools they need. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Speaker, I have some questions about the motion. A report was commissioned by the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2004. The purpose of that study, requested by the province and carried out by a university in that province, was to evaluate the situation in this regard. What is somewhat ironic, as far as the motion is concerned, is that this study cost the citizens of Newfoundland and Labrador— the taxpayers of that province—over $281,000 of money from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study was designed to evaluate the possibility of a fixed link between the island and the mainland. If this study was requested in 2004 and just completed in 2005—that is not so long ago—then why would the process have to start over? This question is very important and I think that during the next hour of debate the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78920,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78920&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">St. John's-East</A>, who presented this motion, will have the opportunity to answer us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is even more worrying is that the member who is presenting the motion is also talking to us about ferries and says we should make sure that the Marine Atlantic ferries are providing the necessary tools to the people of his province.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740">(1740)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para399653"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2004, Marine Atlantic carried out an evaluation and did a study of the condition of the various ferries, the current situation and what it should do to secure the future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399654"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to mention what the study said. It is a special study from 2004, which included a recommendation that “The Corporation should develop a comprehensive vessel replacement plan based on operating needs and full life-cycle costs”. This is exactly what has been done. It is a part of the motion by my colleague opposite. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399655"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we look at the situation, we realize that Marine Atlantic went even further by saying, in the management response to this recommendation, “The plan has been developed and the first stage is in place”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399656"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So right now we are have with two reports: one commissioned and carried out in 2004 and another commissioned in 2004 and completed in early 2005, which cover the situation which the hon. member included in Motion M-242.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One certainly has to wonder what is the reason for carrying out another study. The idea is superb and really should be considered. The only thing that I wonder about is this: Do we have to re-do what has already been done? Do we have to start over with what has just been presented? Must we take public funds from the people who have contributed their tax dollars in order to pay for such studies? Do we again have to take money from our citizens and do these studies one more time? </div>
    </p><a name="Para399658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A politician told me the best way to do nothing is to carry out repeated studies. I believe that is the reality. By conducting studies and more studies, we end up not moving forward. Meanwhile, the residents of Newfoundland and Labrador require the necessary tools. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concern that I have in dealing with the motion is that if we again undertake the same process that has already been completed, we will not advance. If there is no progress, what will happen to the people who now need renewal of their ferry service? Marine Atlantic must meet certain obligations. We know that it has to fulfill its responsibilities. The question must be asked: where is this headed? </div>
    </p><a name="Para399660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom line is does the member want to stand still or does he really want to be proactive and continue to help his constituents? I believe we can always examine Motion 242 in that light. We might also ask if the member would be ready to take the two studies that have already been paid for out of the public purse and implement them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, the member should certainly consider that. Once again, I wonder why my Conservative colleague wants to spend more public money. There certainly must be a reason. However, I am not convinced that we will get answers tonight. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The priority is to provide the tools to the residents of Newfoundland and Labrador. That is a priority for the Liberal party and for the Liberal members from this province. They want to make sure that their constituents have the tools they need to make progress. For that reason, can we not go forward immediately? Can we take the studies that we now have, which were requested and largely paid for by ACOA and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, in order to move forward and do more for the residents of that province? If we really want to help them, we must give them the tools to develop economically and improve their quality of life. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am certain that before very long we will able to get these answers. I hope that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78533,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78533&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint John East</A>can give us some explanations about this motion that he has tabled in the House. </div>

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para399666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also look back in history a little. I heard members refer to what Canada's constitutional law provided in connection with Newfoundland's entry into Confederation. Let us look at this together. It will help the people of Quebec and Canada who are watching to understand. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1949, when Newfoundland, now Newfoundland and Labrador, joined Confederation, it was granted special status under the Constitution, more specifically term 32(1) of the Terms of Union, which states that “Canada will maintain in accordance with the traffic offering a freight and passenger steamship service between North Sydney and Port aux Basques, which, on completion of a motor highway between Corner Brook and Port aux Basques, will include suitable provision for the carriage of motor vehicles”. That is what constitutional law provided. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do matters stand today? At present, Newfoundlanders travel to mainland Canada on Marine Atlantic ferries. Having been made a crown corporation in 1986, Marine Atlantic works in cooperation with Transport Canada under the terms of an agreement. Its 2005 annual report and 2005-09 business plan show that this crown corporation provides quality service and is cost-effective. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out a few figures. There was a net profit in 2004-05. The corporation is doing well financially and has been posting gains since 2004-05. But good financial performance does not necessarily mean a company offers the best services. That is why, as my colleagues mentioned earlier, an advisory committee was created in 2004 to improve things. In March 2005, the committee submitted a report containing 41 recommendations to the federal Minister of Transport. I agree with some of my colleagues. Today, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78920,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78920&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">St. John's East</A> tabled a motion for more studies. I am sure that since I have a copy of the conclusions in the advisory committee's report, the member must also have a copy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read the main recommendations submitted to the Minister of Transport in 2005: recognizing the essential nature of Marine Atlantic’s services; renewing Marine Atlantic’s governance structure; investing in Marine Atlantic’s fleet and phasing in three larger vessels between 2006 and 2011; improving Marine Atlantic’s efficiency by eliminating the drop-trailer service; improving the quality, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness of the service; improving relations with users and stakeholders through partnerships; passing savings and efficiencies on to users with a 15% rate reduction; stabilizing and predicting future rates based on inflation; stabilizing Marine Atlantic’s annual subsidy; and relocating Marine Atlantic’s head office to Port aux Basques. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have quoted only a few of the 41 recommendations made by that advisory committee, which submitted its report to the Minister of Transport in 2005. That was not 20 years ago. This is 2007, so it has not even been two years since that report was submitted to the Minister of Transport. Today, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78920,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78920&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">St. John's East</A> says that the new <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport</A> would agree to having studies done again. This is a matter of direct concern to me. Newfoundland and Labrador is a province, and an island, as we know. In Quebec, we have the Magdalen Islands. I quite understand that Newfoundlanders are having transportation problems. Earlier, my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78920,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78920&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">St. John's East</A> said that air transportation is not what it used to be. There are problems with ferry service, and that is why a committee was created and recommendations were made directly to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people of the Magdalen Islands are in the same situation. They have transportation problems, especially in winter. Ferry service is not always as effective as they would like, and the air transportation companies do not provide the service that they would like to see.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So yes, the Bloc Québécois is aware of the problems that people who live on islands have. We agree. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first recommendation that must be made, however, is to establish an effective ferry service. That is what they would like to see. That is what the people of the Magdalen Islands are asking for, to solve the transportation problem in the Magdalen Islands: increase the number of ferries, ensure that there are ferries in winter, and all of that. These are justified requests.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the main recommendations made in the report submitted to the Minister of Transport in 2005 was to invest in the Marine Atlantic fleet, to move gradually to a fleet with three larger vessels between 2006 and 2011. No one could oppose this. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, what the member is proposing in his motion is that more studies be done. You will understand that we cannot support this. It has been barely two years since a committee made those same recommendations. I am not talking about the number of ships, I am talking about what the people of the Magdalen Islands are asking for when they tell us about their ineffective transportation services between the islands and the mainland.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magdalen Islanders are experiencing the same problems as the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. I am glad that a study was done there and that a committee made recommendations to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</A>. What the Conservative member is saying in his motion today is that the studies are going to be redone. I have a real problem with that. He should have made specific demands in Parliament. We could have supported them to reinstate an effective service or establish a more effective ferry service, as provided for in the Canadian Constitution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I often say, it is all well and good to debate and talk here in this House, but maybe it is time to take action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand that if the Bloc Québécois votes against this motion it is not because it is against the interests of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, who have a transportation problem. I am telling you: the Magdalen Islands are in the same situation. It is time to invest money and establish effective services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased that, in Newfoundland and Labrador, a committee made specific recommendations to increase the number of ships and improve quality of service and on-time performance. The committee also recommended that the governance structure of Marine Atlantic be renewed; that its efficiency be improved by no longer providing a drop-trailer service; that savings and profits be passed on to users through fare reductions; that future fares be stabilized and anticipated. We already know all these things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, today's motion proposes to conduct new studies, but this is difficult to accept, because such studies have already been made. We would love to see the government commission a study for Magdalen Islanders, to review their transportation problems. Moreover, after looking at the findings of that study, we could ask that investments be made. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Conservative member, who witnessed these studies—even though they were conducted under the former Liberal government—is again asking that more studies be done. Instead, he should have asked that the recommendations of the committee that submitted its report to the Minister of Transport in 2005 be implemented. Today, we could be voting on a monetary request to settle the maritime transportation issue that exists in Newfoundland and Labrador.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, hon. members must realize that the objective pursued by the Bloc Québécois is that of efficiency. We have to put a stop to all the talking. Enough is enough. It is time to act. We thought that this is what the Conservative government had in mind. But the motion presented by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78920,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78920&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">St. John's East</A> is asking for studies that have already been made. Today, he should have tabled a motion asking for investments. Then would have been pleased to support it. We would support a motion asking for studies if it was for the Magdalen Islands, which have not had the benefit of such studies. Again, we would have supported a government motion asking for money. However, we cannot support a new motion asking for more studies. </div>

We discussed various issues affecting the province. One of them, of course, was marine and transportation services to the province. He indicated to me that the fees being charged for Marine Atlantic services were anywhere from 50% to 60% of the fees themselves. In many cases, it is quite formidable and costly for people to access goods and services on and off the island.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78993,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78993&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Random—Burin—St. George's</A> was correct when he said that the previous government froze the fees. We were hoping that there would be a complete analysis of the transportation costs to the good people of Newfoundland and Labrador so that there could be a thorough discussion, not only in the House of Commons but in the House of Assembly, to discuss where we go from here in assisting that province and developing its economy, not just through transportation routes but in other aspects as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the concerns we also discussed was the aspect that some of the ferries are getting quite old and need to be replaced. In the Halifax shipyard, we see the <i>Joseph and Clara Smallwood </i> vessel most of the time being repaired. It is about time that a fair number of these vessels be replaced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that with modern efficiencies and with Atlantic know-how, we could have those ships built right in Atlantic Canada. I will be biased and say at the Halifax shipyards but also in the Marystown yards or Lévis, Quebec, Port Welland or out in B.C. We believe that if the government really had a procurement process that was fair and that used Canadian tax dollars to assist in the building of Canadian vessels, sort of like the ferries and other vessels that we require for our services, then the so-called fiscal imbalance that everyone keeps talking about could be addressed through what I call fiscal development. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to develop these yards and give them the new equipment to make proper sound investments, then the people of Atlantic Canada would not only have good, high-paying and highly-skilled jobs but Newfoundland and Labrador and Cape Breton would be able to get the vessels that they require.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague was absolutely correct when he said that one of the tragedies in a way but, obviously, agreed to, was the demise a while ago of the Newfie Bullet which was the rail service in Newfoundland and Labrador. As the hon. member said, it was exchanged for money to build up the infrastructure of the road system there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know anybody who has been there knows that there are many songs and many stories about many of the people who worked along the railway or the Newfie Bullet as they called it. It is absolutely wonderful that the people can retain stories of that very magnificent form of transport that they had for so long. Unfortunately, however, modern times dictated that we would put everything on the roads.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my hon. colleague for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78920,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78920&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">St. John's East</A> knows well, with that amount of truck traffic on the road and with the weather systems they have, the roads soon fall into disrepair. They need sound investments to ensure that the main transportation routes are not only safe but also efficient to allow goods and services to travel efficiently.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were discussions before. If I am not mistaken I believe the premier of the province once discussed a fixed link between Labrador and that of the great northern peninsula in northern Newfoundland. That is a discussion that we have always said is worthy of further discussion, not just in the House of Commons but in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador as well because that would be a very expensive type of operation. Of course, it would need to connect to a road that goes down through Quebec and then onward into central Canada. I believe that would be a worthy discussion.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, hopefully, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador grow and as that region of Atlantic grows, we think that it has great benefits for all of Atlantic Canada, including northern Quebec. We do need discussions regarding transportation services for the province of Newfoundland and Labrador but when we discuss that we are also talking about other provinces in the Atlantic and maritime regions.</div>

I am proud of this government because this will help many of my constituents. As members know, I am from the third largest Newfoundland city in the world, and I am very proud of that fact, the northern Alberta city of Fort McMurray.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government believes in, is working toward and is helping to build a world-class transportation system that serves all Canadians, along with the required infrastructure to support it. In fact, this Conservative government has made substantial investments in Canada's infrastructure that will benefit all Canadians, not just a select few. It will benefit all regions of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard some comments by other members on this particular subject and I can assure all members in this House that this new Conservative government of Canada is improving transportation. We have looked at the studies that were done and the minister will act decisively. He is a decisive minister and this is a government of action that will get results for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look no further than budget 2006 where we committed $16.5 billion in unprecedented federal support for infrastructure over the next four years. That unprecedented amount includes $900 million in new funding for public transit. It also maintains the current funding under existing infrastructure agreements, such as the gas tax funding worth $5 billion over the next five years. It also includes $591 million in new funding for the all important Asia-Pacific gateway and corridor initiative that will help our trade and transportation routes all the way through Canada. It also includes funding for new infrastructure programs for provincial, territorial and municipal infrastructure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members in this House, especially the members opposite, should hold their breath until budget 2007 because they are in for even more surprises.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last budget, we have consulted with the provinces and territories, the municipal sector and key stakeholders involved in the transportation initiatives across this great country. We have looked at more effective ways to use our infrastructure investments to promote a more competitive, productive economy, to improve the quality of life of Canadians from coast to coast to coast, to achieve tangible improvements in the environment, and most important, to ensure accountability and transparency for all Canadians, for all taxpayers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are acting on what we heard. In fact, advantage Canada, released at the same time as the economic and fiscal update, is an economic plan that is designed to make Canada a world leader for today and for future generations of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key element of this plan is the Conservative government's commitment to work toward a comprehensive plan to make up for the 13 years of bad management of our infrastructure that took place before this Conservative government was in office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It includes long term, sustainable, predictable funding and a fair and transparent provincial allocation for program envelopes to support improvements to the core national highway system which is so important to every Canadian family; to move toward large scale provincial, territorial and municipal projects, such as public transit and waste water management, which has been falling apart for some period of time, especially in my constituency in northern Alberta and across Quebec; and also for small scale municipal projects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next while and within the context of our commitment to restore Canada's fiscal balance, we will set out how we intend to work with all our partners, after listening to stakeholders, to put our infrastructure money to work for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has a constitutional responsibility, and we heard that from the member, to maintain transportation services between the island of Newfoundland and the mainland. We will continue to fulfill that responsibility, but in order to do so and as this motion clearly states, we must examine specific areas to determine the best way forward.</div>

    </p><a name="Para399711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also be noted that to ensure accountability to all Canadians, this funding is contingent upon a detailed business case. As always, the government moves toward items on the basis of transparency and accountability to Canadian taxpayers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province is also constructing a 250 kilometre route from Happy Valley easterly to Cartwright Junction. The project is half completed and scheduled to be finished in the fall of 2009. Completion of this route will mean that the Trans-Labrador Highway will no longer end at Happy Valley and will connect to Newfoundland via the ferry at the Strait of Bell Isle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of the establishment of a fixed link between the island of Newfoundland and the mainland of Canada has also been raised and has been studied. The Newfoundland and Labrador fixed link refers to various proposals for constructing either a bridge, a tunnel or a causeway across the Strait of Belle Isle, connecting Labrador's mainland with the island of Newfoundland, a very important issue to the people of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pre-feasibility study looked at these three concepts. Road and rail modes for transport of vehicles through a tunnel were also assessed. It concluded that one of the tunnel options, a bored tunnel under Belle Isle at its narrowest point, is the most technically and economically attractive alternative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province has stated publicly that, in its opinion, the fixed link is a long term proposition and a national project that will need a significant infusion of financing from the federal government. It has also been mentioned that it is not a priority for the provincial government. As the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78920,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78920&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">St. John's East</A> has mentioned, it is a long term solution that must be kept in consideration and seriously looked at in the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is not a viable option in the short term to improve transportation to the mainland, we can examine if there is a scope for additional work on the Trans-Canada Highway that would improve connections with the province's airport and ferry terminals, as has also been mentioned by the member.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to Marine Atlantic Incorporated, Canada's new government is committed to stabilizing Marine Atlantic and ensuring that the important services that it provides remains safe, efficient and affordable for Canadians. After all, Marine Atlantic fulfills Canada's constitutional obligation to the province of Newfoundland and Labrador to provide a year round freight and passenger service. As many members in the House know, the corporation carries 27% of all passengers, 50% of all freight and 90% of all perishables entering the province, clearly a very important transportation link. The minister will announce a long term strategy on Marine Atlantic in the next coming weeks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will to turn finally to air transportation. The air industry continues to meet the needs of the residents of Newfoundland and Labrador. Air Canada and WestJet both operate extensive services to other regions of Canada and both have recently expanded their capacity to serve Newfoundland and Labrador. In addition, three other airlines based in Newfoundland offer extensive regional service within the province. At present, air carriers provide scheduled service to a total of 21 airports in Newfoundland and Labrador, carrying 1.5 million passengers in 2006. St. John's International Airport has recorded four years of consecutive growth as has Deer Lake, which has nearly doubled over the last five years as far as passenger growth.</div>

This is a government of action that will get things done for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This commitment has been demonstrated in a number of investments in both transportation and infrastructure, but we cannot rest on our laurels. That is why the government will move ahead to support this important motion.</div>

    </p><a name="Para399722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very interesting when the member stood up and talked about Newfoundland's third largest city being Fort McMurray. This comes from a member who not too long ago said that those unemployed in Atlantic Canada should go to Alberta to look for employment. He said he would be supporting this motion put forward by my friend from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78920,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78920&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">St. John's East</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the parliamentary secretary is supporting the motion to make Marine Atlantic services more effective in order to get more Newfoundlanders and Labradorians to go to Fort McMurray, or is he sincere about improving the transportation services to the people of our province which are so badly needed?</div>
    </p><a name="Para399724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary speaks about the previous Liberal government. The Conservative government has been in office for a year. We do not see too many results in transportation services by water, road or by air for Newfoundland and Labrador. As a matter of fact, our services have decreased and the levels have gone down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to the parliamentary secretary that if he is going to stand in his place representing the minister and the government, he has to be sincere about what he is saying. He has to understand the issues. He has to understand our province. Obviously he does not. It is obvious that he does not understand a Marine Atlantic issue as would the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78920,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78920&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">St. John's East</A> and my colleague from Gander and myself. I say that out of respect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the parliamentary secretary that we are not proud about the thousands of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians that had to go to Fort McMurray to work. We want them to work in our province. That is why we want to improve this service, to get employment opportunities within our province. We do not want to improve it so that more of them go to the area he represents. If the member gets us worked up enough, in the next election we may have to get a good Newfoundlander or Labradorian elected in his riding. There are enough of them out there that they could probably defeat the member if we went out there and put on a campaign. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not proud of that. That is not what we are here for. We are here because we are sincere about seeing this constitutionally protected service improved. The government is sitting on enough reports, paid for in part by agencies of the federal government, by Marine Atlantic and stakeholders in Newfoundland and Labrador, that make concrete recommendations to the minister and to the government on how to improve the service. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people want purpose built vessels. The service has changed over time. Transportation methods and modes have changed over time. The department has enough information now to make the decisions that the parliamentary secretary talks about without talking about further consultations for other strategies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for the parliamentary secretary and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78920,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78920&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">St. John's East</A>.

It is an issue that we have been discussing in the House for over 10 years. It truly is unfortunate that we are still discussing it instead of actually taking action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said earlier this week to the minister:</div>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Mr. Speaker, the current fiasco could have been avoided. In the last Parliament all parties recognized the urgency to update the current, archaic and discriminatory Citizenship Act that does not recognize people married in religious ceremonies abroad and considers their children illegitimate. Had it not been for the defeat of the previous government, Canadians would now have a new Citizenship Act.</small></td>

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para399738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That question was fairly straightforward and called on the government not to discriminate against religious marriages. That is exactly what is happening and it is having quite an impact on quite a few Canadians. I find it passing strange that a party, which supposedly promotes religious freedoms, would discriminate against them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister responded to me by saying:</div>
    </p><a name="Para399740"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para399741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that the Conservatives have recognized same sex marriage, finally, but I am left wondering if they also recognize common law marriage. Why would we discriminate by taking citizenship away from people who were married in a religious ceremony? </div>
    </p><a name="Para399742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more disturbing is that we are talking about a young man 27 years old who lived in this country since he was a few months old and because his great-grandparents were married in a religious ceremony and did not have a civil ceremony, he had his citizenship denied because he was born out of wedlock. How ridiculous can we get?</div>
    </p><a name="Para399743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it incredible that this allegation would be made in particular against the Mennonite community that has the highest of morals and is very much traditionalist on this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can fix this and we can fix this if the Conservatives keep their promise, in the last government and previous governments, that they would bring in a citizenship act that was in line with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I want to commend the work of CBC Radio on this issue. I encourage Canadians to engage in the debate because it is a critical debate. It impacts on hundreds of thousands of people, or even millions of people, who are Canadian citizens.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals had 13 years to do it and could not get it done. They had 11 years of majority governments and did nothing, absolutely nothing, to fix these problems.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our Conservative government did not create the problem, we will fix the problem for the benefit of all Canadians in all categories.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government finds it unacceptable that law-abiding individuals who have been led to believe they were always Canadian citizens are not now having their citizenship affirmed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is precisely why the minister has instructed department officials that if an individual falls in one of the areas in question and has been recently notified that he or she is no longer a citizen while showing a significant attachment to Canada, our government will do everything necessary to make sure that citizen's status is made clear as quickly as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para399756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the minister's recent actions have received support from stakeholders. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote from the January 26 edition of the <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i>, which said that the immigration minister's “decision was welcomed by Bill Janzen, head of the Mennonite Central Committee”, to which the member was referring, “who has been trying for several years to help an accumulating number of children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Mennonites who have lost their citizenship, even though they were raised in Canada”. Mr. Janzen stated, “We are really happy now that the government is committed officially and clearly to act quickly on these cases”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para399758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is action when we have seen 13 years of inaction. We will see that we stand behind these citizens and make sure that they are recognized, as they ought to be.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hypocrisy of the government's position happened just yesterday when it told Mr. Joe Taylor that it will go all the way to the Supreme Court to deny him his citizenship.
