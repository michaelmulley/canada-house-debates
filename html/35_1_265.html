	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately take 
the required measures to privatize all operations and services of the Canada Post 
Corporation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for 
seconding the motion.
<P>
	My speech will be about 10 minutes long to allow my colleagues 
to also speak to private members' motion 312. I preface my 
remarks by stating that Canadians need and deserve an efficient 
postal service.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports placing the ownership and control of 
corporations in the sector that can perform their function most cost 
effectively, with greatest accountability to owners and the least 
likelihood of incurring public debt. We believe there is 
overwhelming evidence that this would be the private sector in the 
vast majority of cases.
<P>
	As far as Canada Post Corporation is concerned, the Reform 
Party supports free competition for the post office. There should be 
no restrictions on private competition in the delivery of mail, 
which brings me to my private members' motion. It calls for the 
government to take measures to privatize the operations and 
services of the Canada Post Corporation.
<P>
	There are at least two essential considerations. First, is there any 
reason at all to involve government in mail delivery? Should it be 
completely privatized or totally deregulated? Second, if there is 
reason for government involvement in mail services, is the current 
system the best and the right way to do it?
<P>
	As far as the first consideration is concerned, if our goal is 
simply to maximize efficiency, there is no role for government 
operations or subsidies here or anywhere else. If people who live in 
remote places find that mail is hard to send or hard to get, that is a 
consequence of their  home being somewhere remote. If they do 
not like it, they should move closer to a city or area where mail 
service is better. Of course, I am not advocating that option.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	It is normally argued that the purpose of a national mail service 
is to contribute to national unity by allowing everyone from sea to 
sea to sea to send and receive letters at a reasonable price. If this is 
true, there has to be some sort of government role.
<P>
	The bulk of the mail is between businesses and their customers, 
in and around large towns and cities where deliveries can be made 
cheaply because the volume is so high. In a truly private world, the 
more remote you are the more your mail will cost. It is true that 
people in remote places generally are among the less wealthy and 
less able to afford high postal rates.
<P>
	Most people, except possibly a few federal cabinet ministers, 
understand that free citizens do things better, cheaper and more 
nicely than government. Therefore we should assume that 
government should not become involved in any particular area and 
put the burden of proof on those who say it should stay involved 
and to explain why.
<P>
	In the case of mail delivery the reason for involving government 
is to make sure that all Canadians from coast to coast to coast have 
access to mail in the interests of the national community and 
national unity. It is not because people think the government would 
do a good job of delivering the mail, even by the normal standards 
of bureaucracy.
<P>
	However, people who think the government should ensure that 
everyone can get and send mail cheaply should still not want a 
postal monopoly. The right way to manage the mail would be to 
promise that anyone, anywhere can mail a letter for a certain rate, 
say 45 cents. The entire field of delivery would then be thrown 
wide open and deregulated totally, except that the government 
would pay for but contract out the job of making mail deliveries at 
45 cents per letter to places like Inuvik, that private carriers just 
could not and would not service cheaply.
<P>
	This would be paid for out of general revenues. Since the goal of 
promoting national unity is one that benefits all Canadians equally, 
it makes sense to ask them all to pay for it. The argument will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16804"> 16804 </A></B>
<P>
made that the  government would lose money on this even if it is 
compared with the present system. What the present system does is 
penalize all users of mail and all potential mail delivery servers 
quite heavily. It allows every Canadian to get mail, but imposes the 
cost disproportionately on one group and in the process damages to 
the Canadian economy. I suggest the damage to the Canadian 
economy at the hands of Canada Post is not small.
<P>
	CPC is a perennial money loser, having lost money in three of 
the last five years, ending its most recent fiscal year with a $68.8 
million loss. That amount is only a fraction of the cost to the 
Canadian economy by the mail monopoly. Slow delivery, private 
opportunities denied and lost, excessive charges for mail in big 
towns and cities that could be delivered for less than 45 cents and 
burdensome bureaucracies are some of the inefficiencies.
<P>
	The real cost of Canada Post is higher than its on-book losses. 
Here are a few losses to consider; the $68.8 million loss which I 
just mentioned for 1993-94. It was $22 million higher than the 
company executives predicted just a year before. Some prediction 
and, I suppose, some executives. The books also showed a $270 
million deficit even though last year CPC showed a profit in its first 
class mail delivery; a $282 million entry attributed to internal 
restructuring of some kind. That is more than five times higher than 
the previous year's entry. No explanation was given for what type 
of restructuring.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	Here is another interesting phenomenon: 41.7 per cent of CPC'S 
volume of delivered mail is in the form of unaddressed advertising, 
or as Canadians so affectionately refer to it, junk mail. Here is the 
kicker. Junk mail generates only 5.2 per cent of CPC's total 
revenues, which means that nearly half of CPC's volume produces 
a paltry 5.2 per cent of its revenues.
<P>
	To the viewers watching, I hope they are sitting down for this. It 
is illegal for private mail carriers to charge less than $1.29 a piece 
for the delivery of first class mail, which is nearly three times as 
high as the already exorbitant price of 45 cents a stamp charged by 
CPC. It is a monopoly and it is still losing money.
<P>
	The government is planning to review the operations of CPC. 
That is really what our country needs, and the people are just dying 
for it, another study by this do nothing government. CPC should be 
privatized using the contracting out model of reform on the least 
subsidy basis; that is, ask for bids to deliver the mail, charge 
customers 45 cents and take the bid from the company that delivers 
to remote places as efficiently as possible. The extra cost would be 
taken out of general revenues as I stated earlier.
<P>
	One thing is certain. CPC is pricing itself out of the business of 
delivering mail, especially with more and  more businesses turning
<P>
to faxes and E-mail. CPC is a top down, inefficient monopoly that 
has no place in the emerging global economy. I urge the 
government to take action to allow private carriers the opportunity 
to be involved in mail delivery. Not only would it help to fix our 
ailing economy, but the Canadian people would be much better 
served.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motion before the House states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately take 
the required measures to privatize all operations and services of the Canada Post 
Corporation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I cannot support this motion. To support it is to support an end to 
universal access. My riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants is 
primarily a rural riding, a riding where people recognize the 
important role of the post office in strengthening the economic and 
social infrastructure of our communities.
<P>
	Much like myself, the hon. member for Yellowhead lives in and 
represents a predominantly rural riding, an area where a private 
corporation might not choose to provide a service. Does the hon. 
member realize that if this motion were adopted, the postal services 
in his riding and in rural ridings across Canada could be seriously 
affected or become non-existent?
<P>
	As government we believe in the importance of providing easy 
access for all Canadians regardless of where they live. I cannot 
understand why the member for Yellowhead would introduce a 
motion that could deny postal services to his own constituents.
<P>
	Canada Post is improving services to Canadians. In the past five 
years Canada Post Corporation has increased by nearly 30 per cent 
the number of locations where stamps, postal products and postal 
services can be purchased. The crown corporation has a network of 
over 2,500 franchise outlets across the country. When we walk into 
our local drug store or convenience store, chances are we can 
purchase postal products at one of these outlets. These outlets 
attract customers to these locations which means increased 
commerce. It is good for business and good business helps our 
economy.
<P>
	By building on these partnerships with local businesses, Canada 
Post is expanding the accessibility of postal services without 
incurring large expenditures. This is part of Canada Post's drive to 
ensure convenient access to postal services for Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	I also point out to the hon. member that independent surveys 
done by Decima and Anderson Strategic Research show that 
customer satisfaction with these outlets is well over 90 per cent.
<P>
	Canada Post's diversity is evident and it is demonstrated in how 
it operates throughout the country. Take for example Atlantic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16805"> 16805 </A></B>
<P>
Canada. In Atlantic Canada,  Canada Post is a 200-year old federal 
institution which has helped to build and maintain the region. 
Atlantic Canada is predominantly rural and has the largest number 
of small post offices in the country. Among them is Canada Post's 
first post office which is located in Halifax. Throughout the region 
there are approximately 2,300 locations to buy postal products.
<P>
	The post office is not just a place to buy stamps. It is a place to 
interact with other people, to establish the links which make a 
community and build a country. I live across the street from the 
post office in Canning, Nova Scotia and I see the traffic. I hear the 
conversations. I see the relationships which are made. I see the 
transactions people make. I talk to those people. It is the hub of our 
community.
<P>
	For millions of Canadians the post office has been connection 
point and an important part of our culture. Hon. members will 
remember that in February 1994 there was talk of further closures 
of rural and small town post offices. During that debate I talked and 
met with postal officials and many concerned citizens in my riding 
of Annapolis Valley-Hants and the message was clear: ``Do not 
close down the post offices''. I brought that message back to 
Ottawa.
<P>
	On February 17, 1994 in the House I urged the government to 
demonstrate its commitment to rural Canadians to ensure that these 
post offices remained open. The minister listened to these concerns 
and to the concerns expressed by Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast. As we know, he placed a moratorium on closures and 
conversions of rural and small town post offices. In announcing the 
moratorium the minister said: ``As long as this government is in 
power, no rural or small town post office will be closed''.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that in his riding the towns of 
Whitecourt, Grande Cache, Hinton, Edson and Jasper are all 
covered by the Liberal moratorium on post office closures.
<P>
	If Canada Post were to be privatized, would the private company 
keep all of these small post offices open? Even courier companies 
are closing down shop in small towns. If these companies close 
down, who is left? Who will deliver the parcels to rural areas once 
the hon. member has privatized Canada Post? That is why Canada 
Post is a necessary national institution.
<P>
	The hon. member must take into account that 20 per cent of 
Alberta and 23 per cent of Canada is rural. With privatization there 
is a real danger that rural Canadians will be forgotten.
<P>
	People in the town of Evansburg in the hon. member's riding 
held a meeting and asked the government not to close down their 
postal outlet. The government is listening. Canada Post under this 
government will not abandon rural Canadians.
<P>
	While the motion talks of privatization, I wonder what kind of 
service Canadians living in the northern regions would receive 
under this scenario. In all likelihood the answer is nil.
<P>
	Canada Post has had a profound impact on the north. Since its 
formation in 1989 the northern services division has been 
responsible for maintenance and improvements to postal 
operations in northern Canada.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	Ongoing training programs have allowed northern services to 
work toward the gradual turnover of operations and management to 
indigenous residents of the area. The area administered includes 
Yukon, Northwest Territories, communities in northern Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and all of Labrador. 
This division represents 72 per cent of Canada's land mass and a 
diverse population of 221,000 people.
<P>
	The geographic location, the climate conditions, the low 
population density and the remoteness of population centres create 
operational challenges and some difficulties in mail delivery and 
communication with residents. To overcome these difficulties, the 
corporation has adopted its network policies and procedures to 
meet the specific needs of the north.
<P>
	It is clearly evident that Canada Post helps to promote and 
maintain this region of our vast country. Canada Post must remain 
a crown corporation because there is a need to provide consistent 
services to Canadians while being fiscally responsible. This means 
servicing all areas of the country, even those which are less 
profitable, and serving them well.
<P>
	That is why the Canada Post Corporation was established as a 
crown corporation on October 16, 1981 out of what was then a 
government department. I remind all members of the House that 
the Canada Post Corporation Act was supported by all three parties 
in the House of Commons. It was welcomed by organized labour, 
business and consumer groups.
<P>
	The Canada Post Corporation was established as a crown 
corporation to provide purpose and direction and to bring business 
values to the operation of postal services in Canada. Why should 
this government now take a successful corporation and privatize it? 
I believe that over the years Canada Post has made progress. 
However, I also believe we still have a lot of work to do.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that our government is conducting a mandate 
review of Canada Post. It has been 15 years since the corporation 
was established and 10 years since the Marchment report, the last 
major review of Canada Post's mandate. It is therefore necessary to 
examine the current situation against the original intent. It provides 
a valuable opportunity to revisit corporate direction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16806"> 16806 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada Post is a national institution and we are proud of it. 
Canada Post has achieved many accomplishments. Canada Post 
is a viable crown corporation and it provides an essential public 
service.
<P>
	I cannot support the motion before the House because I believe it 
would bring an end to universal access to postal services. This in 
turn would negatively affect the very communities I have been 
elected to serve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to this private 
member's motion this morning.
<P>
	As we know, the role of Canada Post will be reviewed by a 
committee recently set up by the minister; my remarks are 
therefore subject to this committee's proceedings and subsequent 
report.
<P>
	If I understand correctly, today's motion calls for privatizing 
Canada Post. In principle, since this is a private member's motion, 
I will speak first on my own behalf and not on behalf of the Bloc. 
Of course, I myself am not opposed in principle to privatizing 
government controlled businesses. In principle, one should not be 
against this. Even the present federal government cannot come out 
against any kind of privatization, since it has just privatized CN. It 
is easy to see that this privatization may eliminate some rural 
services and that this is not necessarily a good thing for people 
across Canada.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	But they may have done the right thing by privatizing CN, 
especially because of the competition with CP. As for Canada Post, 
it is indeed a monopoly, which raises questions on the risks of 
privatizing such a large monopoly.
<P>
	We already know about the numerous problems with Canada 
Post. The Canadian Union of Postal Workers has exposed many 
cases of waste and inefficiency, accusing Canada Post of misusing 
its money and running considerable deficits from one year to the 
next because of this. There have also been complaints from private 
firms, including courier service and mail advertising companies, 
which deliver information packages from door to door.
<P>
	I have reviewed this matter quite thoroughly, since industry 
representatives have complained to me personally that Canada Post 
unfairly competes with private sector companies. This is 
something of an outrage because, if I understand correctly, Canada 
Post can make a profit from its monopoly in first class mail 
delivery by charging 48 cents for every stamp. If we look only at 
the revenue from stamp sales and first class mail delivery, Canada 
Post makes a profit, but uses it to compete with businesses such as 
home delivery, courier service and mail advertising firms.
<P>
	This is unfair and I am totally opposed to this kind of 
competition from the government, whether we are dealing with the 
postal service or the engineering sector. Canada Post comes under 
the responsibility of the public works minister, and we will soon 
have an opportunity, perhaps even this afternoon, to debate Bill 
C-52, which testifies once again to the government's tendency to 
compete unfairly with the private sector.
<P>
	For a government that wants to encourage private enterprise and 
put in place legislation to promote job creation, this is totally 
unacceptable. In the case of Canada Post, this is blatant. It is 
inevitable. Last year, Canada Post's deficit was approximately $70 
million, if I am not mistaken, and, before that, I think it was $280 
million. But these deficits can be attributed, to some extent, to the 
fact that Canada Post is spending money it makes as a monopoly to 
compete with the private sector for courier services and direct mail 
advertising.
<P>
	Canada Post's services are not competitive. It is in fact digging 
in the public purse, because, as a crown corporation, Canada Post 
belongs to all of us. It belongs to all Canadians and uses its 
revenues from mail delivery to compete with the private sector. It 
is obviously unacceptable and, at the very least, Canada Post's 
should be reviewed to ensure that, if Canada Post maintains its 
monopoly on first class mail delivery, it should not compete with 
the private sector, at least not any more.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	That is for sure.
<P>
	But I am not sure how effective it would be to privatize Canada 
Post and limit, say, its role to first class mail delivery. I wonder 
because, as I said earlier, Canada Post only turns a profit on first 
class mail delivery. So, why do that if the service is there and is 
adequate, or at least cost effective, although there may still be room 
for improvement within the organization. As I said earlier, 
according to labour, postal workers, inside staff and others, service 
delivery could be improved, but there does not seem to be any net 
benefit in privatizing Canada Post.
<P>
	But again, it all depends on how Canada Post's mandate review 
will be conducted. Perhaps, over the next few months, moving 
away from a monopoly, service delivery could be broadened, in the 
sense that several private companies could provide the service.
<P>
	However, there are many instances where, when we try too hard 
to liberalize certain sectors, ordinary people end up footing the bill. 
For example, the government's decision to end Bell Canada's 
monopoly resulted in a significant increase in the costs of 
telephone services. The same thing also happened in the transport 
sector and in several other ones.
<P>
	Sometimes, the liberalization process is taken too far and is 
detrimental to public interest. Since consumers have to pay more, 
we must ask ourselves this question: If  we privatize Canada Post 
so that a number of companies can offer services currently 
provided exclusively by the corporation, does it mean that, instead 
of paying 48 cents for the delivery of a first class letter, consumers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16807"> 16807 </A></B>
<P>
will have to shell out 75 cents? If this is the case, I do not see how 
such a change would be beneficial. It would create an excess in the 
other way.
<P>
	So far, the government has not used adequate judgment to 
restrict the mandate of Canada Post and ensure that the corporation 
does not compete unfairly with private businesses in the delivery of 
mailings, or even as regards courier services. This an abuse of 
power and an aberration. It is unacceptable. It may even be 
immoral. However, it would be just as bad to go to the other 
extreme, liberalize all the services provided by Canada Post, and 
trigger a substantial cost increase in the delivery of a first class 
letter for ordinary Canadians. That could be an excess of another 
kind.
<P>
	As a matter of principle, we cannot oppose the privatization of 
crown corporations. The government has already shown that it was 
open to privatization. However, a balance must be sought regarding 
the mandate of Canada Post. Hopefully, once that mandate is 
reviewed by the minister's committee, balanced recommendations 
can be made and take into account the interests of all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the motion now before the House proposing the privatization of the 
post office can be based on myth only, and we on this side of the 
House prefer to deal with the facts.
<P>
	The mover of the motion presumes that Canada Post is an 
inefficient, money losing organization and a drain on the Canadian 
taxpayer. In fact, Canada Post has achieved a considerable 
turnaround in its operations and finances. It is self-sufficient and 
since 1988 no longer receives appropriations from government.
<P>
	The mover of the motion presumes that Canada Post is an 
inefficient organization that did not adapt to the realities of the 
marketplace. Wrong again. In fact, Canada Post has been 
improving continuously since becoming a crown corporation, with 
efficiency gains in all aspects of its operations.
<P>
	It is most important to note the current mandate review, which 
the minister responsible for Canada Post announced on November 
6 of this year. It has been ten years since the last major review of 
Canada Post. This review will give Canadians a chance to express 
their concerns about the corporation.
<P>
	The review committee will also be analysing the current 
competitive environment of the corporation. The communications 
market has changed dramatically since  the Marchment report, and 
it is time to review the effects on the corporation.
<P>
	The mandate review will also review the functions that Canada 
Post currently carries out and those that should be provided in the 
future. In this regard, I want to deal with the allegations of 
cross-subsidization, which we have heard from couriers and others 
and most recently from the hon. member for Quebec East.
<P>
	Let me emphasize that Canada Post Corporation competes fairly. 
It does not subsidize its services. These allegations have been 
reviewed by both the Bureau of Competition Policy and the 
National Transportation Agency. The Bureau of Competition 
Policy examined concerns with regard to cross-subsidization of 
Canada Post ad mail services with profits from letter mail and 
alleged predatory pricing. The bureau cleared Canada Post of the 
allegations in 1994.
<P>
	The year before that, in 1993, along with the National 
Transportation Agency the bureau also reviewed the corporation's 
acquisition of 75 per cent of Purolator courier and the issues of 
unfair competition and cross-subsidization as they would relate to 
that purchase. The bureau found: ``No grounds to believe that 
cross-subsidization would occur post-merger''.
<P>
	The hon. member putting forward the motion is not aware of the 
many other changes taking place at Canada Post. Canada Post 
knows technological innovation. In a world economy driven by 
ever changing business partnerships and alliances, technological 
innovation and convergence, there remains the crucial need for a 
reliable, efficient, dedicated postal administration.
<P>
	Canadians want a faster, more reliable, and lower cost postal 
administration. Throughout its history Canada has always been 
quick to embrace these demands. Canada Post has worked hard to 
meet its mandate to provide service to every Canadian.
<P>
	Between 1992 and 1994, pieces of mail processed per hour 
increased by 64 per cent. Delivery points per hour increased by 30 
per cent. All this was accomplished with a workforce that was 
reduced by 24 per cent. These are the facts, something the Reform 
Party does not seem to be acquainted with.
<P>
	Since incorporation there have been many innovations Canada 
Post can be very proud of, such as the national control centre, 
which allows end to end monitoring of performance. The first 
system for tracking and tracing also has been developed. This 
system accurately pinpoints the progress of your mail. The 
corporation has also developed a new technology for hybrid 
services, which can electronically send your document, print it, and 
have it mailed. This is available to all Canadians.
<P>
	Would a private corporation offer this accessible service to 
all-I underline all-Canadians? This is something the opposition 
has not considered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16808"> 16808 </A></B>
<P>
	Good service means accessibility to retail services. In the 
mid-1980s Canada Post decided to experiment with franchising 
of postal outlets. This partnership with the private sector has 
resulted in an increased network of outlets where Canada Post 
products and services are available.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The Canada Post retail network currently consists of nearly 
8,000 full service outlets, 4,150 corporate outlets, and more than 
3,400 private sector outlets, supplemented by 11,000 stamp shops 
and agencies. Hours of access to postal products has increased 
substantially, while the cost of operations has been reduced. These 
outlets had a combined earned retail revenue in 1994-95 of $1.8 
billion.
<P>
	The franchising of retail postal services provides key solutions 
to four critical problems that were faced by Canada Post: how to 
obtain necessary capital; how to restructure and expand the retail 
customer service network; how to move quickly to a customer 
focused workforce; and how to reduce the high cost of a corporate 
retail network.
<P>
	The franchising of postal service brought benefits to not only 
Canada Post but, more important, to Canadians, rural and urban. 
Franchising has nearly doubled the size of the postal network, 
offering consumers over 3,000 additional service centres across 
Canada. Canada Post's franchising and retail postal service has 
been a success. It is evident that Canada Post is constantly 
improving and adapting. Why should that be changed?
<P>
	Canada has entered a new electronic era. Should Canada Post be 
involved in this electronic era? In the government's upcoming 
mandate review one of the terms of reference is whether CPC 
should be free to react to advances in technological alternatives to 
mail. If so, what would be the implications for the users, namely 
the government, the public and CPC competitors? This should 
make the opposition happy. We look forward to hearing the results.
<P>
	The future contribution of postal administration in the new 
electronic environment will be contingent on the answers to some 
very basic questions. What is and will be the role for a postal 
administration as a public service? Is there a role for a postal 
administration as an electronics intermediary and as a provider of 
security services in electronic messaging? Can letter mail be 
delivered still faster and more cheaply? How much commercial 
freedom should a postal administration have?
<P>
	The volume of physical mail in Canada is still marginally 
increasing from year to year. However, it will significantly 
decrease as electronic messaging takes hold. Over time, the labour 
intensive infrastructure required to process physical mail will be 
transformed to handle more electronic messaging. The 
transformation from hard copy to electronic will take time, 
however, more than  most people predict, and for good reason. 
There is a multi-million dollar investment in the interlink physical 
mail infrastructures of Canada Post and its customers, and it will 
take an enormous investment to go completely electronic.
<P>
	The immediate future is a bridge the corporation calls hybrid, 
which allows messages to be submitted to CPC electronically, 
travel electronically to the closest point of delivery, then be printed 
and delivered in hard copy. It is in this area that CPC's new 
electronic services are concentrated. It is the belief of many that a 
hybrid environment will be with us for a very long time.
<P>
	Canada Post's concentration on hybrid services is allowing it to 
greatly increase its efficiency. Expansion of these services is vital 
to its customers, not only to contain or reduce costs but to allow the 
transaction of business effectively in a global marketplace using 
electronic data interchange, EDI, and hybrid data interchange, 
HDI. This obvious change in the face of technology has allowed 
Canada Post to remain competitive. Canada Post is doing much 
more than perhaps the hon. member is aware.
<P>
	Business and governments need to share information with their 
clients in the form of documents or reports. Maintaining physical 
copies of documents and distributing them is costly, 
environmentally damaging and does not add value to the economy. 
Working further to reduce costs and speed up delivery, CPC has 
developed a service that stores documents and delivers them 
through a 1-800 telephone line. The documents can be delivered by 
fax, E-mail or regular mail. This service reduces business costs, 
speeds delivery of information and avoids environmental impacts 
of printing and storing an abundance of physical documents.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Canada Post presently has a physical directory of all addresses in 
Canada which it must maintain to deliver mail, including postal 
codes for efficient mail sortation. It is extending this directory to 
include electronic addresses and other information which Canadian 
businesses and governments can access for effective 
communication in the medium of the receiver's choice.
<P>
	This will take the form of hard copy, telephone, fax, computer, 
E-mail, telex and even interactive television in the future. The 
directory will reduce the cost of doing business, improve the speed 
of messaging and enable a sender to reach the receiver regardless 
of technological-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise to speak today on Motion No. 312 tabled by 
the member for Yellowhead which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16809"> 16809 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately take the 
required measures to privatize all operations and services of the Canada Post 
Corporation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The finance minister stated in the last budget speech: ``Our view 
is straightforward. If the government doesn't need to run 
something it shouldn't and in the future it won't''.
<P>
	Motion No. 312 allows the government the opportunity to make 
good on this straightforward point of view. When it comes right 
down to analysing where the government should be involved, 
Canada Post does not rank as a priority.
<P>
	This is an organization that in the view of Professor Robert 
Campbell of Trent University has been ``given a considerable 
amount of space in which to function like a private commercial 
operation and has acted very much like a private sector 
corporation''. Canada Post has therefore illustrated that it is 
capable of providing its existing services as a private sector 
corporation.
<P>
	Traditionally the main argument against the privatization of 
Canada Post is that people see it as the communications link for 
rural areas. This claim is now false. If Canada Post is so committed 
to rural service, why has it either closed or amalgamated 1,700 of 
its rural post offices? The simple answer to the question is that 
Canada Post is behaving like a private corporation. If it were 
privatized and industry as a whole were permitted more market 
freedom, people in rural areas would have greater access to more 
and more delivery companies. Many companies would jump at the 
opportunity to provide full postal services in rural areas.
<P>
	Another weak argument offered against privatization is that 
Canada Post does not receive any federal money for its operations. 
This claim has an element of truth in it. Every year Canada Post 
aims to balance its books and it has been successful in three of the 
last five years in doing so. However the two years that losses were 
recorded added up to just under $400 million in losses and these 
losses were absorbed by the taxpayers.
<P>
	I find the idea of privatizing Canada Post a compelling one. 
Canadians should no longer be asked to bear the burden of 
subsidizing an organization that could operate just as effectively or 
more efficiently if it were in the private sector. Best of all, if this 
were the case, taxpayers would not be shouldering the costs when 
Canada Post records financial losses. These financial losses 
continue despite the fact that Canada Post has invested enormously 
in becoming more efficient and more diverse.
<P>
	I was surprised when I learned that Canada Post owns 75 per cent 
of the courier company Purolator. I was even more surprised when 
I read repeated claims by competitors in the courier industry about 
Canada Post. The competitors claim that Canada Post is using 
revenue generated from ordinary mail to subsidize its courier 
company. It is claimed that this allows Purolator Courier  to offer 
rates that are lower than private sector rates and gives the Canada 
Post-Purolator team an unfair advantage.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	The president of the Canadian Courier Association recently 
claimed: ``There is not a courier in the world who would offer that 
kind of service at that price. Who is paying for that cost? You are if 
you bought a stamp''.
<P>
	Canada Post's competitors claim that if Canada Post is to have 
an unfair advantage then its entire financial record should be made 
public. This would mean that Canada Post should present not only 
its budgetary figures but also how much money is being transferred 
to Purolator? I find the request to be entirely reasonable. If 
taxpayers are subsidizing Purolator they have a right to know the 
exact nature of the financial arrangement these two companies 
share.
<P>
	Canada Post is an enigma, especially to the corporate world. On 
one hand it operates as a crown corporation with a mandate to 
provide universal postal service to all Canadians. On the other hand 
it operates as a ruthless competitor expanding into the courier 
industry while possessing a legislative monopoly on first class 
mail. In other words Canada Post enjoys all the benefits and 
security of a crown corporation with government protection and 
government backing while it conducts itself as though it were a 
private sector organization.
<P>
	Canada Post should no longer enjoy this advantage. It should 
have it one way or the other. A spokesman for the United Parcel 
Service, UPS, recently said: ``We are not seeking the abolishment 
of the post office. Our goal is that the playing field should be 
levelled''.
<P>
	Another area that competitors claim is not on a level playing 
field is the business of delivering unaddressed mail, advertising 
flyers or junk mail. When Canada Post created its so-called ad mail 
program to distribute third class mail, it knocked many small 
distributors right out of the industry. The ones that are left face an 
unfair advantage.
<P>
	By Canada Post's own estimates, the number of delivered flyers 
jumped from 1.8 billion pieces in 1987 to 4.4 billion in 1994. This 
represents an increase of 144 per cent. This would not be all bad 
except Canada Post only reported a 63 per cent increase in revenue 
from this service.
<P>
	Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> columnist Peter Hadekel recently commented: 
``Canada's Post's own numbers show that its cost per thousand 
flyers delivered fell 33 per cent, a clear indication it has been 
cutting prices to build volume''. Once again Canada Post is using 
this diversity within the protection of a crown corporation to create 
a monopoly in another area. Taxpayers have the right to know how 
the financial structure of Canada Post works and how it is using this 
advantage unfairly.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16810"> 16810 </A></B>
<P>
	Despite the closure of over 1,000 rural area post offices Canada 
Post is the largest franchise chain in Canada. It is the 28th largest 
corporation in the nation. It has the potential to grow even 
stronger. Canada Post would have no problem finding investors 
and would, if privatized, be able to provide the same service it 
does now, and perhaps more efficiently in the competition of the 
open market.
<P>
	In many ways Canada Post already operates as a private 
organization. It rented a $200,000 private sky box in Toronto's 
SkyDome. It may be an acceptable practice in the corporate world, 
but during a time when the government is trying to reduce 
expenditures and debt it is absolutely unreasonable for a crown 
corporation. I do not feel comfortable telling the people of my 
riding of Cariboo-Chilcotin that we must make sacrifices to 
reduce the debt while Canada Post executives have this kind of 
government guaranteed luxury at all Blue Jay games.
<P>
	If privatized Canada Post would do fine on its own and 
Canadians would still enjoy good postal service by whoever 
provides it.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	Next August Parliament will see the results of a major review 
that has recently been ordered. It is my hope that it will not be just a 
cosmetic review to appease the concerns of Canada Post 
competitors. The editor of the St. Albert <I>Gazette</I> near Edmonton 
recently stated: ``Are they going to be able to dig into Canada 
Post's affairs or will they be stonewalled like everyone else before 
them? Canada Post likes to keep business to itself''.
<P>
	The time has come for Parliament to recognize that Canada Post 
can do well as a private corporation and that it needs a more level 
playing field in the postal industry for the benefit of all Canadians. 
As I have said, Canada Post likes to keep business to itself. As a 
private corporation Canada Post can still freely keep to itself but 
only if it can beat the competition.
<P>
	I ask members to support the motion and to realize this is a start 
in the most logical direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
know we are in trouble when we see Liberals defending Canada 
Post. In the few minutes remaining I should like to deal with the 
mandate of Canada Post. Its mandate should be to deliver letters 
efficiently and cost effectively. That is the bottom line. Why it is in 
the courier business is a bit of a conundrum because it is using the 
postal rates to justify and undercut private courier businesses.
<P>
	I must commend the government for its timely and upcoming 
review of Canada Post. However once we have the review I would 
then hold the government accountable to looking into the review 
and making some major changes such as changes in access to 
information.
<P>
	Crown corporations are presently exempt from access to 
information requests. As such Canada Post is exempt. We cannot 
get an access to information request from Canada Post because it is 
exempt, as are other crown corporations. This is basically wrong. 
How are Canadians supposed to find out and figure out what is 
wrong with their crown corporations including Canada Post when 
they cannot get the basic information?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is taxpayers' money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> ``It is taxpayers' money'', as my colleague says. 
Why can we not see the records?
<P>
	I support my colleague's move to privatize Canada Post. I look 
forward to the review to see which direction the country will go 
with its postal system and hold the government accountable for 
listening to what Canadians say.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are a few minutes remaining in the 
debate. If the proposer of the motion, the hon member for 
Yellowhead, wishes to summarize he is allowed to do so under our 
standing orders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleagues for supporting the motion. I urge the government to 
look carefully at it and in its review come forward with some of its 
suggestions and recommendations.

	The House resumed from November 24, 1995 consideration of

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent. The hon. 
member for Erie has the floor from the last time. He has 15 minutes 
remaining for debate, if he wishes to take advantage of having the 
floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a few 
remarks to wind up my address to the House.
<P>
	Bill C-100 takes important steps to ensure that Canada's 
financial institutions enjoy effective, independent corporate 
government yet allows OSFI to intervene in the composition of 
senior management and boards when the institution is experiencing 
financial difficulty. Clearly it is often when institutions encounter 
financial trouble that management and boards need to be carefully 
scrutinized.
<P>
	The current minimum one-third of unaffiliated or independent 
directors sitting on the board of a financial institution will no 
longer be permitted to hold a seat on the board of their unregulated 
parent. This will help ensure that there are directors of institutions 
who will focus on the institutions' interests alone. This measure 
will be particularly important for ensuring independence and 
objectivity in the management of institutions in trouble.
<P>
	For institutions that are in trouble, the legislation will empower 
the superintendent to veto the appointment of directors and senior 
officers of that institution. This is a very limited provision as it 
applies only at the appointment stage and only when the institution 
is in financial trouble.
<P>
	Incidentally, a similar authority exists in the United States. It is 
an important power since the institution in trouble needs to rely on 
its board to make important decisions about the future of the 
company.
<P>
	My remarks so far have focused on the measures to give OSFI 
further power to enhance the quality of corporate governance. It is 
also important to note that this legislation recognizes that effective 
corporate governance is not just one-sided.
<P>
	We should appreciate that Bill C-100 includes measures that will 
help boards perform the all important function of overseeing 
management. An example is the guidelines for supervisory 
interventions that are being set out. These guidelines identify four 
stages of increasing intervention available to the superintendent, 
culminating in the power to close an institution.
<P>
	By knowing what stage their company is in and the penalties 
involved, directors will have both a tracking measure and a set-up 
to guide their dealings with management.
<P>
	As well, the legislation includes providing the Canadian Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, CDIC, with the authority to apply varying 
deposit insurance premiums based on risk factors. This too will act 
as a source of information for directors who will be free to inquire 
why their institution may be paying more than the base rate.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	I have covered a fair amount of ground. I will close by putting 
the legislation into context as I see it.
<P>
	Bill C-100 is being put forward for the continuing success of a 
supervisory and regulatory system which must evolve with market 
trends and respond to current experience both here and in the rest of 
the world. The thrust of the legislation clearly is safety and 
soundness. These improvements in safety and soundness build on 
the recent Canadian experience with financial institutions that have 
failed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16812"> 16812 </A></B>
<P>
	By giving our approval to Bill C-100, we will be honouring a 
responsibility to help maintain what is truly a world class financial 
system. This is a goal we can all support irrespective of partisan 
politics. I urge all members of the House of Commons to support 
Bill C-100.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to enter the debate on Bill C-100. This bill is 
designed to bring about certain changes and make some 
amendments to the Trust Companies Act, the Interest Act and so 
on. I want to address this in the context of what is happening in the 
financial world in Canada today.
<P>
	About 10 years ago legislation was passed in the House which 
actually eliminated the four pillars of Canada's financial 
institutions. I will review briefly what that was all about. We know 
that the four pillars which existed were the banks, the trust 
companies, the insurance companies and the investment 
companies, or investment dealers as they are more commonly 
known today.
<P>
	The provisions in the past were that the banks took deposits, 
made loans and had financial interaction with their customers. The 
ownership of the banks was restricted to 10 per cent. No one person 
or group could own more than 10 per cent of a bank.
<P>
	The trust companies were another pillar. They were allowed to 
hold property in trust for others. They could hold shares, bonds and 
real estate. Often they exercised the prerogative and in fact did take 
the fiduciary responsibility to manage the portfolios of individuals, 
particularly widows, children, orphans, and other people who did 
not want to look after their own portfolios. It restricted very much 
the kinds of things the trust companies could do. For example, the 
trust companies could not lend out more money than they actually 
had on deposit. They also were limited in the kinds of loans they 
could give. For instance, they were excluded for many years from 
lending out under the Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
	The insurance companies, the third pillar, were divided into two 
sections: the life insurance section, and the property and casualty 
section. The life insurance companies were there to provide life 
insurance policies and annuities for people who wanted payment in 
perpetuity. The property and casualty insurance companies dealt 
with the liabilities that might be incurred toward individuals. They 
also insured the physical properties, buildings in most cases and 
vehicles and other equipment.
<P>
	The fourth pillar was the investment companies. The investment 
companies were the underwriters of equity shares. They also 
helped to distribute those particular shares once they were issued. 
They also underwrote debentures and limited partnerships and 
made a market for these particular securities. They acted nationally 
and  internationally so that individuals who wanted to sell shares 
internationally could do that.
<P>
	In 1987 these pillars came apart. They were changed. The 
legislation allowed the banks to own trust companies, the banks to 
own insurance companies and the banks to own investment dealers. 
The independence which was guaranteed before was now 
amalgamated under one piece of legislation. The insurance 
companies also took advantage of those changes. They bought trust 
companies and in some cases the established banks. They also got 
into the mutual fund distribution business.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Why did it happen? It happened because the insurance 
companies and banks are the two big giants in the financial 
institutions. They command the largest proportion of the money 
that is managed in our financial world. The banks wanted access to 
the huge funds of money the insurance companies had and of 
course the insurance companies wanted to keep them out.
<P>
	There was a real conflict going on at that time. The insurance 
companies finally agreed to let the banks buy insurance companies. 
That made it possible for the banks to actually own an insurance 
company, but they could not distribute the insurance through their 
branches.
<P>
	Actually, the very thing the insurance companies wanted to 
prevent they ended up not preventing. Now the only difference is 
the bank cannot really distribute it through their branch network. I 
will talk about that in more detail later.
<P>
	I will briefly focus on the concentration of the financial interests 
that has come into an increasingly small group. Fewer and fewer 
companies actually manage more and more of the financial assets 
in Canada. That is really what has happened here. I want to bring 
this into a more detailed focus as I get toward the end of my speech.
<P>
	The policy paper was presented by the Secretary of State for 
Financial Institutions when he appeared before the Senate 
committee in August. He said he intended to release a policy paper 
sometime early in 1996 which would deal with these four financial 
institutions under the Trust Companies Act, the Loans Act, the 
Investment Companies Act and the Bank Act.
<P>
	The secretary of state wants to release that in the early part of 
1996. That policy paper would then be followed by further 
consultation before we table legislation for passage early in 1997 
which has to do with a total review of the Financial Institutions 
Act. He said: ``I want to act now on the issues included in Bill 
C-100 because the legislation enhances the safety and soundness of 
the system. When steps can be taken to improve on it to diminish 
risk, I believe it is important to get on with those changes right 
away''.
<P>
	It is pretty hard to argue against that, except that we are now at 
the end of November. This statement was  made in August. The bill 
is before the House. In the early part of 1996 there is to be this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16813"> 16813 </A></B>
<P>
policy paper, yet we have something that is supposed to be acted on 
right now.
<P>
	I warn the secretary of state and the government that to make the 
kinds of changes that are being proposed in this legislation will 
affect other legislation. I am convinced it will affect the overall 
review that will take place in 1997.
<P>
	What is the big hurry now? We are not even seven weeks away 
from 1996 and we are faced with supposedly some kind of an 
emergency. I submit there is no emergency. There is no urgency to 
get this done right now.
<P>
	Some people will say that this is actually to come to grips with a 
big problem we had last year when Confederation Life went down. 
What is really involved here is that this is a very subtle way to get 
us ready for that continued erosion of the distinction between the 
financial pillars. It will have the effect of drawing more and more 
power into the hands of fewer and fewer financial institutions, 
namely the banks.
<P>
	I will get into the Confederation Life matter in greater detail 
because it is this concentration of power that creates some 
difficulties. For example, the Confederation Life people bought 
trust companies and through that trust company they developed 
what would easily be characterized as an imprudent portfolio. It 
was imprudent from the point of view that it was overextended in a 
particular sector.
<P>
	My understanding is that the former Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions did tell the Standing Committee on Industry that he had 
warned that particular institution that it was over extended in the 
real estate market. But what did he do? Nothing. What did the 
company do? Nothing.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Some people would argue it is more poor management than an 
imprudent portfolio. Imprudent portfolio, poor management, 
whatever the case, the issue is there was legislative provision that 
allowed a concentration and overextension that was never the 
intention of the original legislation but nevertheless was the effect 
of it. That is precisely the danger we are running into here.
<P>
	Suppose one of our chartered banks today were to go down. 
Imagine the implications that would have across the country. 
Within that context let us now look at the provisions in Bill C-100. 
In particular, I want to look at the Office of the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions.
<P>
	In this context I would refer to exactly what the purpose of the 
bill is. It is to amend the Bank Act, the Co-operative Credit 
Associations Act, the Insurance Act, and the Trust and Loan 
Companies Act, dealing with the disclosure of information, the 
elimination of appeals in  relation to certain matters, the 
disqualification of persons from becoming office holders of an 
institution, the taking of control of an institution by the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions, and changes to the duties 
of the superintendent.
<P>
	Then there are amendments to the Winding-up Act respecting 
the circumstances and procedures for winding up an institution and 
the revised part III dealing with the restructuring of insurance 
companies and amendments to the Canada Deposit Insurance 
Corporations Act concerning the business affairs of the 
corporation, the restructuring of the institutions by means of 
divesting of shares and the corporation becoming a receiver, the 
assessment and collection of deposit insurance premiums, and the 
enforcement of the act.
<P>
	What are some of these details? I refer to clause 81:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The Governor in Council may make regulations and the Superintendent 
may make guidelines respecting the maintenance by life companies and 
societies of adequate capital-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Okay, let us keep that in mind.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) Notwithstanding that a life company or society is complying with 
regulations or guidelines made under subsection (2), the Superintendent may, 
by order, direct the company or society</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) to increase its capital; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) to provide additional liquidity in such forms and amounts as the 
Superintendent may require.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Does anybody need any more authority than that to run a 
company? The whole company could be run with those two 
phrases.
<P>
	Then the bill goes on to state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Governor in Council may make regulations and the Superintendent may 
make guidelines respecting the maintenance by property and casualty 
companies of assets of a particular value.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is again a direct imposition. In fact the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions can get into the exact management now of the 
company itself:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Notwithstanding that a property and casualty company is complying with 
regulations or guidelines made under subsection (2), the Superintendent may, 
by order, direct the company to increase its assets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Furthermore:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A company may then enter into a transaction with a related party of a 
company if the Superintendent, by order, has exempted the transaction from the 
provisions of section 521.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We want to put this into the context of clause 93, because we 
recognize how significant the powers of the superintendent are in 
determining the assets of a company, to increase its financial 
situation, to look at the ownership of property of the company. Now 
let us get a good view of what else happens here:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Superintendent shall disclose, at such times and in such manner as the Minister 
may determine, such information obtained by the Superintendent under this Act as the </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16814"> 16814 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Minister  considers ought to be disclosed for the purposes of the analysis of the 
financial condition of a company, society, foreign company or provincial 
company-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Good, we will say, that is fine; there is nothing wrong with that. I 
agree. It goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-and that</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) is contained in returns filed pursuant to the Superintendent's financial 
regulatory reporting requirements in respect of companies, societies, foreign 
companies or provincial companies; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) has been obtained as a result of an industry-wide or sectoral survey 
conducted by the Superintendent in relation to an issue or circumstances that 
could have an impact on the financial condition of companies, societies, 
foreign companies or provincial companies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Now comes the key part. We notice that the superintendent can 
do these things but subject to the minister's approval. The second 
clause states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister shall consult with the Superintendent before making any 
determination under subsection (1).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What has happened here? We have the minister deciding in the 
first instance what the superintendent should do and what kinds of 
information can be collected, and then before he can have any 
discussions or make any public pronouncements he has to go back 
and consult with the superintendent before he can do that. Who is 
in charge here?
<P>
	The person in charge here is the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions. The Minister of Finance, who is to be looking after the 
financial affairs of this country on behalf of the people and who the 
Prime Minister has entrusted with this particular portfolio, is now 
having his hands virtually tied by the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions, a bureaucrat who has been appointed by the minister.
<P>
	These kinds of provisions are not for the health of this country.
<P>
	I draw the attention of the House to the exact powers and objects 
of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. The 
objects are to supervise financial institutions in order to determine 
whether they are in a sound financial condition and are complying 
with their governing statute law and supervisory requirements 
under that law; to promptly advise the management and board of 
directors of a financial institution in the event that the institution is 
not in sound financial condition or is not complying with its 
governing statute law or supervisory requirements under that law 
and in such a case to take or require the management or board to 
take the necessary corrective measures or series of measures to 
deal with the situation in an expeditious manner; and to promote 
the adoption of management and boards of directors of financial 
institutions of policies and procedures designed to control and 
manage risk.
<P>
	That is good. A further object is to monitor and evaluate 
system-wide or electoral events and issues that may have a 
negative impact on the financial condition of financial institutions. 
That is good. Further, in pursuing its objectives the office shall 
strive to protect the rights and interests of depositors, policy 
holders, and creditors of financial institutions, having due regard to 
the need to allow financial institutions to compete effectively and 
take reasonable risks. We would say that is just great, and I agree.
<P>
	Notwithstanding that the regulations and supervision of financial 
institutions by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions can reduce the risk that financial institutions will fail, 
regulation and supervision must be carried out having regard for 
the fact that boards of directors are responsible for the management 
of financial institutions. Financial institutions carry on business in 
a competitive environment that necessitates the management of 
risk, and financial institutions can experience financial difficulties 
that can lead to their failure.
<P>
	He is supposed to do all these wonderful things and then in the 
final analysis he is given the power to intervene, to get involved in 
the actual management of a company. Then in the final section it 
says that if things go wrong it is not his fault. I think the bureaucrat 
wrote this, because he is totally absolved on these things.
<P>
	We are dealing with the trust and the faith that individuals have 
in financial institutions. I have no difficulty in recognizing that the 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions is a very 
important office. It has been given extensive powers. But in the 
final analysis, who is accountable?
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	We have to come to grips with this. We need to know all the 
secrets. In all the texts I read there is no obligation to make those 
kinds of things public. I want to get into the Canada Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, because it is here that it becomes even more 
significant.
<P>
	The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation guarantees the first 
$60,000 deposited in a financial institution that is covered under 
that particular act. This is a great provision, but I want to take a 
look at some of the experiences.
<P>
	This particular corporation was set up in 1967. There were no 
bank failures prior to 1967. Since 1967 there have been 30 failures 
of financial institutions, 20 of them in the last 10 years. The CDIC 
has now paid out a total of about $5 billion and owes the federal 
treasury $1.7 billion as of March 1994. It may be a little more than 
that, about $1.745 billion if my memory serves me correctly.
<P>
	The provisions of this act are very noble. People want to know 
that their deposits are insured. However, it has had some very 
interesting effects. Financial institutions  did not fail before but 
have failed since. Why? There are pretty obvious things, but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16815"> 16815 </A></B>
<P>
nobody can prove them. It reduces the incentive of a financial 
institution to look after the deposits up to $60,000. They can be 
reckless or risky because that money is not going to come out of 
their pockets. The first $60,000 will be paid by the Canada Deposit 
Insurance Corporation.
<P>
	There is also no incentive on the part of the depositor to look 
around to find which of the financial institutions is the soundest. 
They look to see which institution is to pay the best return on their 
money after it is deposited. That becomes the issue, and not the 
soundness of the financial institution.
<P>
	There are some interesting things that can be looked at here. The 
insurance premium the institution pays to the Canada Deposit 
Insurance Company should be commensurate with the risk incurred 
by placing these deposits in certain kinds of ways. The act does go 
that way up to a point. It states, for instance, that financial 
institutions will pay $5,000 as a base and after that I believe it is a 
fraction of a percentage, based on the total of the money that is on 
deposit. That is great, except that the minister, without telling 
anyone, has the right to reduce that rate.
<P>
	The other part of this is that the rate the institution has to pay for 
its premium to be insured by this company is secret. This means 
that on the one hand we have the financial institution paying a 
premium that is somewhat commensurate with the risk involved, 
but the person who deposits does not know what it is. So he has no 
way of telling whether this financial institution is a sounder one 
than the other one.
<P>
	I believe there are some very serious shortcomings in this act. If 
we really wanted to get serious about this act we should think about 
such a thing as a co-insurance plan of some kind. An individual 
who is depositing his money into a particular institution knows it is 
insured up to $60,000 but with a deductible. The individual will 
have the responsibility to put it with an institution that will insure 
his or her deposit for the full $60,000. If the Canada Deposit 
Insurance Corporation insures it for up to $58,000, the financial 
institution will give the other $2,000 with no penalty.
<P>
	An institution could also state it is going to be paying 12 per cent 
on your deposit, CDIC covers a major part of it and it will cover 
part of it, but because this is going to be a high return you are 
eligible for $1,000 or $2,000 deduction. So there is a co-insurance 
plan here, which will provide the incentive to the financial 
institution to manage the money well or to at least let the individual 
know where the risk is in that particular deposit.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Second, that individual will say: ``If I am to get a higher rate of 
return from this institution, I also need to carry some of the risk''. 
There has to be responsibility in  those particular areas. There are 
major concerns about the proposed amendments to this legislation.
<P>
	I want to move now to another part of the review of financial 
institutions which has to do with the concentration of power to 
which I alluded before. The four pillars have, to a large degree, 
been eroded. It is my suspicion that the review in 1997 will erode 
them even more.
<P>
	I draw attention in particular to the big fight now being displayed 
in the newspapers, financial papers and other media between the 
insurance companies and the banks. The insurance companies are 
saying: ``You are not going to sell our product through your 
network''. The banks are saying: ``If we can own the insurance 
company, we want the authority and the power to do that''. The 
fight is on.
<P>
	A lot of problems are associated with the concentration of power, 
one of which I want to detail. That has to do with conflict of 
interest. I am going to take my example not from the insurance area 
but from the investment business. The investment companies have 
the opportunity to underwrite shares for an issue. I will use as an 
example the privatization of CN Rail. This share issue is 
underwritten by a number of investment dealers. Who owns the 
investment dealers? The banks, with a few exceptions. They 
underwrite the issue. However, some people are going to borrow 
money to buy those shares. Who will lend them the money to buy 
those shares? The banks.
<P>
	There is a projection that the investment dealers of Canada are 
going to have an extraordinary year. They will have great profits 
this year. Guess what the main contributing factor was on ``Canada 
AM'' report this morning. The privatization of CN Rail.
<P>
	This is very interesting. It is a very cosy arrangement. A crown 
corporation is in the process of privatizing. The underwriters are 
investment dealers who are, to a large degree, owned by the 
banking community. The banking community will, through its 
subsidiaries, show a tremendous profit. The banks will earn 
approximately $5 billion this year and, as well, the investment 
dealers will realize a terrific return.
<P>
	The banks are also saying they want to sell the insurance product 
because it will give them more money. Associated with that money 
comes a far more significant issue, of which I am most fearful, 
which is the concentration of power. When a few people can decide 
where the money is going to be applied and how it is going to be 
invested, that is too much power in the hands of too few people. 
That is my big concern.
<P>
	Every effort should be made to balance this situation very 
carefully. We must not run into this situation without being very 
clear about the implications.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16816"> 16816 </A></B>
<P>
	Comparisons will inevitably be made by the banking 
community. The banks will argue that they should have the service 
because to be competitive globally they have to be able to sell 
insurance. Let us look at this situation.
<P>
	Approximately 2,000 banks operate in France, while in Germany 
there are 4,600 licensed banks. With such intense competition it is 
difficult for a European bank to cross-subsidize its entry into the 
insurance business. That situation cannot be compared to the one 
that exists in Canada. To use that argument is not only specious but 
misleading. We have to be very very careful not to get sucked into 
that kind of situation.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	To suggest the banks are going to take control is rather easy to 
understand. In 1992 reforms gave the chartered banks unrestricted 
powers to own trust companies. A few years later, what portion of 
the trust business is now in the banks? Almost all of it. Less than 
three years after the 1992 financial institution reforms came into 
effect only two independent trust companies of any size remained 
in the business. The danger of banks cross-subsidizing their entry 
into other financial services is that it is provoking a reduction in 
competition for consumers.
<P>
	Probably the most vicious argument is that all this entry into the 
marketing of insurance through the branch network is in the 
consumers' interests because they will have one stop shopping. 
That may be convenient, but will the consumer get the best advice? 
Will the consumer get the best price? Will the best interests of the 
consumer be served? That ought to be the consideration, not 
whether the consumer can do it all in one place. If the customer 
gets a bum deal in one place, it is a bum deal regardless of the fact 
that it was very convenient to do it in that place. That becomes our 
concern.
<P>
	We need to make sure the power is balanced, that we have a 
separation so the people's best interests not only now, but in the 
long term, are looked after as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
contribution on a very important issue.
<P>
	It is important for members of the House and the public to know 
that the critic for industry from the Reform Party has been working 
very hard in committee over the last two years on the whole issue 
of access to capital for small businessmen and women. The issue 
we are debating today is very important for that whole small 
business market.
<P>
	We have been trying to the best of our ability in a non-partisan 
way to try to change the thought processes of the banks in their 
attitudes toward small business. Frankly, after two years despite a 
bunch of PR from the banks we have not accomplished a lot.
<P>
	Does the member not fear or have concern that those million 
small businessmen and women out there who  depend by and large 
on that relationship with their branch managers will once again lose 
leverage with their financial institution because once they take on 
the insurance component of a business relationship, that small 
business will have no other place to deal than with the bank? If that 
relationship is not solid then that small businessman's or 
businesswoman's whole equation is in jeopardy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent question. I would 
like to divide my answer into three parts.
<P>
	The first part has to do with whether the businessman is going to 
feel coerced into buying the product the banker is shoving down his 
throat. The question then becomes is the bank in this instance 
acting as a broker for a variety of insurance companies or is it 
going to be presenting its own insurance company which it owns? 
Talk about a conflict of interest; there it is.
<P>
	The second part concerns whether the individual gets the best 
possible premium rate. The individual, in order to get the loan 
through, will buy the insurance as well at the same time.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	The third point is that recently the banking community had a 
study done on its branch network. It seems to me that both in the 
United States and here in Canada the conclusion was and the 
recommendation was to reduce the number of branches. That 
network, which is supposed to be this great fanning out, is actually 
going to go the other way.
<P>
	I do not think that businessmen or individuals are going to be 
served as well as they are today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in debate on Bill C-100. I am going 
to bring something a little different to this debate. I take my hon. 
colleague's comments very much to heart. This debate has been 
well motivated by the very best spirit of Parliament to try to bring 
all kinds of light to a very important piece of legislation before the 
House.
<P>
	I have listened very carefully to the debate. We are dealing with 
the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and the 
Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation. I will confine my 
remarks primarily to the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions because this legislation is designed to enhance the 
protection of the assets of ordinary people. This is the kind of 
legislation that Parliament and the government should be all about. 
I believe it is exactly that.
<P>
	Small people put their life savings into financial institutions 
which are regulated by the Government of Canada. We must at all 
costs ensure that their deposits are safe. This legislation builds on 
earlier legislation, primarily because we have seen some 
unfortunate  incidents in the financial marketplace of late. I am 
thinking of the collapse of Confederation Life and the earlier 
difficulties with other institutions. Certainly the depositors and the 
investors in these organizations were paid back. Nevertheless, a 
question of confidence arose from these eventualities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16817"> 16817 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-100 is an effort to address this problem of confidence. In a 
nutshell the legislation gives a mandate to the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions to investigate, along with 
various other things.
<P>
	I am very interested in this legislation because it is a model for 
what can be done in other sectors. It is a model for what can be 
done in the not for profit sector.
<P>
	It is well known that I am an MP who has shown a great deal of 
interest in the regulation of charities and non-profit organizations, 
which currently are, basically, very poorly regulated now. They are 
controlled by a hodge-podge of legislation here and there, court 
precedents and that kind of thing. Yet the not for profit sector 
represents about $120 billion of revenue a year going in and out of 
these organizations.
<P>
	On the other hand, deposits of around $600 million are covered 
by Bill C-100. We have comparable huge industries, one that is 
subject to very fine regulation now, one that does not have very 
much regulation.
<P>
	I would like to go through Bill C-100 and put it up against what I 
would like to see happen with the not for profit sector.
<P>
	First, Bill C-100 gives a mandate to the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions. In effect, it lays out the 
rules. It says this organization can investigate and monitor all 
institutions that are in the business of taking deposits from ordinary 
citizens. We would like to see with the not for profit sector a charity 
commissioner with a similar mandate, which incidentally does not 
exist at this time.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-100 also adds something that is vitally important and very 
near and dear to my heart. It enhances disclosure. The public 
throughout Canada is demanding that institutions be more 
transparent than they have been hitherto. To give the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions the ability to track what is 
happening in deposit organizations Bill C-100 requires a higher 
level of disclosure.
<P>
	For example, it requires all deposit institutions to disclose their 
balance sheets in much more enhanced detail than is defined by 
regulation. It requires the disclosure of executive salaries. That is a 
favourite issue with me because executive compensation is not a 
matter of privacy when dealing with the public trust. It is a way of 
determining whether the executives of an organization who have 
the public trust are acting in the public's best  interest. In other 
words one of the most instant signals of trouble with an institution 
is a very high executive salary and very low results on the balance 
sheets.
<P>
	Bill C-100 requires an enhanced level of disclosure of the assets 
and liabilities of deposit taking institutions. Some of my colleagues 
feel that is an invasion of the central government into the affairs of 
an organization. Indeed it may be a provincial organization such as 
the caisses populaires in Quebec.
<P>
	Nevertheless if we are to know what is happening we need the 
details. It requires an enhanced monitoring of assets and liabilities. 
I can compare that with non-profit organizations and say that it 
would be an enormous step forward if the public had access to the 
details of how non-profit organizations are spending their money 
and what are their assets. Presently no such regime exists for 
non-profit organizations. As such, for charities it is very restrictive 
in its level of public disclosure.
<P>
	Bill C-100, however, would give all this to the public so that 
everyone could see what is happening, including the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions. This is the most 
important.
<P>
	Bill C-100 defines the role of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions as his office monitors deposit taking organizations. 
There is a whole schedule of warning bells. Certain things happen. 
Certain things appear on the books. The Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions will ask questions. If further problems occur 
the questions will be more probing. They will go deeper and 
deeper. There is a whole schedule of early warning levels for the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions.
<P>
	The organization knows the benchmarks at each level, the 
benchmarks going down as it gets into trouble. It knows what to 
expect, what it has to give, and what is expected of it by the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions. Bill C-100 lays out very 
clearly what will happen when there is a crisis and what are the 
steps if an organization is deemed to be in significant trouble, for 
example if its liabilities exceed its assets or that kind of thing.
<P>
	I can compare with charities and non-profit organizations and 
say that is precisely what we want with charities and non-profit 
organizations that also have the public trust and are in effect 
chartered by the government. They ought to be able to convince the 
public that they are using the money wisely and well.
<P>
	When it is determined that a deposit taking organization is in a 
sorry state financially, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions can move in to take over. Basically it will dismember 
the organization or sell it.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	We need the same for the not for profit sector. Right now if a 
charity is deemed to be in trouble it is a painful  and difficult 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16818"> 16818 </A></B>
<P>
process to take it out of action no matter how extraordinary its 
failure is. In the case of not for profit organizations there is no real 
legislation to take them out of the picture at all if they have 
problems. We only find out about the problems when they get into 
such difficulty that it hits the news or if there is a criminal or 
extraordinary charge. Otherwise secrecy is the order of the day 
with respect to charities and non-profit organizations.
<P>
	Bill C-100 applies transparency and a whole regime of what to 
do when organizations that have the public trust get into trouble. 
There is a series of regulations to look after the problem. I wish the 
revenue minister and the finance minister would take note of the 
structure and effectiveness of Bill C-100.
<P>
	One problem of the not for profit sector is that it has been 
unregulated for many years. The problem of bringing in legislation 
to control it seems insuperable. However Bill C-100 is the model 
that could be used to set up a charity commissioner or a not for 
profit commissioner who would bring the entire $120 billion sector 
under regulation and into transparency so that public confidence in 
charities and not for profit organizations could be restored.
<P>
	My comments will be in another direction temporarily. I listened 
with great attention to the debate on the bill in the House last 
Friday. I was struck by the comments of Bloc Quebecois and 
Reform Party members who tend to be opposed to the bill. At one 
point the Liberal member for Willowdale stood and with great 
passion complained that the opposition to the bill of the Bloc 
Quebecois, and to some degree the Reform Party, was as a result of 
their separatist leanings.
<P>
	I listened with great attention to what I heard from the Bloc and 
the Reform Party and I did not hear separatism so much as I heard 
provincialism. I heard from the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform 
Party about the fundamental problem with Confederation. There is 
always a tension between the federal government in the central 
power and the provincial powers. The provinces are always looking 
for more power and saying: ``You are intruding into our affairs''. 
This is natural and normal aspect of Canada as we know it today. It 
is a pity that the Bloc Quebecois translates provincialism into 
separatism. Bill C-100 clearly illustrates why federalism works and 
why provincialism in this case should not be the order of the day.
<P>
	I will explain myself. Certain aspects of our political life occur 
at a provincial or municipal level. At that level politicians are 
normally taken up by local needs, almost selfish needs. It is very 
difficult sometimes for local politicians to look at the grand scheme 
of things when they have local community and provincial concerns 
to look at. This was illustrated last week by a Reform Party motion 
dealing with the suggestion that the federal government should 
force municipalities to provide better  sewage treatment rather than 
dumping effluent into the seas. It was a classic case of where it was 
easier for the municipality to use its taxes on things that matter to 
its people locally rather than to worry about the environmental 
aspects of a problem being caused to the country at large or the 
world at large.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	So it is with financial institutions, with charities and non-profit 
organizations. The need for central regulation of charities and 
non-profit organizations is amply illustrated by the example of the 
Nanaimo Holding Society in British Columbia that is under 
investigation for suspicion of having diverted charity funds to the 
provincial NDP of British Columbia. Without commenting on 
where that investigation will go, it is the kind of reason we need 
arm's length regulation of public institutions with the public trust.
<P>
	At the provincial level or the municipal level these organizations 
may be subject to undue political influence. If there is something 
like the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions that 
can look from afar at an organization and be out of reach of local 
politicians we are better guaranteed that the public trust is being 
served by the organization. The warning will be sounded by an 
organization that has no axe to grind or has no involvement in the 
institution.
<P>
	The classic example was during the recent referendum when it 
was claimed that the caisse populaire was supporting the Canadian 
dollar. We learned from the caisse subsequently that it was not 
doing any such thing. Nor should it. It is a classic reason for 
needing an organization like the Office of the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions. If undue influence were exerted by the local 
political power, be it the province or the municipality, control 
would be in an arm's length organization that exists outside the 
zone of political interference.
<P>
	Quebec and the caisse benefit from federalism because of an 
organization like the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions. The benefit is even greater because all deposit taking 
organizations are dependent on the rest of the country for the 
confidence the public has in them.
<P>
	Let us just suppose that every banking institution, every deposit 
taking institution were separately administered in each province, as 
I suspect has been suggested by the Reform Party. We would not 
have the level of confidence in the institutions that we have when 
people in Quebec or British Columbia, for example, know that the 
institution is subject to the same rules of transparency, openness 
and honesty across the country from sea to sea. It does not matter 
whether the organization is in Quebec or in Nova Scotia. Because 
we have organizations like the Office of the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions, Canadians from sea to sea can have 
confidence in their institutions.
<P>

	Bill C-100 deserves the support of the entire House regardless 
of our individual viewpoints on centralized government or 
decentralized government. This legislation serves us all regardless 
of our political viewpoints. It serves the ordinary person.
<P>
	I should like to discuss the bill at great length but I know my 
time is up. It is the kind of legislation which makes federalism 
work and of which I am proud as a member of the government.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will take 
advantage of the opportunity afforded by the debate on Bill C-100 
to draw the attention of this House to the inconsistencies and poor 
decision-making that undermine the very foundation of the 
federation.
<P>
	I have had an opportunity during the past thirty years to observe, 
as many of us have, the evolution of Canadian federalism. A 
system based on certain relations between the federal government 
and the provinces, federalism has never been able to settle the issue 
of Quebec, Quebec which has the largest national minority in 
Canada. The Fathers of Confederation designed a system of 
government in which the provinces maintained a large measure of 
autonomy. In the twentieth century, two world wars, the emergence 
of the welfare state and the modernization of institutions as part of 
today's worldwide trend towards globalization gave the central 
government a chance to intervene increasingly in the 
administration of the provinces.
<P>
	This normal development in a country whose geography was 
continental in size was never well received by the Quebec 
government which, for most French Canadians and later 
Quebecers, had always come first. Any attempt or decision made 
by the government in Ottawa to improve the way this country was 
governed has always been perceived by successive governments in 
Quebec as an encroachment on the prerogatives of the Quebec 
National Assembly.
<P>
	The sovereignty plus partnership proposal of Quebec 
sovereignists constitutes the only concrete and realistic initiative to 
get out of the vicious circle that has poisoned the existence of this 
beautiful and great country that is Canada. Yes, Canada is an 
exceptional country. Although the current state of its public 
finances has prevented it from developing its full potential, this is 
due to the legacy left by former Prime Minister Trudeau and to the 
inept financial management of the present Prime Minister who was 
then Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Under his stewardship, the deficit rose to $10.4 billion in 
1977-78 and to $12.6 billion in 1978-79. For the first time, the 
annual deficit exceeded the 10 billion dollar mark, before spiralling 
completely out of control during the years that followed. In power 
for far too long and instructed by English Canada to deal with the 
Quebec  problem, Pierre Trudeau believed he could unite the 
country by wooing voters with wall to wall social programs. He 
temporarily reduced certain disparities which today reappear with a 
vengeance as a result of the debt left us by the former Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	Yes, Canada is an exceptional country, and the only way to deal 
with the crisis in our public finances, with useless administrative 
overlap and internal constitutional bickering, is to create a new 
economic and political partnership between Quebec and Canada, 
with a sovereign Quebec engaging in continuing negotiations 
between two sovereign and equal states. Yes, Canada is an 
exceptional country, but as Quebecers, we want our own country.
<P>
	We know Quebec will also be an exceptional country and will be 
Canada's first global partner. Canada will be an even better 
country, once it has stopped the bickering and useless power 
struggles with a sovereign Quebec that will maintain special ties 
with Canada, based on equality and friendship.
<P>
	Instead of supporting this view of relations between modern 
states, instead of supporting the proposals for renewal and change 
which the Prime Minister promised us during the last days of the 
referendum campaign in Quebec, the government proposes Bill 
C-100 on financial institutions, after tabling C-76 in which Ottawa 
assumed the power to impose national standards on social 
programs. Ottawa made another attempt at centralization with Bill 
C-88, to implement the agreement on internal trade, an agreement 
that would allow the government to act as the ultimate arbiter in 
interprovincial disputes.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The federal government and Quebec are going to be at each 
other's throat over regional development. Under Bill C-91, Ottawa 
will also be able to sign agreements with local authorities directly, 
without regard for provincial governments or existing regional 
structures.
<P>
	All these legislative efforts aimed at centralization and at 
building a modern country could be meaningful and have some 
implication, if Quebec's situation were settled once and for all. 
Canada could blithely carry on with its efforts at economic 
modernization and streamlining the administration of its structures, 
if Quebec's situation were settled through the 
sovereignty-partnership arrangement we sovereignists are 
proposing to Quebecers. Ottawa will always be too centralizing for 
most Quebecers, whereas the majority of Canadians believe, quite 
legitimately, honestly and proudly in a strong central government.
<P>
	In the meantime, no attempt can really reform Canadian 
federalism without the resolution of the Quebec-Canada issue, 
through the emergence of a sovereign Quebec that would keep 
close ties with its Canadian partner.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16820"> 16820 </A></B>
<P>
	Instead, the Liberal government is proposing Bill C-100, which 
simply fuels the flames of federal-provincial relations. Let us have 
a closer look at the implications of this bill for Quebec's financial 
institutions.
<P>
	Bill C-100 is very clear. It enables the federal government to 
take action faster when a financial institution is in difficulty. It also 
aims to reduce the risks inherent in Canada's financial system.
<P>
	Under clause 6 of Schedule I, which establishes a Canadian 
clearing system, the Governor of the Bank of Canada reserves the 
right to issue directives, not only to clearing houses but to financial 
institutions as well, regardless of their charter. So, for example, 
Bill C-100 would allow the Governor of the Bank of Canada to 
issue directives and orders to institutions that are institutions of 
Quebec essentially, such as: Fiducie Desjardins, the Fonds de 
solidarité des travailleurs du Québec or the Lévesque Beaubien 
Geoffrion brokerage firm, to name but a few.
<P>
	The Superintendent of Financial Institutions and of the 
Winding-up Act will be given more powers and will be able to 
intervene directly with provincial charter institutions.
<P>
	The increased options available to the federal Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions will mean costly duplication and inefficient 
management of savings. The Inspecteur général des institutions 
financières du Québec already monitors the situation in this regard 
so that the federal superintendent's new powers will simply 
duplicate those that already exist.
<P>
	The federal superintendent's broader powers may prompt 
Ottawa and Quebec City to issue court challenges that will leave 
struggling financial institutions and their depositors in the lurch.
<P>
	Bill C-100 shows that the federal government is more concerned 
about assuming new powers than about ensuring the viability of 
financial institutions and protecting savings.
<P>
	Bill C-100 will make major changes to the deposit insurance 
system in Canada. To become members, financial institutions now 
pay premiums based on deposit liabilities. The bill provides that 
the premiums will no longer be based on the financial institution's 
deposit liabilities but on its level or degree of risk. This raises 
many questions. For example, what criteria will be used to 
determine a financial institution's risk rating? The federal 
government now refuses to make public the regulations that will set 
risk ratings.
<P>
	What will be the impact of federal risk ratings on financial 
institutions? No one knows.
<P>
	Basing premium amounts on risk levels may penalize Quebec 
financial institutions particularly because they are relatively small. 
Since large corporations are generally seen as less risky and since 
Quebec has its own deposit  insurance scheme, in which premiums 
are not based on risk levels as such, we will end up with two 
systems: one based on risk and the other on deposit liabilities, with 
all the inconsistencies and contradictions that this entails.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-100 shows once again Ottawa's determination to 
centralize activities. By establishing Canada-wide clearing and 
settlement systems, this bill encroaches on powers exercised by the 
Quebec securities commission and the Quebec inspector general of 
financial institutions.
<P>
	All this results in costly overlap. Financial institutions will be 
subject to two levels of control, a situation which will result in 
unnecessary administrative duplication.
<P>
	As I already mentioned, in addition to Bill C-100, the 
government has tabled three other centralizing pieces of legislation 
since the last federal budget, namely Bill C-76, Bill C-88 and Bill 
C-91. The centralization exercise is continuing as strongly as ever.
<P>
	A 1991 Treasury Board study showed that 67 per cent of federal 
programs overlap provincial ones. With Bill C-100, Ottawa keeps 
heading in the same direction, towards a dead end. According to 
Julien and Proulx, from the University of Montreal, close to 1,000 
meetings take place every year between Ottawa and Quebec public 
servants, simply to harmonize program objectives, or to ensure that 
provincial and federal programs are not incompatible with one 
another. Bill C-100 will give all these public servants another 
opportunity to meet, simply to try to harmonize the criteria used to 
determine premiums paid by financial institutions.
<P>
	Pierre Fortin, who is an economist, estimates that three billion 
dollars is wasted annually because of overlapping Quebec and 
federal programs. Such overlap results in unnecessary costs for 
taxpayers, businesses and citizens. These costs have an impact on 
the debt and, in the end, jeopardize institutions which were set up 
to support our country's blueprint for society. From that 
perspective, Bill C-100 is nothing but an ill-considered attempt by 
this government to centralize, under the pretence of protecting 
investors, when the system in Quebec works very well.
<P>
	This bill is also an unacceptable intrusion into the securities 
industry, when the private sector and major business associations 
already complain about excessive government involvement. Such 
abusive interference always results in lower productivity and in a 
shortfall, this at a time when there is an urgent need to improve the 
sad state of public finances. Instead of withdrawing and 
concentrating on the essential, as it should, given its chronic state 
of indebtedness, the federal government is increasingly interfering 
in fields of provincial jurisdiction, as well as in the activities of our 
businesses.
<P>
	In Quebec, the various governments which have been in office 
over the last 30 years have all strongly defended  Quebec's 
jurisdiction over the securities industry. Even Daniel Johnson 
reaffirmed that position in February 1994, when he was Quebec's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16821"> 16821 </A></B>
<P>
premier. The authority given to the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada to issue directives or orders to participants goes squarely 
against that traditional Quebec position, which was upheld even by 
provincial Liberals, which is quite something. As in the case of 
manpower training, there is a strong consensus in Quebec 
regarding this issue.
<P>
	Consequently, the official opposition cannot support Bill C-100 
on financial institutions, because it maintains a situation which, for 
more than 25 years now, has led to disputes which have drained the 
country and put it into debt. In order to end the current financial 
crisis, the federal government must stop getting involved in the 
activities of businesses. Similarly, in order to end the current 
constitutional crisis, Ottawa must stop getting involved in fields of 
provincial jurisdiction and let Quebec take charge of its own 
destiny. Unfortunately, this is just the opposite of what is proposed 
in Bill C-100, which is yet another stage in the exercise conducted 
by a centralizing government which is out of step with current 
events.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
how would the hon. member explain the increased riskiness that 
apparently is to be expected by the financial institutions in Quebec 
relative to the financial institutions in other parts of Canada? In 
particular, I would like him to address the failure of Confederation 
Life, which was not exactly a small financial institution. I would 
like him to compare the risks Confederation Life had vis-à-vis 
some of the institutions which exist in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to relate the small institutions that 
operate in Quebec vis-à-vis those that operate in other provinces, 
for example the Atlantic provinces, British Columbia, Alberta and 
Saskatchewan and some very small institutions that are covered by 
the CDIC. Is it the same kind of problem he is alluding to in 
Quebec, that in fact there are riskier situations? Exactly what point 
is the hon. member trying to make?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell the hon. member 
that we already have a deposit insurance corporation in Quebec. 
Savers and investors' savings are already protected under the law, 
and I agree with him. A government majority member who spoke 
previously mentioned that the attitude displayed by both Bloc and 
Reform members could be described as a provincialist attitude or, 
in the case of the Bloc Quebecois, a separatist attitude.
<P>
	I would like to tell these hon. members that all we, Quebecers, 
want is to be able to manage our own affairs.  We certainly have 
nothing against any streamlining effort, any legislation or measure 
that Canada may want to make, pass or take to better protect 
people's savings. But as Quebecers and members representing the 
single largest minority in Canada, we must point out that we have a 
unique culture, a unique language, and have always defined 
ourselves as a distinct nation. All we want is to manage our own 
affairs. Whether in finance or in any other area, we want to be 
regulated and protected by our own laws.
<P>
	We have absolutely nothing against any legislation being 
introduced before this Parliament to improve the way financial 
markets operate, or the way Canada operates. As I said earlier in 
my remarks, Canada is indeed an exceptional country. And I think 
it is destined for further growth in the future. But as Quebecers, that 
is not our goal as a society. It is not our goal as a country. All we 
want is just to manage our own affairs. And in a future referendum, 
in two, three or four years from now, I think that the majority of 
Quebecers will vote yes, and then, as I indicated earlier, we will 
have the opportunity to keep working together, hand in hand, not as 
one of nine or one of ten, but with all nine English provinces and 
the federal government. We will have the opportunity to keep 
working together on an equal footing, one on one, with Quebec on 
one side of the table and Ottawa on the other side.
<P>
	That is all I wanted to say on this subject today. That is the 
context in which we want to continue to co-operate with you: as 
two peoples on equal footing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity 
to stand and support Bill C-100, an act to amend, enact and repeal 
certain laws relating to financial institutions.
<P>
	This bill, which is essentially a housekeeping bill, has many 
good features in it. We are giving the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions, an organization within the Government of Canada, the 
power and the capacity to have a much more specific 
accountability. This is not just in terms of protecting depositors' 
funds, but also in terms of making sure that the financial 
institutions are following all of those rules and regulations they are 
responsible for following which is the reason they got their 
franchise.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	A bank is really not any different from a McDonald's franchise. 
The person who applies for a McDonald's franchise has to live by 
the rules and regulations of the administration granting the 
franchise. If that McDonald's franchiser is not following the rules, 
then as I am sure members have heard from people who have 
owned a franchise other than McDonald's such as Budget or Swiss 
Chalet, the management will say: ``There are rules and  regulations 
attached to the franchise that you have been allowed to operate. 
You are not following them and if you do not clean up your act, we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16822"> 16822 </A></B>
<P>
are going to pull the franchise. We will pull our agreement. We will 
take the franchise away from you''.
<P>
	Very few Canadians realize that the people of Canada through 
their trustees and agents in this House of Commons are the ones 
that grant the banking franchises which exist in Canada. The men 
and women in this room are the ones who design the rules and 
regulations that allow the banks to operate. The basic thrust behind 
that banking franchise is to protect depositors' funds but they are 
also to be in the business of lending money.
<P>
	The banks, the franchisees, have done a pretty good job of those 
7,000 little franchise operations across Canada, whether they be the 
Royal Bank or the Bank of Nova Scotia. They have done a pretty 
good job of protecting depositors' funds.
<P>
	Where I have a problem is the way they have been handling their 
relationship with small business men and women. If I had my 
druthers and if I had had an opportunity, I would have added a 
couple of amendments to the bill. I would have liked a very specific 
responsibility given to the Superintendent of Financial Institutions 
on behalf of small business.
<P>
	As the Superintendent of Financial Institutions goes through all 
the lists of responsibilities he has to maintain in his relationship 
with banks there is special mention for small business. I do not see 
it in here anywhere. On that score, I am disappointed. It does not 
take away of course from supporting the bill because there are a lot 
of good things in this bill.
<P>
	Today I have the opportunity to stand on my feet in the House 
two years into our mandate. I have to say that our effort to sensitize 
this country's banks to become much more supportive of small 
business has not grown. That attitude change has not grown the 
way it should have grown.
<P>
	I see my colleague, the industry critic from the Reform Party, 
who sits on the committee with me. He is nodding his head in 
approval that we really have not done as much as we should have 
done in committee.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	I do not want to say that our efforts and the efforts of the banks 
have been a total failure. Two weeks ago there was a meeting of the 
industry committee. It was reported in a document that at the end of 
the second year there was an increase in the small business loan 
float. We were all very excited about getting that document. We 
saw that the loan float for all small business men and women in 
Canada was approximately $28 billion. That is the total of 
outstanding loans being utilized by small business men and 
women. That is a 1 per cent increase in the small business loan float 
over the last year.
<P>
	Granted some people would argue that we are lucky it was not a 
decrease. However, when we consider the government's Small 
Business Loan Act guarantee, which is also included in that and the 
fact that the float increased, the real risk the banks have taken on 
behalf of small business men and women has not increased that 
much in the last two years. We are going to have to continue to 
press forward.
<P>
	We hope eventually the banking culture, the men and women 
who operate the 7,000 bank franchises across Canada, in the not too 
distant future will be fully converted. We hope they will realize that 
the only way the economy is going to get back on the right track 
and men and women will get back to work is by making sure the 
small business community is given the maximum opportunity and 
the best environment in which to grow.
<P>
	The Superintendent of Financial Institutions can play a major 
role in helping members of Parliament accomplish that policy 
directive. I am not talking about my policy directive here today; it 
is a policy directive of the Prime Minister of Canada. Make no 
mistake about it. Two months before the last national election 
campaign began the Prime Minister of Canada sat in the press 
gallery across the street from Parliament and said on coast to coast 
television that we were going to be the government that would 
really work to change the attitude of financial institutions toward 
small business men and women.
<P>
	When I stand in the House today and support this bill and talk 
about access to capital for small business men and women, I am 
speaking on behalf of the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Industry. In the last budget even the Minister of Finance said that 
we have to create new benchmarks for the banks in relation to the 
small business sector.
<P>
	Those in the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions who will take this bill after it has passed here today and 
later through the Senate are responsible for monitoring, reviewing 
and auditing small business activities. I plead with them to assist us 
in sensitizing those 7,000 branch managers, those franchise holders 
that small business must be very much a part of the language of the 
review, et cetera.
<P>
	I want to move on to another aspect of the bill which I am 
pleased to see is addressed. It is on page 29 and deals with the 
whole business of derivatives.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	It is no secret to anyone in the House that I have always been 
concerned about the private casinos the financial institutions in this 
country operate, the derivative sections in the banks. I see that this 
bill gives the Superintendent of Financial Institutions enhanced 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16823"> 16823 </A></B>
<P>
authority to go into those derivative sections within the financial 
institutions and do thorough and complete audits.
<P>
	I will be honest. I do not understand the complexity of the 
derivative game the banks are playing. I notice other members are 
nodding likewise. However, I trust that the expertise exists within 
the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. Some 
members are noting they are not convinced of that. I hope they are 
wrong. I will tell them why I hope they are wrong. I know of one 
financial institution in this country that in its derivative section, 
which I call the private casino, trades close to $30 billion a day. In 
one 24-hour period it trades $30 billion. This is an amazing amount 
of paper pushing, going back and forth. There are very small 
margins but with very big exposure.
<P>
	If the essence of this bill, as my colleague from Dundas said 
earlier, is to make sure those depositors' funds are protected, then 
the Superintendent of Financial Institutions should start by making 
sure there is a good solid handle on all those private casinos, all 
those derivative sections in all the financial institutions.
<P>
	Do members not wonder sometime how one bank can find $30 
billion to play the derivative game in one day yet cannot seem to 
find the resources for the small business men and women who 
really require a small loan of $10,000 or $15,000 or $50,000? Am I 
losing it? Does anyone wonder about that sometimes? It is a totally 
different issue, but it has to do with will and attitude, which is the 
point I am trying to make.
<P>
	If the board of directors or the senior management of a bank 
decides it is going to be in the derivative business and play with 
$30 billion a day, it happens. These guys work 24 hours a day, 7 
days a week in these derivative sections of the bank. So if the 
management of a bank puts forward a policy that allows $30 billion 
a day to be pushed around the world by these unelected, 
unaccountable people who can affect the way our dollar goes and 
affect our interest rates, then why can we not get the same kind of 
will from the management of the banks to increase the float to 
small business by a little better than one per cent a year?
<P>
	I noticed my colleague from the Reform Party, the industry 
critic, is saying that we can do it. We on this side of the House 
appreciate his consistent support as we deal with this issue.
<P>
	This is a good bill because it gives the authority to the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions to make sure that not only 
are depositors' funds protected in a more thorough way, but the 
whole administration of the bank franchises is followed according 
to the basic framework of the Bank Act. Alongside that 
responsibility, I would also ask them, as they go through their 
check list of responsibilities, to add another one: check and make 
sure that those 7,000 franchise holders of bank licences or bank 
charters across Canada are doing what they should be doing for 
small business.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Industry 
for raising the issue of what is happening to small business. I do not 
believe he is taking enough credit for some of the things that have 
happened and have changed the attitude of the banks.
<P>
	On the one hand, it seems to me that the committee succeeded in 
saying we have to get more numbers together to ensure that we 
know for a fact they are not giving money to small business. That is 
important. The committee was sensitive not only to small business, 
but to the banks and to the House.
<P>
	The banks will never be able to escape from the investigation 
that took place. Each of the chartered banks has appointed an 
ombudsman and they are now looking for a national ombudsman.
<P>
	I know that the parliamentary secretary feels the national 
ombudsman will probably not be very effective because he will be 
appointed by a board of directors that is made up of representatives 
from the banks. We will see whether that is the case.
<P>
	With all of this, the parliamentary secretary has demonstrated 
one word, although he has never said it: transparency. It is about 
transparency, being open, telling the story the way it is and making 
sure the banks come up with their numbers.
<P>
	I ask the parliamentary secretary whether he agrees with the 
provision that the premiums paid by the financial institutions to the 
CDIC should be left secret. Should that not become transparent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
deal with the specific answer to the question I will deal with the 
first part of my colleague's remarks.
<P>
	I do not believe it is appropriate for us to stand in the House and 
defend the chartered banks of Canada until they have really 
delivered on the objectives the hon. member helped to form in our 
``Taking Care of Small Business'' document.
<P>
	Yes, the banks have agreed to create an ombudsman, which they 
essentially appoint, because they control the board of directors. 
However, I am nervous about our effectiveness as a committee. 
Yes, they will report more numbers, but let us face it, the banks will 
not give us what we wanted in recommendation number two, where 
we wanted a much greater regional breakdown. When I only see a 
one per cent increase, which is what I call real action, not 
words-they are fantastic. Remember that campaign of the Bank of 
Montreal: ``We want to share your pain''. When I see only a one per 
cent increase in the small business float, are they getting to us? Are 
they pushing us off the mark? Are they pushing us off our focus? 
Are they distracting us?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16824"> 16824 </A></B>
<P>
	This is not bank bashing. There are a million small business 
men and women out there, and there are as many in the hon. 
member's riding as there are in mine. If his small business men 
and women are saying to him that the banks are doing a great job, 
then his small business men and women are different from mine. 
They are saying we have not made much of a difference yet.
<P>
	I plead with all members, if we get one thing done in this session 
for small business, let us make sure that we get the banks into the 
business of loaning to small business in a serious way.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	In answer to the member's specific question about CDIC fees 
being disclosed, for me it is a slam dunk: I think they should be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I share the zeal with which the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood campaigns on behalf of small businesses. 
I know exactly what he is talking about. I have spent my entire life 
in small business and I know the problems small businesses have 
had with banks. Quite often the small business people I talk to feel 
like third class citizens when they go to these big banks to try to get 
some financial help.
<P>
	I agree that it must be demanded of the banks that they get 
serious about dealing with small business in a substantial manner. 
As far as I am concerned, one per cent is a bit low. I would like to 
see it higher.
<P>
	I believe there is an inherent and traditional conflict of interest 
when it comes to the relationships that governments, whether they 
be Tories, Liberals, or whatever, have had with the banks over the 
last several years. The major contributors to the federal parties, 
both the Tories and the Liberals, have been these very powerful 
banking institutions themselves. The banks are the most powerful 
financial institutions, but they are also probably the most 
influential institutions as far as political direction.
<P>
	I hope this government has the guts to stand up to the banks and 
hold a hammer to their heads and say the way they have done things 
in the past with the Liberal Party and with the Tory Party does not 
go any more and that the government wants to see them make a 
profound effort toward helping small business to thrive and prosper 
in this country. Until a government is prepared to do that, mean it 
and stick to it, nothing is going to change in the attitude of banks 
toward small business. That is the key to all this.
<P>
	We can talk all day long about legislation, and we are going to 
put this in and we are going to make this amendment, but the 
government has to be prepared to back it up. I hope this is the 
government that does it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I presume 
the hon. member was talking about the  campaign donations made 
to the parties. I do not think political donations made by the banks 
really have any effect on whether a government would deal with an 
issue such as this. I do not see it. I could be wrong.
<P>
	Where we have a problem as a government, and this is all 
governments, has to do with the bonds, the government coupons 
that are being clipped by banks; in other words, buying our debt. 
That is where bank decision makers can have a tremendous 
influence on the executive of a government. We are so dependent 
on the marketing and the purchasing of those bonds.
<P>
	That goes back to what the member from Okanagan said earlier 
in his remarks, which has to do with transparency. When we have a 
bill like this today, Bill C-100, where we are dealing with the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions and all the major financial 
institutions in Canada, I find it absolutely stunning that there is not 
a list of speakers the length of this room who want to speak on this 
bill. It gives us an opportunity not only to exchange with each other 
but also to send a message to the implementers of this bill where 
we, as a collective group, are coming from.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	In my judgment, as MPs, we are blowing a gift to debate one of 
the most fundamental issues facing Canadians today, which is the 
ability of small business to gain access to capital. The 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions is one of the key players in 
making sure that happens and happens properly.
<P>
	What are we doing? We have just half a dozen speakers, then the 
bill will go through the House. It is not that the bill would not go 
through the House, but this is a good reason to have a good, 
exciting debate to provide some hope for the only sector in the 
economy that is creating jobs.
<P>
	Where are we today on this issue? I am not being critical of the 
House. I am just saying that every now and then we get a gift 
handed to us. This is one of the bills that affects the lives of most of 
our constituents. I wish we could create a little more excitement 
around it so the superintendent would understand where all of us 
are coming from on this issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on Bill C-100.
<P>
	I feel obliged to say that this is yet another unfortunate federal 
initiative which, despite some slight impression that they are 
willing to help small business and create employment, is only 
intended, when it comes right down to it-at least in the eyes of a 
member from Quebec-to increase the powers of control and 
centralization over certain of the country's financial institutions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16825"> 16825 </A></B>
<P>
	The truth at the heart of the matter is that assigning powers to 
a superintendent of financial institutions under Bill C-100 
increases his powers. It also allows Ottawa to take action more 
promptly when financial institutions are in difficulty, and here 
again, in the eyes of a member from Quebec, this is merely a move 
to increase the power in the hands of the federal government, since 
we in Quebec already have institutions in place which do the job 
and, what is more, do it very efficiently.
<P>
	The Commission québécoise des valeurs mobilières is already in 
place and working very well. We have an inspector general of 
financial institutions who carries out the same duties Bill C-100 
now wants to give to a superintendent at the federal level.
<P>
	The game is therefore, of course, once again to beef up the 
federal government's power, the power of centralization, 
unfortunately at great cost, since once again there is overlap and 
duplication. Duplication is part and parcel of the history of Canada, 
the waste of having a federal department doing something, and a 
provincial department doing the same thing. There is a virtually 
endless list of examples of this fundamental problem of Canadian 
federalism, which essentially seems to me to want to monopolize 
powers in Ottawa, although there are already competent 
institutions on the provincial level.
<P>
	This bill is, I repeat, not the sole example of this logic, or 
political attitude, within the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	I could easily recall from memory some six or seven other bills 
brought before this House recently, since the election of the Liberal 
government. Without going into them in great detail, I could 
mention Bill C-52, which once attempts to add to federal power in 
areas that are not only under provincial jurisdiction but also 
concern the private sector. Then there is Bill C-95, which attempts 
to establish national health standards, often contrary to the interests 
and powers of the provincial governments.
<P>
	We have C-96, which addresses human resources and also gives 
increased powers to the minister in applying the department's 
legislation. We have Bill C-91, which grants broader powers to the 
Federal Business Development Bank, we have Bill C-88 on 
interprovincial trade, which quite openly gives the federal 
government residual powers, including the power to intervene in 
agreements between the provinces. And there are many more 
examples. I could go on all day about this.
<P>
	This government is quite simply intent on increasing its powers 
to guarantee a certain level of centralization and to keep the 
provinces well under control. We have this enormous deficit in 
Canada because the federal government in Ottawa has far too much 
power and, as a result, is wasting money left and right. It is the 
same old sad story of this country. As a system, Canadian 
federalism has been wasteful, and the federal government has 
failed to learn from its past mistakes. Even today,  government 
members tell us, in speeches that are hypocritical and make no 
sense at all, that they are helping small business and will find ways 
to give them more money.
<P>
	We are already doing the job in Quebec. We have agencies that 
are perfectly capable of meeting the requirements of small 
businesses. In Quebec, we have set up a number of creative 
initiatives to meet these requirements, in large municipalities and 
also in the regions. Our financial institutions work very well. We 
have all the resources and agencies we need to supervise these 
institutions. And it works.
<P>
	So why bother today with Bill C-100, which would establish at 
the federal level a series of activities and institutions that already 
exist at the provincial level? Again, and we keep repeating this all 
the time, this is what is fundamentally wrong with the federal 
system. I could go on and on about the disease, as it were, that 
exists here in Ottawa, which is-perhaps unfortunately-not only 
due to a lack of political will on the part of the government but is 
reflected in the very survival of the whole bureaucracy established 
in Ottawa for so many years, which is very invasive and whose 
resistance to decentralizing powers to the provinces is ingrained, 
although across the country, people keep asking for 
decentralization.
<P>
	The federal government has now tabled a bill that is a complete 
contradiction of these repeated requests for decentralization. The 
government cannot or will not listen. This is irresponsible, 
especially considering the deficit, which is cause for serious 
concern. It is extremely disturbing when a government tables bills 
like the one before the House today.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-100 is purely and simply another tiresome and costly 
duplication gimmick. In Quebec, we know what this means. We 
have problems with this, and perhaps this is one major reason for 
Quebec's wanting to leave and its wanting to change the way 
negotiations are conducted with the federal government. We want 
to negotiate as equals, because, it would seem that English Canada 
is unable to give the federal government a wake up call.
<P>
	It will take Quebec's sovereignty to wake up the other provinces, 
and it will be in their best interests, because they will be able to 
reorganize themselves in more effective terms. When I talk of 
duplication and the costs of the waste it entails, we know what that 
means in Quebec. We have done a lot of studies on this. There have 
been commissions and studies, including the Bélanger-Campeau 
study in 1990, which gathered a lot of information. There was also 
the study by Mr. Fortin, a Quebec economist, who said that, in all, 
some $3 billion had been wasted due to federal and provincial 
duplication-and this was only as far as Quebec was concerned.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16826"> 16826 </A></B>
<P>
	In other words, Quebec as a province could save some $3 billion 
if there were not this duplication. Three billion dollars; that is a 
lot of money. You will agree that $3 billion a year is a substantial 
amount. If the Government of Quebec had this money to create 
jobs, to lend it to small and medium businesses, jobs would be 
created.
<P>
	It is time the government stopped kidding us about wanting to be 
more efficient and to create jobs, when, in fact, the only thing it 
wants to do is increase its power. There are examples of 
duplication. I tell you: all the latest studies show that Quebec alone 
is losing $3 billion. If we were to look only at the matters essential 
to Quebec's development, we could point, in the case of manpower 
training for example, to another study showing that, because of 
duplication between the federal and the provincial governments, 
Quebec loses $250 million a year. There is no training and the 
reason is that the federal government is trying to do the same job as 
the province. Often the federal government implements initiatives 
that run contrary to Quebec's interests.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, you will be able to continue 
the debate after question period. It being two o'clock p.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 31, we will now proceed to statements 
by members.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last

Ontario. This was the home of Margaret Laurence and before her of 
two other famous authors, Catherine Parr Trail and Susannah 
Mordy.
<P>
	On this day, the village was celebrating no less than four 
anniversaries. It was the 75th anniversary of the Lakefield 
Hydroelectric Commission and Memorial Hall. It was the 100th 
anniversary of the library and it was the 120th anniversary of the 
first village council meeting.
<P>
	The celebrations were organized by the LACAC, Lakefield 
Architectural Conservation Advisory Committee, with the support 
of council and many volunteers and sponsors. Past and present 
reeves and councillors were present. A historical booklet was 
produced.
<P>
	We do not take enough time to celebrate our rich and diverse

The fortune, raising enough money to beautify the downtown core.
<P>
	How does it work? The Pride in Barrhead Association 
representing over 100 local businesses minted the Barrhead 
two-buck. The coin features two deer on one side and on the other 
side the town's mascot, the blue heron. The two-buck is local 
tender in Barrhead until the end of 1996.
<P>
	Collectors from all parts of Canada are clamouring to get their 
hands on this gold coin. The demand is so high that thousands more 
had to be minted.
<P>
	If members want more information on this unique fundraising 
idea they could call my office. Better yet, they could purchase the

<P>
	Our small group presented the Governor General with a 
Christmas tree, a white spruce, the provincial tree of 
Saskatchewan, on behalf of the town of Meadow Lake which was 
Canada's forestry capital in 1995 and on behalf of the Canadian 
Forestry Association of which the Governor General is the 
honorary patron.
<P>
	I take the opportunity to thank the people of Meadow Lake and 
the Meadow Lake Forestry Capital Society represented today by 
Donna and Barry Aldous for the fine job that they have done on 
behalf of forestry communities throughout Canada in 1995. 
Meadow Lake's efforts during the past year will be fondly 
remembered for many years to come.
<P>
	I congratulate the people of Meadow Lake, their representatives 
and the members of the Canadian Forestry Association for making 
the forestry capital program such a success.

Valley-Hants I met with a group of young people involved with 
Katimivik.
<P>
	Katimivik is an Inuit word meaning meeting place. The project 
being funded under Youth Services Canada brings youth between 
the ages of 17 and 21 together to acquire work experience, become 
involved in their communities and discover Canada.
<P>
	Through exchange programs such as Katimivik, Canada's young 
people have an excellent opportunity to travel and learn about all 
regions of our great country. By promoting this wonderful program 
the government is helping to bring young people together to 
achieve common goals, build lifelong friendships and to help break 
down regional barriers that often divide us.
<P>
	I urge the government to continue to promote Katimivik and 
other similar exchange programs as a valuable means of building 
stronger ties among all parts of Canada.

immediately on the new plant that will be occupied by the Panacom 
automation division. The 75,000 square foot facility will be ready 
by September 1996. Panacom designs, develops, markets and 
manufactures network terminal devices for the worldwide market.
<P>
	Since Panacom began in 1984 it has been a leader in its field. 
Panacom is the number one supplier worldwide of X-stations, 
which are network display devices that allow users to access 
simultaneously multiple applications running on work stations. 
Panacom is a genuine Canadian success story.
<P>
	The people of my riding are delighted that Hewlett-Packard has 
decided to invest in Waterloo. The new plant adds to the growing, 
vibrant information technology sector in Waterloo riding. The new

Mr. Speaker, the holiday season is a busy time for shoppers and 
criminals alike.
<P>
	The Peel regional police and police all across Canada have 
compiled lists of suggestions to help people reduce the risk of 
becoming a victim of crime. Among other things they suggest that 
shoppers avoid carrying large amounts of cash and lock their 
purchases in the trunks of their cars.
<P>
	They remind people that empty cartons from high value products 
such as televisions, computers and stereo equipment may cause a 
thief to add their home to his post-Christmas shopping list. They 
suggest that gifts and valuables be kept away from windows to 
keep criminals from window shopping.

	Again it is obvious that the concerns of law-abiding gun owners 
do not count in the House or in the Senate. The Liberal 
government ignored these concerns and rammed through 
legislation which will do nothing to reduce crime but will establish 
an extensive bureaucracy and give the justice minister 
unprecedented powers.
<P>
	When Liberal backbenchers voted with the wishes of their 
constituents, the government gave them a swift kick to keep them 
in line. It is the front benches that need a swift kick in their egos, 
one that will propel them to the back and out the door.

<P>
	The parents, students, staff and members of the community have 
embarked on a unique environmental project to transform the

	The environmental nature area will include trails, wildlife, 
habitat facilities including a butterfly garden, plantings of 
Carolinian forest trees and shrubs, as well as woodland wildflowers 
and ground cover, thereby returning the area to its natural habitat.

	The outdoor educational classroom and amphitheatre will have

	We are still waiting for government proposals, and what is 
emerging is not very encouraging: a recognition of distinct society 
through a meaningless resolution of the Canadian Parliament that 
falls far short of the Meech  Lake agreement, and a right of veto 
over any constitutional change that will be contingent on the 
federal government's goodwill.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has clearly taken the path recommended by

guide for broadcasters, producers and parents to help determine age 
appropriate programming for Canada's children.

Speaker, December 12 is the grand opening of Windsor's second

total number of casino jobs created in Windsor will rise by 950 to a 
total of 3,000. Ninety per cent of these jobs are from the 
Windsor-Essex county area.
<P>
	The Northern Belle will entertain 2 million patrons on top of the 
5.5 million that already visit the existing site. Eighty per cent of 
those visitors are U.S. residents. That means 80 per cent of the 
dollars spent are foreign dollars.
<P>
	One of the major competitive advantages to Casino Windsor 
over its American counterparts has been the safety factor which 
will be further strengthened by the recent successful passage of the 
government's gun control legislation. The legislation will not only 
increase the safety of Canadians in Windsor. It also means good

address some comments to Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, 
currently the Bloc Quebecois supported by the Liberals, with 
specific reference to the words loyal and opposition.
<P>
	According to the Oxford dictionary loyal means faithful, 
trustworthy, true, steadfast in allegiance and devoted to the 
sovereign or government of one's country. In the House the Bloc is 
certainly not loyal to Her Majesty or to Canada and is openly 
plotting against the government to set up a separate Quebec.
<P>
	Turning to the word opposition, according to Beauchesne's the 
official opposition is the largest minority group which is prepared 
in the event of the resignation of government to assume office. 
How can we have an opposition party that has no intention of 
becoming government, at least not in Canada, and is attempting to 
set up a separate independent state?
<P>
	Clearly Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition in this 35th Parliament 
is neither loyal to Canada nor is prepared to fulfil the role of 
official opposition. It is time for the Bloc to step aside to make 
room for the real opposition to the Liberals, the Reform Party of

equity initiatives. Women now represent 45 per cent of all workers. 
Nonetheless challenges do remain. Today, on average, women earn 
72 cents for every dollar a man earns. Most women continue to 
work in traditionally female dominated fields.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	We need to support job creation and training programs that will 
prepare women and girls for the jobs of today and tomorrow. We 
must help Canadian women prepare so they too can have good jobs 
and earn good incomes.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THECONSTITUTION">THE CONSTITUTION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the special 
general council of the Quebec Liberal Party revealed last week in 
Montreal that Daniel Johnson, the president of the No committee, 
not only heard the Prime Minister's promises of change, he 
believed them. As Ottawa has been reluctant to deliver the goods, 
the Quebec Liberal Party went so far as to adopt four resolutions on 
the promised constitutional changes.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs or to the Deputy Prime Minister. Will they acknowledge 
that the Prime Minister has no intention at all of acting on the 
recommendations of the Quebec Liberal Party and reopening the 
Canadian Constitution, as requested, to insert a provision 
recognizing Quebec as a distinct society?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16830"> 16830 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental  Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, my first answer is that the Prime Minister is a man who 
keeps his promises. He promised he would act on the issue of 
distinct society and the veto. I remain convinced, absolutely 
convinced, that he will act on those two promises very quickly and 
that Quebecers will see the Prime Minister is a man of integrity, a 
man of his word and a man who keeps his promises.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs acknowledge that what the 
government plans to do about recognizing Quebec as a distinct 
society and about the veto has no connection at all with the request 
made by Quebec Liberals on the weekend to include these two 
concepts in the Canadian Constitution, and that the government 
certainly has no intention of reopening the Constitution to do so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps we should rephrase the question as follows: What 
is the position of the Bloc Quebecois and of the Leader of the 
Official Opposition? Because if I remember correctly, last week the 
Leader of the Official Opposition, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
and aspirant leader of the Parti Quebecois, said in no uncertain 
terms that he would not consider any constitutional offers before 
sovereignty.
<P>
	Clearly, the Leader of the Official Opposition is the one who is 
obstructing any translation into constitutional terms of the Prime 
Minister's promises.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister's inept excuses are not backed up by Daniel Johnson, 
president of the No committee in Quebec City. I have the following 
question for the minister. Now that even his federalist allies in 
Quebec are asking the Prime Minister to deliver the goods, will the 
government remember his pre-referendum commitments to 
Quebecers or will it do what the minister just did and hide behind 
the fact that there is a sovereignist government in Quebec City?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I repeat, the Prime Minister made promises he intends to 
keep and he will keep them. The only obstacle to our proceeding 
immediately is the members of the official opposition, because 
their leader made it very clear he is not prepared to proceed on any 
constitutional offers.
<P>
	It is time the official opposition stopped trying to evade the issue 
and admitted that with the Parti Quebecois, it is preventing 
Quebecers from having the full benefit of the Prime Minister's 
promises.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	After all, 73 per cent of Quebecers said they wanted the Quebec 
government to negotiate offers with the federal government, and 
we have the Leader of the Official Opposition who objects, who 
said no and who prevents us from taking a constitutional approach.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to a Gallup poll released today, fewer than 40 
per cent of people living in English Canada are in favour of 
recognizing Quebec as a distinct society, and barely 10 per cent are 
in favour of reopening the Constitution to add the right of veto.
<P>
	In light of these results, will the Deputy Prime Minister admit 
that, when the Prime Minister promised changes to Quebecers on 
October 24, it was only to sweeten the pot during the referendum 
campaign and he was well aware that these changes would be 
unacceptable to English Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all there is not one 
English Canada, as the future leader of the Bloc Quebecois claims. 
Second, if he wants to look at surveys, I would recommend the one 
that shows 73 per cent of Quebecers want the government of 
Quebec to assume its responsibilities and negotiate in good faith 
with the federal government, which it refuses to do, despite the 
support of the majority of people in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> There is 
no English Canada, Mr. Speaker; everybody knows that. That is 
why all the newspapers are in English.
<P>
	At the special general assembly of the Quebec Liberal Party, the 
leader of the No committee and of the Liberal Party stated as 
follows, with reference to the resolutions on constitutional changes 
adopted yesterday: ``These demands represent a starting point only, 
and are most definitely not the last word''.
<P>
	Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that the major problem of 
the Canadian federation is that what constitutes a starting point for 
the federalists of Quebec represents something unacceptable for 
the federalists of English Canada, even with the majority they have 
here in this House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what bothers the member is 
to see that there are sixteen francophone members representing 
ridings across this country which are not in Quebec but are 
francophone.
<P>
	It bothers the member to hear that a poll by <I>L'Actualité</I> shows 
that 86 per cent of Quebecers state that they belong to Canada. If 
the hon. member wants to carry out an analysis of Quebecers' sense 
of belonging to Canada, I am sure that the Quebecers, along with 
other Canadians, are aware that Canada has need of  improvement, 
that Canada has need of change, that Canada has need of open 
minds, yet Canada is still the best place in the world to live.

<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Quebec's premier in waiting has said that he will not hold another 
referendum until 1997. That seems to be good news for this do 
nothing government.
<P>
	A recent poll found that if a Quebec referendum were held today 
the yes side would win with almost 55 per cent. This is an outright 
condemnation of the Liberals' post-referendum strategy. What is 
more, 55 per cent of Quebecers reject the symbolic changes which 
the Prime Minister is offering, while a strong majority, as high as 
85 per cent, want to see a transfer of powers to the provinces.
<P>
	Since constitutional change is not an option and since Quebecers 
will reject the symbolic changes, when will the Prime Minister 
introduce concrete measures to transfer real power to the 
provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think Canadians are 
probably as disturbed as we are to hear the underlying tone of glee 
in the member's voice when she talks about the possibility of a 
future referendum.
<P>
	I point out to her that just as Quebecers do not want a 
referendum, Canadians do not want a referendum. They want the 
Canadian government to work together in a constructive way with 
the provinces, municipalities and Canadians to make a better 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians want better health care. They want a national health 
care plan that is respected by the province of Alberta. We will 
continue to fight for a better Canada for every Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
wanted the referendum to be over and done with through a strong 
no vote. It did not happen because of who was in charge over there.
<P>
	Let me remind the Prime Minister that on October 25, in a 
speech broadcast to the entire nation, he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All governments, federal and provincial, must respond to the desire of 
Canadians everywhere for greater decentralization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was a promise, not just to Quebecers, but to all Canadians. 
Since the referendum, however, the government has done nothing 
but backpedal on its promises.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister keep his promise to introduce 
concrete measures to transfer many powers to the provinces, which 
is their normal jurisdiction anyway?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to underscore how 
sad we are that the Reform Party  missed a real opportunity to work 
for Canada during the referendum.
<P>
	I also remind the hon. member that despite the backroom 
manipulations of her party, we actually won the referendum. As a 
government we intend to govern for the betterment of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made promises in Verdun. He has every 
intention of keeping those promises. He will not be able to count on 
the support of the leader of the third party because when the time 
came, in a private meeting when the Prime Minister asked the 
leader of the third party to fight for Canada in the way that the 
leader of the Conservative Party did, the leader of the third party 
was not there to fight for Canada.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have been and will continue to fight for a new Canada, not this old 
rehash, out of date Canada that they keeping talking about.
<P>
	I seem to hear from the other side decentralization, if necessary, 
but not necessarily decentralization. Mackenzie King's dog would 
have been proud of that line. He could not have said it any better.
<P>
	Canadians inside and outside of Quebec want real change. They 
do not want just cosmetic changes and the ivory tower thinking that 
we are going to hear on Wednesday from the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	Is that it? Is that all this bankrupt Liberal government has to 
offer, recycled centralist policies again and again and botched unity 
strategies? Does the government have any clue whatsoever, or is 
the Prime Minister just making it up as he goes along?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the saddest thing about the 
configuration of the current Parliament is the fact that in the 
opposition every day basically we see two sides of the same coin. 
We see a Bloc Quebecois that is fighting to separate Quebec from 
Canada and a Reform Party that is fighting to separate Canada from 
Quebec.
<P>
	The member talks about the rehash of Canada. I remind her that 
despite our differences and despite our flaws, we have been chosen 
for several years in a row as the best country in the world in which 
to live. Yes, there is room for improvement, but if the Reform Party 
suggests that Canada is a rehash, it should call itself the regress 
party.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to either the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs or the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, Daniel Johnson repeated what he, his party and all 
other Quebecers had heard and understood, namely that the Prime 
Minister had undertaken to make  constitutional changes in line 
with Quebec's aspirations. That is why Mr. Johnson urged Ottawa 
to act quickly on its referendum promises.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister, his deputy or the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs admit that setting up a phoney 
committee to save Canada is only a tactic to water down the Prime 
Minister's commitments, but a tactic that fools no one, not even 
former allies of the no side like Daniel Johnson and Liza Frulla, 
who are now asking him to deliver the goods quickly?
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, again, I think that the official opposition is hard of 
hearing. The Prime Minister made promises and he will honour 
them.
<P>
	This past week-end, the special convention of the Liberal Party 
passed a number of resolutions, which we will do our best to help 
implement. The unity committee that was struck and that I chair is 
to look not only at how the Prime Minister's promises can be 
fulfilled, but also at possible corrective measures to make Canada 
an even better place.
<P>
	I wish that the official opposition would do its job, which is to 
help make Canada a better place, instead of systematically 
attempting to destroy the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> In this regard, Mr. 
Speaker, are we to understand that the Prime Minister intends to 
take the advice of the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, which was suggesting that, 
to save face, all he would have to do is to offer Quebecers a 
symbolic recognition of the distinct society and a so-called right of 
veto?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, again, we must bear in mind that the Prime Minister made 
promises concerning the distinct society and the right of veto and 
that he will keep his promises.
<P>
	But at the same time we must not forget that the Leader of the 
Official Opposition very clearly stated that he would reject any 
constitutional proposal and refuse to consider any offer made by 
the federal government. So, in this instance, the Prime Minister is 
the one who is trying to go ahead and give something to Quebecers, 
but his efforts are being thwarted by the inflexible and hard line 
approach taken by the official opposition and its leader.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, every time this 
government holds a debate on peacekeeping it is a total sham. The 
decisions are already made and there is no free vote.
<P>
	Last week I sent a letter to the Prime Minister requesting that he 
respect the will of Parliament and allow a free vote on a clear 
peacekeeping proposal. Now that the government has had time to 
think about it, I would like an answer. Does Parliament get a free 
vote, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	As he knows, while the peace accord was signed, from the 
Dayton, Ohio discussions it appears it will be some time before the 
accord is actually ratified. He would be aware that there are a lot of 
perturbations going on in Bosnia with respect to the details of the 
accord itself, such things as the width of the corridor in 
northeastern Bosnia, the disposition of war criminals potential and 
also the difficulty with the management of the Sarajevo situation.
<P>
	On behalf of the Prime Minister and the ministers of defence and 
foreign affairs, I can guarantee the hon. member that there will be a 
debate. The opposition parties will have their input. But I cannot 
say when this debate will take place. I hope it will be soon, but it 
cannot take place until the accord is actually agreed to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess I missed 
the yes or no in that answer. I am sure it was there somewhere.
<P>
	In my letter to the Prime Minister I asked him for a genuine 
debate on peacekeeping. In order to have that debate, we require 
details. We need to know the budget, the maximum duration, the 
mandate. The government has not even told us the size or the role 
of the Canadian contingent.
<P>
	When is the government going to provide these details? Is it just 
planning to keep Parliament in the dark as usual?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in response to the hon. member's questions, they are very 
valid.
<P>
	The standing committee on defence, with the input of the third 
party, has agreed to a set of criteria in the white paper. I can assure 
him that these criteria will be looked at. They were developed 
basically by all parties in the  House. We will try to provide 
<P>
<HR>

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, the president of the no committee, Daniel Johnson, 
asked this government to decentralize federal powers, starting with 
those in the manpower training sector.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	Can the Deputy Prime Minister pledge that the social security 
reform, which her party intends to table in the House this week, 
will be an example of decentralization and that, consequently, 
Quebec will have sole authority over manpower training?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the hon. member knows, we will shortly be tabling a new 
Unemployment Insurance Act here in Canada in response to what 
we heard from hundreds of thousands of Canadians who want 
basically a modern system, a system that is sustainable, and a 
system that will provide Canadians with a set of tools to get back to 
work quickly.
<P>
	Part and parcel of what Canadians are calling for is greater 
decentralization and empowerment of local communities to make 
the decisions that best suit their local realities. The objectives that 
Canadians have set will be of course honoured in the new 
employment bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary is for the Deputy Prime Minister. This week, we 
will discuss a concrete issue, namely vocational training, and we 
are anxious to see how the government will decentralize powers.
<P>
	Are we to understand that, by refusing to make the social 
security reform an example of decentralization, the government is 
clearly showing that the commitments made by the Prime Minister 
in Verdun were just a smoke screen?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I do not know where the hon. member gets the impression that we 
are not willing to reform Canada's social security system. Just as a 
reminder, it was the federal government that embarked on this very 
important legislative process to modernize Canada's social security 
system.
<P>
	I want to tell the hon. member, who is extremely concerned 
about the role of the provinces in this particular case, that the 
provinces will be brought in as very effective partners, along with 
local stakeholders, to make sure that the type of training Canadians 
need is in tune with the times and will get Canadians back to work 
very quickly.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was 
recently reported that the 1994-95 cable TV bill for providing cable 
services to prisoners at the Mountain and Kent institutions totalled 
nearly $60,000. That is for one year.
<P>
	Criminals should be punished for their crimes. Yet we have 
murderers, thieves, rapists, and drug dealers being treated to such 
luxury as cable TV, compliments of the taxpayer.
<P>
	My question is for the solicitor general. Why is he wasting 
taxpayers' money to provide prisoners with cable TV when many 
of our law-abiding citizens and seniors cannot even afford to keep 
it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I think my hon. friend is mistaken in his allegations. If my 
recollection is correct, the system is being switched so that the cost 
of cable TV is being paid for by the prisoners themselves. I think 
that is something he should be happy to support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Solicitor General should get his facts straight. The salaries the 
prisoners make in prison are paid for by the taxpayers. It is still 
taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Federal prisoners in federal institutions are sitting on their duffs 
watching cable TV to the tune of $1 million a year. Whatever 
happened to hard time?
<P>
	Will the minister show some strength of character and announce 
immediately that all TVs will be removed from federal prisons, yes 
or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when prisoners get paid it is basically for work they do or 
programming they are involved with in prisons. It is part of the 
process so that when they get out they do not offend again, which I 
hope is something the hon. member will support.
<P>
	I repeat, the cost of TV in prisons is being borne by prisoners 
themselves. I do not understand why the hon. member is more 
concerned about this than matters of jobs or Canadian unity, but if 
he wants to be, I am happy to answer his questions.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of the Environment surely knows that her colleague, the 
Minister of Natural Resources will, as early as mid-December, fob 
off on the private sector a site located in Quebec which could be 
contaminated by nuclear waste. Indeed, a public servant involved 
in the sale wrote that: ``If the site is contaminated, we may be 
forced to decontaminate it, even after the sale''.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>

environmental challenges into economic opportunities''?

	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I must confess that I am not sure I understand the hon.

2,500 acres owned by AECL in the province of Quebec, AECL will 
be selling 250 acres of that site. The contractual negotiations are 
ongoing at this time.

	Now that the report of the special commission on restructuring

is of importance to all members of the House.
<P>
	I have to tell the hon. member, and I believe the House is aware, 
that this spring a special commission was struck on the 
restructuring of Canada's reserves. The commission was chaired by 
a retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. Two 
acknowledged experts in the field were his compatriots on the 
study. The study was completed at the end of last month and was 
reported to the minister and indeed to the parliamentary committee.

	The Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans 
Affairs is now in its third week of hearing witnesses with respect to 
the recommendations that were made on the report, which was

which allows first degree murderers to appeal their sentence after 
serving only 15 years of a life term.

unacceptable provision by ensuring that Bill C-226 is brought

is to hear the hon. member asking about a new and important 
subject.
<P>
	Last spring, when the private member's bill was before the 
House, there was in effect a free vote on the question of whether it 
should go to committee. It went to committee. Shortly afterwards I 
wrote to the chair of the committee and asked that the committee 
arrange to have hearings on the bill early on. Those hearings were

	I have urged the committee to look at the question of section 745 
in the broader context of penalties for murder. I hope it does that. I

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
motivates, at least in part, my question to the justice minister is 
my knowledge of his stand on Bill C-226 when it came before 
the House.
<P>
	I say to the justice minister that Darrel Crook, the convicted 
murderer of RCMP Constable Brian King, is appealing his parole 
ineligibility for first degree murder this February.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	Will the minister put a stop to the further torment of Brian 
King's widow or will he subject her to reliving the brutal death of 
her husband one more time? Will he support the elimination of 
section 745 from the Criminal Code? Will he tell us of his intention 
today?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney </B><B>General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I met last June in my office with 
Marie King Forest, the widow of Constable King. I had an 
opportunity to discuss with her firsthand the effect that the 
application has had on her and her family.
<P>
	More than anything else, it was my perception that her exclusion 
from the process was enormously hurtful. That in large part 
motivated the change in section 745 which I brought before the 
House in Bill C-41, which guarantees the role for the victim in the 
section 745 hearing. This change was brought about largely due to 
my meeting with Marie King Forest.
<P>
	I do not believe the issue is so simple that it can be dealt with 
solely by the repeal of section 745. I have made every effort to 
encourage the hon. member, the House and the committee to see 
that question in the broader context of penalties for the crime of 
murder.
<P>
	As the committee examines that broader question, I shall have 
something to say by way of what I hope are constructive 
suggestions as to how it might improve the regime for murder 
penalties in Canada. This will include the question of the 
application provided for in section 745.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the heritage minister.
<P>
	In response to a question put to him last June about the fact that 
the Canadian sports guide was published in English only, the 
heritage minister promised to have the Official Languages Act 
enforced in organizations that his department awards funding to. I 
wanted to remind him of that promise.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that several sports associations 
that his department is responsible for, such as Badminton Canada, 
Water Ski Canada and a dozen other associations, are still 
publishing their annual reports in English only?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, since that time, we have taken steps to negotiate an 
accountability framework for the various federations receiving 
financial assistance from the federal government.
<P>
	If our hon. colleague has additional information, I will be 
pleased to look at it, but the policy I outlined has not changed: we 
expect these documents to be published in both official languages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
never heard of legislation being open to negotiation in this House 
before.
<P>
	Here is my supplementary question: How can the minister 
explain that, this year, for the first time, Football Canada's report 
was published in English only, if not by the fact that francophones 
are the first ones to bear the brunt of budget cuts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I will remind our hon. colleague that the funding of 
sports governing bodies does not come under any statute of the 
Parliament of Canada nor directly under the Official Languages 
Act. Arrangements are made by my department to make sure that 
French is used as it should be in Canada. But the law was not 
broken in this case.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the solicitor general. Some time ago, the RCMP 
suspended Sergeant Gaétan Délisle for running in a municipal 
election and being elected Mayor of Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu. 
This individual has been campaigning for years to defend the right 
of RCMP officers to form a professional association.
<P>
	How can the solicitor general justify Sergeant Délisle's 
suspension, when other RCMP officers elected to public office in 
their communities have never been suspended from their jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
according to the information I have, the other officers the hon. 
member is referring to were elected as school board trustees and 
not as mayors. The regulations prohibit any officer from running 
for mayor, for member of a provincial legislature, or for member of 
Parliament. It is also a matter of internal discipline. This whole 
matter will be reviewed thoroughly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
remind the solicitor general that the rules that now apply to the 
RCMP used to also apply to the Public Service Act, and that this act 
was ruled unconstitutional and obsolete. I therefore ask the 
solicitor general if he intends to intercede with the Commissioner 
of the RCMP to defend Sergeant Délisle's democratic rights and 
stop the RCMP management's harassment campaign against him?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of

once again, according to my information, the Supreme Court ruling 
has no direct bearing on Staff Sergeant Délisle's case. In any event,

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, due to 
popular demand the federal government's cash buyout program 
aimed at reducing the public service is expected to cost an extra 
$500 million in addition to the original cost of $1 billion. These 
expensive buyout programs are costing the taxpayers millions of 
dollars and are giving some lucky public servants a golden 
handshake similar to winning the lottery.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	Will the President of the Treasury Board confirm that the

been a long time since so much has been given by so many to 
so few?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
government initiated these programs it obviously went to the 
private sector to see what was being done there. Certainly what we 
are doing is very comparable to the private sector.
<P>
	My colleague fails to understand there has been an initial rush on 
that program. There have been more people than expected. Yes, it 
may reach $2.3 billion, but during that same period of time $4.2 
billion will be saved and $2.2 billion per year thereafter. That is a 
clear saving.
<P>
	I am really quite surprised that my colleague would make such a 
charge. It is unfounded and completely incorrect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, talking 
about the private sector, the National Capital Commission is 
cutting 400 jobs by contracting work out to employee takeover 
companies. Spokesperson Diane Dupuis said that the project works 
because employees will receive less pay and benefits in the private 
sector than they would as public servants.
<P>
	Would the parliamentary secretary please tell us why civil 
servants are paid more than private sector employees, have better 
job security than private sector employees and have far more 
generous buyout packages than what one could have in the private 
sector?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
already indicated that the first question was totally erroneous, that 
there is going to be savings over time.
<P>
	With respect to the second question that if one privatizes or 
commercializes there would be a particular savings because people 
would earn less, we all know that sometimes it works that way but 
other times it is completely the opposite. In this case we are 
keeping those programs we need to keep. We are keeping those 
civil servants we need in order to give the best service to 
Canadians. In certain cases we are looking at alternatives which is a 
wise, sensible and sensitive way to proceed.

I find this bill unfortunate for Quebec, because it is an attempt 
to set up institutions that already exist in Quebec and work very 
well there.
<P>
	I said that the great misfortune of the Canadian federal system is 
this business of duplication and that a policy of decentralization 
had to be implemented as quickly as possible. The people of 
Quebec, like elsewhere across the country, have spoken in favour 
of more decentralization.
<P>
	Here is the government introducing Bill C-100, which goes 
against the trend and the wish expressed by so many people. 
Common sense itself dictates the need for more decentralization in 
Canada. Quebec has already suffered considerably from the 
wastage caused by departmental duplication. I was saying that, 
according to certain studies submitted to the Bélanger-Campeau 
commission, including the one done by Pierre Fortin, duplication 
cost Quebec alone some $3 billion a year. This money is wasted. 
This is pure and simple loss. Not only is it money lost, but it means 
departments and governments are unable to function and to provide 
people with quality services.
<P>
	It seems to me that, if I were in government, and I wanted to save 
this great and fine country of Canada, I would undertake to 
decentralize. It seems that it is just good common sense for the 
government to decentralize; it is obvious. If only the people in 
government would listen, it could be done. They would understand 
that, in fact, decentralization is the only way to save the country. I 
repeat: centralization, the federal government's tendency to take 
over powers and to duplicate services already available 
provincially, is costing the Government of Quebec $3 billion. 
Studies have proven this; these are not groundless allegations.
<P>
	Just in the area of transport and communications, there has been 
much talk-call it dispute if you want-much debate about the 
distribution of powers between the federal and provincial 
governments. It is estimated that, in the area of transport and 
communications alone, the shortfall is about $233 million. If the 
responsibility for transport and communications came under only 
one level of government instead of being shared by two 
governments, hence duplication, the Government of Quebec would 
end up with $233 million more in its pocket. So, there is a shortfall 
in that regard.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	It is the same thing with taxes. If there were only one 
government collecting taxes in Quebec, this would generate $299 
million in savings. In other words, this much, $299 million, is lost, 
squandered, because of duplication and overlap between our 
respective departments.
<P>
	I could give you more examples, with respect to regional 
development and business assistance for instance. In fact, Bill 
C-100 is brought forward under the pretext of providing assistance 
to businesses, when there are well established new business 
start-up services in Quebec to assist small business. Why more 
duplication? Why establish more agencies and institutions that we 
already have at the provincial level?
<P>
	Same thing with health and culture. The worst of all, of course, is 
manpower training, an area where the federal government is 
essentially copying the services provided by the province, 
duplicating programs. This duplication is apparently responsible 
for a $250 million shortfall in Quebec and, again, not only is 
money being lost, squandered, but manpower training is not being 
conducted.
<P>
	We are told that, in Quebec, thousands of jobs may have 
remained vacant because this training was not provided. In many 
cases, these jobs require special technological training. Since this 
training was not provided because of intergovernmental 
duplication, the people who should be holding these jobs end up 
either on unemployment or on welfare because of the government, 
again, because of this duplication.
<P>
	This creates not only deplorable waste but also a great deal of 
poverty. In fact, this keeps a number of people unemployed and on 
social assistance. Of course, the federal government does not have 
a good reputation in this area so far. You know as well as I do, Mr. 
Speaker, that since the last budget the federal government has 
introduced a whole series of measures to make cuts in 
unemployment insurance, in the health sector, in education, and 
even in old age pensions, which all amount to rather virulent 
attacks against the most vulnerable in our society.
<P>
	Allow me to quote from an article by Jean-Robert Sansfaçon that 
appeared in the May 2 edition of <I>Le Devoir</I>: ``To this day, the only 
result of the federal government's social reforms has been to move 
people from unemployment to welfare rolls. Yet, one does not have 
to be a separatist to know that the provinces are in a better position 
than the central government to find the solutions that can best meet 
the needs of their people''.
<P>
	In fact, we should all learn this lesson, which is constantly 
repeated in this House. The lesson is that the provincial 
government is often in a better position to fulfil certain functions, 
as in the case of financial institutions. Unfortunately, Bill C-100 
would put in place institutions that already exist at the provincial 
level. What a waste.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-100, an act to amend OSFI and CDIC 
and related acts.

<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	Looking back in history, some years ago we had what were then 
known as the four pillars of our financial industry, which were the 
banks, the trust companies, the insurance companies, and the 
brokers. At that time, the government of the day saw fit to allow the 
banks to break down these barriers among the four pillars of the 
financial industry. So the banks started to take over the trust 
companies and the brokerage houses. Today, as we know, the banks 
virtually control the other two pillars of the industry, which only 
leaves the insurance companies, which by and large are removed 
from the banks. At this point we still have a clear separation of 
what banks can do in the insurance industry, and insurance 
companies are kept out of the banking industry.
<P>
	We know there is serious lobbying and serious pressure by the 
banking industry to get into the insurance business, which is going 
to take away the pillars of our financial industry that kept us four 
square on the ground and leave us standing on one leg. I am not 
exactly sure that we are going to find that standing on one leg 
interminably is actually going to be good for our health. It might 
get a little cramped and painful after a while.
<P>
	I have some serious concerns about the wisdom in the long term 
about decisions such as allowing the conglomeration of all the 
financial services in this country to come into the realm of the 
banks. Without being derogatory to the banks, there are not that 
many of them left. We have a very serious concentration of power 
in the hands of a very small number of elite people in this country, 
all of whom are unknown, unelected, and responsible to no one, 
hardly even to their shareholders.
<P>
	The banks are such a complex business that those people 
involved in the senior management of the banks would have great 
problems, I am sure, trying to explain the intricacies of their jobs to 
the shareholders who own their business and to the depositors who 
participate or create the business to the benefit of the country and to 
the government at large.
<P>
	As I have said, I have serious concerns about the wisdom of 
taking the four pillars of the financial institutions and making them 
into one.
<P>
	I know the banks have always put forth the argument that 
competition requires that they get bigger. When we look around the 
world we see some behemoths as far as the financial world is 
concerned. I understand the merger of the Chase Manhattan Bank 
and the Chemical Bank in the United States will create an 
organization of $300 billion in size. That is truly a behemoth under 
any rule we wish to use.
<P>
	However, here in Canada we are a small country. If we are to 
agree that big is beautiful in the world of international finance, we 
cannot have it both ways. We can either have competition with a 
large number of  competing companies or we can meet the desire to 
be large and compete on an international scale by using the same 
measures as the huge banks around the world. Therefore we may 
end up having a choice between big banks and no competition or 
small banks and much competition, or we may have to have an 
arrangement or a comprise in between.
<P>
	I say that competition surely is the way to go. When we look 
around the world we always find that competition brings out the 
best in business. It brings out the best service, the best products, 
and the best prices. I am sure that rule applies to the financial 
industry every bit as much as it applies to every other industry that 
serves our Canadian public.
<P>
	The other argument for competition is these huge banks that are 
being created around the world. It was earlier this year when the 
first surprise was sprung upon the world with the Barings Bank 
disappearing overnight with a $1 billion loss, all because of one 
rogue trader in one office who was on the opposite side of the world 
from the head office. The entire organization was destroyed 
overnight.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	A couple of months ago one of the Japanese banks in New York 
admitted to losing $1 billion. Again it was the fault of one rogue 
trader, who perhaps was in collusion with others within the 
organization. That overnight loss was revealed to the general 
public.
<P>
	In the last decade there was a $500 billion loss in the savings and 
trust loans fiasco in the United States. Now we are facing a 
situation in Japan, where the largest of the world banks have been 
based for some time, in which losses may be as high as $1 trillion. 
That is a tremendous vote of non-confidence in people's ability to 
manage institutions that big.
<P>
	That is why competition is vitally important. Bigger is not 
necessarily better.
<P>
	Bill C-101 deals primarily with two things: the Canadian 
Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions. I would like to talk about 
the CDIC.
<P>
	The CDIC is sponsored by government to insure deposits within 
the federally regulated banking system up to $60,000. We thought 
it was working well for many years because there was never a 
claim. However, in the last few years we have seen quite a number 
of institutions that have been claiming on a regular basis, from the 
vast sums of money claimed by Confederation Life to other trust 
companies that have failed over the years. They have cost the 
Canadian taxpayer large sums of money.
<P>
	It is time for us to take a new look at the situation. This bill 
unfortunately goes a short way by proposing rated premiums for 
the CDIC, which will be based on its assessment of the risk. It will 
vary the premiums  according to the risk. The bad thing is that the 
CDIC intends to do this behind closed doors. That I cannot accept. 
If they think they are going to tell a financial institution that the 
risk is high and therefore the premium on the deposits is high, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16842"> 16842 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian public must be made aware that there is a potential risk 
involved in the financial institution and be governed accordingly.
<P>
	About a decade ago in my home province of Alberta we had a 
fiasco called Principal Trust. I know that was a provincially 
regulated institution, but the principle is still the same. If an 
institution that is being fraudulently managed wants to work behind 
the veil of secrecy, it can do so, making the Canadian public 
vulnerable to loss.
<P>
	It is absolutely vital that the information be provided upfront. I 
cannot see any harm in that. I do not see how an institution can 
prevent it from becoming public knowledge.
<P>
	We all know that once the bill is adopted the premium ratings 
will be applied. All it requires is someone at the annual meeting of 
the financial institution to ask what is the rating of the premium 
paid to the CDIC. They will either find out or management will lie 
to the shareholders. I hope they will not lie to the shareholders. The 
information should become public very quickly. I see no real 
reason for the information to be kept private.
<P>
	Another thing regarding the CDIC, which perhaps has more of a 
bearing on the government than the CDIC, is the fact that if it needs 
money it will be given the opportunity to borrow the money on the 
open market rather than dipping into the consolidated revenue 
fund. While it may seem a fairly innocuous change, if we look 
more closely we see it is another way to slide borrowings off the 
balance sheet of the Government of Canada and on to the private 
sector so that they will not show up in the public accounts of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	It is shameful and disgraceful the government would even 
propose such a move. If the government is to stand behind the 
deposits of investors, let it show in its records what it is costing 
taxpayers. It is shameful the government would even propose the 
amendment to which I am totally and absolutely opposed.
<P>
	The money markets of the country are not the place in which to 
subsidize the losses of financial institutions that create the money 
markets in the first place. We could go around and around in ever 
increasing circles and accomplish absolutely nothing.
<P>
	The government should be prepared to stand up to its 
obligations, have the information in front of the public, tell people 
what is happening and let the people decide while the government 
still enjoys their confidence. If they do not we know the 
consequences. To hide behind the barriers and the veils of secrecy 
cannot be tolerated in this day and age. On OSFI the veil is being 
drawn even  more tightly than on CDIC, perhaps with even more 
disastrous results.
<P>
	We can look at some of the items in the white paper released by 
the government back in February 1995 prior to the tabling of the 
legislation. OSFI's role is to monitor and supervise financial 
institutions to ensure that they are safe for the general public to 
invest in. The government has come up with the phrase that it is a 
privilege rather than a right to own a financial institution. I tend to 
agree with the statement that no one has the right to own a financial 
institution if it allows them to rip off the public and hence the 
Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	There are four steps that OSFI envisages if an institution were to 
decline financial help. In stage one, the early warning stage, the 
management and the board of directors of financial institutions are 
formally notified by OSFI of concerns and requested to take 
measures to rectify the situation. Perhaps it is not as strong as we 
would like it to be. Therefore some directives are being issued.
<P>
	In stage two the financial health of the institution has continued 
to deteriorate in the opinion of OSFI. At that point senior OSFI 
officers meet with the management and board of directors of the 
financial institution and with the external auditor of the institution 
to outline concerns and discuss remedial actions. The management 
and board of directors are formerly notified that the institution is 
being placed on the regulatory watch list. That is more involvement 
by OSFI which perhaps at that stage is not bad. OSFI is getting 
more and more involved in the daily administration of the 
institution.
<P>
	If it continues to slide it gets into stage three where the 
management and the board of directors and external auditor of the 
institution are informed of the problems. Depending on 
circumstances, pressures may be exerted on the management and 
the board of directors to restructure the institution or to seek an 
appropriate prospective purchaser.
<P>
	That brings us to stage four. The organization is continuing to 
deteriorate. The government's says that pressure to rectify the 
situation is exerted on the management and the board of directors 
of the financial institution with frequent meetings with senior 
officers. If statutory conditions for taking control of the assets exist 
and if circumstances are such that there is an immediate threat to 
the safety of depositors and other creditors, OSFI may take control 
of the assets of the institution for a short period.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	While the financial institution is still solvent everything in steps 
one, two, three and four have taken place behind closed doors, in 
secrecy. They have watched the institution deteriorate. They have 
become more and more closely involved with the management of 
the institution on a daily basis. It may be that their  management 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16843"> 16843 </A></B>
<P>
has caused the institution to deteriorate. While the institution is 
still solvent they took upon themselves the authority to seize it and 
manage it.
<P>
	I hope this is a democratic country. If it is, that cannot be 
tolerated. We cannot have an agency of government getting 
intimately involved in the daily management of the affairs of a 
financial institution, participating in the decline of the financial 
health of the institution and seizing control of the institution prior 
to it becoming insolvent. That is not democratic and that has to be 
opposed.
<P>
	I stand fully behind the idea that we have solid, sound financial 
institutions, but I do not stand behind the idea that the government 
shall get into bed behind closed doors, dictate to the management 
of a financial institution and seize it if it does not like the proposals 
coming from management. Also I do not like the idea that we have 
rated premiums which are supposed to be kept secret from CDIC.
<P>
	It is time to rethink the entire bill and talk about such things as 
co-insurance. The government could perhaps ensure 90 or 95 per 
cent of deposits up to a certain limit. At that time investors would 
know they have a potential exposure. Perhaps it is small but 
nonetheless it is exposure. In that way they would take more of an 
interest in their money and more of an interest in financial 
institutions. It is the same as the bond rating system in place for 
governments, for institutions and for money markets. They are 
rated according to financial strength, soundness, liquidity and so 
on. They have a rating which people know when they put up their 
money. The same could quite easily apply up front, above board, in 
the open so Canadian depositors know how well financial 
institutions are being run.
<P>
	As far as the supervision of institutions that are falling short is 
concerned, Canadians need to be assured that the government is 
looking over their shoulders. We saw in the <I>Financial Post</I> over the 
weekend that the managers of a brokerage house a number of years 
ago are off to prison because they helped themselves to several 
million dollars of the company's money and mismanaged the 
company to the point of losing quite a number of millions of 
dollars.
<P>
	I hope that is not the type of supervision we are looking at. I hope 
we will be able to monitor rather than get into daily management of 
the organization. We will be asking them to ensure they meet the 
margins they require and that the risks are not being totally 
ignored.
<P>
	As I said earlier, Japan is now looking at $1 trillion in bad debts 
because they all jumped on the same bandwagon and inflated real 
estate to such an astronomical or exorbitant price that people were 
getting 100-year mortgages to try to pay for the property they were 
buying. The banks caused the problem. They are the ones that now 
have to suffer the problem. The taxpayers  in Japan will be left 
holding the bag as they did in the United States under the 
Resolution Trust situation.
<P>
	Let us get the situation out in the open now while it is sound and 
while we can see it. If warts are to grow on our financial 
institutions, let us watch them grow rather than wait until the 
cancerous growth will kill us.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	The government could have done much more in conjunction 
with financial institutions to make it an open system, an 
accountable system, a system that would work. Then Canadians 
would know what is going on and would have some faith in it.

	The House resumed from December 13 consideration of Bill 
C-52, an act to establish the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services and to amend and repeal certain acts, as 
reported (with amendments) from the committee; and of Motions 
Nos. 2 and 3.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When Bill C-52 was last 
before the House the hon. member for Elk Island had 
approximately two minutes remaining on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I realized there 
were some hazards when I got into the political  business, but I did 
not realize I would be interrupted for 349 days, almost a year, on an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16844"> 16844 </A></B>
<P>
important statement that I was making. Because I have so little 
time left I want to get right to the statement.
<P>
	Bill C-52 would put into action a decision made by the previous 
government to establish the department and we are dealing with 
some amendments to the bill. I go on record as reviewing what I 
said almost a year ago and emphasizing as strongly as I can that I 
think we would make a gross error in approving some of the items 
in the bill unless we accept the amendment proposed by the Bloc to 
delete clause 16.
<P>
	We run the risk of actually losing the very foundation of the 
economic system of the country, namely free enterprise or the 
private initiative to go out and get it. The government has taken it 
upon itself to tax everyone to death and use that money to subsidize 
activities that should properly take place in the private sector and, 
most important, to compete unfairly with it.
<P>
	It is unjustifiable to force businesses to pay taxes and then use 
that money to provide the services the companies are in the 
business of providing. It is a contradiction that will destroy the 
economic basis of the country if we proceed. I emphasize as 
strongly as possible that we should not do what the bill proposes, 
which is to give the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services carte blanche to do anything for anyone as the bill 
proposes, just anything that he decides, using government 
departments to provide engineering services, printing services, 
advertising services, all the services which many businesses 
depend on in order to provide for their employees for their very 
survival.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Instead, we have this move by the government to give the 
minister unbridled ability to do whatever he or she wants in terms 
of competing with private enterprise. That is a wrong principle.
<P>
	Let us ask for some careful thought on the part of the 
government. Let us not wait until the other place has to be the 
Chamber of sober second thought. Let us do some sober thinking in 
this Chamber and defeat this bill unless we can get the amendments 
for which we asked.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me commend the hon. 
member for Elk Island for being so patient and waiting all those 
number of days to close his intervention. It seems just like 
yesterday that he spoke on this very important matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to resume the debate.
<P>
	When I heard my hon. colleague say this bill will somehow 
shake up or destroy the economic system of the nation, I think there 
is some exaggeration.
<P>
	I heard my colleague say we are forcing businesses to pay taxes. 
My goodness, I think most businesses pay taxes rather willingly. 
Some have questioned some sections of the bill, but they have also 
acknowledged some of the meaningful changes that have been 
made.
<P>
	When he suggests there ought to sober thinking here, I hope 
there is thinking and that the people who are doing the thinking are 
sober. If that is so, it would be sober thinking.
<P>
	It has been almost a year since we debated this bill, as my 
colleague has pointed out. With Bill C-52, an act to establish the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services, four 
common service agencies are being integrated into one: Supply and 
Services Canada; Public Works Canada; the Translation Bureau 
and the Government Telecommunications Agency. The bill has a 
single and simple purpose, integration. The government is setting 
out a solid legislative process for integrating virtually all common 
service agencies within one organization. The result will be 
increased savings, efficiency and improvement in services for 
government, business and, most important, the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Through overlap and duplication reduction, system streamlining 
and expertise pooling, the cumulative savings for the Canadian 
taxpayer will be approximately $180 million by 1997-98.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are talking here about integrating four former departments. 
We are talking about efficiency and about improving services to all 
Canadians. We are also talking about saving taxpayers' money.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Under this bill, the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services will have the authority to provide services in several 
areas, including acquisition of material and services for other 
departments, printing and publishing, communications and 
translation, real property services, including the administering of 
federal real estate, realty services and architectural and engineering 
services, acting as a receiver general, providing administrative 
services such as management consulting, information services 
audit, accounting and financial management.
<P>
	The authorities contained in Bill C-52 essentially reflect those 
contained in the legislation of the four components of government 
that are being amalgamated. However, changes were made to 
modernize the legislative responsibilities of the department and to 
ensure consistency across the newly amalgamated organizations.
<P>
	The Public Works Act dates back to 1867 and the Supply and 
Services Act back to 1969.

<P>
	We are merging four former departments. We take into account 
the legislation of these departments, of course, but we also 
modernize.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-52 is about savings, efficiency, improved services. The 
integration of virtually all common service agencies into one 
department is achieving savings, increasing efficiency and 
improving services by reducing overlap and duplication, 
streamlining systems and pooling expertise. This will ensure the 
most efficient and cost effective delivery of our services and 
generate significant savings for Canadians, savings I have 
indicated previously in the magnitude of $180 million annually.
<P>
	As a result of budget and program review decisions, the 
department will reduce the workforce in five years by 5,263 full 
time equivalent positions, or by about 30 per cent of its current 
population. About 85 per cent of these reductions will occur by the 
end of 1997-1998 fiscal year.
<P>
	This is about competition. The minister recognizes that more 
than ever the government has to be sensitive to the needs of the 
private sector and the real and legitimate concerns about unfair 
competition from the public sector. That is why the minister has 
moved swiftly to rectify the situation when specific examples of 
unfair competition have been brought to his attention.
<P>
	In the case of architectural and engineering services, the minister 
has directed a review take place to determine the most cost 
effective means to deliver these types of services for the 
government as a whole.
<P>
	A consultative committee has been established to guide this 
review, with representatives from industry associations and firms 
as well as union and government officials participating, including 
members of the Association of Consulting Engineers of Canada.
<P>
	The minister has stated on several occasions that the department 
will not be allowed to compete against the private sector. This 
legislation will only be used by the department to support Canadian 
businesses to expand successfully, I might add, and to obtain a 
greater share of global markets, as well as to reduce overlapping 
duplication in all levels of government.
<P>
	This bill has now the inclusion of a requirement for an order in 
council. The inclusion of a requirement for an order in council in 
section 16, proposed by the member for Guelph-Wellington, will 
ensure that the government obtain full direction from cabinet 
before the authority contained in this section is exercised and, 
therefore, ensuring accountability.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-52, an act to 
establish the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services and to amend and repeal certain acts, as reported (with 
amendments) from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 2 and 3.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill is a further safeguard to 
ensure that the government is committed to govern with integrity 
and will take every measure necessary to restore confidence in the 
institutions of government.
<P>
	This bill is about public-private partnering. The Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services is committed to further 
investigation and development of a potential for partnering. He is 
working at building the kinds of partnerships and working 
arrangements which will be beneficial to the government, the 
business community and the people of Canada. This commitment 
is shared by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Bill C-52 is needed to allow the minister to fulfil his 
commitment to further investigate and develop the potential for 
beneficial public-private partnering and working arrangements as 
well. This bill is about the efficiency of the federation.
<P>
	PWGSC is contributing to the efficiency of the federation 
initiatives in the area of shared government support services. 
Priority areas identified include infomatics, procurement and realty 
services. PWGSC is in the process of negotiating with the 
provinces and territories on shared government support services.
<P>
	Bill C-52 will enhance efficiency of the federation initiatives in 
that it will simplify administrative processes, leading to sharing 
arrangements with other levels of government.
<P>
	Bill C-52 is about good government and improving services. It is 
essential that we get on with this bill. I look forward to the support 
of my colleagues.
<P>
	This bill is about responsible and responsive government. We 
have consulted extensively with the Association of Consulting 
Engineers of Canada, the ACEC, and have made every effort to 
accommodate the concerns of this special interest group.

<P>
	We recognize that the issue raised is a very important one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First, we have put forward two separate amendments to section 
16 of the bill, one at committee stage clarifying that the department 
would only provide services outside the federal government at the 
request of another level of government or private sector firm.
<P>
	The member for Guelph-Wellington has now also introduced 
an amendment stating that this will be done only after receiving 
governor in council approval.
<P>
	Second, the minister has directed his department to undertake a 
comprehensive review of the levels of out-sourcing of the 
government's architectural and engineering requirements. For this 
review, a consultative committee comprised of industry, union and 
government representatives has been established to provide advice 
throughout all phases.
<P>
	This study is now under way with a report expected in the spring.

modernizing. We are responsive to the issues raised by a number of 
people and we are trying to be sensitive to their concerns. I believe 
this bill does just that.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 6</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-52, in Clause 17, be amended by replacing lines 5 to 16, on page 
6, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``17. The Minister may, subject to any regulations that the Treasury Board 
may make for the purposes of this section, charge for services provided by the

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
motion is proposed essentially to allow the government to be more 
open in its method of setting the price of goods and services. Our 
suggestion, basically, is that all changes involving the price of 
supplies, the awarding of contracts or almost anything else be 
published in the <I>Gazette </I>and even in daily newspapers.
<P>
	Clause 17 in fact gives the government or the minister the right 
to change the charges for passports, for example, or for any other 
service the government supplies at the present time. The minister 
would be entitled under this section to change the set charges  
without notifying the House or the public in advance. All we want 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16847"> 16847 </A></B>
<P>
is for all changes to be published in the <I>Canada Gazette </I>and in 
newspapers, so that people are informed and the government is 
transparent.
<P>
	The non-transparency of government can be seen in a number of 
areas. Moreover, the government does not even listen to the 
suggestions made by the general public. For example, the 
preceeding clause, 16, contains the same problem as 17: lack of 
transparency or not being attuned to the concerns of the general 
public.
<P>
	Where clause 16 is concerned, it is even more flagrant. It is not 
solely a question of publication, but is really a question of 
respecting private enterprise. The committee even heard 
representations from the Canadian Association of Professional 
Engineers. Engineering representatives joined with more than 12 
other Canadian organizations to oppose clause 16. In fact, that 
group of associations was a coalition of 12 of the most important 
organizations in Canada, including the Canadian Association of 
Professional Engineers, the architects' association, boards of trade, 
the federation of independent business, the Conseil du patronat du 
Québec, and so forth. These 12 associations represent 280,000 
Canadian companies opposed to clause 16. They were violently 
opposed to clause 16 because, with it, the minister assigns himself 
the power to compete with the private business sector, particularly 
in the areas of engineering and architecture.
<P>
	In my opinion, this is an abuse of power. The hon. member for 
St. Boniface said that the minister had no intention of competing 
with the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	However, in a letter sent to committee members, the minister 
himself stressed they did not intend to bid the private sector out of 
the market, but he did say they intended to compete. This is in fact 
abuse of power, because not only does the government not respect 
the opinion of those concerned, as in the case of clause 17, but it 
acts as though nothing was wrong.
<P>
	After all the representations made in committee, the government 
fails to act on this request by the coalition of Canadian 
associations. The hon. member for St. Boniface said that they set 
up a committee to review this sector, at least as far as competition 
between the government and the private sector on engineering and 
architecture projects was concerned, but this is just another phoney 
committee. The federal government is very good at setting up 
committees that do nothing, know nothing, hear nothing and see 
nothing.
<P>
	The committee was set up nearly a year ago. Can you believe it? 
In fact, the president of the coalition, Pierre Franche, told me they 
had yet to meet. Imagine, they have not discussed the problem. In 
fact, he said there was absolutely no hope for any changes, 
especially in clause 16. That is pretty obvious, because today in the 
House,  the government wants to adopt the same clause tabled a 
year ago, without any changes.
<P>
	This is not openness, and this is not necessarily listening to the 
general public. We can hardly say this is a government that is 
working very hard to meet the needs and deal with the concerns of 
Canadian citizens or associations. They are doing nothing. Zilch. 
Not one word changed.
<P>
	In fact, the government's proposal concerning clause 16 is to 
maintain all the elements that have raised the concern of these 12 
Canadian associations which represent 280,000 companies in 
Canada. That is a lot of people. The government did not budge and 
insists on maintaining this clause, while saying, of course, that no, 
this will not necessarily increase the minister's powers: no, the 
minister will not act in such a way as to establish competition with 
private businesses; and no, we will be on our best behaviour. This 
power, accorded the minister under this clause in the bill would not 
be abused.
<P>
	Well, if government members are honest, candid, and really up 
front, as we hope they are, if indeed the minister would not abuse 
this increased power, if indeed he would not use it and if 200,000 
companies in Canada oppose this clause, let the government 
abolish it. It should abolish it. Why are they keeping it saying they 
will not use it, despite the opposition to it? If they keep it, it is 
because, hypocritically, they want to use it.
<P>
	Obviously, the government would not hang onto increased power 
knowing that it would not use it, despite the opposition expressed 
by so many responsible companies and organizations across 
Canada. It wants this power. And this, basically, is why the 
government is keeping the clause intact. What also concerns me is 
that any engineering industry and architectural expertise we may 
have in Canada is mostly concentrated in Quebec.
<P>
	Engineering firms have developed admirably in Quebec. The 
industry is very important to Quebec. It is one of the most 
important ones given all the hydroelectric projects and the 
consultation development done.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Is the federal government positioning itself to set up coalitions 
with certain private corporations in these sectors? Does it want to 
set up coalitions that may compete with and even destroy other 
engineering firms? Could this lead to patronage? Is there a 
possibility of collusion to support certain policies rather than 
others?
<P>
	This provision opens the door to abuse, to competition between 
the government and the private sector. I find this extremely 
dangerous. We have seen, across Canada and around the world, 
several cases in which competition between government and 
private enterprise is never good. This morning, we talked about 
Canada Post, a crown corporation that competes with the private 
sector in the area of courier services and mail advertising  delivery, 
for example. This is costing Canadian taxpayers a lot of money. Do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16848"> 16848 </A></B>
<P>
you know why the federal government is running such a huge debt 
and deficit? It is because it is not really dealing with this.
<P>
	I basically think that clauses 16 and 17 are unfortunate. Again, 
the main purpose of our motion is to ensure maximum openness, so 
that the general public will know exactly what the government is 
doing, because between you and me, Mr. Speaker, this government 
does not always act honestly and in a straightforward manner.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member who has just spoken really was discussing section 
16 of the act rather than the amendment he has put before the 
House regarding advertising in newspapers.
<P>
	While there may be some relevance and I am not arguing that, I 
think he has misunderstood the thrust of the amendment that has 
already been proposed and which is subject to a vote. Also, I think 
he will be well satisfied with this bill and the Canadian public will 
be well satisfied when we have completed the amendments that 
have been proposed in the House today. I think the hon. member for 
Québec-Est knows that perfectly well.
<P>
	I would like to speak in support of the amendment I proposed to 
clause 17 of this bill. Clause 17 deals with the powers of the 
minister to fix certain charges that may apply to the various 
services provided by the minister's department.
<P>
	The government's original intent was that the legislation dealing 
with the departments of public works and government services, 
industry, and heritage would all include an identical clause dealing 
with fees for the sake of consistency and uniformity. However it is 
recognized that public works and government services differs from 
the other two departments in that the focus of its mandate is 
internal to government as opposed to delivering government 
programs to the Canadian public which is the case in the other 
departments I listed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The vast majority of contractual arrangements that the minister 
signs and that involve charging for goods or services are made with 
other federal agencies. Generally speaking, the department delivers 
common services to some 150 federal departments and agencies. 
These services cover a wide range of activities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
They include: providing office furnishings and supplies; consulting 
services; real property and realty services; architectural and 
engineering services; communications and telecommunications 
services; and many more. The important point is that these are 
essentially intergovernmental arrangements that do not impinge  
directly on the department's relations with outside interests.
<P>
	As a result and subsequent to debate on this clause, I put forward 
an amendment to its wording. Under the proposed amendment, the 
full wording of the clause would be as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>17. The minister may, subject to any regulations that the Treasury Board may 
make for the purposes of this section, charge for services provided by the 
department pursuant to this act or any other act in force at the time this section 
comes into force.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Not only does this revised wording simplify the description of 
the minister's power in this area, it also more accurately describes 
the nature of the department and its functions. The use of the words 
``charging for services'' rather than the original wording ``fixing 
fees and charges'' reflects the reality of the service nature of the 
department. It is in line with the wording found in the existing 
Supply and Services Act. For this reason I ask hon. members to 
support this amendment.
<P>
	Clause 17 of this bill as amended establishes a clear, relatively 
simple and unbureaucratic regime for establishing charges for 
services made by the department. It is in line with the general thrust 
of the bill, which is to streamline government operations, reduce 
red tape and make the delivery of common services more cost 
effective.
<P>
	However, the minister's powers in this area are by no means 
unlimited. One of the major constraints is that many of the services 
his department provides to the government are optional; that is, the 
client may accept them or look elsewhere for better value. This in 
itself is a powerful incentive to make sure the department's 
schedule of charges is well thought out and competitive with 
outside sources. Of course in establishing charges the minister 
must take into account the rules and guidelines of his own 
department, the Treasury Board, and other government bodies.
<P>
	By giving the power to set charges to the minister rather than the 
department, clause 17 ensures the minister will be ultimately 
responsible to Parliament to answer any questions that may arise 
with regard to charges.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> As it should be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> As my hon. friend from Hamilton West says, that 
is as it should be. I agree.
<P>
	This being the case, members can rest assured that these powers 
vested in the minister under clause 17 with the amendment I have 
proposed will not be abused. Passage of Bill C-52 with this 
amendment will give the minister the legislative authority he needs 
to continue working for more efficiency and cost effectiveness in 
government operations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16849"> 16849 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the proposed 
amendments to Bill C-52, an act to establish the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services and to amend and repeal 
certain acts.
<P>
	The four proposed amendments-now two, as two have been 
dropped-have been grouped together for debate. All address 
clause 17 of the bill. Clause 17 proposes to allow the minister of 
public works, subject to any regulations the Treasury Board may 
make for the purposes of this clause, the authority to ``fix fees and 
charges that the minister considers appropriate to be applied to 
products, services, rights, privileges, regulatory processes or 
approvals and the use of facilities provided by the minister, the 
department or any other board or agencies of the Government of 
Canada for which the minister has responsibility, including public 
works and federal real property under the administration of the 
minister''.
<P>
	That is a very longwinded way of saying that the minister would 
be free to set fees and charges for any department services under 
his portfolio completely at his discretion. This amount of 
ministerial discretion and power goes too far and is clearly 
unnecessary.
<P>
	This clause moves in exactly the opposite direction to where we 
feel we should be heading. Canadians want a bottom up system of 
decision making. However, proposals such as clause 17, with 
decisions concentrated in the hands of the minister, support a top 
down system of policy and decision making. Somehow the Liberals 
must have their signals crossed, because this is definitely a move in 
the wrong direction. Either they are not listening, which happens 
quite often, or they are hoping to slip one by the public when it is 
not looking. This may explain why the government has sat on this 
bill for so long, nearly a year, because such controversial proposals 
simply will not be accepted by the Canadian public.
<P>
	It is not surprising that a number of amendments have been 
proposed to address this clause. What is surprising is that these 
changes are being proposed in the first place.
<P>
	The first proposed amendment by the member for Québec-Est is 
to change clause 17 so the minister would have to publish any fee 
or charge increases in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> and in no fewer than two 
leading newspapers in each province. This notice must clearly 
indicate the product, services, rights, privileges, regulatory 
processes, approvals or use of facilities provided under subsection 
(1), and the fees or charges that have been fixed or increased.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	However, this proposal would do nothing to change the intent of 
the clause as it stands. The only benefit, and it is a benefit, is that 
the public will be made aware of the changes. But the minister still 
retains complete  discretion in the setting of fees. For this reason, 
this amendment is redundant and I see little cause to support it.
<P>
	The member for Scarborough-Rouge River proposed an 
amendment and then withdrew it. The amendment had the effect 
that the fees and charges for government services did not exceed 
the cost of providing the service. The motion would have restricted 
the minister in how much he or she could raise fees for services. I 
could not have supported that in the long run, so I am pleased to see 
the amendment withdrawn.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary to the leader of the government also 
proposes an amendment to clause 17. However, I fail to see why 
this amendment was proposed in the first place, because it changes 
nothing, except perhaps the wording of a particular clause. The 
intent of clause 17 is the same. Fees would be set by the Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services at his discretion or whim, 
giving the minister far too much discretion, which I am not 
confident he can handle. I cannot in good judgment support this 
amendment either.
<P>
	Motion 7 was proposed by the member for Scarborough-Rouge 
River and is the only amendment to clause 17 that makes any sense. 
Perhaps that was why he withdrew it today. Motion 7 would have 
proposed to delete clause 17 altogether. That made good sense. 
This amendment clearly would have had our support, because 
Canadians are demanding a more open and transparent system of 
government. They want honesty and integrity restored to our 
government.
<P>
	Canadians are simply tired of governments that do not consult 
them, disregard their views, and especially governments that 
conduct key parts of public business behind closed doors. Yet 
closed door politics that allow government ministers to make 
random changes to fees and service charges, with no system to 
scrutinize and oversee changes, can hardly be considered a step in 
the right direction.
<P>
	The Liberal government has made a lot of promises regarding 
open government. We often hear the term open government, but we 
see little action. On the contrary, we have seen quite the reverse. 
This is just one example of the government grasping at more power 
and control. When this government proposes decision making to be 
concentrated in one person, the minister, and conducted behind 
closed doors with no accountability, this is not open government. 
This is a step toward a more autocratic, not democratic, system of 
government.
<P>
	The Liberals promised in the red book that ``open government 
will be the watchword of the Liberal government''. Right. It is 
obvious that the Liberals need to reread their book of promises. 
When put to the test on this government's commitment to open 
government, it has failed miserably again and again.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16850"> 16850 </A></B>
<P>
	It is unfortunate to note that with the problems the government 
has had regarding patronage and abuses of privilege, clause 17 is 
certainly not appropriate. Clause 17 has no criteria in place to 
guide decisions to raise or lower fees. It is completely lacking in 
any system of checks or procedure for making fee changes known 
to the public.
<P>
	In addition, who will scrutinize the minister's decision when 
fees and charges are raised or lowered at his whim? Will it be the 
ethics commissioner, who has been notably absent in a number of 
allegations of impropriety? I rather doubt it.
<P>
	The government is proposing a system that will be left wide open 
to the possibility of abuse. That is what concerns me most with this 
portion of the bill. Unless the government will impose a system of 
checks and balances to ensure accountability, it is best not to leave 
the entire Department of Public Works and Government Services 
and all its operations open to the possibility of abuse.
<P>
	Let me remind the House and Canadians who are watching that 
this is the same government that allowed one of its backbenchers to 
take money from two different government departments for one 
piece of equipment. In this case there was no system of checks and 
balances to assure that the money was used appropriately. This is 
just one example of the government's irresponsibility in the 
managing of taxpayers' money. And now we are looking at a 
proposal to give the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services complete discretion over rates for his department. Give us 
a break.
<P>
	This is the same government that promised to scrap the GST. 
Where is it now? Right back where it was.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	There is a definite lack of accountability. This makes it very 
difficult to consider giving unlimited ministerial discretion. Time 
and again this government has made a mockery of open 
government. Last session closure was invoked on several bills in an 
effort to hide the bills from public scrutiny.
<P>
	In conclusion, Canadians will not tolerate this abuse of privilege 
again and again. Canadians must be allowed to participate in debate 
and decisions. It is time for this government to take a step in the 
right direction, and that is to strike clause 17 from this bill 
altogether.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
general thrust of Bill C-52 is to allow the Minister of Public Works 
and Government Services the opportunity within existing laws and 
regulations to develop the most efficient possible system for 
delivering common services to the government.
<P>
	An amendment has been put forward by the member for 
Kingston and the Islands to clause 17 of the bill, which will allow 
the minister, subject to Treasury Board  regulations, to charge for 
services provided by his department.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is a simple and direct approach to price and fee setting and 
determination.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
This approach reduces to a minimum the administrative time and 
costs involved, both to the department and to its client departments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another amendment to clause 17 proposed by the hon. member 
for Québec-Est would have exactly the opposite effect. Adopting 
this motion would result in substantial additional costs, a heavier 
bureaucratic structure and considerable delay in the price setting 
process for the department's services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This goes directly against the grain of what the government and 
most members want to see; namely, more efficiency and economy 
in government operations and less red tape.

	There is already a framework within government that ensures 
that any authorities granted are being executed to safeguard the 
interests of Canadian taxpayers. It should also be noted that the

Government Services are offered to other departments on an 
optional basis and not to the general public.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, this amendment to clause 20 is once again 
an attempt by the official opposition to provide greater 
transparency in the activities of the Department of Public Works 
and Government Services.
<P>
	We certainly understand that the Department of Public Works 
and Government Services has an important mandate, which is to 
award contracts. However, we also know that there is a lot of 
patronage related to that process, and that is something that can be 
very costly. As you know, the federal government contracts out 
almost $10 billion worth of services every year. The committee 
which reviewed this bill was told at one point by Treasury Board 
that these contracts amounted to only $5 billion. Then we learned 
that it might closer to $7 billion. Now we know that, for all intents 
and purposes, these contracts amount to some $10 billion, and not 
all of them are necessarily justified.
<P>
	Again, we were told by Treasury Board officials that, while the 
government is in favour of relying more on the contracting out 
process, as confirmed from year to year, particularly since the 
Liberals took office, and while that practice has indeed increased, 
Treasury Board has not set up any written assessment system to 
effectively show that this process was good for the government, in 
terms of money saved and increased efficiency.
<P>
	Just recently, the committee heard some Treasury Board officials 
who showed us, through their studies, that the total value of 
non-competitive contracts was greater than that of competitive 
contracts. Just think. Contracts under $30,000 awarded by the 
government are not subject to a bidding process, nor is any 
assessment done by any independent agency or department.
<P>
	In other words, all contracts worth less than $30,000 can be 
awarded to anyone, without any bidding. These are non-competi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16852"> 16852 </A></B>
<P>
tive contracts and, as I said, their total value is greater than that of 
all the contracts which are subject to the competitive bidding 
process.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I think this is outrageous, because we know perfectly well that 
the present government has monstrous debts. It seems to me that a 
responsible government would want to use every means at its 
disposal to ensure that these contracts with agencies that do 
business with the government are honest and efficient.
<P>
	However, there seems to be no desire to take any initiative in this 
respect. The motion on clause 20 is quite straightforward. Its 
purpose is to ensure that all contracts entered into by the 
government with outside firms are published. It is certainly not too 
much to ask the government to publish contracts, if only to inform 
members of contracts entered into in their ridings. This is 
elementary.
<P>
	It is not a matter of cost either, although the government keeps 
saying it would be extremely costly for the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services to table in the House copies of 
contracts entered into with outside firms. It is certainly not too 
costly, since the Quebec government already does this.
<P>
	This mechanism already exists. Clearly, if contracts awarded by 
the government were published, this would be one more way to 
monitor the system, so there would be less patronage involved in 
awarding these contracts. Members of Parliament and others with 
access to this information would be able to draw attention to the 
many cases of abuse that would be easy to detect.
<P>
	However, the government will not budge, it continues its policy 
of concealment and shows no desire to be transparent. As far as we 
are concerned, the kind of information we want is elementary. We 
want to know. This is nothing out of the ordinary. We would have 
this information if the government had the political will to inform 
the general public, but we are not even asking that. We just want 
members of Parliament to be informed, as is the case in Quebec. 
The government has rejected our request. In fact, in the past two 
years we have filed several requests with the Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services for access to this information, and 
we were turned down many times.
<P>
	In my opinion, this refusal on the part of government to make 
contracts entered into with outside firms public seems to be a 
desire to conceal information. It seems to me that it is not a desire 
for transparency, and the fact that waste and patronage may be at a 
very high level in this government perhaps explains why access to 
this information is being refused. Not only does this denote a denial 
of transparency and information, but it is also an obvious reflection 
of the desire, or lack of concern, on the part of the Government to 
try to really reduce waste and misspending when it comes to 
contracts with companies outside the government.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Where subcontracting is concerned, in connection with contracts 
of under $30,000 with no tendering process, I can personally tell 
you that I have met a number of people who are familiar with all 
the tricks used within the public service, all those readily 
implemented tricks that can be used to get impressive amounts out 
of the government, under the pretext that they are non-tendered, 
non-competitive contracts. Shockingly high amounts have been 
wasted once again by these departments.
<P>
	All that we in the official opposition want is to be responsible, to 
set up an initiative which will ensure greater transparency by 
enabling us to obtain the necessary information to denounce abuses 
and waste. This, I feel, is elementary. These are things to which one 
ought to be entitled.
<P>
	It seems to me that the government itself, if it were really 
concerned about transparency and reducing waste, would have 
brought in modifications to ensure that those involved were better 
informed. It seems to me that the government is refusing things 
which are self-evident.
<P>
	To my eyes, this is an extremely worrisome action. We can 
understand why the government is not reducing its deficit. We can 
understand that the debt is going to continue to increase. The 
economists are even predicting that the debt will exceed $800 
billion by the year 2000. This situation is cause for alarm.
<P>
	With this, the government would have the opportunity to 
implement measures to limit these abuses. It could even go so far 
as to adopt an act, as my colleague from Portneuf has said, to 
protect public servants reporting waste within government, or to 
propose bills to protect private businesses who have dealings with 
the government, so that they too may report wastage, rigged 
contracts, abuses and so on. But the government does not do so.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to express my wish that the government 
adopt this motion so as to guarantee greater transparency in 
contracts outside government, thus reducing waste in Department 
of Public Works and Government Services contracts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address the Group No. 4 amendments to 
Bill C-52, particularly the motions put forward by the hon. member 
for Québec-Est.
<P>
	I know what the hon. member is thinking in proposing these 
amendments. They would allow government contracts to be placed 
before committees and before members of Parliament. The 
committees would look at them and either approve or disapprove of 
them. Quite naturally, this is an unworkable and unrealistic 
concept. It simply does not work.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16853"> 16853 </A></B>
<P>
	We must take into consideration when considering MotionNo. 8 the fact that the government enters into literally thousands 
of contracts over the course of a year with thousands of individuals 
and hundreds and hundreds of companies. To suggest that these 
contracts could be effectively analyzed by the government 
operations committee is unrealistic. Considering the sheer number 
of contracts in no time the committee would be simply choked 
with paperwork. Ultimately this would achieve nothing.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	While I do not support the amendment I share the opinions of the 
member for Québec-Est, particularly those on non-competitive 
contracts. I share his concern in all contracts laid out by the 
government. It is a well known fact that Liberal governments past 
and present and Tory governments past and hopefully not in the 
future have built their party fortunes on the practice of patronage.
<P>
	We can look at the who's who of business in the country and find 
Liberal and Tory friends, big time. We have seen time after time 
where Canadian companies that are well known supporters of the 
Liberals or the Tories end up with a multitude of contracts.
<P>
	One that comes to mind since I spoke about it a couple of weeks 
ago is in the area of Canada Post, a crown corporation, and 
SNC-Lavalin. I know it is a little removed from what we are talking 
about. However SNC-Lavalin is a huge consortium, a huge 
company, a well known friend of the Liberal Party. In the last three 
years hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts have been let out 
by Canada Post. They have been uncompetitive and given with no 
public tender to SNC-Lavalin.
<P>
	It does not take a rocket scientist to go through the political 
contributions over the last 10 or 15 years. Almost on an annual 
basis SNC-Lavalin and friend companies come up right at the top 
of the list as contributors to the Liberal Party. We wonder why.
<P>
	I share the concerns, but to put thousands of contracts before the 
government operations committee, before members of Parliament, 
is simply unworkable and unreasonable. Let us talk about whether, 
if they did go before committee, the matter of committee 
examination raises larger issues with respect to how committees 
operate anyway.
<P>
	The Liberals promised that committees would play a greater role 
in Parliament and that members would have input into the 
legislative process by way of their roles on the committees. What a 
joke.
<P>
	Let us start with some of the more notable initiatives of the 
government when it comes to committees. One of the vice-chairs 
of committees is automatically given by tradition to a member of 
an opposition party in the House. There are two recognized 
opposition parties in  the House. One is a federalist party that 
believes in Canada, that loves the country. Its power base in the last 
election just happened to have been in the western provinces, from 
Manitoba west. It was a good result for our first time out. We will 
wait until the next election. We will let the people of Ontario, 
Quebec, the maritimes and the rest of Canada determine our future.
<P>
	We are a federalist party. We put forward a member's name from 
our party to sit as a vice-chair. The separatist party, the Bloc 
Quebecois, put forward a member. It is a party determined to break 
up the country. The Liberals had two options. One was a separatist 
who wants to destroy Canada and the other was a federalist who 
wants to keep Canada together and make some changes so that it 
will stay together. Who did the Liberals vote for en masse? They 
voted for the separatist member. In every vice-chair position the 
separatist member was supported by the Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	The chairman of the public accounts committee is always an 
opposition member. The Reform Party, a federalist party, put 
forward the name of the member for St. Albert and the Bloc 
Quebecois put forward the name of a member of its party for the 
chairmanship of the committee. One would think the government 
would want someone in that position who has the interests of the 
future of Canada at heart. I would think that. Most Canadians 
would think that, but not the Liberals.
<P>
	The Liberal whips were there to make sure all their committee 
members did exactly what they were told. They promptly voted in a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois, a separatist party whose goal is to 
break up the country, to be chairman of the public accounts 
committee. What a joke.
<P>
	We can talk about the effectiveness of committees. Given the 
fact that government members dominate the committees in 
number, and they are the government so let us give them that credit, 
the effectiveness of the committee is nullified. If there was 
patronage going on, and I am sure there is, it would quite likely 
continue because the committee members would simply rubber 
stamp everything their party whips and powers that be told them.
<P>
	We should look at how effective opposition members have been 
in committees and the way Liberals have bulldozed bills through 
committees. We need only look to Bill C-45, Bill C-64, Bill C-89 
and Bill C-91 to find that the Liberals had no intention of listening 
to what the Reform Party or the Bloc party had to say.
<P>
	When Bill C-64, the employment equity bill, was before the 
committee the Liberals allowed four witnesses from the Reform 
list to appear before the committee and debate on each clause was 
limited to five minutes. We are talking about a major piece of 
legislation the Liberals wanted to push through the House. What 
did they do?  They sent the whip down to the committee examining 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16854"> 16854 </A></B>
<P>
the bill to give Liberal members their instructions and the bill was 
rammed through.
<P>
	Motion No. 8 has some merit in so far as the intent of the hon. 
member for Québec-Est. I agree with his intent but unfortunately it 
is simply not workable.
<P>
	Motion No. 9 would cause a list of all government contracts in 
each constituency to be distributed to the appropriate MP every 
month. This would incur a tremendous amount of cost. The Reform 
Party is a fiscally conscious party. It wants to see government 
operations decreased rather than increased. Although we agree with 
the intent of the motions we have to oppose them and that we will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today to address Bill C-52, more 
particularly the proposed amendments to clause 20 put forward by 
the Bloc Quebecois member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Before doing so, I would like to make a few comments. When 
my colleague from the Bloc referred to contracts, he forgot to 
mention that the number of contracts awarded in the past few years 
has remained essentially unchanged. True, their value has 
increased, but he is well aware that this is because of a number of 
major contracts that skewed the information. He knew this, but he 
did not say it.
<P>
	What is interesting, is that one of the government committees, 
the Standing Committee on Government Operations, decided to 
take a look at the matter. When it called witnesses, do you know 
what was interesting? It was that people in the public service were 
already looking at this question. They were studying it because 
they were concerned as well. There you have it. It is quite 
interesting, but he neglected to mention it.
<P>
	I also find it interesting that my colleague has made all sorts of 
unfounded accusations. He claims it is rotten, claims there is 
patronage everywhere and claims that we are handing out money 
here and there as if it grew on trees. Frankly, I find this exaggerated 
and unfortunate. And what about my colleague from the Reform 
Party?
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He makes accusations too. He can make any kind of accusation. 
He does not have any proof. It does not really matter. The Reform 
Party has a lusting for power. It is lusting so terribly that it is saying 
some terribly silly things. It is so silly that Reformers are trailing 
the Tories in the polls. That is how silly it is and Canadians know it 
is silly. I invite them to continue to make comments. Every time 
they do it helps the Liberal Party. Would you stand and continue? 
You are doing a fine job to help us.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. It is not for 
me to slow anyone down, but I remind the member to make his 
intervention through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry. I was trying to speak 
through you to them. I shall make sure that I do so from here on in.
<P>
	I will make a couple of comments as well with respect to 
contracts and sole sourcing. The preferred approach of the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services is always 
the competitive one. My colleagues know that. Why would they not 
have mentioned that?
<P>
	They also know that there are good occasions and good reasons 
when we need to sole source. They know that. They also know that 
if we sole source, any supplier who feels qualified to meet the 
requirement can challenge the sole source award. They forgot to 
mention that. That is openness. That is transparency. Is it that they 
do not know or are they being mischievous?
<P>
	It is interesting to note as well that advance contract award 
notices can be challenged. They are rarely challenged. What does 
that mean? That means that it is being done transparently. It is 
being done above board. I am really surprised that it would not 
have been mentioned.
<P>
	I add as well that the House should also be reminded of other 
measures the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
has taken to ensure integrity in the process. For example, all 
members of the House have been invited to subscribe to the open 
bidding system. I wonder if those who have been rather loquacious, 
vociferous and noisy today have done that.
<P>
	The minister introduced the lobbyist certification clause. Do 
they know that? Do they know what it does? Probably not. An 
effective bid challenge process has been implemented in the 
department. Do they understand that? No, probably not. 
Contracting operations are subject to regular internal audits. That is 
another precaution. I cannot believe they would not share the 
positive as well as the questions they feel need to be addressed.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works and Government Services 
holds supplier seminars across the country almost every day to 
make sure people are aware of what is happening. In this 
department small contracts are competed, contrary to the 
impression that was given, even contracts below the dollar 
threshold required by Treasury Board for competition. That was 
not said.
<P>
	They did not talk about the transparency of the open bidding 
system. They have not said that for low dollar value procurements 
not advertised on the OBS the department uses an automated 
vendor rotation system which ensures equitable access to all 
suppliers of local commodity specific source lists of qualified 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16855"> 16855 </A></B>
<P>
suppliers, another precaution. They did not mention that 75 per 
cent of suppliers subscribing to the OBS have 50 or fewer  
employees, which points out that small businesses take advantage 
of it.
<P>
	We have no evidence of a trend for contract splitting in the 
department. The department statistics indicate a reduction in both 
the number of contracts under $30,000 and the number of contract 
amendments.
<P>
	I thought we needed to set the record straight because either my 
colleagues have not done their work or they have done their work 
and choose to ignore the facts. Either one is unacceptable.
<P>
	I get back to the specifics. It is my view that the amendment 
aims to address two issues related to the department's procurement 
activities: access to information on contracts and ensuring integrity 
in the procurement process. No one would argue that these are not 
worthy goals. Right now the department has mechanisms in place 
which address the same issues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure the members in opposition are familiar with Public 
Works and Government Services' efficient and rapid contract 
opportunity information dissemination system.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	I am talking, obviously, about the Open Bidding System, the 
OBS. It is an electronic display panel providing information not 
only on opportunities for contracts over $25,000 for goods and over 
$60,000 for services, but on contracts already awarded. It provides 
details on the bid selected along with the name of the contractor 
and the amount of the contract.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The OBS gives its users, be they small or medium size 
businesses or members of Parliament, instant access to valuable 
information on procurement opportunities past and present.
<P>
	If the goal of the member is to ensure that the system is fair, let 
me assure the House that many steps have already been taken by 
the minister and the department toward that goal. For instance, the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services has taken 
positive steps to tighten up the manner in which the government 
awards contracts for advertising and public opinion research. This 
is a sensitive area, one in which the actions of the previous 
government have come under serious criticism. The minister has 
also moved to curb the potential influence that lobbyists could 
bring to bear on the contracting process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All contracts awarded by Public Works and Government 
Services now include a clause requiring all firms to state that 
payment, in full or in part, of services rendered by all lobbyists 
hired to obtain the contract  depends neither directly nor indirectly 
on the client's being awarded the contract.
<P>
	In other words, conditional payment of honoraria to lobbyists is 
prohibited. As the result of these amendments, Treasury Board now 
requires all departments to prohibit contractors from paying their 
lobbyists conditionally.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If it is accountability that the member is concerned about, the 
function of procurement or contracting out is almost certainly the 
most closely scrutinized responsibility of the minister and 
Department of Public Works and Government Services. The 
contracting process is subject to the department's own rules and 
procedures; to Treasury Board regulations and guidelines; to 
scrutiny by cabinet and the auditor general; and of course, by the 
media and the Canadian public.
<P>
	An emphasis on fair and open competition goes to the very heart 
of the drive for economic growth and renewal in this country. Fair 
competition encourages firms to strive for greater efficiency and to 
look for innovative ways of producing and delivering their goods 
and services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These qualities are vital to the development of a strong and 
creative economy for Canada. It is therefore particularly important 
for the federal government to practice what it preaches in its own 
business operations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By stressing competition, fairness, and openness in contracting, 
the government can help build a culture of excellence in this 
country and ensure the Canadian taxpayers get full value for their 
money. Passage of Bill C-52 and the creation of the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services will be a positive step in 
meeting this goal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will close by saying that I deplore this tendency we have of 
making unfounded accusations. I also deplore the tendency of 
exaggerating problems we have in government and I deplore the 
tendency of members not doing their homework before rising in the 
House.

	The House resumed from November 21 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-94, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation for commercial purposes of certain manganese

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> On this bill we are now at

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to address the issue in Bill C-94 concerning 
the removal of MMT from gasoline in Canada.
<P>
	We have been told that this was a debate between, on the one 
hand, the automobile industry and, on the other hand, the industry 
that is making MMT, that is, the Esso company.
<P>
	For us, on this side of the House, it is not in any way one or the 
other; it is purely a debate on an environmental issue, on a 
sustainable development issue resulting from automobile 
emissions that are the greatest sources of noxious gases that change 
the climate and against which we are fighting vigorously under the 
convention on climate change.
<P>
	For us, the intent and the objective are to reduce as much as 
possible noxious automobile emissions so that we can reduce 
greenhouse gases.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The whole debate revolves around what are known as catalytic 
converters in automobiles. Twenty-five years ago, before catalysts 
were installed in automobiles, automobile emissions were far more 
severe than they are today. With the advent of very adverse 
conditions especially in the heavy automobile states such as 
California, New York and Pennsylvania, catalytic converters were 
born. To appreciate the essence of the debate on MMT, we have to 
appreciate what is the true function of a catalyst in an automobile.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16857"> 16857 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	A catalyst in an automobile has two main functions. One is to 
filter and to deter the emissions of hydrocarbons and deleterious 
gases. The other is to store oxygen within the converter. In modern 
automobiles we  are now installing onboard detection systems with 
very sensitive equipment such as computerized sensors which 
permit the catalytic converters to function at their maximum 
efficiency.
<P>
	What happens with the use of the heavy metal MMT in gasoline? 
It compounds the problems of catalysts in that it produces 
manganese oxide deposits inside the various elements of the 
converters. The effect of MMT over time on a catalyst today is to 
impair its function of providing the maximum input in reducing 
hydrocarbon emissions and other noxious gases. This happens 
gradually and increasingly as the catalyst ages.
<P>
	More oxygen is accumulated inside the converter with the effect 
that the sensor is completely fooled by MMT in its application. 
Today's sensors in the onboard detection systems are prevented 
from working properly. The automobile manufacturers have rightly 
said that where there is MMT it is impossible for the new type of 
onboard detection systems to function properly.
<P>
	Further, a big cold battle has been raging in the United States as 
to whether MMT should or should not be included. It will follow 
that even if MMT is permitted in the United States, in several states 
representing at least one-third of the gasoline purchases in the 
United States, all the heavy automobile states such as California, 
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New York and so forth, it will still be 
impossible to use MMT because the clean air act provides that 
these states must use reformulated gasoline.
<P>
	This means MMT or additives containing heavy metals will not 
be able to be used, except under very special circumstances. It 
means that even if MMT were allowed in the United States 
tomorrow, in the several states which provide for the use of 
reformulated gasoline, for example, California, Connecticut, 
Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas 
and Wisconsin, it will be impossible to use MMT because heavy 
metals cannot be used in reformulated gasoline.
<P>
	The reason is very simple. When heavy metals are introduced 
into gasoline it is impossible to gradually change to other formulas 
which enable other octanes such as ethanol to be used. The quicker 
we ban MMT in Canada, the faster we can move into the use of 
alternative fuels such as ethanol and others as additives to produce 
a more environmentally friendly gasoline. It has been said that this 
debate is the auto industry against MMT, that this side has relied on 
the automobile industry for its input. I have gone to the trouble of 
speaking to scientists very far removed from the automobile 
industry, who have told me that unless we remove MMT from our 
gasoline it will not be possible for us to move toward reformulated 
gasoline using additives, such as environmentally friendly ethanol 
produced from wood and other substances; ethanol which will 
produce far fewer emissions, which go toward the warming of our 
climate.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	For me this whole question is an environmental issue. It is very 
much an environmental issue. If tomorrow I have a choice to use a 
heavy metal, such as manganese as an additive in gasoline, and on 
the other side to gradually move toward environmentally friendly 
additives, such as ethanol and others, then for me there is no 
choice. Unless we take the first step, the second will never happen.
<P>
	I know it has been said that the Ministry of Health has not 
banned MMT, has not found it noxious to health. Yet there are very 
severe warnings. In the last debate in this House at second reading, 
I quoted some very severe warnings by leading health specialists 
and scientists. I will not return to all the quotes I have already read, 
except to put the accent on one of them.
<P>
	During the hearings before the United States house of 
representatives committee on health and environment regarding the 
EPA, there was one quote: ``that like lead, manganese is not new or 
toxic. It is an element and thus does not degrade or lose its potency 
with the passage of time. As a result, the manganese released into 
the environment through the use of MMT in a given year 
accumulates over time with all the MMT released in the next year 
and all the subsequent years''.
<P>
	I have recently received a health report written by three 
scientists. It is a report headed ``Developmental Toxicity of 
Mangafodipir Trisodium and Manganese Chloride in 
Sprague-Dawley Rats''. It is by three scientists, Kimberley Treinen 
of the Sanofi Research Division of Collegeville, Pennsylvania; Mr. 
Tim Gray of the Alnwick Research Centre in Alnwick, 
Northumberland in England and William Blazak of Nycomed, 
Collegeville, Pennsylvania.
<P>
	They studied MnDPDP, which is a manganese chelate being 
developed as a contrast agent for magnet resonance. They say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A third study, in which 15 rats/group were dosed intravenously with 0, 5, 20 
or40 mmol/kg MnCl2 on days 6-17 of gestation, produced identical skeletal 
malformations to those seen with MnDPDP, indicating that manganese is the 
active moiety responsible for these specific malformations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Their summary says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In summary, the data presented here indicate that a specific syndrome of 
skeletal malformations in rats was induced by MnDPDP, which occurred in the 
absence of maternal toxicity at four times the intended clinical dose. The same 
specific malformations were also seen with intravenous administration of 
equivalent or lower doses of manganese. Since manganese has been shown to 
cross the placenta (Jarvinen and Ahlstrom, '75; Koshida et al, '63; Rojas et al., 
'67), it appears that manganese is the active tertogenic moiety in MnDPDP.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	It appears that manganese is the active teratogenic moiety in 
MnDPDP.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16858"> 16858 </A></B>
<P>
	Our health ministry has not accepted and proven conclusively 
that manganese is a toxic agent that should be banned. At the same 
time, the whole question is, if we have two alternatives, it is 
always a question of choice. We have two alternatives, MMT on 
one side, a heavy metal that is known to affect, to gum up catalytic 
converters. It is not used in California, which is trying to clean 
up its air. It is not used in New York state. It is not used in 
Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.
<P>
	If by any chance we move to cleaner additives, to ethanol and 
others, then the choice is very simple for us. Let us ban MMT so 
that eventually we are going to produce and use much cleaner fuels.
<P>
	The world is moving very fast. I am told by various scientists 
from the automobile side and others that the day is coming very 
fast when automobile catalysts will be so precise that they will be 
able to monitor any noxious fumes. There will be far more effective 
filtering agents that will be used much more effectively with 
reformulated gasoline, such as is the case in the states that have led 
the fight on this, California and others.
<P>
	If MMT continues to be used, then the potential for an improved 
catalytic converter will not happen. The choice for us is to say let 
us move on, let us go along, pass Bill C-94 very fast so that Canada 
joins not only the United States, not only California, not only 
Pennsylvania but Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, France, 
England and all the states of the world that do not use MMT. Why 
should we be the exception?
<P>
	For me, this is the vote for the environment. We will vote with 
much conviction for Bill C-94.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened to the hon. member present his case. I 
want to make a point and ask a question.
<P>
	The member speaks as if there is absolute, conclusive opinion 
regarding the detrimental effects of MMT. I listened to the member 
speak. I believe that he believes that.
<P>
	The fact is that there are conflicting reports on the effects of 
MMT. I would like to ask the member if he has read the reports that 
say that MMT is not the bad additive that the report says. Has the 
member read both reports? Could he comment on what is his 
opinion of the report that supports the continued use of MMT and 
the effectiveness of it as a product that helps the gasoline to burn 
more clean and effectively? Has he read both reports?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, I have read on both sides of the 
question. Yes, I know it is not a question that is totally black and 
white. Yes, I know that the makers of MMT can genuinely say that 
in some sectors it has advantages.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	However, in all the decisions we make here nothing is exactly 
black or white. We have a choice. Of the two choices, one is the 
choice of a heavy metal with very serious potential health questions 
attached to it which many scientists have been flagging, as they did 
about lead. The same debate took place on lead. Should it be taken 
out of gasoline? Should it be left in because it is a very good octane 
enhancer? Today we would never go back. If we looked at the 
debates which took place I am sure there were two sides to the 
issue.
<P>
	Eventually a choice has to be made. With me the choice is clear. 
On one side is a heavy metal which has potential health problems. 
It has been clearly demonstrated to gum up catalytic converters, 
which are the salvation of tomorrow with respect to the car of the 
future. I would like to find a way to move much faster in Canada 
toward other additives. It may be a bit more expensive in the 
beginning, but eventually we should look to other additives, just as 
the rest of the world is doing.
<P>
	If MMT is so beneficial, why do not Scandinavia, a leader in the 
environmental field, the Netherlands, Germany or Japan use it?
<P>
	For me the choice is very clear. In the balance of choices I have 
chosen to go with Bill C-94. It is the fastest way for us to use 
environmentally friendly fuels in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the answer of the hon. 
member.
<P>
	I want to key in on a phrase which he used and that was the 
phrase ``potential health hazards''. Either we have a health hazard 
with the use of MMT or we do not. Surely, with the science which 
is available to us to study the effects of a fuel product using MMT, 
we can determine beyond a shadow of a doubt whether there is or is 
not a health hazard.
<P>
	The hon. member said that he has read studies which indicate 
that MMT is fine and that no conclusion has ever been reached that 
there are health risks involved with it. On the other hand, the 
reports and studies which came from the auto industry said that 
there is a health hazard with MMT and that we must stop this 
devastating product immediately.
<P>
	I am surprised that the government is ready to jump to a decision 
to ban MMT without having a conclusive scientific finding. When 
there are two reports on the product which are at absolute 
opposites, I wonder what is behind the government's enthusiasm to 
jump in and ban MMT. It is all right to say that the sky is going to 
fall, but that might only be opinion. The sky may never fall.
<P>
	I believe that the Liberals are playing ``Chicken Little'' with this 
bill. The sky is falling and MMT is going to pollute the earth. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16859"> 16859 </A></B>
<P>
fact, the sky has never fallen and  there is no scientific evidence 
that MMT is a health hazard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, the auto industry has 
never made its case on the health issues. The automobile industry 
made its case on catalysts and sensors and the onboard detection 
systems in vehicles. That was its case.
<P>
	With respect to the case on health, I produced several quotations 
during second reading and I have them here. I did not obtain them 
from the automobile industry.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	The fact is that several very learned and respected scientists have 
said beware, there is a potential problem with manganese. To say 
that it does not exist is to negate some very important opinions that 
have been expressed.
<P>
	Following the Earth Summit in Rio, which my friends on the 
environment committee will know, sanction is now one of the basic 
principles of any environmental law as a precautionary principle. 
Do not wait until everything has been proven conclusively before 
we act.
<P>
	When Rachel Carson wrote a book about DDT she was thought 
to be crazy. And look at what DDT has done while we waited for 
conclusive proof.
<P>
	At one time we were using PCBs and we thought they were good 
for the environment and for equipment in transformers. We found 
out too late how deleterious it is to the environment. We used lead 
as well, and thought it was great until too late we found out what 
happened.
<P>
	As I said to the member, if there is a choice to be made, do we 
choose a heavy metal that can produce problems or do we use a 
clean additive? The choice is very clear to me. On the basis of the 
precautionary principle and on the basis of all I have read, I am 
voting very convincingly for Bill C-94.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
Bloc Quebecois has decided to propose an amendment to Bill C-94 
at third reading, because we know that the American agency EPA 
will table a report on the issue shortly. As my colleague of the 
Reform Party said earlier, we believe that it is important for us to 
also look at studies that will be published at the international level, 
because our friends opposite enjoy saying in committee that the 
environment knows no boundaries. This is why I move the 
following amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' 
and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-94, An Act to regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation 
for commercial purposes of certain manganese-based substances, be not now 
read a third time but that it be read a third time this day six months hence.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We are verifying the 
validity of the amendment.
<P>
	The hon. member has taken debate time. We now have a 
10-minute period of questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-94, which is now before the House.
<P>
	In the bill the government is taking a decisive step toward 
protecting the environment, jobs, consumers, and keeping our 
country at the leading edge of automobile technology. All are very 
important goals.
<P>
	Bill C-94 will prohibit the import and interprovincial trade of 
MMT, a manganese based fuel additive manufactured in the U.S. 
The proposed bill, to be known as the manganese based fuel 
additives act, will come into effect 60 days after it gains assent.
<P>
	Canada is one of the only countries in the world that use MMT. It 
is very rare in the world these days. The U.S., for example, banned 
it from use in unleaded gasoline in 1978. It is remarkable that it did 
it so long ago and we still have it in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	Some members opposite have cited a recent U.S. court decision 
in favour of MMT as a reason to stop this legislation. But MMT 
will still be banned in California and in those states that require 
federal reformulated gasoline to be used. What is more, we have 
yet to see whether the U.S. government will repeal this decision.
<P>
	We are taking this action because we need to protect the latest 
onboard diagnostic systems that Canada's car makers are installing 
in their new vehicles. These systems are extremely important for 
the environment. They are responsible for monitoring the vehicle 
emission controls and for alerting the driver of malfunctions. 
Without that kind of technology one cannot be aware of how well 
the car is working or if it is not functioning at all in terms of its 
emission control processes. They ensure that the cleaner burning 
engines of today and tomorrow operate as designed. They ensure 
that automobiles are properly maintained, resulting in decreased 
tailpipe emissions and improved fuel economy. In other words, this 
is one more important tool to help us address air pollution, 
including smog and climate change.
<P>
	This government will not allow MMT to get in the way of the 
automobile industry's effort to make cars cleaner and more 
efficient and less polluting. Canada's environment and Canadian 
consumers have the right to the best anti-pollution technology 
possible. Yet Ethyl Corporation, the manufacturer of MMT through 
its subsidiary Ethyl Canada, denies the vehicle industry allegation 
about the ill effects of MMT on the vehicle emissions control 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16860"> 16860 </A></B>
<P>
systems. In fact it makes a counter claim that MMT is 
environmentally beneficial.
<P>
	All this is somewhat fuzzy. What is certain is that efforts to 
reduce motor vehicle pollution can no longer be addressed by just 
the petroleum industry, the auto industry, or the federal 
government. Progress at reducing vehicle pollution requires 
simultaneous action by all. The petroleum industry needs to keep 
making improvements in the composition and properties of the 
fuels engines burn. The auto industry needs to keep making 
improvements in the vehicle emissions control systems and 
technologies, such as those offered through onboard diagnostic 
systems. The government needs to take decisive action in Bill 
C-94, which removes a major obstacle to the introduction of these 
technologies. That obstacle is MMT.
<P>
	Our strategy to reduce vehicle pollution goes beyond just taking 
action on MMT. The government is doing its part because we know 
that automobiles are a major contributor to climate change and 
urban smog as well as some toxic pollutants like benzene. In fact in 
a recently released task force report done by Canada's deputy 
ministers of environment it is noted that even with the 
improvements in emissions technology, vehicles are still the largest 
contributors to air pollution.
<P>
	I must say that troubles me. I as a member of Parliament, and I 
am sure many of my colleagues, have to travel a great deal 
throughout my riding and often I am the only person in the vehicle. 
There are times when I feel uncomfortable about that. I know that it 
is important that I get around my riding, get around to different 
events, be seen and hear people's concerns. Yet I also know that I 
am driving a vehicle a lot more than I would like to be driving it. 
Unfortunately, my riding is too big to go by bicycle. It would take 
me forever, but it would certainly be great for my health. This issue 
does trouble me. We should be concerned about the impact of 
automobile emissions as they impact on the environment and air 
pollution.
<P>
	On a national basis, gasoline and diesel powered vehicles still 
contribute some 60 per cent of carbon monoxide emissions, 35 per 
cent of nitrous oxide emissions or smog, 25 per cent of our 
hydrocarbon emissions, and 20 per cent of carbon dioxide 
emissions. These vehicles, gasoline and diesel powered, are very 
big contributors to our smog and pollution problems.
<P>
	This report I just referred to stresses the need to proceed on all 
fronts at the same time in all of these areas. It states the following: 
``Vehicle technology and fuel composition, although two separate 
industry sectors, must be treated as an integrated system in the 
development of policies and programs in order to successfully 
reduce emissions from motor vehicles''. This is good advice. It 
should complement our work in preparing our comprehensive 
motor vehicle exhaust emission standards.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	To meet these standards, we are counting on integrating 
improvements achieved in emission control technologies and fuels. 
However, clearly we cannot hope to meet these standards without 
the kind of action we are taking against MMT in Bill C-94. And it 
is not simply an act of impatience. Since 1985 the federal 
government has waited for the automotive and petroleum 
industries to resolve this situation without legislation. It was not 
resolved. The time for waiting is over. It is now time for the 
government to act.
<P>
	Last October the Minister of the Environment urged both the 
petroleum and automotive industries to voluntarily resolve the 
issue of MMT in Canada by the end of 1994; otherwise, the 
government would take action. This deadline was subsequently 
extended in February of this year to review automobile and 
petroleum industry proposals. The MMT issue is no longer an 
industry dispute. Its outcome can affect the vehicle emissions 
programs we are putting into place. In the long term it could also 
negatively impact on the automotive sector. Successful resolution 
of the MMT issue will ensure that environmental benefits are 
realized through the use of the most advanced emission control 
technologies. We have to move in this direction.
<P>
	Members opposite have claimed that this legislation will have an 
enormous financial impact on the petroleum sector. However, let us 
be prudent and realistic. The economic impact of removing MMT 
will be small, not enormous. Estimates for the industry, an industry 
that involves many billions of dollars, range from $50 million to 
$83 million per year, which means an additional cost to consumers 
of 0.1 cents to 0.24 cents per litre at the pump. This is less than 
one-quarter of a cent per litre at the pump.
<P>
	Some have said that taking MMT out of our fuel will increase 
benzene. That is not so. It is nonsense. Gasoline can be refined 
without MMT and without increasing levels of benzene. Any effort 
to increase benzene levels or benzene precursors will not be 
tolerated under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. In fact 
this past summer the Minister of the Environment announced that 
benzene levels would be regulated at a maximum of one per cent 
per volume. So there is nothing to fear. Let us move ahead. Let us 
do it, because we need new emission control technologies like the 
onboard diagnostic systems. We need them to help achieve 
reductions in smog, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons. We need 
to reduce these kinds of emissions because they have an influence 
on climate change and urban air quality.
<P>
	This is good legislation. It is good for consumers and good for 
the environment. All 18 automobile companies in Canada agree, 
even if the Reform Party does not, that we are moving in the right 
direction.
<P>
	I urge all members to give their support and swift passage to this 
bill.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as 
we said in the motion, we are not asking for the bill to be 
withdrawn altogether but to be postponed for six months. The 
environment is of course a very important matter, and we support 
any measures that have a positive impact on the environment and 
that are environmentally viable.
<P>
	However, as far as Bill C-94 on the abolition of MMT is 
concerned, we are not convinced it is a good bill. If we consider 
what has been done with respect to manganese, including tests by 
the automotive industry, the tests now being done by independent 
laboratories were ordered strictly by Ethyl Corporation which, on 
the basis of its tests, has demonstrated that MMT does not in any 
way affect the components of the antipollution system in 
automobiles.
<P>
	I also wonder what the automotive industry is doing in this 
respect. If studies have already found that MMT causes pollution in 
the components of the antipollution system, why have these tests 
not been published? Did they actually do any tests? Do they intend 
to or did they never do any at all?
<P>
	When I look at the government's position in this respect, is it 
possible that the government was pressured by the automotive 
industry lobby to the extent that it felt obliged to table this bill? It is 
quite possible. I do not want to accuse anybody, but we all know 
that there are two major lobbies here in Canada. The oil company 
lobby and the automotive lobby. As it happens, all the automotive 
industries are in Ontario, not far from the environment minister's 
riding. Maybe that should give rise to some questions.
<P>
	However, the U.S. automotive industry is only beginning to test 
this product. The purpose of our amendment is for us to wait until 
they get the results of those tests before we make a final and 
definitive decision, because legislation is definitive. We must have 
some kind of proof and nobody has proven anything yet, not even 
Health Canada. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the 
Environment said earlier-he read it, by the way, because it is in 
<I>Hansard</I>-that as far as health is concerned, tests have shown that 
there is no threat whatsoever to health.
<P>
	I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the 
Environment made a mistake a while ago when he mentioned that 
manganese was a toxin. I am sorry, but if it were considered a toxic 
product, we would not be here considering a special piece of 
legislation such as Bill C-94 to ban it, because it would be covered 
under CEPA, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. This 
means that any product considered toxic is automatically included 
under CEPA. This is not the case here. Manganese is not a toxic 
product since we have to enact a  specific legislation to ban it. 
There has been a slight error which I wanted to point out and 
correct.
<P>
	We have heard about a recent ruling in the United States, which I 
believe to be very important. The Ethyl corporation has been 
working for years to keep on manufacturing and marketing its 
product. Very recently, a few weeks ago, a ruling ordered the EPA, 
the Environmental Protection Agency, the American equivalent of 
our Department of the Environment, to lift the ban on MMT.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	In the United States, even the Environmental Protection Agency 
tells us when we call that it does not know if it is going to appeal, 
that it does not think so. We are told that this product could be 
reintroduced in the United States as early as the beginning of 
December. So what is the rationale behind Bill C-94?
<P>
	We are also told that 50 per cent of American refineries are ready 
to use this product and cannot wait to do so. So if 50 per cent of 
these industries are ready to use MMT, again what is the rationale 
behind Bill C-94?
<P>
	In the environment committee, we are always talking about 
harmonization, about trying to make the environment an 
international concern. I totally agree with that. Yes, I said many 
times that we have to avoid duplication and conflict and yet, with 
Bill C-94, we are creating a conflict with our neighbours, the 
Americans, who are a bit more powerful than we are.
<P>
	So we are going to eliminate MMT from the market and ask all 
our refineries to transform their system, at a cost of several million 
dollars, because they will not be able to use MMT any more, and 
we may well have to reintroduce it in six months. It makes 
absolutely no sense at all.
<P>
	What we are asking is not that the bill be withdrawn, but that we 
wait and see what happens in the United States. We are also asking 
to see the tests being done right now by the U.S. automotive 
industry, and I have the feeling that these tests will be performed a 
little bit faster than the ones scheduled to be done in Canada, 
because we will not be able to watch them. Once we have these 
results, we will have a complete, concrete and logical overview of 
the issue, and in six months' time, we can revisit the bill and make 
a decision based on logical arguments.
<P>
	We are going through tough a period, in our economy, where we 
cannot afford to make mistakes. We are out of money. We are going 
through some hard times. Are we going to ask refineries to 
completely modify their process simply to achieve what we set to 
do as far as MMT is concerned? I know that MMT is an additive. 
But we are also talking about other additives now available on the 
market, such as ethanol. As you know, we have yet to see complete 
and concrete evidence that ethanol is neither  toxic nor hazardous. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16862"> 16862 </A></B>
<P>
We may realize one day that ethanol is not that good for the 
environment.
<P>
	I am not against the introduction of products like ethanol, but 
why should we replace manganese, MMT, which has been 
thoroughly analyzed for 15 years and has not been proven to be 
dangerous? On the contrary, it even helps to reduce the greenhouse 
effect by 20 per cent.
<P>
	I am not saying that we should keep this product forever or that 
the bill is not good. What I am saying is that the product is now 
being reintroduced on the American market and that we should 
wait six months to see what the EPA will do or what studies the 
U.S. automotive industry will produce on this product before we 
make a logical and reasonable decision on this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, if the minister is lucky, her Bill C-94 banning gas 
additives will stall before it backfires.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An innocuous-sounding piece of federal legislation supposedly aimed at 
reducing auto emissions has left critics wondering whether the Liberal 
government hasn't inhaled one noxious substance too many.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The bill we are debating, the manganese based fuel additive bill, 
would ban a gasoline additive called MMT.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Environment Minister Sheila Copps has made the rather dramatic claims that 
the move will make auto emissions 600 percent cleaner, while saving car buyers 
an average of $3,000 on the next family clunker. Unfortunately for all, there is 
considerable evidence that the issue is made up of equal parts of clean air and 
the hot variety.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A growing number of critics of the legislation-including provincial 
environment ministers in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick-fear a ban on MMT may actually cause a dramatic increase in 
choking tailpipe filth, while causing higher gas prices.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MMT has been added to Canadian gasoline since 1977, primarily to increase 
octane levels.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	It was mentioned that it was banned in the United States. That is 
not particularly the case. It was never really approved because of 
some early concerns and then it got involved in extensive court 
battles. Specifically, it was never banned because it was seen as a 
dangerous substance; it just never received approval.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The alternative is enhanced oil-refining, at greater cost to the petroleum 
companies and, inevitably, consumers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course that would involve other additives, which may also 
prove eventually much more harmful than MMT was ever 
contemplated to be. There is also evidence that MMT may 
significantly cut smog-producing nitrogen oxide emissions, or 
what we commonly call NOx.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But the automobile companies claim MMT gums up their emission-control 
warning systems, possibly causing the malfunction indicator lights on the 
dashboard to malfunction. If  drivers don't know they have a problem with</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>emission control, the industry argues, they will unwittingly be poisoning the air 
even more than usual.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The alternative of fixing the cars instead of the fuel, according to the federal 
environment minister, would increase the average car price by $3,000.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	One official spokesman for the minister said that ``On this 
particular issue, the evidence she has seen-has provided her with 
enough to get this bill through cabinet and the House''. The cabinet 
dealt with this in a far too cursory manner.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That so-called ``evidence'' is contained in four separate reports-three 
written by various automobile lobby organizations, the fourth at the request of 
General Motors. No surprise; all concluded MMT was pretty terrible stuff.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As it happens, there are a few other studies floating around. Health Canada, 
for instance, concluded MMT poses no particular health risk.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I recall looking at my vitamin bottle, and manganese is on the 
vitamin pill list. It is a matter of trace amounts or whatever. The 
studies that were quoted by the parliamentary secretary talk about 
giving rats an unusual amount of the concentrated substance. I 
would think that any vitamin given in a disproportionate amount is 
going to cause some deleterious effects to a living organism.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Another mega-study was conducted over a five-year period for the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, which, until recently, had placed a total ban 
on MMT additives in gasoline. It was not permitted. The results of the study, in 
part, last month led the U.S. Court of Appeals to order the environmental agency 
to approve the use of MMT in unleaded gas.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are waiting for December 5, which is the cut-off date for any 
filing of appeals. Certainly the motion before the House today 
would accommodate that wait and see approach to see how the 
world is generally going to move on this item.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The U.S. court ruling also blew the engine on the minister's argument that, as 
a trade issue, it was vital to harmonize Canadian and U.S. standards on MMT.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One effect of the U.S. court ruling is that it compelled the American 
automakers and petroleum industry to launch a new joint study into MMT and 
the whacky warning lights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given the amount of conflicting evidence presented by both sides, the five 
provincial environment ministers have suggested Copps put the brakes on her 
pet legislation, at least until the U.S. joint study has been completed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even within the Liberal cabinet, we are told, some ministers seem concerned 
that Copps' determination to ram the MMT legislation through has more to do 
with her personal political agenda (e.g., saving face) than practical 
environmental considerations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Copps's rhetoric on this issue has been so forceful, retreating from the 
legislation now would produce more political egg than she has face to wear.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fortunately for her, there is a graceful way out. The Commons is expected to 
prorogue some time next month, meaning this session of Parliament will be 
officially declared dead, along with  all unpassed bills. In the meantime, the bill still has 
to go to the Senate, which, if Copps is really lucky, will tie up the bill till 
prorogation do it part.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	This anti free trade bill should die. I think MMT is about to be 
used around the world. Many countries are not using it now 
because it is not being used in the United States. They are watching 
what will happen in the United States. If the American industry 
begins to use it, many countries are ready to follow suit.
<P>
	The EPA will be completely out of the picture on December 5. 
The government should be embarrassed about this bill. It knows it 
and we know it. Let common sense prevail.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, </B><B>Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to rectify a few things that have been said by 
previous speakers.
<P>
	I think reading from a newspaper article to show that the 
minister is only pushing Bill C-94 forward as a project to save face 
is nonsense. The minister believes, as I and the Liberal government 
do, after much thinking and cogitation and the several weeks of 
discussion the bill has undergone, that for us it is the best choice.
<P>
	There are two choices. MMT could be left in, riding on the back 
of the Ethyl Corporation which both the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Reform Party quote very extensively. The Ethyl Corporation has 
done a great lobbying job with the members. I am happy for the 
Ethyl Corporation that some members are convinced. At the same 
time, there is an issue of choice, an issue of whether we keep a 
heavy metal, which is what MMT is, in our future gasolines and 
cars, or whether we try to move toward more environmentally 
sound fuels.
<P>
	I heard the Bloc Quebecois member question whether ethanol 
will one day be found to be just as bad for the environment as lead 
or something else is today. I would suggest that she read the 
testimony made before many committees of the House on ethanol 
and that she consult with people involved in the ethanol industry. 
Perhaps she should consult with those who crafted the clean air act 
in the United States. It was amended so that in the future more and 
more ethanol would be used because of its cleaner properties. The 
scientists are very clear that ethanol is a cleaner fuel because it is 
derived from natural, biological properties. Obviously, it is not a 
heavy metal.
<P>
	When I referred to manganese as a toxin I was quoting from 
studies of scientists who referred to it. A statement was made by 
the United States House of Representatives Committee on Health 
and Environment at the EPA hearing on June 22, 1990. Reference 
was made that like lead, manganese is not only neurotoxic, it is an 
element, et cetera. We are talking about neurotoxic in the generic  
sense, not in the sense of the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act. We are talking in a generic sense.
<P>
	I will quote other scientists from the University of Pittsburgh, 
Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic at the same hearings: ``The 
page 15 appendix to their waiver application''-talking about 
Ethyl Corporation-``that deals with health nowhere mentions the 
neurotoxic properties of manganese''.
<P>
	The Department of Health and Human Services in the United 
States stated: ``MMT can be absorbed through the skin and 
probably readily by the nose and lungs''. Obviously they are 
talking in a generic sense about a heavy metal.
<P>
	Perhaps the Bloc Quebecois critic should check with the deputy 
minister of the Department of the Environment who in a letter to 
our deputy minister in the Department of the Environment said:
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In a letter dated July 7, 1995, the minister said that they were 
thinking of supporting the Canadian position on MMT in order to 
maintain the uniformity of car fleets and to take advantage of the 
environmental gains that will be made possible by the new motor 
vehicle emission control technologies.
<P>
	The Quebec Deputy Minister of the Environment wrote to his 
federal counterpart that they were thinking of supporting the 
Canadian position on MMT in order to maintain the uniformity of 
car fleets and to take advantage of the environmental gains that will 
be made possible by the new motor vehicle emission control 
technologies.
<P>
	This, of course, was denied in a November 2, 1995 letter from 
the Quebec Minister of Natural Resources, who disagrees. In any 
case, it is interesting to note that they agreed from an 
environmental point of view. It is clear that this issue has two 
components. We could argue, like the Reform critic, that once 
MMT is accepted in the U.S., the rest of the world will follow.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is no evidence of that. There is no evidence that the 
Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark or 
Japan, environmentally conscious countries, would join in because 
a court case was won by the Ethyl corporation in the United States.
<P>
	Certainly the EPA opposed the court case all the way along. The 
Environmental Protection Agency of the United States also pointed 
out that several states of the United States would not be able to use 
MMT because they were using reformulated gasoline so that they 
could clean up their own air emissions faster.
<P>
	It is a stalling tactic to try to kill the bill, to produce another 
amendment that is exactly the same as the  amendment we defeated 
very fairly the other day. There was a similar amendment on second 
reading to defer it for six months and we defeated it. That is the 
democratic process. I am sure the same result will greet this 
amendment.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16864"> 16864 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Madam Speaker, certainly stalling has been 
basically our position all along because of the appeal situation in 
the United States. Our position, which was purported to support the 
MMT bill, has been well pointed out in the House and at 
committee.
<P>
	When I began to cross-examine some of the evidence at 
committee, for instance the sparkplug evidence, it turned out to be 
fake. I demolished the testimony of the person who had the nerve to 
come to the table and put forward evidence that turned out to be 
completely erroneous.
<P>
	That is why the government has been very reluctant to agree to 
independent third party testing. It has rejected that down the line. 
However I understand some groups are getting together in the 
United States to have independent third party testing to be able to 
remove the pressure of lobby groups.
<P>
	Certainly our party has not been siding with any particular lobby 
group. Right from the beginning we have been asking for 
independent third party tests. My colleague asks who stands up for 
science. We wonder about the government and what lobby groups it 
is supporting.
<P>
	The delay is to see what will happen in the United States and 
certainly this is an ill advised bill that should die.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The question is on the 
amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those in favour of the 
amendment will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In my opinion the nays 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 45, a division on the question now before the House stands 
deferred until November 28 at the end of government business, at 
which time the bells to call in the members will be sounded for not 
more than 15 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, in view of the time of the day 
which leaves very little time to commence a new order I suggest 
that we call it 6.30 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THECONSTITUTION">THE CONSTITUTION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
November 7, the Prime Minister announced that a ministerial 
committee had been set up to review the whole question of 
constitutional and administrative changes to the Canadian 
federation. It is strange though to set up such a committee, whose 
mandate and schedule remains unknown, even as we speak.
<P>
	It is strange also that this committee is made up only of federal 
ministers, when everyone knows full well that the real decision 
makers in that regard are the provincial premiers. I for one believe 
that this committee was struck just for the Prime Minister's 
satisfaction, to give him something to say, or else to distract 
momentarily from the poor performance during the referendum.
<P>
	How can this committee have any credibility when some of its 
members have gone out of their way to trample on Quebec. What 
can be said about the Minister of Justice, who was looking for legal 
means to prevent Quebecers from voting again on their future? And 
what about the fisheries minister who invited thousands of 
Canadians to act in violation of the Referendum Act? What about 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage who will not recognize that 
Quebecers are a nation? What about the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration who, when he was a member of the opposition in 
this House, voted against a government proposal which recognized, 
among other things, the distinct society in the Meech Lake Accord?
<P>
	And what about the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs who, 
when answering the question I put to him on November 8 about the 
mandate of the committee, simply said, and I quote: ``Our 
committee will also look  at non constitutional measures, so as to 
not overlook any means to make our federation more effective''?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16865"> 16865 </A></B>
<P>
	Yet, by giving such an answer, the minister admits his 
helplessness. The measures which will be considered are non 
constitutional measures. How can such measures come up to the 
expectations of the Quebecers? Again, it is a committee established 
to do away with the legitimate expectations of the Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, on November 
8 the member for Chicoutimi asked the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs about the mandate of the cabinet 
committee on unity.
<P>
	The minister replied that the committee was going to look at all 
the possibilities for constitutional and administrative changes in 
the federation.
<P>
	The member further asked if the minister could inform the 
House whether the committee would look at options, such as a 
resolution to recognize Quebec's distinct character, as well as a bill 
on regional referendums.
<P>
	The minister responded that the commitments made by the 
Prime Minister during the campaign concerning a distinct society 
and constitutional veto for Quebec will be fulfilled.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The initiatives announced today by the Prime Minister represent 
a ground breaking and effective way of achieving a major 
constitutional objective without reopening the Constitution, since 
Lucien Bouchard and the PQ government have stated clearly and 
repeatedly that they were not interested in constitutional change.
<P>
	Our legislation on the right of veto ensures that we will not make 
any constitutional change Quebec does not want. We must not let 
the intransigence of Lucien Bouchard and of the Quebec 
government impede the adoption of non-constitutional changes, 
changes the people of Quebec and of other Canadian regions are 
looking forward to.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The results of the October 30 referendum have shown the clear 
desire of Quebecers to remain within Canada, a country that they 
have helped to build into the tolerant, compassionate society we 
know today.
<P>
	At the same time, the referendum has signalled that Quebecers 
and many other Canadians are looking for changes within the 
federation that will make the government more responsive to the 
needs of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.17 p.m.)
