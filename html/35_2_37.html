that a vacancy has occurred in the representation, namely, Ms. 
Copps, member for the electoral district of Hamilton East, by 
resignation effective May 1, 1996.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to paragraph 25(1)(b) of the Parliament of Canada Act, 
I have addressed a warrant to the Chief Electoral Officer today for 
the issue of a writ for the election of a member to fill this vacancy.

	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today in honour of Child 
Find's Green Ribbon of Hope month.
<P>
	Thousands of children go missing in Canada every year. Each 
time a child is abducted, a family and a community is devastated. 
They suffer a loss that is unbearable. Together they hope and pray 
for the child's safe return. The reality is that many children are 
never found and many others lose their lives to their abductors.
<P>
	Our children must be protected. It is the responsibility of this 
government and indeed of all Canadians to guarantee that

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in response to the speeches by all the members of this 
House, as well as public pressures, the Deputy Prime Minister has 
finally stepped down. She had no other choice, moreover, since she 
had made a public commitment to quit if the GST was not 
abolished.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that this resignation is evidence 
that it was not only the Deputy Prime Minister who did not keep 
her word concerning the GST, but the Liberal government as a 
whole, and he himself?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Ms. Copps, who resigned earlier today-and I must 
express my admiration for her in this connection-had made a 
personal commitment. At her press conference, she indicated 
clearly that the government was respecting the commitments it had 
made in the red book, on page 20 in French and page 22 in English, 
that she herself had made an additional commitment, and that now 
her credibility was being criticized or questioned by the public.
<P>
	In response to the incessant attacks against her, she has decided 
to rely on the judgment of the voters of Hamilton East, and I am 
convinced that, after the June 17 byelection, she will be back with 
the support of the people of Hamilton East.
<P>
	She had made a personal commitment to which she has been 
faithful. For this lady, who has so well served the province of 
Ontario, first as an MPP and then as an opposition MP and later a 
minister and Deputy Prime Minister in this House, an attack on her 
integrity was unacceptable. She is putting her fate in the hands of 
the voters. They have always had enormous confidence in Ms. 
Copps, as do we on this side of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week, Number Three in the government, that is the 
Minister of Finance, admitted his error and apologized for it. 
Number Two has just done the same, and has resigned.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that now there is just Number 
One left, who has not admitted, nor is he capable of admitting, to 
the Canadian people that he has not respected his commitments?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, some ten times or so I have read out here in the House the 
Liberal Party's commitment, made at the time of the election, 
namely that we were going to replace the GST by a form of taxation 
that would be harmonized with the provinces, that would generate 
the same level of revenue as the GST did in the past, that there 
would be a single administration to implement it, that there would 
be only one group of auditors bothering businessmen, etc.
<P>
	We have begun the process of having a national tax harmonized 
with the provinces. We regret not having been able to do so across 
the board immediately, but we have had the co-operation of four 
provinces so far, and are counting on the others, in order to have a 
single tax. According to many of the opposition members, we are 
the only country in the world to have two competing levels of sales 
tax.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to clarify things for the Prime Minister and for anyone 
else, the Minister of Finance had promised to abolish the GST. He 
said ``We did not do so, and I apologize for that, it was a bad thing 
to do''. The Deputy Prime Minister had said ``We are going to 
scrap the GST or I will quit''. Acknowledging her commitment, she 
has resigned. As for the Prime Minister, he had said ``We are going 
to scrap the GST''. So what is he going to do now?

a Prime Minister who has successfully protected our social

Speaker, even if the Minister of Finance shouts himself hoarse 
issuing all kinds of challenges, he will not make us forget that we 
heard him admit on television he made an honest mistake. 
Everyone heard him.
<P>
	I understand why the Prime Minister had him responding to the 
third question: because the Minister of Finance has far more 
credibility than he does as a result of admitting he made a mistake.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 
usually-although we have not seen him do it today-brandishes 
the red book to try to confirm his promise with respect to the GST.
<P>
	Will he finally realize that millions of people heard him say on 
television and in all other forums that he would scrap the GST? 
When will he admit that he has not kept his promise, as his 
Minister of Finance and his Deputy Prime Minister have done? 
Number Two and Number Three on either side of him have both 
realized this; only the one in the middle has not.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a few minutes ago, the Deputy Prime Minister stated that 
she was totally satisfied the government had kept its word, as 
mentioned in the red book on page 20 in French and 22 in English.
<P>
	We have kept our campaign promise of a new tax generating 
equivalent revenues. If the hon. member refuses to believe what is 
written, there is not much I can do about it. We campaigned on this. 
That is what we have been saying for weeks, and the Minister of 
Finance will work on a new national sales tax with the co-operation 
of all provincial governments.
<P>
	Furthermore, an all-party committee of this House, which spent 
one year studying the problem, recommended the strategy used by 
the Minister of Finance to honour the commitment in the red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we, too, have read his red book more than once.  However, 
when one compares what is written in the red book with what his 
government has just done, one can see that, even then, the 
government has not kept its word since, on page 20 in the French 
version of the red book, the Liberal Party promises, and I quote: 
``Nous substituerons-''.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister consulted a dictionary from time to time or 
watched the evening news on Radio-Canada before going to bed, he 
might understand the meaning of this French word. ``Substituer'' 
means ``to replace'', to replace the GST with something else. Two 
weeks ago, the Liberal government confirmed that the GST would 
be maintained. All it did was give it a different acronym.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit, as his Minister of Finance and his 
former Deputy Prime Minister did, that he has laughed at the 
people and broken his promise, as he has done for his entire 
political career on all kinds of issues?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in 
Quebec and in the other provinces with which an agreement was 
reached, there will now be a single sales tax instead of two, a single 
tax collector instead of two, a single tax base instead of two.
<P>

not rationalize taxes with Quebec? Is the hon. member completely

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
although under great public pressure, the former Deputy Prime 
Minister has done the right thing and resigned her seat in the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> She made a promise and is now keeping that 
promise.
<P>
	The Liberals promised to abolish, scrap and kill the GST and 
broke that promise. Now even Sheila Copps realizes that the 
government cannot continue to justify the unjustifiable.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Will he now finally admit 
that his government has broken its election promise to abolish, 
scrap and kill the GST?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in talking about integrity, I would like to mention the 
flip-flop by the hon. member within a few hours and the fact that 
his party 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2181"> 2181 </A></B>
<P>
totally ignored the same statement by the member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan for  two years before reluctantly asking him 
to change what he said.
<P>
	I do not think we have any lessons to learn from that party about 
anything in politics, especially after hearing words like that which 
are completely unacceptable in a modern society like Canada 
where tolerance is the modus vivendi of the whole nation.
<P>
	I have always said that the red book is clear. We said we would 
replace the GST with a national harmonized sales tax with the 
provincial governments. So far we have done this with four 
provinces. With the help of the provincial governments it will be 
done with the rest of them. It is the red book commitment and the 
promise we have kept.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
funny that Sheila Copps did not see it that way and all we have left 
in her memory are roses on her desk used as a prop.
<P>
	Sheila Copps said today in her press conference that she 
overstepped the red book. She had every opportunity to overstep 
the red book when it was lying on the floor because that is where 
that red book belongs, especially page 22.
<P>
	Liberal candidates campaigned on a promise to abolish, scrap 
and kill the GST and they know it. What Canadians demand to 
know now is why has the Prime Minister tried so hard to hide the 
fact that the Liberals broke their number one election promise.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister again, why did he not simply come 
clean with Canadians from the very start and tell them that he had 
absolutely no intention of eliminating the GST?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if you want to quote Madam Copps, she said a few hours 
ago that we are doing exactly what we said in the red book. She said 
that she had made a personal promise that was more than what the 
red book stated and that she had to live with that promise.
<P>
	Yesterday, you challenged her to have the guts to go to her 
riding. She is waiting for you to come to her riding with the 
member for Nanaimo-Cowichan. She will tell the people of 
Hamilton what kind of party you are, which attacks everybody who 
is coloured or who has other differences in order to please the 
narrow-minded people in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	The majority of the people of Canada are not like the Reform 
Party. They are generous people who tolerate people of colour, of 
different religions and different mode de vie, which was so 
shamefully mentioned yesterday by the member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan and supported by the acting leader of the 
Reform Party. During that time, the leader of the party has been 
hiding in British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would remind you of two things. 
Would you please all address your remarks to the Chair. Second, 
would you please refrain from mentioning whether a member is 
here or not.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
challenge has been put out for me to be in Hamilton East. I will be 
there, you betcha.
<P>
	The member for Hamilton East-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, the former member for Hamilton 
East's decision to honour the promise she made to her constituents 
puts the rest of the Liberal caucus in a pretty tight spot. I think we 
can see that today.
<P>
	Like Sheila Copps, they ran on a platform that included 
scrapping the GST. I am sure there will be a lot of soul searching 
going on in Liberal offices today now that the former Deputy Prime 
Minister has blown the GST red book sham completely out of the 
water.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister one more time, what does he have to say 
to Liberal MPs who got elected on a promise to abolish the GST 
and are now considering whether to follow Sheila Copps' lead?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we go back to the basic issues.
<P>
	On the issue of human rights, we saw what happened to the chief 
whip. The member for Beaver River claimed yesterday that what 
the chief whip said was supported by the majority of her 
constituents.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Shame, shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been in the 
member's riding and I do not believe that reflects the views of her 
constituents. I do not believe it reflects the views of Canadians. If 
the hon. member is going to go to Hamilton East, we will all be 
there. I want to make sure I am there the day she is.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The history of the Liberal Party's election campaigns is 
revealing. In 1974, they promised not to freeze wages and prices. 
They did not keep their word. In 1979, they made a commitment 
not to raise the gasoline tax. They did not keep their word. In 1989, 
they promised to tear up the free trade agreement if elected. They 
did not keep their word. In 1993, they got elected on the promise of 
eliminating the GST, and again they did not keep their word. And 
that is not to mention countless unkept constitutional promises 
made to the people of Quebec.
<P>
	Facts clearly show that, in every election over the past 20 years, 
the Liberal Party has repeatedly taken office under false pretences. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2182"> 2182 </A></B>
<P>
How can the Prime Minister still  expect the public to have any 
confidence in his government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we got a fair number of our candidates elected in the last 
election. The next time an election is held, we will get re-elected 
with a substantial majority. I can bet the hon. member a much 
smaller number of her colleagues will be elected to this House in 
the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is very well known in Quebec. In the 
last referendum, the people voted yes-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> In his own riding.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> -in his own 
riding. He should run in Rimouski-Témiscouata to see who would 
win then.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	My second question is as follows. When will the Prime Minister 
come to the realization that the only thing he can do at this point is 
to apologize to the people of Canada for breaking his promise 
regarding the GST?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is to be found on page 22 of the red book.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
finance minister has apologized for his role in the GST fiasco. The 
former Deputy Prime Minister, Sheila Copps, has jumped, or was 
she pushed? Now we have the situation of the Prime Minister in 
denial.
<P>
	The question is very simple. When is the Prime Minister going 
to admit that he and his government broke their promise to scrap 
the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government has brought in a policy after going through over 20 
options and after working for close to two and half years to find a 
better solution. This policy is the one recommended by the finance 
committee and supported fully by the Reform Party.
<P>
	Why is it that the Reform Party now stands up day after day 
denying what it said? Why is the Reform Party swallowing itself 
whole? Why does it not admit what it admitted at the time of the 
finance committee, that this is good public policy. Is it afraid to 
endorse something that is good for Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
finance minister knows very well that we have called on the 
government from day one to fulfil its promise to scrap the GST. It 
is how the Liberals won the election. He and all the members 
across the way who ran on that promise should take the high dive.
<P>
	I want to quote from the House record from June 16, 1994. These 
are the words of the Prime Minister. He said: ``There can be no 
substitute for responsibility at the top. The Prime Minister sets the 
moral tone for the government and must make the ultimate 
decision when issues of trust and integrity are raised. That is what 
leadership is all about. As Harry Truman put it: The buck stops 
here''.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. When is he going to start 
accepting responsibility? When is he going to admit that he broke 
his promise on the GST?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance said what was the policy of the 
government very clearly.
<P>
	A committee of the House, as promised in the red book, studied 
the problem of finding an alternative to the GST. The committee 
came up with this recommendation. It was supported by the 
Reform Party, the same party that changed its position five times 
on the GST.
<P>
	We were consistent. We said that it had to be replaced by one 
sales tax. I remember very well the Reform Party saying that it was 
completely unacceptable to have 10 different provincial sales taxes 
plus a federal sales tax.
<P>
	The members of the committee went across the nation for a year. 
Their report was supported by the Reform Party and it is exactly 
what the Minister of Finance is implementing at this time.
<P>
	We have nothing to apologize for. It is what is written in the red 
book on page 22 and it is what was recommended by a committee 
of the House formed by Liberal members and Reform members 
who supported that policy as the only good alternative to the 
present system.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The current consultation process for the Canada pension plan is a 
top down, closed door, elitist sham. The fix is in. The chair has 
been ordered to report by mid-June and he has already decided the 
outcome, and now I have been denied the opportunity to stand 
before that committee in my home town of Calgary to make a five 
minute presentation.
<P>
	I ask the minister to explain to the House why a member of 
Parliament has been denied this opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the process of consultation on 
the CPP is a joint effort between the Government of Canada and the 
provinces. As we go across the country federal representatives are 
conducting hearings in co-operation with their provincial 
counterparts.
<P>
	There are very few Canadians who have the kind of opportunity 
the hon. member has to make a contribution on a whole series of 
subjects brought before the House. This and other topics can be 
discussed in the House on any number of occasions. Whatever 
contribution the hon. member wishes to make to the consultative 
process on CPP we would be happy to receive.
<P>
	To have members of Parliament take up the time of committees 
when they are travelling across the country does not appear to be 
necessarily the best use of committees time.
<P>
	I want to tell the hon. member that whatever her views on this 
consultative process, I would be happy to receive them and will 
make sure they are taken into consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for that answer. It is the one that I did 
anticipate.
<P>
	I would like to tell the minister to put a red circle around 
Tuesday, May 7 in Calgary next week because I will be at the 
committee hearing.
<P>
	We keep hearing the government wants to consult with all 
Canadians on how to save the Canada pension plan. This should 
mean people from all provinces of Canada. The only hearing in 
British Columbia has been cancelled, well before the B.C. writ was 
dropped.
<P>
	Will the minister explain to the House why he refuses to hear 
from people in all provinces on how to save the Canada pension 
plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, because of the nature of the 
Canada pension plan and how it can be modified, I am sure the hon. 
member knows it is a very complex situation requiring a large 
number of provinces representing a very significant percentage of 
the population of Canada before anything can be done. We will 
have as extensive a consultation as possible.
<P>
	A very integral part of the process of consultation involves the 
provinces because the CPP is a partnership. As we enter into the 
consultative process, obviously we have to ask our provincial 
colleagues how they wish to proceed as well.
<P>
	There is no intention on the part of anyone either at the national 
government level or at the provincial level to preclude the 
participation of anyone. This process of public consultation is only 
one of the many available to members of Parliament and to 
Canadian citizens.

wishes to participate to make their views known to us. We will take 
them into account.

cuts on francophones outside Quebec. Does the Prime Minister

responsible for the  CBC's inability to meet the needs of the 
country's francophones?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that 
Radio-Canada and the CBC must respect not only their own act but 
also the Official Languages Act. I think we can say that the 
corporation respects this act.
<P>
	As for the cuts, it is very clear that Radio-Canada and the CBC 
have a board of directors and that it is up to them to make choices 
consistent with the needs they must meet throughout the country. 
We respect the responsibility of the CBC's directors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
corporation may be respecting the act, but this government is not, 
when it comes to keeping its promises not to cut funding to the 
CBC. Everyone recognizes that the absence of adequate means of 
communication is a factor in assimilation.
<P>
	By going back on his promises not to reduce the CBC's budget, 
just as he went back on his promises to scrap the GST, will the 
Prime Minister go on much longer denying that it is through 
measures such as these that his government is playing an active 
role in the assimilation of francophones outside Quebec?

Mr. Speaker, the hon. member did not finish his question but I can

revitalization plan was developed over a period of about a year, 
stemming from the Fraser report, 70 stakeholders and a round table

	It is not a perfect plan. It is not a plan which has 100 per cent

in the commercial salmon industry. However, the plan does address 
the difficulty of overcapacity in the fishing industry.
<P>
	He is right, it may not result in fewer salmon caught. However, at 
least it will reduce the pressure on the salmon that exist. The 
salmon stocks are at a very low level.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="2185"> 2185 </A></B>
<P>
	This plan will address the problem. It will help the stocks. It 
will help the industry at a time when it is low. It will help in the 
revitalization despite the plan the member has, which would derail 
everything that would help the fishermen and their families.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr.

it decrease the pressure on the fish? It makes no sense.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In March 1993, the then Leader of the Opposition and current 
Prime Minister of Canada made the following comments about the 
amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act introduced by 
the Conservative government, and I quote: ``The Liberal Party is 
appalled by these measures. Obviously, by reducing benefits and 
further penalizing those who leave their jobs voluntarily, the 
government shows very little concern for the victims of the 
economic crisis. Instead of getting to the heart of the problem, it 
goes after the unemployed''.
<P>
	As his government is getting ready to adopt a so-called reform of 
the unemployment insurance program, which makes existing 
penalties even harsher, is solely designed to cut billions of dollars 
in funding and will have a more devastating effect than any reform 
to date, how can the Prime Minister justify this new about-face on 
the part of the Liberals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons why we had 
to find ways to improve on the Unemployment Insurance Act was 
precisely the fact that tens of thousands of women could not have 
access to the program at all.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member knows full well that, as a result of changes 
made to the Unemployment Insurance Act, women working less 
than 15 hours per week for instance, who used to be penalized for 
all kinds of reasons, will now be covered and have access not only 
to the unemployment insurance program, but also to a variety of 
programs also designed for those considered to be ordinary 
employees by their employers.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the Unemployment Insurance Act had to 
be amended. Everyone agrees with that. But what is happening 
now? The government has introduced legislation. Members of the 
committee to which the bill was referred have proposed 
amendments. But all we hear coming from the official opposition 
party is that the bill should be withdrawn.
<P>
	We do not know whether they in favour of the status quo, 
whether they have amendments to suggest that might be regarded 
as improvements, or whether they are just playing petty politics at 
the expense of the most vulnerable segment of our society.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the then 
Prime Minister told people protesting against a reform less 
devastating that this one that they could count on the Liberals to 
demand that the bill be withdrawn.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not agree that this reform is of no help 
at all in resolving the unemployment problem? In his own words, it 
does not go to the root of the problem. Worse yet, it is 
anti-employment.

Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a very 
important point in her question and that is this concern with 
employment. The bill does provide among other things for $300 
million to be invested in a transition fund, precisely to create jobs 
in the most disadvantaged regions of the country.
<P>
	As an extra benefit, once the program is fully implemented, $800 
million will be invested in job creation programs. There is one 
thing on which we agree with the hon. member, who is her party's 
critic on the subject. We agree that the solution to the problem 
facing the unemployed is job creation. And that is what we are 
working on.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Correctional Services Canada is showing how innovative it can be 
in the Edmonton Institution for Women. There were three more 
escapes last night. That means that one-quarter of all inmates have 
walked away from that place.
<P>
	Since it opened last November there has also been a suicide, an 
assault on staff, and several reports of attempted suicide and 
self-mutilation.
<P>
	Does the acting solicitor general agree with the warden that there 
is nothing to worry about at this prison even though there are 
children being raised there? Or does he think it is time to close this 
mistake until they get their act together at the Edmonton prison?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite right to 
raise this issue. The solicitor general is concerned about it, as are 
the department, the warden and I. We are taking steps to upgrade 
security at the facility.
<P>
	Many practical steps have already been taken. Today the 
solicitor general called the attorney general of Alberta and 
arrangements have been made in the meantime to transfer many of 
the inmates to provincial institutions, another example of 
co-operation between the two levels of government and 
corrections.
<P>
	Many of the inmates have been transferred to provincial 
institutions in Alberta. There are difficulties at the Edmonton 
facility and steps have been taken and will be taken to address 
them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has built five such prisons in the country. I have visited 
two of them.
<P>
	Virtually all of the guards at this prison in Edmonton were hired 
straight out of college. I think it is time the government look not 
only at the Edmonton Institution for Women but at the Nova 
Institution for Women and all the other facilities to revise its 
policy. Change it.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	I ask the justice minister if that is the case. Is the government 
looking to change its policy on women's prisons?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the opening of the 
correctional facility in Edmonton was the result of a task force, 
established in 1989, which recommended the closure of the 
correctional facility in Kingston in favour of opening five regional 
centres.
<P>
	To date we have had problems in Edmonton, but there are other 
facilities that have proven to be without incident, one in Maple 
Creek, Saskatchewan and one in Truro, Nova Scotia.
<P>
	On the question of safety and security in Edmonton, today 
Correctional Services Canada announced an additional eight 
measures it is implementing to ensure safety, which was a concern 
expressed by my colleagues from Edmonton East and Edmonton 
North.
<P>
	These measures are taken very seriously. We have implemented 
the procedures and are doing so immediately.

	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, flooding in 
southern Manitoba has reached critical levels. In the Red River 
Valley region alone 180 families have been evacuated.
<P>
	The Government of Manitoba is saying national defence is not 
meeting its responsibility to the flood victims.
<P>
	Can the Minister of National Defence tell the people of 
Manitoba what actions and financial help Canada has provided to 
southern Manitoba flood victims?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the flooding in 
Manitoba this year has been particularly severe. As was the case in 
southeastern Saskatchewan last year, there are mechanisms in place 
whereby the federal government can assist the provinces.
<P>
	The prime responsibility for co-ordination of disaster relief is 
with the provinces, and the province has requested relief and 
assistance from the Canadian Armed Forces. Seventy class A 
reservists have been working over the last three or four days to 
assist with flooding in the Saint-Adolphe area.
<P>
	However, under the disaster financial arrangements regime there 
is a program whereby the federal government can assist the 
provinces and in turn the provinces can compensate individuals or 
municipalities. Officials of the two governments are working on 
this right now. Official requests are to come in the next few days.

<P>
	B.C. communities have elected their representatives, raised the

<P>
	Will he now commit to suspending the May 24 deadline and 
commit to beginning a serious discussion with representatives of 
the affected communities who have already been chosen to 
negotiate effective ways to achieve fish stock enhancement that 
will also maintain west coast communities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's question, which I 
know is a serious one.
<P>
	I met with a community sustainability group yesterday. It 
expressed some of the concerns and misunderstandings with the 
Pacific revitalization plan which, as I said, is not 100 per cent 
perfect. I understand these difficulties and I understand the 
uncertainty involved. I have great concern for the concerns of 
fishermen and their families.
<P>
	I will be in British Columbia tomorrow meeting with fishermen, 
addressing their concerns, listening to them, bridging some of the 
gaps, addressing uncertainties and fine tuning the program, which 
will probably address some of the items mentioned by the hon. 
member.

been breached by the unacceptable remarks made by a member of 
this House.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	The discriminatory and racist comments made by the hon. 
member for Nanaimo-Cowichan prompt me to ask you to suspend 
him from this House until his case is reviewed by the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	In an interview to the <I>Vancouver Sun</I>, the hon. member said that 
if he ran a business and if he had a homosexual employee-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, you may be a few seconds 
late, as the hon. member has already made a speech today in which 
he offered to withdraw his comments and admitted he had made a 
mistake.
<P>
	It seems to me that, given this fact, the question of privilege is 
not in order at this point.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am indeed aware that 
the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan did apologize in this 
House, but I insist that apologies are necessary. The fact remains 
that the comments made by our colleague infringe on the dignity of 
the people of Canada and Quebec, and I really think that this 
statement-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Many times statements are made outside the 
House which are not made in the House. Our precedents tell us 
these are things said outside of the House and therefore are not 
necessarily the purview of the House.
<P>

they have tried to clarify them. The member does not have a point 
of privilege in this matter. I would like to pass from this matter

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order on the same issue. I wish to remind the Chair that, 
less than three years ago, the hon. member for Rosemont, who then 
sat as an independent, was ordered by the Speaker to apologize for 
comments he had made outside the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member brings up something that 
happened in 1993. I have no reason to doubt that. I am going from 
memory because I was a member of the House at the time. I will 
inform myself of this in a formal way, but it seems to me the 
member for Rosemont made suggestions about members of the 
House and the House itself. However, in this case, to my 
knowledge, the words used did not reflect on the House, on a 
member or on the works of the House.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Because the hon. member does bring up a very specific point, I 
wonder if the House would grant me some time to look into this 
and see if that precedent can apply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I point out that according to the standing 
orders, once you have made a ruling members of the House should 
not question your ruling. Therefore I object to what is going on 
here.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is true I have made a ruling on a point of 
privilege. I am not dealing with a point of privilege here. I am 
dealing with a point of order brought up by an hon. member. I will 
look at this precedent and if it does exist I want to see what the

<P>
	This petition was conceived, drafted and brought forward by this 
group of innovative and creative students. There are approximately 
185 signatures on this petition calling for Senate reform. These

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
interest and hope that I table in this House a petition signed by 339 
persons who support the organization Le Patriarche, which 
provides therapy to drug addicts.
<P>
	Founded in France in 1972, Le Patriarche is established in 
Canada and it also provides services to drug addicts in over 15 
countries throughout the world. Le Patriarche needs volunteers 
from abroad to apply its therapy and to train Canadians to take over 
this responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	I therefore support these petitioners, who ask the government to 
make it easier for volunteer therapists from abroad to come to 
Canada. Since the problems related to drug addiction are on the rise 
and affect more and more young people, it is essential to support 
organizations such as Le Patriarche.

to keep dangerous sex offenders and pedophiles locked up for life; 
to eliminate statutory release; impose stiffer sentences for violent 
offenders; have violent offenders serve their full sentences and 
have time added for bad behaviour; have a central register for the 
names and addresses of violent offenders; give more power to the 
legal institutions to keep dangerous criminals, even after the

an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its

chronically ill or the aged.

consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems or 
impair one's ability and, specifically, that fetal alcohol syndrome 
and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent preventable

that everyone who counsels a person to commit suicide and who 
aids and abets a person to commit suicide, whether suicide ensues 
or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.

	The petitioners ask Parliament not to repeal or amend section

the Supreme Court of Canada of September 30, 1993 to disallow 
assisted suicides and euthanasia.

<P>
	The petitioners, all being residents of Canada, petition the 
following: that the wartime merchant navy was the fourth arm of 
the armed services; that veterans of wartime merchant navy are 
under the Civilian War Related Benefits Act; that one in ten 
Canadian merchant seamen lost their lives, the highest proportional 
rate of all services, and that merchant navy prisoners of war spent 
50 months on average in imprisonment but only 30 months are 
recognized.

the wartime merchant navy equal to that enjoyed by the veterans of 
Canada, World War II armed services.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I declare the motion carried.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CONSIDERATIONRESUMEDOFSECONDREADING">CONSIDERATION RESUMED OF SECOND READING</A></H4>
	The House resumed from April 30, consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-33, an act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, there are four minutes 
remaining for questions or comments on the intervention of the 
hon. member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know it has been some time for Canadians who are 
watching this on television. This debate is on Bill C-33, which is a 
government order to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act by 
inserting the two words, sexual orientation.
<P>
	Since we are in the period for questions and comments, I will ask 
my honoured and learned colleague from Fraser Valley East if he 
would tell the television viewers across the country what the 
implications of the insertion of those two words in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act might be for them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have four minutes or maybe less now. 
Parliamentarians have an hour left to speak on this. Again it is a 
travesty that the Liberals have brought in closure to restrict open 
debate.
<P>
	Last night I asked for unanimous consent to split my time with 
the member for Ontario who is not being allowed to speak by the 
Liberal Party. That permission was denied by the members of the 
Liberal Party, which is a shame. They talk about freedom to speak 
one's mind and their own members are not allowed. One of their 
members was not even allowed to split my time with me.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
member has made a statement which is not accurate and reflects 
badly on other members of the House. Anybody who wants to 
speak is allowed to speak-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is a matter for debate, not a point of 
order. The time will not come out of the time of the hon. member 
for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the person who 
was just on her feet denied unanimous consent when I tried to 
obtain it yesterday.
<P>
	It is a shame-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is a second point of order which 
will not come out of any member's time. The hon. parliamentary 
secretary on a point of order. I hope it is not the same point of order.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2192"> 2192 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
member is making accusations which are not correct. he has also 
made an accusation which to me has taken the Chair in question. 
He is attributing that we are deciding who speaks in this House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary will 
know that his party will have the floor for the next speaker after the 
present speaker finishes in two minutes. Then the parliamentary 
secretary will be permitted to get up and explain what he has just 
said as part of debate.
<P>
	The hon. member for Fraser Valley East has about three minutes 
left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess I am down to two minutes now. 
I am not sure if they are going to jump up again.
<P>
	If they would care to look in yesterday's <I>Hansard</I>, I stood in this 
spot and said that I would like unanimous consent to split my time 
with the member for Ontario. That unanimous consent was denied 
by members of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that it is disgusting that the Liberals will 
not allow people in their own party to speak. It is disgusting that 
they have invoked closure. If I had another 40 minutes, I could get 
wound up again on the whole issue we are debating here.
<P>
	However, the issue I am raising now is that I made an offer to the 
member for Ontario. I had talked it over with him previously and 
said that I would do that. Consent was denied. He has been denied 
the privilege to speak by his own party. That is truly disgusting. 
Now the rest of the members will not be allowed to speak because 
closure is in place.
<P>
	I have gone through the issue and my remarks are in <I>Hansard</I> for 
everyone to see. Closure is being invoked for the umpteenth time, 
which is far worse than what the Mulroney Tories ever did.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	I would just like to point out that the Liberals are denying free 
speech in their own House of Commons and I think that is truly 
disgusting.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too would like to say how ashamed and upset I am that people in 
this House-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe 
the next speaker in the normal order is in fact a Liberal member. I 
believe it is the secretary of state for-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member was sitting there an 
instant ago and watched me look at her whole bench and nobody 
moved a muscle. The only person who was standing was the hon. 
member for Calgary North. The hon. member for Calgary North 
has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an issue of real concern to 
Canadians. The phone is ringing off the hook  in my office. I have 
scores of letters from my constituents about this legislation yet 
debate is being stifled in this House by the government. The most 
undemocratic thing that has ever happened in this Parliament is to 
have debate on contentious issues simply cut off at the knees 
because the Liberals want to ram it through. Shame. I speak with 
the outrage of many Canadians across the country.
<P>
	Unfortunately this debate has been surrounded by a high degree 
of politicization and emotion. I want to touch on the perception that 
was conveyed by the reported remarks of my colleague from 
Nanaimo-Cowichan. Those remarks were most unfortunate and 
were completely inconsistent with Reform policy.
<P>
	Once again, I want to put on the record that the Reform Party 
will take a back seat to no one in opposing unfairness and 
discrimination. We believe strongly in the principle of equality, 
that all Canadians are equal, entitled to equal protection under the 
law, equal freedoms, equal protection from discrimination and hate 
mongering. Even where we may disagree with the lifestyles or 
viewpoints of others, the innate value, dignity and worth of each 
individual is to be respected and affirmed.
<P>
	This legislation must be looked at on the merits of whether it is 
serving the best interests of Canadians and whether it is in fact 
furthering the goal of equally protecting Canadians from unfairness 
and discrimination in our society because that is a goal we all 
believe in and to which we are all committed. There are four 
reasons that this legislation should not proceed at this time.
<P>
	The first point is it negates the key principle of equality in a 
democracy. This is a very important principle which we need to be 
looking at and have not looked at properly in my view. We should 
not be looking at whether we should be adding one group or 
another to the federal human rights legislation. We should focus 
instead on the broader principle of equality and individual rights.
<P>
	The principles of equality and individuals rights apply to 
individuals and are based on the position of each person as a human 
being, not on group membership. Recognizing different categories 
of people for the purpose of defining or augmenting their rights 
under the Canadian Human Rights Act is negating the principle of 
equality and polarizing Canadian society.
<P>
	So far the Canadian Human Rights Act lists 10 categories of 
Canadians deserving special protections. Special interest groups 
have used and are using these categorizations to demand 
preferential treatment, not equal treatment but preferential 
treatment. Often their claim is based on the rationale that special 
treatment is required to make up for past injustices or for certain 
inherent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2193"> 2193 </A></B>
<P>
disadvantages. This has led to a situation where  Canadians are no 
longer equal. Groups not currently included in the list justifiably 
argue for inclusion.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	We see this in the United States where there is a real movement 
to include prohibitions against discrimination of people based on 
their height. I personally would applaud that. That is another 
expansion that logically this kind of approach leads to. There is a 
movement for the prevention of discrimination based on size or 
weight. There is a movement for the prevention of discrimination 
based on looks. If one is not attractive, according to that particular 
lobby, then one is discriminated against and not given the same 
opportunities as others. Where does it all end?
<P>
	We need to look carefully at the kind of approach we are taking 
to this legislation before we rush it through. We should back up and 
take a long range look at it.
<P>
	The Reform Party strongly believes that all Canadians are 
entitled to the same rights and privileges under the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. However, the protections awarded by this act 
do not ensure equality but rather tend to have the opposite result in 
some cases. It sets Canadians against each other in a quest for 
economic benefits which benefit one group at the cost of another.
<P>
	All of us have friends and family members who want to pursue 
different professions or different opportunities in the federal public 
service but are told: ``No point in applying. You do not have the 
special group characteristics that are required at the current time''. 
Extending the special protections of the Canadian Human Rights 
Act to a constantly growing list of groups will lead to increasing 
infringement of the existing privileges and rights of other 
Canadians.
<P>
	Under the current wording of the Canadian Human Rights Act, 
inequalities clearly do exist. Therefore, the only logically 
consistent and defensible way to oppose extending these special 
rights to groups not currently included is by proposing to eliminate 
those inequalities while strongly affirming a belief in the equality 
and rights of individuals.
<P>
	The debate we really ought to be having is to back up, take a 
clear look at the big picture and the principles we are attempting to 
protect. Before we go too far down the road of adding more and 
more specially designated groups, we should first consider 
replacing all prohibited grounds of discrimination. We should also 
replace the special categories currently listed in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act with a clearly worded straight definition of 
fundamental human rights that applies to each and every Canadian 
without discrimination and without any inequality at all. We have 
not looked at this approach. It is one I believe must be considered 
and properly debated before we move to add more and more groups 
to the human rights legislation.
<P>
	The second reason this legislation should not be passed at this 
time is that Canadians are very unsure, and I believe rightly so, 
about the effects and the consequences of passing this legislation. 
The government put out a little book about what would be the effect 
of passing this legislation. It says that it would not extend 
economic benefits to different groups and a number of other things 
which it is alleged this legislation would not do. Unfortunately I do 
not think it is any surprise to Canadians that once legislation is in 
place, its interpretation or application very much depends on 
decisions of the courts.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Canadians are rightly asking: Will this legislation change our 
application of economic benefits? Will this legislation change our 
definition of family and the basic building blocks for our society? 
Will this legislation prohibit people who disagree with certain 
viewpoints from voicing that disagreement, or if they choose to 
speak their own opinion, will that be considered discrimination? 
Will they be muzzled and their freedom of speech abrogated? 
These are very real logical questions and they should be answered.
<P>
	What does the Liberal government do when these very serious 
questions are put forward by the Canadian people? It cuts off 
debate, in effect saying: ``We do not want to talk about this. We are 
not going to answer your questions. It is going to go through and let 
the chips fall where they may''.
<P>
	Canadians are increasingly losing confidence in their lawmakers 
and no wonder. They are often told one thing and the consequences 
are something quite different. Canadians have a real lack of trust 
and confidence in their lawmakers.
<P>
	We have a duty as lawmakers to address that by being open and 
transparent and taking all the time necessary to answer the very real 
concerns, fears and objections of the people who are going to have 
to live with this legislation. We must do that. It is our 
responsibility. We represent these people. Pushing something 
through because a few people in their wisdom have decided this is 
the way the country should be going is not the way a democracy 
should be working. Shame on us.
<P>
	Shame on us for not taking the time to respond to the concerns 
that I am hearing in my constituency office. I am willing to wager 
that every single member of Parliament is hearing those same 
concerns. That is not the way to bring in good legislation.
<P>
	The third reason we should hesitate in pushing ahead with this 
legislation particularly in such a high-handed manner is that it does 
not enjoy the support of the majority of Canadians. I have already 
mentioned that Canadians are concerned about the real effects and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2194"> 2194 </A></B>
<P>
consequences of this kind of bill. In addition to that,  simply put, it 
does not enjoy the support of the broad base of the Canadian public.
<P>
	Surely if we have to live with laws, they should at least meet 
with our approval. If we think that people would approve if they 
knew all the ins and outs, then it is up to us to place that 
information in front of the public, to inform them to the point 
where public opinion would broadly support this kind of a measure. 
If we truly believe this is right for our society, that it is something 
which is necessary, proper, fair and just, then it would be no trouble 
at all. There would be no problem in getting Canadians behind it.
<P>
	But what does this Liberal government do? It introduces the 
legislation, it introduces closure, it shoves the debate through and 
just pushes it upon Canadians without any consideration for their 
hesitation, their concerns and their lack of support. That is wrong. 
It should not be done that way. I protest in the strongest possible 
terms on behalf of the people of Canada at the way this legislation 
that is going to affect us and the way we perceive society is being 
dealt with and that there are special protections for yet another 
group.
<P>
	I did a survey in my riding of Calgary North in anticipation that 
this issue would come forward. I listed arguments that were most 
often brought forward in favour of the inclusion of sexual 
orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the arguments 
that were most often brought forward against it. I received over 
1,000 responses. Not one response criticized the objectiveness or 
completeness of the background information that I provided to my 
constituents.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	As an elected representative I need to give people objective 
information. They need to know both sides of any question. They 
need to know the pros and the cons, which there always are in 
whatever proposal comes forward. They need time to look at the 
information, to consider it and discuss it in order to make an 
informed decision.
<P>
	Of the 1,035 responses I received to the question: Do you think 
the federal government should amend federal legislation to add 
sexual orientation as a prohibited grounds of discrimination, 67.9 
per cent said no; 26.3 per cent said yes; 4.4 per cent were 
undecided; and 1.4 per cent had no response.
<P>
	I then asked a second question: If yes, would you support this 
amendment if it meant extending economic and family benefits 
that heterosexual couples currently enjoy such as medical, 
survivor, income tax benefits, marriage and adoption to 
homosexual couples? Of the 272 people who answered yes to 
question number one, that sexual orientation should be included, 
64.3 per cent of those 272 people agreed that economic and family 
benefits should also be extended to same sex couples, 28  per cent 
disagreed, 7.7 per cent were undecided and no one omitted a 
response.
<P>
	That is the result from one poll in one urban riding. It has a very 
wide and broad range of people and backgrounds. It is incumbent 
upon us, it seems to me, to take more time to canvass the public 
when putting into place legislation that is going to affect our 
society for many years to come. It would have results we cannot 
clearly foresee pending court interpretation of the legislation.
<P>
	As this legislation deserves a more sober, broad based and public 
dimension and consultation, I would move an amendment to the 
bill before the House at this time. I move that we:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Delete all the words after ``That'' in the main question and substitute the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-33, an act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act be not now read a 
second time, but that it be read a second time six months hence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion is acceptable.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member said in her remarks that the Reform 
Party was all in favour of equal rights for all Canadians. Yet it 
appears that her intention is to get rid of part of the Canadian 
Human Rights Act and take away rights that have been granted.
<P>
	It is my view, and I think the view of most Canadians, that the 
provisions of the act which prohibit discrimination based on race, 
national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, marital status, 
family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been 
granted, have been widely accepted as advancing the interests and 
the opportunities for the persons named on that list, which is, of 
course. the vast majority of the Canadian population, since sex 
after all is one of the prohibited grounds.
<P>
	I understand that most women's groups feel their interests have 
been advanced by the legislation. I am also of the view that most 
persons who come from various ethnic backgrounds or persons of 
colour feel that their interests have been advanced by this 
legislation and so have persons with disabilities in particular. I 
mention those groups because they are strongly in support of this 
legislation.
<P>
	If the hon. member thinks that there should be equality for all, 
why does she oppose the inclusion of persons who are being 
discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation? They have 
provided ample evidence of this discrimination over the years. 
They have sought this amendment for many years and now Reform 
Party members seek to exclude them from this list because in their 
view they are unworthy of inclusion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2195"> 2195 </A></B>
<P>
	Why does the hon. member not come clean and admit that is 
the real reason behind her remarks? It is not because she does not 
think this act has done a good job. She is not advocating repeal 
of this act and she knows it. I invite her to answer that comment. 
Is she not trying to simply whitewash the Reform Party position 
by saying everyone should be equal.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the intervention of the 
member for Kingston and the Islands because he is on record as 
supporting the first remarks in my intervention in this debate that 
the use of closure in this House is morally wicked. I appreciate the 
fact that he feels so strongly on behalf of the right of members to 
fully and fairly debate issues. Unfortunately the comments he made 
in that regard were in the last Parliament. He seems suddenly to 
have changed his stance in this one.
<P>
	We need to look at what we are trying to accomplish in this 
legislation. The member talks about advancing opportunities but is 
that what we are trying to do in this legislation? I would submit that 
this legislation is trying to eliminate unfairness and discrimination 
against Canadian citizens.
<P>
	If we are doing that, it is is something that each and every 
Canadian citizen is entitled to. We are all individually and equally 
entitled to protection against discrimination and unfairness.
<P>
	What happens? We have a Canadian Human Rights Act. The 
member is quite correct. I certainly would never support abrogating 
that act. It enshrines very important principles of fairness, equality 
and anti-discrimination in our society. Instead of a straightforward 
definition of fundamental, individual human rights, it puts in 
categories. It says these people are entitled to special protection 
against discrimination, not all of us equally, but these groups.
<P>
	The member even mentioned a category that is not in the 
legislation: the disabled. The point he is making is quite correct. 
Many people in our society for many reasons suffer unfairness and 
discrimination. That should be stamped out. They should be 
protected against that but on the basis that they have fundamental 
individual rights and individual liberties and not because they are a 
member of a group. No one would be excluded at all if there were 
no categories because we would all be equally entitled to equal 
protection, equal fairness and equal protection from 
discrimination. I submit that is exactly what our legislation should 
be doing.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
ask the hon. Reform member this question. Would the addition of 
the proposed term to the legislation, namely, the prevention of 
discrimination on  the basis of sexual orientation, not cover all 
Canadians, regardless of their sexual orientation?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would certainly hope so. If it 
does, why do we need to put it in? If we are all equally covered, 
then we are all equally covered. We do not need to list some 
defining characteristic of the people who are covered. If we are all 
covered, why are we defining who is covered and who is not?
<P>
	What the hon. member just said is that he agrees with the logic of 
my argument and I appreciate that very much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect, I believe the hon. 
member from the Reform Party has completely missed the point, 
but that ought not to surprise any of us.
<P>
	I will make it clear for her. At present an individual who is a 
heterosexual could be discriminated against and could be fired for 
that reason. This legislation will prevent that from happening. Is 
that not a good thing?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member is suggesting that I 
am mentally challenged, then perhaps he ought not to discriminate 
against me by asking vague questions and then be unhappy because 
I do not answer properly or to his satisfaction.
<P>
	Again, the point that I am making is that any person in our 
country who is discriminated against, who is treated unfairly for 
any reason, whose fundamental, individual human rights are being 
contravened, should be protected. That should not be allowed in 
our society and that person should have a recourse to have that 
discrimination reversed and addressed.
<P>
	For whatever reason the hon. member wishes to raise it, I would 
agree that if there is discrimination and unfairness taking place, it 
should not be allowed. There is no need to say that these people are 
going to be protected and these people are going to be protected 
and if a person is in this group they will be protected, but then be 
silent about the rest. That abrogates the fundamental democratic 
principle of equality and is not the right way to go about protecting 
human rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a brief comment on what my colleague from 
Calgary had to say.
<P>
	Yesterday in the mail I received a little booklet that describes 
why the government is adding sexual orientation to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. I find it very interesting that it has already put 
this out as a fait accompli. The government has limited debate in 
the House.
<P>
	What is being done here today is a sham. It is not going to 
change the mind of the government. The government has already 
decided what it is going to do. It has printed the information as if it 
is an accomplished fact already that the amendment to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act will be passed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2196"> 2196 </A></B>
<P>
	This is a travesty of democracy and debate. There is absolutely 
no point to what we are doing in the House. It becomes abundantly 
obvious when the government invokes closure on the motion that 
it has already set its course. The Liberals will not listen to the 
Canadian people. They will not listen to the debate in the House. 
That is unconscionable. It is a travesty of democracy and the way 
things should work.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	If the people of Canada were demanding this we would have a 
very different view of this entire thing. However, what we have 
here today is top down, ``we are telling you the way it is''; it is 
being published it in advance, before the bill is even put through 
the House.
<P>
	Liberals refer to their speaking notes all the time. Are those 
speaking notes binding on this legislation? I do not think they are 
any more binding than the promises they made on NAFTA, the 
GST and all of these other things. They do not mean a thing and 
they will not be binding on this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I accept the comments of my hon. 
colleague and thank him.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The five hours for debate were up one 
minute ago, so we shall now move on to the period when each 
member is given 10 minutes on debate.
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House 
that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
are as follows: the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake-the goods and services tax.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am dividing my time with the 
member for Ottawa West.
<P>
	I rise with pleasure and pride to speak to Bill C-33, an act to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to add sexual orientation as 
a prohibited grounds of discrimination. I congratulate the Minister 
of Justice and the Prime Minister for bringing this amendment 
forward at this time, because there has never been any doubt about 
the government's commitment to this principle.
<P>
	This amendment is about the principles of justice and equality 
which have always been the bedrock of the Liberal Party's belief. 
They have always been the bedrock of Canadian values that we 
hold dear, values of tolerance, respect and social responsibility.
<P>
	Today more than ever we need to emphasize and set strategies to 
promote equality. Today more than ever we need to name in 
legislation what we mean by equality and how we intend to 
implement that equality.
<P>
	Today we see attempts by some groups to erode fundamental 
Canadian values, groups like the Reform Party which speaks of 
equality and yet its members espouse discrimination. They speak 
about representing the grassroots of Canadians yet seek to divide 
Canadians into different classes of citizens, those who would be 
relegated to the back of the bus or the back of the shop, those who 
would eat in different establishments eventually or go to different 
schools. I thought that ended with apartheid.
<P>
	The third party, which will undoubtedly vote against this bill, as 
it has been saying, will have proven yet again that apologies or not, 
its record is clear. It has voted against every equality seeking piece 
of legislation the government has put forward.
<P>
	Let me speak about the ugliness of discrimination. I know 
because I am a member of a visible minority. I was a family 
physician who listened daily to the pain, the anguish, the shame 
and the loss of self-esteem that each patient of mine who was a 
target of discrimination told me about, whether it was because of 
their religion, colour or sexual orientation. These people lived with 
that loss of self-esteem, with their mental health, with their ability 
to walk proudly down the street, damaged and harmed with the pain 
of discrimination.
<P>
	Discrimination kills the soul. The idea of optional discrimination 
is the antithesis to the fundamental values we hold dear. It is the 
antithesis to the whole idea of equality. In a fantasy world, which 
one day I hope to live in, where we are all equal under the law, 
where it has been established that we no longer need to seek 
equality, then the hon. member across may have something to say.
<P>
	It is interesting to look at what history has taught us. It is 
interesting to see how at every point in history and at every stage 
where the fight for equality and freedom has been fought 
arguments have always been made by majority groups against the 
equality and the freedoms of the groups seeking equality.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	Arguments have been made giving quasi-logical and legal 
reasons for denying those freedoms. There were arguments for 
slavery based on the fact that blacks were mentally inferior. All the 
excuses were made on the mass genocide of Jews. People were told 
there were economic arguments for ensuring the Jews were put 
down.
<P>
	The equality of women was denied consistently for centuries 
based on the fact they were merely chattel and lacked the 
intellectual ability to take an equal place in society.
<P>
	I would not be standing here today in the House of Commons if 
these kinds of legislation were not put into place to ensure I had the 
same fundamental and basic equality as the other people sitting in 
the House of Commons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2197"> 2197 </A></B>
<P>
	I have listened to the arguments made by the third party to deny 
this amendment. The arguments go on about groups and that 
equality means we should all be treated equally. Equality can be 
achieved only by removing barriers.
<P>
	I am disabled and I cannot achieve equality if I cannot get into 
the building to participate without a wheelchair ramp. That is a 
special measure taken to ensure the equality of disabled people.
<P>
	Today we know, and it has been well documented, that gays and 
lesbians in this country are denied the right to employment based 
on sexual orientation.
<P>
	As a physician I have seen on a Friday or Saturday night gays 
and lesbians who were beaten purely because of their sexual 
orientation, taken bloodied into an emergency room.
<P>
	The fundamental amendment we are discussing seeks to give 
equality of access to employment and housing. I know what it is 
like to be denied housing. When I was a medical student in England 
I sought an apartment. Because I came from a Commonwealth 
country I sounded quite British on the telephone. When I went to 
the door, about one minute later because I telephoned from around 
the corner, the woman took one look at me and said: ``I am sorry, 
it's gone''.
<P>
	People have to know what it is like to feel that way, to suddenly 
feel inferior, subhuman, dirty and disgusting. That is what we mean 
when we talk about the reality of the lives of people who are 
discriminated against.
<P>
	I do not hear the third party talking about equality in terms of 
``then let us not let gays and lesbians pay taxes. Why should they be 
equal and pay taxes?'' We know this group belongs to one of the 
highest income groups in the country and pays an extraordinary 
amount of taxes.
<P>
	We talk about equality and I do not think members of the third 
party understand the reality of people's lives because they come 
from a privileged majority. We sit here and listen to them 
espousing very warm, fuzzy and logical arguments, sot to speak, 
based on airy-fairy ideas. They do not understand. They seek to 
represent true Canadians and I do not think they even understand 
the reality of the lives of ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	The statements repeatedly made in the House by the members of 
the third party tell me they represent only a particular group in the 
country. They do not know what it is like to be a person of colour. If 
they did they would never talk about some of the things they do. 
They do not know what it feels like to be disabled. If they did, they 
would talk about special measures to be taken to ensure that 
disabled people are able to take their places in the workforce. They 
would support the kinds of changes which would give people the 
ability to seek equality opportunity from a level playing field. That 
is what the amendment is about.
<P>
	The amendment speaks to the fact that 71 per cent of Canadians 
have supported the bill in poll after poll and survey after survey. 
Canadians are fundamentally and basically people who espouse 
freedom, justice, equality and who talk about respect, not just 
tolerance. Tolerance means to put up with people. Respect means 
we know that person belongs and that they have something to 
share, something which will enrich the lives of Canadians. This 
country is based on respect. We are the role model to the world.
<P>
	The third party talks about discrimination. Name any country 
that within the last part of this century has understood 
discrimination better than South Africa? Yet as soon as it got rid of 
apartheid and formed its first democratic government, one of the 
first things it did was put into its constitution lists of all those 
people who had been held back and who have a long way to go to 
achieve equality. In that list the South African Parliament put 
sexual orientation.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	There was not a debate. The reason there was not a debate was 
that people who have been downtrodden, people who have been 
seeking equality understand the reality and do not seek to keep 
anyone from that basic fundamental freedom we talk about when 
we speak of equality in this country.
<P>
	Equality and justice are based on the fact that the greatest of us 
in society will always seek to lend a hand to raise the smallest and 
the least of us. This is what we are talking about. This is what this 
party stands for. This is what this government stands for. This is 
what the third party opposite does not even begin to understand.
<P>
	I am proud to stand here and I am proud to support this bill. 
Every Canadian looking on today, the 71 per cent of Canadians who 
continue to believe in the things that hold us together, the common 
values that hold us together as Canadians, will be applauding in 
their homes today when they see us speaking to this bill because 
they believe in it.
<P>
	It is no coincidence that we have been seen as a role model to the 
world. It is no coincidence that when Boutros Boutros-Ghali met 
the Prime Minister at the 50th anniversary of the United Nations he 
said: ``Your country is the greatest country in the world because 
you have learned how as a diverse people to live together, 
respecting differences, sharing equally, seeking constantly to bring 
equality to the world. It is you who will lead us into the 21st 
century''. This piece of legislation is beginning to do exactly that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The 20 minutes speeches ended at 45 
minutes past the hour. We are now into 10 minute speeches rotation 
across the floor. The hon. secretary of state spoke for 10 minutes. 
Now it is the turn of the other side of the floor and then it will come 
back to the deputy whip for the Liberal Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2198"> 2198 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-33 to amend the Canadian Human 
Rights Act.
<P>
	This legislation will add the undefined term sexual orientation to 
the list of categories which offer special protection under the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. This contravenes the concept of 
equality, the idea that all people are equal and should be treated as 
equals under the law.
<P>
	This bill sets aside one more category under the Canadian 
Human Rights Act to include people who will get special treatment 
under the law. This is a break away from equality. I believe the 
intentions of the government is presenting this legislation are good 
and are honourable, but the results of this legislation, should it 
pass, and we know it will because closure has been invoked and the 
government whip will make sure it passes, will be one more 
category enshrined in the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	The argument used by some members opposite of how could 
anyone oppose adding protection based on sexual orientation under 
the Canadian Human Rights Act is not a valid argument. What 
should happen is that all categories set aside for special treatment 
should be eliminated. We should, pure and simple, view Canadians 
as equal, and under the law we should treat all people in this 
country as equal.
<P>
	I cannot support a bill which breaks away from this important 
basic principle of equality.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to read the very first principle written in the Reform 
blue book. It is the most important principle that guides Reform 
policy.
<P>
	It says: ``We affirm commitment to Canada as a balanced 
federation of equal provinces and citizens''. The most important 
principle of Reform is the principle of equality. I will support no 
legislation that goes against this principle. It is a basic principle 
that I think Canadians support without reservation. For that reason, 
I will vote against this bill.
<P>
	I would like to comment on what my constituents say about this 
legislation. I did a survey about a year ago in anticipation of this 
legislation coming forward. The survey went out to all eligible 
voters in the constituency through a householder. I would like to 
read some results of this survey.
<P>
	I will read the question so members know what was asked. It was 
a fair, unbiased question: Should sexual orientation, undefined, be 
included as a protected category under the Canadian Human Rights 
Act? That is quite a simple, straight forward question.
<P>
	What response did I get from my constituents? The message was 
very clear. There is no doubt how my constituents feel on this issue. 
Eighty-nine per cent of  respondents said they are against having 
sexual orientation, undefined, included as a protected category 
under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Only 6 per cent were in 
favour. The rest were undecided or did not respond to that question. 
Those results are pretty clear. They certainly guide my vote.
<P>
	When going to constituents to determine their view on an issue, 
it is important to do the background work. This issue has been well 
debated in my constituency. The media have played their role on 
this issue. They reported what has gone on at public meetings. They 
reported what different people are saying on this issue. They have 
my point of view on it. They have the point of view of many others 
from the constituency who have an interest in this issue. The debate 
has taken place at public meetings. There has been media 
involvement. This has taken place over some time.
<P>
	Finally, the formal mechanism, a key part of the process, which 
is a householder survey that went out to all constituents, indicated 
that 89 per cent are against having sexual orientation, undefined, 
included as a protected category under the Canadian Human Rights 
Act.
<P>
	I also asked in the householder some other questions about 
related issues. These related issues, although the government 
argues otherwise, are pertinent. When this change passes-we 
know it will-it will lead to more changes down the road.
<P>
	Many members in this House and people outside who support 
this legislation say that this is only a first step. I firmly believe that.
<P>
	The other related questions that I asked in this survey were these. 
I will read them and give the results: Do you agree with the 
definition of the family as those individuals related by the ties of 
blood, marriage or adoption and that marriage is the union between 
a man and a woman as recognized by the state? The response to this 
question: 96.5 or 97 per cent were in favour, only 2 per cent were 
against and about 1 per cent were undecided.
<P>
	I asked two other two related questions. One question was: 
Should spousal benefits for any program funded or administered by 
the federal government be extended to same sex couples? In 
response 94 per cent said no, only 4 per cent said yes and about 1 
per cent were undecided. Those results are quite clear.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I believe that not only do the results reflect the position and the 
beliefs of the people in my constituency but they reflect a much 
larger view. I have heard this certainly in Ontario, Atlantic Canada 
and across the prairies as I have gone around the country over the 
past couple of years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2199"> 2199 </A></B>
<P>
	The fourth question that I put to the people in my constituency 
was: Should a new category called households be established for 
the purposes of identifying dependent relationships that are not 
currently included in the definition of a family? In response 88 
per cent said no, 7 per cent yes-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
paraphrase a famous orator: ``Never in history has so much been 
said by so many about only two words''.
<P>
	I want to begin by reading from the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
This act enshrines the fundamental principle of Canadian society:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Respect for the dignity and equality of all human beings and their right to live 
and to work free from discrimination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A great deal has been said to suggest that in fact this act treats 
Canadians unequally. Let me therefore read from the act:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For matters coming under the legislative authority of Parliament-every 
individual shall have an equal opportunity-to make for himself or herself the 
life that he or she is able and wishes to have, consistent with his or her duties and 
obligations as a member of society, without being hindered in or prevented from 
doing so by discriminatory practices.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Every individual. Equal opportunity.
<P>
	It then lists the characteristics on which discrimination most 
commonly occurs: race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, 
age, sex, a conviction which has been pardoned. The amendment 
before Parliament today adds two words to that list, nothing more. 
The words are sexual orientation.
<P>
	As far as I know every single Canadian has a sexual orientation. 
You are bisexual, you are heterosexual or you are homosexual. 
Everybody is covered by this act.
<P>
	Inclusion of race in the Canadian Human Rights Act does not say 
that black people are protected but white people are not. Inclusion 
of religion does not say that I am protected as a Roman Catholic, 
but a Muslim, a Buddhist, a Protestant is not. We are all protected 
from discrimination based on our religious beliefs, whatever they 
may be.
<P>
	Not one person who has written or spoken to me on this issue has 
said that it should be acceptable to discriminate against someone, 
to deny them employment or services just because they are gay or 
lesbian. Nobody says it is all right to discriminate and that is what 
this act is about. It is saying it is not all right, it is not acceptable, it 
is not legal in Canada to discriminate.
<P>
	People have raised with me issues that they are afraid may be 
implicit in this act so let me deal with these concerns. They are 
concerned about pedophilia. The preamble specifies the right to be 
free from discrimination based on respect for the law and lawful  
conduct. Pedophilia is not a sexual orientation, it is a crime. It is 
prohibited by the Criminal Code and it will continue to be 
prohibited by the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act applies only to lawful conduct. 
Churches and schools are worried it will interfere with their right to 
preach religious values on matters of sexuality. Churches and 
schools are not under the jurisdiction of the federal government. 
The Canadian Human Rights Act applies only to those matters 
under the purview and the legislative authority of Parliament.
<P>
	Even when this issue was dealt with by the Supreme Court of 
Canada under an Ontario human rights act which does include 
sexual orientation and has for a decade, the Supreme Court of 
Canada said that Catholic schools were completely free to ensure 
that those people they hired had religious beliefs which were 
consistent with the purpose of the school.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	People are concerned that this amendment may affect the 
definition of marriage. Again I want to go back to the preamble of 
the bill, which says very clearly that the government recognizes 
and affirms the importance of family as the foundation of Canadian 
society and that nothing in the act alters its fundamental role in 
society. In any case, marriage is primarily a provincial matter. If 
having sexual orientation in the human rights act automatically 
implied recognition of same sex partnerships, the Ontario 
government would not have had to go through introducing a piece 
of legislation 10 years after it included sexual orientation in its 
human rights act. It would not have had to introduce legislation to 
establish same sex relationships on a legal basis.
<P>
	Again I want to go back to the courts because people are also 
concerned about the extension of employment benefits to same sex 
partners. It was very clear in the case of Egan and Nesbitt <I>v.</I> The 
Queen. The unanimous decision of the court was that sexual 
orientation is a prohibited ground of discrimination under section 
15 of the charter of rights and freedoms. Not the Canadian Human 
Rights Act, but the Canadian charter, which is constitutional law. 
Notwithstanding the court's finding, it did not support the 
extension of same sex benefits in that case.
<P>
	The claim that this bill establishes special rights is simply not 
accurate. This covers all Canadians. It protects us all from 
discrimination, from whatever source.
<P>
	We are bringing our Canadian Human Rights Act into 
conformity with the human rights acts of eight of the provinces and 
territories in Canada. We are bringing to 10 per cent of Canadians 
who work in federal jurisdiction the same rights which are enjoyed 
by the majority of the workforce employed in eight of our 
provinces and territories. Is it not about time we had equality of 
rights across the country?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2200"> 2200 </A></B>
<P>
	There are complaints. People can argue that there is no 
discrimination, but there are many complaints from gays and 
lesbians. The vast majority are about something as basic as the 
ability to get and keep a job.
<P>
	Discrimination hurts us all. Discrimination hurts our society. It 
leads to isolation from society, to alienation, to being forced into 
hiding who we are for fear of discovery, for fear of losing our jobs, 
our apartments, the right to go where we want to go, to do what we 
want and to buy what we want. It means being ostracised. That is 
not good for the individual and it is not good for society.
<P>
	Legislation will not end discrimination. Our Criminal Code does 
not end murder, robbery, beatings or rape. However, it gives a legal 
recourse to people who are victims of those actions which we have 
determined are unacceptable in our society.
<P>
	This subject is often argued on religious grounds. As a Christian 
I have very strong religious principles that also guide my personal 
behaviour. The strongest of the commandments that I obey is the 
one that says: ``Love one another as I have loved you''. A similar 
principle is in other religions and I respect them all; however, to me 
it is a simple matter of human dignity, of fairness, of respecting 
every other person on this earth and treating them fairly.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ)</B> moved that Bill 
C-217, an act to amend the Criminal Code (protection of 
witnesses), be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today to introduce 
Bill C-217 in this House. The purpose of this bill is to protect any 
person testifying in criminal proceedings in which the accused is 
charged with a sexual offence or a violent crime.
<P>
	Under this bill, the accused could no longer personally 
cross-examine witnesses. In such cases, witnesses would be 
examined or cross-examined by the court.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to thank the members on both sides of 
this House who have already told me they would support my 
initiative. I wish to thank them all. I hope that my presentation will 
convince other members and that a majority in this House will feel 
that my bill is well founded.
<P>
	Bill C-217 is a solution to the problem of accused people 
defending themselves. In fact, the accused can choose their own 
defence strategy, including defending themselves. They can then 
cross-examine their victims and confront them face to face. I have 
two examples of legal proceedings supporting my arguments.
<P>
	My first example is the trial of former Concordia University 
professor Valery Fabrikant. That circus lasted five months, ending 
in August 1993. Fabrikant assumed his own defence after firing his 
lawyers. He was finally found guilty of murdering his four 
colleagues, and he is currently serving a life sentence in the 
Donnacona penitentiary, close to Quebec City.
<P>
	The second case is that of Ferreira, whose trial took place in 
Montreal, last fall. This person was accused of forcible 
confinement and sexual aggression. As in the above-mentioned 
case, Agostino Ferreira assumed his own defence. He even 
personally cross-examined his two victims. I deplore the fact that 
these aberrations in our legal system were not more strongly 
condemned outside Quebec. I presume that a certain regionalism 
prevails when it comes to news items of this sort.
<P>
	For example, reaction to horrible murders committed in British 
Columbia is not as strong in New Brunswick. To fully understand 
the purpose and the objectives of my bill, it is imperative to see the 
facts in these two legal cases that led me to propose this solution.
<P>
	Here are these facts. On August 24, 1992, around 3 p.m., Valery 
Fabrikant, a teacher and researcher at the mechanical engineering 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2203"> 2203 </A></B>
<P>
department, entered Sir Henry F.  Hall, in Montreal's Concordia 
University. He was carrying three fully loaded revolvers, as well as 
boxes full of ammunition. He went to his office on the ninth floor 
with his union president, professor Michael Hogben, 52, and shot 
him point-blank.
<P>
	He then killed in the same manner professors Ziogas, 48, Saber, 
46, and Matthew Douglas, 66. He also shot secretary Elizabeth 
Horwood several times, 66, without managing to kill her. He then 
locked himself up in an office with the security guard, Daniel 
Martin, and Georges Abdou, who managed to disarm him when he 
was momentarily distracted. That is the first horror story.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	On January 4, 1995, Agostino Ferreira entered a clothing store 
on Saint-Denis in Montreal. It was 10.30 a.m. and the store was 
empty. He indicated to the two young female employees that he 
needed their help to write a suicide note, but they did not take him 
seriously. In the face of this reaction, Ferreira showed them a bomb 
attached to his belt. He said it was powerful enough to blow up the 
whole neighbourhood.
<P>
	He was also armed with a pistol. He calmly told the girls to get 
into a taxi. They were afraid that he would set off the bomb, and did 
what they were told. The three went to Ferreira's apartment. In a 
gloomy room, lit by candles, he had one of them write a suicide 
note in which he confessed to a double murder five years earlier.
<P>
	He then bound the girls with tape. He gagged them, blindfolded 
them and tied their hands and feet. He cut the clothes off one of 
them with a knife. He then raped both girls. They managed to 
escape when he left the apartment to get some cocaine. So much for 
the facts.
<P>
	The Fabrikant and Ferreira cases caused quite a stir in the 
metropolitan Montreal area. Apart from the cruelty and the 
perversity of these individuals' actions, these two sordid affairs 
have one fundamental point in common. These two individuals 
presented their own defence, without legal representation, and took 
advantage of their rights to personally cross-examine the victims of 
their crimes.
<P>
	In the case of Valery Fabrikant, the trial lasted five months. 
Fabrikant, who refused to plead insanity, as his lawyers had 
suggested he do, wanted to show that he had been persecuted by 
Concordia University. He wanted to mount a defence mid-way 
between that of provocation and the battered woman syndrome. In 
all, the accused rejected 10 lawyers.
<P>
	His defence, obviously, was not admissible in law. Provocation 
supposes that the accused has been subjected to an insult or an 
unfair action such that a reasonable person in the same situation 
would have been unable to maintain control and, in the heat of the 
moment, would also have killed his victim. This is a defence 
which, if accepted by the court, would not have led to an acquittal, 
but to lessened criminal responsibility. The individual  could have 
been found guilty of involuntary homicide rather than murder.
<P>
	I dare not even touch the battered wife syndrome argument for 
fear of losing my cool. There can be no more twisted and abject 
individual that one seeking to justify his foul crime by identifying 
himself with a woman who has been the victim of spousal violence. 
These are nothing more than the dreadful machinations of a 
paranoid and narcissistic mind.
<P>
	The right to a full defence is a fundamental one in our society, 
and probably the grounds on which Mr. Justice Fraser Martin 
allowed Fabrikant to parade 77 witnesses, mostly from Concordia 
University, despite the inadmissibility of the defence of 
provocation.
<P>
	During the entire trial, Valery Fabrikant presented himself as the 
victim of persecution, of a plot by the Concordia University 
community. He even summoned Elizabeth Horwood, the secretary 
who survived the massacre. Our system allows such things.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	But I would ask this: Is our system better served when someone 
who has been accused of attempted murder can cross-examine his 
victim and attempt to discredit him or her? No. When there is a 
legal counsel, he or she serves as a middleman to cross-examine 
the victim without confrontation with the attacker.
<P>
	I will give you an example of the type of question Fabrikant was 
allowed to ask Mrs. Horwood, whom he had shot at: ``Where did I 
hit you? What did I look like at the time? Can you describe what I 
did?'' Mrs. Horwood acquitted herself very well under the 
circumstances, but might she not have been spared a second attack 
by the perpetrator?
<P>
	Take a moment to imagine the state of mind of Mrs. Horwood, 
when she again saw her attacker coming toward her to question her 
on the events that have left a permanent scar on her life? After five 
months of trial, the jury deliberated seven hours before finding the 
ex-professor guilty of the charges against him.
<P>
	During the trial, Fabrikant did not hesitate to insult Judge 
Martin, which earned him six citations for contempt of court. The 
Supreme Court of Canada finally sealed this murderer's fate on 
June 2, 1994, by refusing him leave to appeal. That put an end to 
the circus trial.
<P>
	The story of Agostino Ferreira is scarcely any better, in fact in 
some ways it is more loathsome. I shall not go into the facts of the 
case, except to point out that Ferreira was charged with forceable 
confinement, kidnapping and assault. At the trial, the victims were 
cross-examined by Ferreira himself, who did not have a lawyer.
<P>
	He started out by apologizing to the first of the two victims for 
asking her questions. He asked her if the suspect-the suspect 
being himself-had acted not out of  spite but out of love. Ferreira 
also asked questions related to his statement that someone or some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2204"> 2204 </A></B>
<P>
force may have been with him in the room when he committed 
these rapes. This cross-examination lasted an hour and and a half.
<P>
	The next day, Ferreira cross-examined the second rape victim for 
an hour and ten minutes. Referring to a crucifix, he asked her is her 
legs were spread apart in the shape of a cross at the time of the rape. 
He also asked her: ``Were you flogged? Did you have to wear a 
crown of thorns?'' This, to me, is an abomination.
<P>
	I readily admit that such incidents are fortunately not 
representative of most cases before the courts. Nonetheless, we as 
legislators have a duty to review Canada's criminal law so that it 
recognizes the rights of the victims.
<P>
	If this House cannot give them an active role in legal 
proceedings, the least it can do is protect them adequately. This is 
the logic behind Bill C-217.
<P>
	This bill would amend the Criminal Code so that the protection 
already provided to victims of sexual or violent offences who are 
younger than 14 is extended to all victims.
<P>
	That is why I am asking the members of this House to support 
my bill.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would also like to 
offer my comments on Private Member's Bill C-217.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In our opinion the bill itself would extend to all witnesses certain 
provisions of the Criminal Code which protect witnesses under the 
age of 14 years in prosecutions for sexual offences and offences 
involving violence. The proposed bill would extend these 
protections to all witnesses.
<P>
	I believe that all members would agree with the member's goal 
of removing any traumatic element and facilitating witness 
participation in the criminal justice system. However, because the 
amendment would affect fundamental principles of the criminal 
justice system, such as open justice and the right to conduct one's 
defence, I think it needs to be examined seriously before we agree 
to include it in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The protection granted to witnesses in the criminal justice 
system has been improved significantly in recent years. The 
Criminal Code already includes a number of provisions to 
safeguard adult victims of sexual offences. At the discretion of a 
judge, he or she may exclude members of the public, place 
publication bans on the identity of complainants and witnesses, 
make evidentiary provisions such as restrictions on questioning 
about previous sexual activity and even hold in camera hearings for 
the determination of admissibility of certain evidence.
<P>
	All of these safeguards would apply even where the accused is 
not represented by counsel. These protections have been granted to 
ensure that victims and witnesses can provide their testimony 
without being intimidated. We must examine Bill C-217 in light of 
the protections that already exist.
<P>
	Bill C-217 would extend to adults protections that are currently 
provided to children. What protection would be extended to all 
witnesses under Bill C-217? Basically there are two protections. 
The first would allow the judge to exclude the public from the 
courtroom when he or she believes the interest of the witness 
requires this. The second would permit a judge to prevent an 
accused from personally cross-examining a witness.
<P>
	Bill C-217 would build upon the recent Criminal Code 
provisions enacted on August 1, 1993. The issue is whether these 
protections which are justified by the particular vulnerability of 
young persons would also be justified if extended to adults.
<P>
	Let us examine the first protection. The prohibition for an 
accused to cross-examine a child witness comes from concerns that 
a cross-examination conducted by the accused would nullify the 
protection granted by allowing the child to testify behind a screen. 
In the case of a child, it is therefore justified by this concern and the 
need to avoid that child from coming face to face with the 
aggressor. This is particularly important because we know that 
child abuse occurs in part because of the dominant position of the 
adult in relation to the child.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2205"> 2205 </A></B>
<P>
	Cross-examination by an accused of a child victim would 
continue that abuse. This is the reason the Criminal Code provides 
that an accused shall not personally cross-examine a witness under 
14 years, unless the judge is of the opinion that the proper 
administration of justice requires that the accused do so.
<P>
	What happens when a judge does not allow an accused to 
personally cross-examine a child? The judge in that case can 
appoint counsel to conduct the cross-examination of the child. This 
provision applies in all sexual offences and in all offences in which 
violence against the person has been used, alleged or threatened. 
This provision, coupled with the provision for the use of screens or 
closed circuit television, ensures that child victims will not have to 
face their abusers. This may assist them in providing their 
evidence.
<P>
	Bill C-217 would extend that protection to all victims and 
witnesses of sexual offences and crimes of violence. In all cases of 
sexual or violent offence the judge could appoint counsel for an 
unrepresented accused to conduct the cross-examination not only 
of the victim, but also of any witness.
<P>
	I readily agree with the hon. member that this protection would 
be beneficial. I would question however whether this protection is 
necessary and I would like to examine its implications. There 
would be implications on costs when counsel is appointed by the 
court to conduct cross-examination for an unrepresented accused.
<P>
	The Criminal Code already provides for the appointment of 
counsel for unrepresented accused persons in specific 
circumstances. For example, the court can appoint counsel to act 
for an accused considered unfit to stand trial.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada can appoint counsel when it 
appears that the accused, whose case is brought before the Supreme 
Court, is financially unable to retain counsel and it is in the interest 
of justice to have the accused represented by counsel.
<P>
	Who pays for these lawyers? As members know, under the 
Constitution the administration of justice is a provincial 
responsibility. Where a judge appoints a counsel to act on behalf of 
an unrepresented accused, it will in most cases be the responsibility 
of the provincial attorney general to pay for that appointment.
<P>
	Bill C-217 would significantly increase the number of cases 
where the courts would appoint counsel, if the courts were 
permitted to appoint counsel, for an unrepresented accused in 
sexual offences, sexual assaults and crimes of violence against the 
person regardless of whether the witness is a child or an adult.
<P>
	This would create the potential for imposing major costs on the 
provinces, which have already expressed their concerns about the 
cost implications where counsel  is appointed in the rather 
exceptional circumstances covered under present Criminal Code 
provisions. Cost implications would significantly increase if the 
amendments provided for in Bill C-217 were to in effect become 
law.
<P>
	Because of this, I would think it is absolutely essential that all 
provinces be consulted about the proposed bill before it is passed. I 
doubt if the hon. member has had the time to perform these 
consultations.
<P>
	I now want to examine another protection that would be 
extended in Bill C-217, the exclusion of the public from the 
courtroom. It is a general principle of our criminal justice system 
that all proceedings take place in open court. The presiding judge 
does, however, currently have discretion, provided by section 
486(1) of the code, to exclude all or any of the members of the 
public where the judge is of the opinion that it is in the interest of 
public morals, the maintenance of order or the proper 
administration of justice to do so.
<P>
	In addition, section 486(1.1) of the code currently directs the 
judge, when considering the term ``proper administration of 
justice'', to include in that consideration ensuring that the interests 
of witnesses under 14 are safeguarded in proceedings arising from 
a sexual offence, a sexual assault offence or an offence involving 
violence against the person.
<P>
	The proposed bill before us would expand the direction given to 
the judge in interpreting the proper administration of justice. In 
interpreting the proper administration of justice the judge would 
have to consider that the interests of all witnesses, not just those 
under 14, are safeguarded in sexual offences, sexual assault 
offences and crimes involving violence.
<P>
	Can we believe that a judge who is asked to decide on whether 
the public should be excluded from court does not already consider 
whether a particular witness would be able to provide the necessary 
and relevant evidence in a public courtroom? I believe the 
discretion to exclude members of the public is carefully exercised 
by all judges. I do not believe it is necessary to require the judge to 
consider the interests of all witnesses in determining whether to 
exclude members of the public.
<P>
	While I am in agreement with the hon. member's intentions in 
introducing the bill, I cannot support it for two basic reasons. First, 
some implications of the bill involve provincial jurisdictions, and 
we should not impose on them without proper consultations. 
Second, I believe the actual modifications proposed are not 
necessary at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I commend the drafter of this bill, my colleague from the Bloc, for 
her compassion and concern for the comfort and rights of victims 
of monsters such as in the case she talked about in her presentation. 
I am a little surprised she did not see fit to support our motion that a  
victims' bill of rights be drafted and passed by the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2206"> 2206 </A></B>
<P>
because I see in her presentation today that she is very concerned 
about victims' rights.
<P>
	However, in this draft bill we have to balance two competing 
interests. The first is the desire to put as little stress and unfairness 
as we are able on victims of terrible crimes in order for them not to 
have to relive their horror. We also have to look at the principles of 
jurisprudence that will be affected by the changes being suggested 
by my hon. colleague.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	There are two principles of jurisprudence which will be affected 
by this bill. One is the right to face one's accuser, which has long 
been a cornerstone of common law. Second, justice will be done in 
the open. Justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done, 
to quote a very long established principle of our justice system.
<P>
	This proposal would amend two subsections of section 486 of 
the Criminal Code of Canada to allow in certain circumstances, 
particularly those of sexual assault and violent assault, that even in 
the case of an adult victim, the victim or the witness could give 
evidence in a closed courtroom and also that the accused could be 
prevented from personally facing their accuser.
<P>
	As has been pointed out in the previous intervention by a 
government member, there is already in the Criminal Code the 
flexibility, the discretion of a court to protect witnesses in certain 
ways. These discretions are sufficient to prevent the excesses the 
member moving the motion is talking about.
<P>
	For example, in the murder trial of Fabrikant which was alluded 
to, the judge ended the testimony of one witness after Fabrikant, 
acting as his own lawyer, became, in the judge's words, insulting, 
sarcastic and brutal. The judge did have and did exercise discretion 
to prevent further abuse of and unwarranted interference with the 
witness.
<P>
	We do not condone trials behind closed doors. When it is 
absolutely necessary, we do allow judges in the interests of public 
morals, the maintenance of order and the administration of justice, 
to curtail somewhat the right of the public to access to a public 
trial. We saw that in the Bernardo trials and in others.
<P>
	Because an open court is fundamental to the pursuit of justice in 
Canada and it is guaranteed under the charter of rights and 
freedoms, we should be very careful about further interference with 
that right. Section 11(d) of the charter states: ``Any person charged 
with an offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proven 
guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an 
independent and impartial tribunal''.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that when the current age restriction of 14 
was introduced in Bill C-126, the matter was referred to the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. The criminal 
lawyers association testifying before that committee questioned 
why the legislation decided 14 was the proper age at which the 
interests of the witness could be better protected than by provisions 
already in the code. Previously there had been a very full debate 
into the whole question of at what age and in what circumstances 
special protections for witnesses should be written into our 
legislation.
<P>
	In a society which values the principle of open court and where 
the principle of open court is deemed essential to our legal system 
so that Canadians can have faith in it, we as legislators should be 
extremely cautious about changes which will affect those 
fundamental rights.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	I concur with the mover of the bill that it is terrible and 
repugnant that victims who have already gone through a 
tremendously traumatic and terrible experience be unfairly asked 
to relive this and should be further abused in the trial. Our courts 
should do everything possible, and there are discretions available 
to the courts, to prevent that.
<P>
	Legislating for the most extreme scenario, for cases furthest out 
on the swing of the pendulum, is not the proper way to structure our 
justice system. We have to deal with those kinds of extreme cases 
by other measures, not changing fundamentally our entire justice 
system because there has been a very extreme and unusual abuse of 
it.
<P>
	The second amendment to the Criminal Code being sought by 
this private member's bill deals with a person's right to 
cross-examine a witness. Currently the code provides for a witness 
under the age of 14 not to have to face direct cross-examination. 
Instead the court may appoint counsel to conduct the 
cross-examination. Bill C-217 would remove the age restriction of 
a witness whom a defendant could personally cross-examine.
<P>
	This part of the Criminal Code also deals with people who act as 
their own defence lawyers. As the mover of this bill quite properly 
pointed out, there are some occasions when an accused acting as 
their own defence lawyer very much abuses the system. That 
should call for the proper intervention of the court.
<P>
	Again, denying or limiting that person a right to defend herself 
or himself does interfere with the fundamental element of our 
system of jurisprudence and we should be very cautious about 
expanding further the erosion of that principle.
<P>
	While giving protection to a witness to avoid unpleasant court 
room tactics by a defendant is something we all recognize is a 
desirable aim, there is the competing interest of upholding the 
established principles of our justice system. The issue has been 
studied by a number of organizations in the past, including the law 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2207"> 2207 </A></B>
<P>
commission. As I said, there has been  legislation dealt with by the 
justice committee of the House of Commons.
<P>
	It appears the protections and the discretion available to the 
court are already present to prevent the excesses this bill is trying 
to address. An expansion to the extent contemplated in this bill 
would not be warranted. We should be very cautious about 
expanding these every time an extreme case comes along.
<P>
	I recommend to the House that we applaud and recognize the 
intent behind the bill and the humanity which motivates it but 
reject the logic and the necessity for the measures being proposed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Bill C-217 seeks to extend certain protections in the Criminal Code 
currently provided to young witnesses under the age of 14 in 
prosecutions for sexual offences and offences involving violence. 
The bill would extend these protections to all witnesses.
<P>
	I applaud the member's intentions in proposing these 
amendments to the Criminal Code. The criminal justice depends on 
victims and witnesses to report crimes and co-operate to the fullest 
extent possible, including participating as witnesses at preliminary 
inquiries and trials. The criminal justice should therefore facilitate 
a witness's participation. Participating as a witness should not turn 
out to be more traumatic than the crime itself.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	Over the past 10 years many improvements have been made to 
ensure that victims and witnesses can provide their testimony 
without fear of intimidation. While Bill C-217 would build on 
these improvements, we would be cautious in supporting the 
amendments without a very careful examination of their 
implications and without consideration of the background of the 
current provisions.
<P>
	I am well aware of a recent sexual assault trial in Montreal where 
the accused represented himself and subjected the victims to hours 
of cross-examination. This case has naturally outraged victim 
advocates and the public. If those victims had been under 14 years 
the Criminal Code would have permitted the judge to appoint a 
lawyer to act for the accused and conduct the cross-examination. 
The victims would not have had to be personally questioned by 
their attacker.
<P>
	The member's proposed bill would respond to that case by 
extending these procedures to all witnesses. My concern is that the 
amendments may be too broad and too far reaching and may not in 
the current form be necessary.
<P>
	The Criminal Code already includes several protections to 
ensure that young victims and witnesses are able to provide 
necessary testimony. In addition there are several provisions to 
facilitate the participation of  sexual assault victims whether young 
or adult. While these recent reforms to the law are designed to 
assist victims and witnesses, we cannot ignore the fact that people 
have an obligation and a duty to report crime and provide relevant 
information and evidence. In some cases it will not be a pleasant 
experience.
<P>
	In the case of young victims and witnesses there is a requirement 
in the Canada Evidence Act that the judge must conduct an inquiry 
to determine if a witness under the age of 14 is able to 
communicate the evidence and understands the nature of an oath or 
affirmation. Even where a young witness cannot be sworn they may 
still be able to provide evidence wherever young witnesses are 
deserving of special protection.
<P>
	The provisions of the Criminal Code which the proposed bill 
would amend, that is sections 486(1.1) and 486(2.3), were only 
proclaimed into force August 1, 1993. The amendments were 
included in Bill C-126 which proposed a wide range of proposals 
which in part responded to the recommendations made by the 
parliamentary committee that reviewed the child sexual abuse 
provisions of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Bill C-126 resulted in additional reforms to the child sexual 
abuse provisions of the Criminal Code, including abrogating any 
requirement that the court warn a jury about convicting an accused 
on the evidence of a child; providing for special prohibitions and 
probation orders for persons convicted of certain offences against 
children, for example, prohibiting offenders from seeking 
employment or volunteer work involving children.
<P>
	It also included providing for peace bonds where it is feared a 
person will commit a sexual offence against a child; permitting a 
support person to accompany a child while testifying; providing 
that the judge consider the need to safeguard the interests of the 
witnesses under the age of 14 when determining whether the 
exclusion of the public from the courtroom would be in the 
interests of the proper administration of justice; permitting a judge 
to prohibit an accused from personally cross-examining a child.
<P>
	These amendments were designed to enhance the reforms made 
in 1988 by Bill C-15 to effectively deal with child sexual abuse. 
One of those original amendments provided that child sexual abuse 
offences and sexual assault offences, the complainant could testify 
from behind a screen or by closed circuit television if the judge is 
of the opinion that the exclusion is necessary to obtain a full and 
candid account of the acts complained of from the complainant.
<P>
	In other words, if the face to face contact with the alleged abuser 
would make it difficult to obtain the necessary evidence, the judge 
could order the use of a screen or closed circuit television.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2208"> 2208 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	However, the protection provided for young complainants by 
this section was illusory where the accused chose to represent 
himself. The accused, acting as his own lawyer, could come face to 
face with his young victim. The amendments passed in 1993 were 
designed to address this problem and were accordingly focused on 
young witnesses.
<P>
	We know that child abuse occurs in part because of the 
inequalities between children and adults in size, knowledge and 
power. Cross-examination by an accused of a child victim 
continued the abuse. Therefore, the Criminal Code was amended to 
provide that an accused shall not personally cross-examine a 
witness under 14, unless the judge is of the opinion that the proper 
administration of justice requires the accused to do so. The judge 
can appoint counsel for the unrepresented accused to conduct the 
cross-examination of the child.
<P>
	This provision applies in sexual offences or in an offence in 
which violence against the person has been used, alleged or 
threatened. This provision, coupled with the provision for the use 
of screens or closed circuit television ensures that child victims 
will not have to face their abuser which may assist them in 
providing their evidence.
<P>
	The private member's bill before us would open that protection 
to all victims and witnesses of sexual offences and crimes of 
violence. The judge could appoint counsel for unrepresented 
accused to conduct the cross-examination of a victim or witness.
<P>
	I have no doubt this protection would be beneficial and 
desirable, but is this protection necessary for all adult witnesses or 
only certain more vulnerable witnesses? We must carefully 
examine the implications of such proposals.
<P>
	As I indicated, these provisions were designed to address the 
problems of child sexual abuse to ensure that young victims of 
abuse could provide the necessary evidence. However, adults are 
presumed to be able to provide necessary and relevant evidence.
<P>
	The Criminal Code already includes a number of provisions to 
safeguard adult victims of sexual offences, including the discretion 
of a judge to exclude members of the public, to order publication 
bans on the identity of complainants and witnesses, to make 
evidentiary provisions such as restrictions on questioning about 
previous sexual activity and in camera hearings for the 
determination of admissibility of certain evidence. All those 
safeguards would apply even where the accused is not represented 
by counsel.
<P>
	We must also consider the cost implications. Who will pay for 
the lawyers appointed to act for unrepresented accused? As 
members know, under our Constitution, the administration of 
justice in the provinces is a provincial responsibility. Where a 
judge appoints a counsel to act  for an unrepresented accused, it 
would in most cases be the responsibility of the provincial 
attorneys general to pay for that appointment.
<P>
	If we permit the court to appoint counsel for unrepresented 
accused in sexual offences, sexual assaults or crimes of violence 
against the person, we are creating the potential for imposing major 
costs on the provinces. It is therefore absolutely essential and 
necessary that all provinces be consulted about the proposed 
amendment.
<P>
	The Criminal Code already includes similar provisions to 
appoint counsel for unrepresented accused persons in specific 
circumstances. For example, where an accused is thought to be 
unfit to stand trial, the court can appoint counsel to act for the 
accused. For appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, that court 
can appoint counsel where it is in the interests of justice and where 
it appears the accused is financially unable to retain counsel.
<P>
	These are exceptional cases that arise rather infrequently. 
Nevertheless, the provinces have expressed their concerns about 
the potential cost implications where counsel is appointed in these 
circumstances. Perhaps we should consider permitting a judge to 
appoint counsel to conduct the cross-examination on behalf of an 
unrepresented accused where the victim makes an application and 
where in the judge's view, the interests of justice demand. 
However, even this more limited measure should be discussed with 
the provincial attorneys general.
<P>
	It is a general principle of our criminal justice system that all 
proceedings take place in open court. The presiding judge does, 
however, have the discretion provided by the act to exclude all or 
any members of the public.
<P>
	There are many protections in place at this time. We 
acknowledge the positive intent of the bill but we believe that 
consultations should be conducted with the provinces and all 
aspects of the bill reviewed.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to give my unconditional support to Bill C-217, 
tabled by the hon. member for Saint-Hubert, whom I want to 
congratulate. This bill will amend the Criminal Code to provide 
increased protection to witnesses who were victims of sexual 
assault, or against whom violence was attempted or threatened.
<P>
	These witnesses would therefore avoid being cross-examined by 
the accused, as is currently the case for persons under 14 years of 
age. This would eliminate a sometimes absurd situation which has 
gone on for too long.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2209"> 2209 </A></B>
<P>
	Recently, an increasing number of people charged with assault 
have decided to undertake their own defence. Every time an 
accused decides to do without the services of a lawyer, his victims 
run the risk of being once again confronted with their aggressor, 
this time in public.
<P>
	Moreover, the legal system is also affected by austerity 
measures. Among others things, eligibility criteria for legal aid are 
becoming more stringent. This means that an increasing number of 
people are not eligible for legal aid, since their income is deemed 
too high. Still, these people do not have enough money to afford a 
lawyer.
<P>
	Undertaking one's own defence then becomes an alternative that 
many will choose, thus increasing the risk of a court confrontation 
between the aggressor and the victim. It is important to think about 
the plight of a victim having to testify in court before the person 
who assaulted her.
<P>
	Our adversarial system is based primarily on the confrontation 
of two parties: the state on one side, represented by the crown 
attorney, and the accused on the other side, usually represented by a 
lawyer. The victim of a criminal act is not considered to be a third 
party in the case. However, he or she remains a key witness who 
can often provide invaluable evidence. Therefore, it is important to 
ensure his or her protection and to see that his or her testimony is 
made in the best possible conditions.
<P>
	This is precisely what Bill C-217 seeks to ensure. It is not a 
magic formula that will turn the victim's testimony into a fun thing, 
but it is a simple way of making sure that he or she does not have to 
go through the absurd ordeal of facing the aggressor again and be 
forced to answer his questions.
<P>
	A few years ago, the federal government amended section 486 of 
the Criminal Code in a fashion similar to the one proposed by the 
hon. member for Saint-Hubert in her bill, except that it legislated to 
prohibit the accused who has undertaken his own defence from 
cross-examining victims under the age of 14. This goes to show 
that the federal government is aware of the fact that, in some cases, 
to ensure the protection of the witness who is also a victim, the 
court may have to impose on the accused that the 
cross-examination at least be conducted by counsel.
<P>
	Age is not the only factor that makes a victim vulnerable. In rape 
or verbal, physical and psychological abuse cases, the victim often 
ends up in a cruelly and painfully fragile emotional and 
psychological state. Having to take the stand is already hard 
enough, and answering questions from their aggressors represents 
quite an ordeal for victims who often are still in a state of shock.
<P>
	Beyond the legal aspect, there is also a whole human aspect, 
which cannot be ignored. Our system certainly recognizes the 
rights of the accused. The accused has  every right to conduct his 
case without counsel. But many experts maintain that it is suicide 
to go it alone, the rules and proceedings being far too complex to be 
readily assimilated by lay persons and used in a trial.
<P>
	However, for various reasons, some individuals accused of 
violent and sexual crimes choose to conduct their own defence. The 
risk remains then that the accused could misuse this right to once 
again confront and traumatize his victim by asking abusive 
questions, making the victim relive every instant of this painful 
experience.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	Recently, two cases have clearly illustrated the absurd nature of 
the situation that prevails at this time. We need only to think of the 
notorious Agostino Ferreira, who was allowed to cross-examine, 
for several hours, the two employees from a boutique on rue 
Saint-Denis in Montreal, whom he had assaulted and raped.
<P>
	We can barely imagine the state of mind of these two victims, 
when brought face to face with the same person who had 
humiliated them in the worst possible way. Imagine what was 
going through their minds when the person responsible for their 
rape was asking them questions about the details of this horrible 
event.
<P>
	Let us remember the Concordia killings as well. The person 
responsible, Valery Fabrikant, dismissed his lawyers and 
cross-examined the witnesses himself, which was truly a verbal 
torture for them.
<P>
	In most cases where the accused himself cross-examines the 
victim, the victim, after having been humiliated by the accused, is 
forced to relive the whole event, this time in public.
<P>
	There is a way of sparing the victims this additional torture, 
without infringing on the rights guaranteed to the accused by law. 
Restricting the rights of the accused to defend himself in assault 
cases of a violent or sexual nature, as proposed in the bill of my 
colleague for Saint-Hubert, would afford the victims additional 
protection during the trial process.
<P>
	In conclusion, the system can be as efficient as possible, but one 
fact remains: the key element in the legal process in cases of 
assault and sexual abuse is the victim's reporting of the attack and 
charging the attacker or attackers. If, for one reason or another, the 
victims do not testify as to what they experienced, any legal 
system, even the best in the world, will prove totally ineffective.
<P>
	But, as long as assault victims continue to courageously bring 
their abusers to justice, and as long as the law makers and legal 
precedent recognizes their rights, the basic and vital objectives of 
criminal law-protecting society and setting an example-still 
have a chance to be met.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2210"> 2210 </A></B>
<P>
	These are the reasons why Bill C-217 represents a giant step 
toward a more efficient and effective legal system, through a 
greater understanding and protection of those who are still the key 
element in the system, the victims.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GOODSANDSERVICESTAX">GOODS AND SERVICES TAX</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, last week, just after the Minister of Finance 
announced the federal government was harmonizing the GST with 
the provincial sales tax of three Atlantic provinces, but before the 
Deputy Prime Minister resigned because the Liberals had broken 
their election promise on this issue, I had the opportunity to 
question the Minister of Finance about the harmonization scheme.
<P>
	The government knows this is the most hated tax in the history of 
the country, and Canadians remember well that in the 1993 
campaign the Liberals campaigned strongly against it. We all 
remember well the candidates on our doorsteps, the literature in our 
mailboxes and the words of the high profile members of the Liberal 
Party stating that if elected, the Liberals would get rid of the GST.
<P>
	When he announced the harmonization package last week, the 
Minister of Finance apologized to Canadians. He said the Liberals 
were wrong to promise they would get rid of the GST. With the 
Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister we now have 
two senior government ministers acknowledging the Liberal's 
mistake. Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that the replacement 
harmonization program is also a mistake.
<P>
	Harmonization is clearly a shift in the wrong direction. It shifts 
an even greater share of the tax burden from the corporations to the 
consumers.
<P>
	New Democrats think it is time to acknowledge that what the 
country needs instead of harmonization is meaningful tax reform. 
In reality it is the consumers who need the tax break, not the 
corporations.
<P>
	When I posed my question to the minister I pointed out he had 
already boasted that the GST harmonization would be good for 
business. At the same time I pointed out the provinces were saying 
harmonization would end up costing them money because at the 
present time the corporations pay provincial tax but under the new 
harmonization scheme they would not. In Saskatchewan that shift 
is pegged at around $400 million in losses to the province.
<P>
	It has already been readily acknowledged outside the Chamber 
that harmonization is a fabulous giveaway to the large 
multinational profitable corporations doing business in Canada. 
For this giveaway the corporations have had to do absolutely 
nothing.
<P>
	Did the corporations have to agree to lower prices? No, they did 
not. Did the corporations have to agree to create any new jobs or 
even maintain the ones that exist today? No, they did not. Did the 
corporations even have to promise to keep their profits in Canada 
for investment in jobs or investment in our communities? No, they 
did not. The corporations get this huge windfall for absolutely 
nothing.
<P>
	When we look back at what the Mulroney Tories did when they 
first introduced the GST, we see they provided a great deal of 
documentation to substantiate their claim. Much of that 
documentation was subject to debate. Nevertheless the 
documentation was made public.
<P>
	Today we have the Liberals introducing the harmonized tax but 
nowhere is documentation provided to substantiate the new claim. 
The Liberals say the economy will boom, jobs will be created and 
prices will be lowered. However, they have introduced or produced 
absolutely no evidence, no studies to back this up.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance seems to want Canadians to trust him, to 
take him on his word on this one. Surely the minister understands 
that when he said he would get rid of the GST Canadians did trust 
him. When he said he was wrong, when he said he made a mistake, 
Canadians lost their trust in him. He must now rebuild and regain 
that trust, which will be very difficult.

	Surely he has reviewed the issue of harmonization and the tax 
shift from corporations to consumers very carefully. Surely he has 
done his homework and has the evidence to support the claims 
he is making to the Canadian public.
<P>
	Surely in the interests of public trust he can produce this material 
and at the same time outline for all Canadians to see how much of 
the current tax burden is being transferred from the corporate 
sector to the ordinary taxpaying consumer. That is what I asked in 
my question of last week.
<P>
	Canadians are tired of being treated like uneducated, unthinking 
children. Let us admit that harmonization is wrong. Stop the 
process and begin to address the real issue of tax fairness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will avoid the temptation to do 
anything other than answer the question that I thought was asked 
and use the time to respond to that question as is intended to be the 
case at this hour in the House. Let me begin by reminding the 
House what the Minister of Finance said in his statement on sales 
tax harmonization on April 23.
<P>
	Anyone who believes that business in this country does not pass 
on provincial sales taxes to the consumer is simply naive. 
Consumers are already paying for the imposition of retail sales tax 
on business inputs in the form of higher prices. Because of reduced 
competitiveness for Canadian products in both domestic and 
international markets as a result of those higher prices, consumers 
are also paying in the form of fewer jobs and lower wages. There 
will therefore be no shift in tax burden from business to consumers 
under harmonization. Canadian consumers are already bearing 
these costs in one way or another.
<P>
	In fact, consumers will benefit from harmonization. Competitive 
market conditions will ensure that businesses pass on the tax 
savings under a harmonized valued added tax to consumers. This 
will result in a decline in price on most goods and services they 
buy. In combination with the lower sales tax rate in harmonized 
provinces, these price declines will result in lower after tax 
consumer prices on many purchases and substantial overall sales 
tax savings to families and individuals.
<P>
	Removing sales tax from business inputs will also enhance the 
competitiveness of Canadian goods and services when competing 
with foreign suppliers in international markets and at home which 
will benefit individual Canadians through higher and more stable 
employment and income levels.
<P>
	Moreover, harmonization will lead to an additional benefit to 
business and consumers, reduced complexity and tax compliance 
costs. For business, harmonization will mean one sales tax not two, 
one tax base not two, one  tax rate not two, and one sales tax 
administration not two.
<P>
	These savings will be substantial. As much as $700 million in 
annual sales tax compliance costs will disappear under 
harmonization on a national basis according to the Canadian 
Institute of Chartered Accountants. Like the tax savings which 
businesses will receive under harmonization, these savings will 
also lead to lower consumer prices and increased economic 
competitiveness in harmonizing provinces.
<P>
	The only real consumer costs associated with this issue are those 
imposed on Canadians in non-harmonizing provinces by 
governments which continue to cling to inefficient and 
uncompetitive retail sales tax systems.
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The motion to 
adjourn the House is deemed to have been adopted. The House 
stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow.
