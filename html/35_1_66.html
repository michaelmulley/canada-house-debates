	The House resumed from May 6 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-22, an act respecting certain agreements concerning 
the redevelopment and operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester 
B. Pearson International Airport, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today is the sixth day of debate on this bill. More than 
40 speeches on this subject have been made by members of the 
Official Opposition. No doubt our colleagues opposite think we 
have talked long enough but as we are expressing ourselves with 
elegance, I am sure they are delighted.
<P>
	My career as a teacher has taught me one thing: even the 
clearest message is never understood by everyone, and we think 
that if we repeat this message often enough, the Canadian people 
will require this government to enforce, in the name of 
transparency, a law on political party financing.
<P>
	The decision made by this House must reflect the concerns of 
Canadians and Quebecers regarding the transparency of 
political power. Supporting Bill C-22 is a vote for 
non-transparency. The Prime Minister, who calls himself a 
champion of transparency, would never forgive us.
<P>
	Much has happened in Canada since October 25, 1993, 
including the arrival of a group of members for whom the 
transparency of political power is an illusion without strict 
legislative regulations regarding political party financing in 
particular. The shock of our mass arrival in Parliament 
traumatized Canada but, like some pills that are hard to swallow, 
I think this shock can only be beneficial.
<P>
	The current debate on Bill C-22 conducted with competence 
and determination by the Official Opposition is instructive as its 
purpose is to demonstrate clearly that the lax federal regulations 
in effect  concerning political party financing goes against our 
society's fundamental interests.
<P>
	The traditional Oppositions of the 34 previous Parliaments 
were justifiably reluctant to point the finger at the friends of the 
government in office since the stronger the accusations the more 
likely they were to turn against them. The Official Opposition of 
the 35th Parliament, of whom I am a member, has demonstrated 
that the lack of legislation on democratic party financing can 
only create a vicious circle with a simple, obvious logic.
<P>
	This logic is as follows: no one has the right to bite the hand 
that feeds him, the government least of all. The contributions 
made by large corporations to the election funds of the 
traditional federal parties, far from being an open secret, are 
considered as essential as bread and butter by this government. 
But there is so much butter that it threatens the most efficient 
liver. Otherwise, how can we explain Clause 10 of this bill, 
whose purpose is to compensate Limited Partnership if the 
Minister considers it appropriate to do so.
<P>
	Who in this House can justify a responsible government 
giving itself the right to offer reasonable financial compensation 
when, according to Robert Nixon, this whole contract was 
nothing less than unreasonable. I urge you, Mr. Speaker, to 
decide for yourself as Mr. Nixon says this in his report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My review has left me with but one conclusion. To leave in place an 
inadequate contract, arrived at with such a flawed process and under the shadow 
of possible political manipulation, is unacceptable. I recommend to you that the 
contract be cancelled.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Which the Prime Minister of Canada has done. The 
investigator he chose was the former Ontario Treasurer in the 
David Peterson government and leading figure of the Liberal 
Party of Ontario. His analysis could only be fair.
<P>
	Let me ask the question again: Is it reasonable to provide 
reasonable compensation following the reasonable cancellation 
of an unreasonable contract? Any sensible citizen would tell you 
without hesitation: no. Why then would this government be 
tempted to say yes?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4026"> 4026 </A></B>
<P>
	I will venture two answers. First, you do not bite the hand that 
feeds you, when that hand is called Charles Bronfman, Léo 
Kolber, Herb Metcalfe, Ramsay Withers-I have five fingers. 
Second, you do not bite the hand that feeds others. What others? 
Let me give you the list, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Don Matthews, who presided over Brian Mulroney's 
nomination campaign in 1983 and former president of the 
Conservative Party; Bill Neville, Conservative lobbyist, former 
chief of staff of Joe Clark and leader of Prime Minister Kim 
Campbell transition team; Hugh Riopelle, another lobbyist with 
easy access to Don Mazankowsky's Cabinet, strong-man of the 
Mulroney Cabinet; Fred Doucet, yet another Conservative 
lobbyist and former chief of staff of Brian Mulroney.
<P>
	We have come full circle. The Pearson Airport affair is a 
dubious affair. Through its leader, the Official Opposition 
indicated it refused to proceed with the second reading of Bill 
C-22, the very principle of which is flawed because the bill 
contains no provision to ensure the transparency of the 
lobbyists' work. This government has been harping about 
transparency for too long. We urge it to finally take actions that 
are in line with its commitments. The Leader of the Official 
Opposition said: ``The Bloc will oppose Bill C-22 first and 
foremost because a royal commission of inquiry must be 
appointed to clarify this dark episode in which the ethical 
behaviour of the government and some related players was not 
up to par''.
<P>
	Since October 25, this government has made a number of 
decisions in keeping with its election promises. In Quebec, the 
helicopter contract was cancelled. But what compensation was 
provided for the jobs lost, all those high-tech jobs so essential to 
Quebec? Are there prospects of industrial reconversion? No sign 
of a program so far. It is true that Quebec workers are not the 
biggest contributors to the Liberal Party of Canada fund.
<P>
	In Toronto, the airport contract is cancelled. In that case, we 
know who will be compensated. The people of Canada know, 
and so do the people of Quebec. There will be no jobs lost and 
the friends of the Pearson Development Corporation will be 
recompensed, I mean compensated!
<P>
	On the one hand, signed contracts are being cancelled, while 
on the other hand, incredibly enough, verbal ones are being kept. 
I am referring, of course, to the Ginn Publishing affair. We 
demand that the government be consistent with itself. If it is 
seeking transparency, then it must put before this House a bill on 
the democratic financing of political parties. Quebec is a North 
American leader in that regard. I would therefore urge the 
government to follow Quebec's lead. There is no shame in 
trailing behind Quebec in that area, for this is one of many areas 
where Quebec, perhaps owing to its inherent difference, sees 
and does things differently.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that whenever Quebec will 
decide to stop towing the Canadian trailer, my country will 
gladly continue to co-operate with its neighbour for the sake of 
contributing to build a fairer and more equitable world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, virtually everyone 
applauded the government when it cancelled the Pearson deal 
last December. With Bill C-22, the Liberals have watered down 
their position, so to speak. They would like to hand the minister 
a blank cheque with which to compensate the contracting 
parties, mainly, one would assume, their Liberal friends.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of Transport has said that the government will 
try to be reasonable and equitable with the would-be developers 
while negotiating their out of pocket expenses. I submit that in 
the interests of being reasonable and equitable with the 
taxpayers of Canada, not one red cent should be paid out. A 
group of businessmen, all of legal age and presumably of sound 
mind, played a risky game of political chicken and they lost. 
That should be the end of the matter.
<P>
	Let us not forget that prior to the execution of the agreement 
with the T1 T2 Limited Partnership on October 7, 1993 the then 
Leader of the Opposition who is now the Prime Minister clearly 
warned the parties proceeding to conclude the privatization 
transaction they would do so at their own risk and that a new 
government would not hesitate to pass legislation to block the 
deal.
<P>
	Going ahead under those circumstances was a dumb business 
decision. We should have no sympathy and the minister should 
keep a firm grip on our pocketbook.
<P>
	I find it fascinating that while the government stands ready to 
pay who knows how many millions of dollars to pacify its 
friends, the Ministry of Transport is declining to honour 
commitments made by the previous government to upgrade 
small airports.
<P>
	Last year the Hon. John Corbeil approved an expenditure of 
$230,000 to resurface a runway and improve lighting at the 
Assiniboia, Saskatchewan airport under the local commercial 
airport's financial assistance program.
<P>
	The final agreement had not been executed when the 
government was defeated. On November 17, 1993 officials of 
Transport Canada attended a meeting in Assiniboia and 
presented the town council with an agreement for signature. The 
agreement was signed and returned to Ottawa for execution and 
there the matter rests. In February a functionary in the minister's 
office informed the mayor by telephone that the agreement was 
on hold and the minister's office is not returning calls on this 
matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	We in the Reform Party are not asking for a costly and time 
consuming royal commission to deliver a report long after the 
cause for inquiry has been forgotten.
<P>
	What we do ask is that the Standing Committee on Transport 
be allowed to exercise its power to subpoena witnesses from the 
government and private sector. The Liberals promised both open 
government and greater power for committees. Let us have a few 
weeks of hearings, find out why the government is determined 
under section 10(1) of its bill to hand out compensation. Let us 
turn over a few rocks and see if there is anything underneath 
them.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on Bill C-22 which provides for the 
cancellation of a contract. The Bloc Quebecois is, I believe, 
putting the lobbying process on trial. Several of my colleagues 
raised this matter during their presentations. The government 
side is beginning to label us as wafflers or quibblers, but what 
we are doing in fact is seizing the opportunity to discuss 
thoroughly a matter which the government only seemed to want 
to deal with superficially.
<P>
	I think the government was in for quite a surprise because 
even though ultimately we would like a royal commission of 
inquiry to be appointed, this serious debate has allowed us to 
discuss some very important issues in the House, issues which 
the government may have preferred to keep under wraps. I want 
to take the opportunity today to recall the argument I presented 
last week and take it a little further. Among other things, I drew 
an analogy between the different airports as far as airport 
authorities are concerned and I would like to touch on this 
matter a little further today.
<P>
	Basically, there have been three types of airport management 
since 1987. The then minister, Mr. Mazankowski, introduced 
deregulation and opened the door to the possibility of 
communities taking over the management of their local airport. 
Mr. Mazankowski indicated at the time that the administration 
of 200 airports in Canada could be retroceded to various 
communities. Thus, interested communities could take over in a 
reasonable way the administration of their airport.
<P>
	Of course, prior to 1987, Transport Canada was responsible 
for all airport administration, with all of the inconveniences this 
entailed. I recall that when I began sitting on the Montreal 
Airports Advisory Board, a position which I held for five years, 
preparations were being made to negotiate with Transport 
Canada. The history of airport management in Montreal was 
already being reviewed, along with the cumbersome nature of 
Transport Canada's administration and its way of handling all 
changes. We had to contend with a great deal of bureaucracy and 
it took months to make any headway at all on specific issues.
<P>
	Naturally, the Montreal region opted for a local airport 
authority to administer its airport facilities. At that time, we had 
already gone beyond the great dream of making Montreal the 
hub for air traffic, which the Liberals had promised when 
Mirabel was built. The promise then was that Montreal would 
become the hub for America and Canada.
<P>
	Unfortunately, with the changes in technology, airplanes 
perform much better now than they did then, so they no longer 
have to land in Montreal. We saw that planes went directly to 
Toronto and the private sector in Toronto realized that pretty 
well too. That is why Ottawa has always favoured Toronto, 
Transport Canada favoured Toronto, and we soon lost our 
position as a hub. We saw that for all major activity slots in 
Toronto, if we tried to land in Toronto from Montreal-I am 
talking to you about Michel Leblanc with Inter-Inter, which 
had broken away from InterCanadian, was offered landing slots 
that made the survival of a well-managed company impossible. 
The expected happened: Inter went bankrupt.
<P>
	We see that when power was left with Transport Canada, it 
was abused and Toronto benefited compared to Montreal. So 
when the policy took effect in 1987 and we had the chance to 
manage our own airports for the future, the greater Montreal 
area seized this opportunity. They formed a board of directors 
with an executive that was very representative of the region. The 
north shore, the south shore and the island of Montreal took 
charge and decided that they would negotiate the transfer of this 
airport with the federal government. Remember that the 
question of having two airports also arose then. The government 
was pondering whether to close Mirabel or Dorval. Here again is 
another case where we had very little say in the matter when 
power was centralized in Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	In other words, overnight, the federal government could have 
decided to close Mirabel because it was no longer used enough 
and to concentrate all the traffic in Dorval, or vice versa. That 
was extremely dangerous for us.
<P>
	One of the first things that the Montreal airports authority did 
was to thoroughly examine this issue of having two airports in 
the Montreal region. An international panel helped us to see the 
very great potential of two airports; it is like having one airport 
with two terminals. The international panel told us that it was 
wonderful and that we should take advantage of it. Of course, 
since the Montreal airports authority now holds the cards, it has 
developed an action plan and a business plan to promote the 
airports. Finally, we also have our say on landing rights and we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4028"> 4028 </A></B>
<P>
can act much more vigorously and effectively to attract potential 
clients from all over the world.
<P>
	While negotiating that transfer, we realized some things. Of 
course, Ottawa wanted to negotiate a long-term lease and we 
wanted to look at the purchase options because for companies 
that come to the industrial park surrounding the airport, it is not 
easy, never knowing whether in 20, 30 or 40 years the airports 
will still be there or not, because the government might take 
them back.
<P>
	So we raised some interesting issues in the negotiation. From 
a financial point of view, $30 million in annual revenue is 
generated and is to be reinvested in the community through 
infrastructure projects. However, we had to negotiate hard to 
convince the federal government to give us a $12 million share 
out of those $30 million. The government told us: We are willing 
to give that money back to you. However, according to our 
financial projection, we had $30 million in revenue in the past, 
but only $18 million was reinvested in Montreal.
<P>
	It was very important to us that the revenue generated in 
Montreal would stay in Montreal. We clearly demonstrated that 
by investing $150 million, that is $30 million annually over a 
period of five years, in airport infrastructure projects in 
Montreal, something which would not have happened before.
<P>
	Of course, the fact that Toronto was favoured made the private 
sector smell the opportunity. Indeed, the private sector saw an 
opportunity there and we know what happened during the 
election campaign. The previous government said: We will give 
this to the private sector; we have many friends involved. This, 
of course, brings the whole issue of political party financing. In 
the end, I think that the Conservative Party bowed to the 
pressure of friends eager to take advantage of a good 
opportunity.
<P>
	What happened then is that the new government realized that 
it also had many friends involved in the dealings. This situation 
led to this infamous Bill C-22, which is now before us and which 
seeks to allow the government to compensate its friends, who 
also happened to be friends of the previous government. It does 
not matter which camp lobbyists belong to! I have nothing 
against them; they look after their own best interests. However, I 
think that when you spend taxpayers' money, you have to do it in 
an appropriate manner.
<P>
	This is why I wanted to take this opportunity to tell once again 
to this House that local airport authorities are the best protection 
against this problem with lobbyists.
<P>
	Of course, if a royal commission of inquiry was set up, the 
private sector might think twice in the future before asking a 
minister to table bills such a this one to compensate friends of 
the regime with taxpayers' money.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will gladly oppose Bill C-22, but I also think 
that our amendment asking for the setting up of a royal 
commission of inquiry should be implemented. I urge hon. 
members to support that amendment. And while we are at it, this 
commission could also look at the  possibility of letting the 
Greater Toronto Area manage the airport through a local airport 
authority. This would provide maximum protection against 
lobbies, while also ensuring that taxpayers money is well 
managed in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
killing the Pearson airport deal was a very good thing indeed. 
The Prime Minister and his government should take some credit 
for having done that.
<P>
	The enabling legislation, Bill C-22, contains compensation 
provisions for the developers. Why is that? As reported in the 
Ottawa <I>Sun</I> on October 6, 1993 during the election campaign, 
the then Leader of the Opposition, the present Prime Minister 
said: ``I challenge the Prime Minister to stop that deal right now. 
People have a right to know what is in the deal''. The Prime 
Minister was entirely correct in saying that.
<P>
	To go further on the side of the government, to quote the 
Minister of Transport, speaking in the House on April 26, he 
said: ``Our government after careful examination of the 
agreements has determined that they are not in the public 
interest. Our examination included a report by Mr. Robert Nixon 
who described a flawed process clouded by the possibility of 
political manipulation''.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport went on to say: ``This government 
rejects the previous government's way of doing business on 
behalf of Canadians. A reliance on lobbyists, the backroom 
dealings, the manipulation of bona fide private sector interests 
and the lack of respect for the impartiality of public servants are 
absolutely unacceptable''. I applaud the minister's words.
<P>
	Therefore if we take the government at face value, it decries 
the backroom deals and would have everything brought out into 
the open. However, the fine print of Bill C-22 will allow the 
Minister of Transport to provide for appropriate payments to the 
partnership for its out of pocket expenses. There is the problem.
<P>
	On the one hand the government said: ``Get things out into the 
open'' and on the other it says in effect: ``Trust us, we will 
provide whatever compensation we think fit and there will be no 
need to publicize it''.
<P>
	Only three weeks elapsed between the signing of the contract 
on October 7 and the order to put it on hold. If there is any 
compensation payable for work done in that short period, then 
let it be spelled out in complete detail and let it be made public.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4029"> 4029 </A></B>
<P>
	Why would the government now want to keep all the facts 
from the public? Is it that it discovered that many of its own 
friends were involved in the deal? It was not just Tories in the 
Paxport consortium but apparently Liberal supporters in 
Claridge Properties Limited and in Paxport.
<P>
	That gives us a possible motivation for the government 
wanting to pay compensation but not make it public. The Leader 
of the Opposition spelled it out very clearly in his discourse in 
the Chamber on April 26. I completely agree with his analysis of 
the situation but in the end he recommends that a royal 
commission be established to get at the truth.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	We agree that the facts must be made public. How is that best 
done? A royal commission would cost millions of dollars and 
would drag on for months or even for years if we go by previous 
royal commissions. Why not use the existing apparatus of 
government, specifically the Standing Committee on Transport? 
If the House chooses we could strike a select special committee 
of the House to investigate what has happened and bring forward 
sufficient witnesses to fully expose this Pearson airport deal.
<P>
	Here is an opportunity to give to the citizens of Canada some 
renewed faith in the institution of Parliament. They have lost a 
lot of faith in the political system and perhaps even in this 
House. They ask: ``Why do we have Parliament if you cannot 
debate things fully and bring this out into the open?'' Here is our 
opportunity. Address this to the people of Canada. Show them 
that we can have witnesses here and that we can expose every 
angle of what may be a dirty deal.
<P>
	Whether it is a select special committee or the existing 
Standing Committee on Transport, such action of bringing in 
witnesses and exposing it all could accomplish the following 
four things for the country and for the House.
<P>
	First, it would fully disclose to the public all of the facts of the 
case. Second, it could decide whether or not there are any 
legitimate cases warranting compensation and, if so, bring these 
out into the open. Third, such action could save the money that 
would be spent on a royal commission and that could be a lot of 
money. Finally, it could, perhaps would, restore some public 
faith in their Parliament.
<P>
	In conclusion, I advocate that the House seriously consider 
completing the investigation into the Pearson airport deal 
through the existing Standing Committee on Transport or 
through a select special committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberal government thought that, by introducing 
Bill C-22 as a token of the political openness with which it 
wanted to deal with the controversial Pearson deal in Toronto, 
the opposition would approve of the legislation. Who does the 
government think we  are? The fact is that this piece of 
legislation covers up a straight case of partisanship and the 
complicity between the old federal political parties. To help our 
good friends to a few bucks, everything is possible.
<P>
	I am probably not the first one to mention that this bill adds to 
the doubts and the questions we have and stresses the need to 
have a royal inquiry to get to the bottom of this whole deal once 
and for all.
<P>
	On April 26, 1994, the Minister of Transport, not a Bloc 
member or a Reform member, but a member of the Liberal 
government, stated in this House and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our government after careful examination of the agreements and the report 
by Mr. Robert Nixon-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Again, the government shows how open it is by appointing a 
good old Liberal friend and a former minister to conduct this 
review. That is the person
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-who described a flawed process clouded by the possibility of political 
manipulation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As if that was not enough, Mr. Speaker, the minister added:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A reliance on lobbyists, the backroom dealings, the manipulation of bona 
fide private sector interests and the lack of respect for the impartiality of public 
servants are absolutely unacceptable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	And if we add the millions or rather the hundreds of millions 
of dollars at stake, we have all the ingredients needed for a real 
political scandal.
<P>
	I think we ought to call this Pearson contract the now famous 
Pearson deal. We must have a royal inquiry to shed some light on 
this issue and to bring to heel the lobbyists and politicians who 
do not seem to care about public funds. However, the Liberal 
government, after careful examination of the ins and outs of this 
deal, is now realizing that the old chums of the Liberal Party as 
well as the long-time followers of the Conservative Party were 
all involved in this thing. And now it has a problem.
<P>
	What do the Liberals do? They introduce this piece of 
legislation in this House, hoping that it will pass surreptitiously 
or that the Opposition will be completely hoodwinked. 
However, it is thanks to the vigilance of the Bloc Quebecois that 
were brought to light these dubious actions, which we have been 
discussing for a few days.
<P>
	The voters are sick and tired of the political scheming, which 
allows the rich to fill their pockets while, by osmosis, the 
taxpayers or the middle class are going broke. At the federal 
level, everything is bigger, larger, more complex. Budgets, 
spending, partisanship, scandals, everything is ten times bigger, 
undoubtedly in the name of the Canadian unity.
<P>
	Well, yes, handouts must be made to those who will stand up 
for our beautiful and great country when the time comes. Money 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4030"> 4030 </A></B>
<P>
is the sinews of war. The old parties have known it for a long 
time. That is why they use it while they still can.
<P>
	That is precisely what is trying the patience of Canadians and 
Quebecers. Anger is brewing up. Moreover, in this Pearson issue 
as in every other issue this government dealt with so far, 
Quebecers and Canadians feel they are taken advantage of and 
manipulated. This was an opportunity for the Prime Minister to 
demonstrate to the voters that he is a man of principle and a true 
statesman, as they have a right to expect, and to call for a royal 
inquiry before even bringing in this Bill C-22.
<P>
	But no. It is easy to realize that he is a man of many words who 
needs a lot of persuading to keep them and to act on them. Yet, in 
the last election, when the Liberal Party was virtuously asking 
for the voters' confidence, they had a position on that. In the red 
book, this little Bible they are quoting times and times again in 
this House, it is said on page 95 and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-we will develop a Code of Conduct for Public Officials to guide Cabinet 
ministers, members of Parliament, senators, political staff, and public servants 
in their dealings with lobbyists. We will also take measures to better regulate the 
activities of lobbyists, particularly in the awarding of government contracts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In particular, a Liberal government will appoint an independent Ethics 
Counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in the day-to-day 
application of the Code of Conduct for Public Officials. The Ethics Counsellor 
will be appointed after consultation with the leaders of all parties in the House 
of Commons and will report directly to Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Where is that independent counsellor? When will the 
government consult him or her? Why is the government taking 
so long to act on that measure? Is there any political will to act? 
Where is that desired openness? Nowhere, because today, the 
Liberals are in power and when a political party takes power, it 
very quickly forgets its commitments.
<P>
	Openness is the objective of the inquiry that the Bloc 
Quebecois desires and demands in the Pearson Airport affair. If 
the famous red book that I just quoted were not only election 
rhetoric, a royal commission would already be at work and we in 
the Bloc would applaud such an inquiry. But no, there is no such 
thing.
<P>
	When everybody talks about lobbyists, patronage, political 
jockeying and shady deals and the government remains silent, I 
instantly see the image of a man who cannot move or talk 
because he put himself in a compromising situation.
<P>
	To prevent any new agreement of this kind and to prevent 
further waste of public money, we must go to the root of the 
problem, and that is the financing of political parties.
<P>
	Why does this government refuse to make the system of 
political party financing more democratic as we in the Bloc 
Quebecois have been advocating for months? How can the 
Liberal government dare say that it is making the system more 
open since it depends itself on big corporate donations?
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	How could it explain that the Top One Hundred Club, the 
party's donor and benefactor clubs or even the Laurier Club, 
with a membership fee of $1,000, are essential to ensure that the 
ordinary taxpayer has access to members of Parliament, to the 
party or to the back rooms where the decisions are made?
<P>
	How can a party or the leader of a party tie their hands by 
accepting as much as a quarter of a million dollars from the 
banks?
<P>
	For those who do not know, according to the latest figures 
available, the six largest Canadian banks contributed close to 
half a million dollars to the Liberal Party and the Conservative 
Party in 1992. According to the data I have, the Conservative 
Party received about $240,000 and the Liberal Party $245,000. 
As these contributions show, financial institutions have a great 
sense of equity towards political parties.
<P>
	How much do you think Canada's richest families contributed 
to the old parties for the government to refuse categorically to 
review the tax treatment of family trusts?
<P>
	How much do you think Mr. Charles Bronfman and the 
consortium he represents contributed to the Liberal Party for the 
Liberal government to try and hide millions of dollars in 
compensation in a bill without Parliament ever having the 
opportunity to consider the matter?
<P>
	In Quebec, under René Lévesque's government, we cleaned 
up our act and raised our moral standards in politics. Today, 
thanks to that new image, Quebecers know that democracy is 
alive and well in that province, something of which they can be 
proud.
<P>
	We have to change our political system to make it more 
receptive to the people, a move which would breathe new life 
into it.
<P>
	Well-known complicity between some political parties and 
those who make large contributions to them undermines 
people's trust in our political institutions, which is very 
unhealthy. Things have to change.
<P>
	I will conclude my remarks by saying that it is very important 
for the government to accept and respond to the Bloc's demands 
regarding the appointment of a royal commission of inquiry 
which would shed some light on the Pearson deal. It would be a 
first step towards the transparency that we want.
<P>
	Then, the next step would be for the government to accept the 
motion proposed by the hon. member for Richelieu, a member of 
the Bloc Quebecois, regarding political party financing. The 
government must set in motion, as soon as possible, a process 
for the democratization of political party financing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4031"> 4031 </A></B>
<P>
	That democratization process, which has already taken place 
in Quebec, is undoubtedly the legacy that I would be the most 
happy to leave to Canada when Quebec becomes sovereign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
dealing today with Bill C-22. I have done my homework and 
read lots of material on the subject of the Pearson airport 
privatization, but all that still does not answer all my questions.
<P>
	I must admit that the more I read, the more questions crossed 
my mind.
<P>
	With all those unanswered questions, as a taxpayer, I cannot 
help but roar with indignation when I see the political scheming 
powerful financiers close to the two old Canadian political 
formations may have used to achieve their ends, that is the 
privatization of the airport, a transaction that is so contrary to 
public interest and to the air transport plan.
<P>
	Whether one is a politician or a public administrator, common 
decency requires exemplary integrity and everything to be done 
out in the open and without cheating. In the case we are dealing 
with today, it seems that the interest of a few people has come 
before public interest. The select few with direct access, through 
their army of lobbyists, to the office of the then Prime Minister 
or to the office of the then Leader of the Opposition would have 
got privileged information thanks to that.
<P>
	I am not the kind of politician who sees scandals everywhere. 
I like to analyze, search and reflect. The more I search, the more 
I analyze and the more I reflect, the more I have serious 
questions about this whole matter.
<P>
	In this case, everything seems to have gone wrong from the 
start. If I can draw a quick conclusion from that, one can say that 
lobbyists, some of whom unfortunately are feeding at the 
patronage trough, have done their job well, and that the 
scheming system does not suffer from excessive openness.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Remembering, as a Quebecer, the sad error the Liberals' 
grand idea led to more than 20 years ago at Mirabel, I hope that 
this government's liberalism will not plunge us back into 
expenditures unacceptable for taxpayers. Allow me to relate 
some disturbing facts in the Pearson airport case.
<P>
	What is the ordinary citizen, the taxpayer, to think of 
politicians and public administrators when the federal 
government, by putting a time limit of 90 days on its call for 
tenders, was automatically eliminating any company that had 
not previously been associated with the Pearson airport 
privatization project? No honest proposal leading to a contract 
worth several hundred million dollars and good for 57 years 
could be entertained.
<P>
	In this request for proposals, no prior financial analysis has 
been required by the government. It is obscene that  for such a 
major project, the winning proposal was picked without any 
financial viability check. A couple of months after the company 
was chosen, it seemed to be in financial trouble and merged with 
its only competitor. What a lesson in public administration!
<P>
	Under a clause in the deal, Transport Canada has to refrain 
from all alternative airport development within a 75 km radius 
of Pearson that could take traffic away from Pearson. Who can 
benefit from that clause? Certainly not the taxpayers in the 
Deputy Prime Minister's riding.
<P>
	What of the interests of passengers, since obviously it would 
have been more expensive for airlines to use those terminals? 
The fees would have gone up 350 per cent, that is from $2 to $7 
per passenger. What of public interest, since the firm to whom 
the contract was awarded did not have to modernize the 
terminals for 50 years? Do we know what the needs will be in 50 
years from now? What a ``sweet heart deal''. What of public 
interest, since the government gives control over an airport to a 
private firm that could face financial trouble or go bankrupt, or 
let airport services deteriorate at the expense of passengers and 
regional development? Is it not the policy of the government 
that airports be operated by local groups of elected 
representatives and business people the way it was so 
successfully done in Montreal, Vancouver and Edmonton?
<P>
	Mr. Robert Nixon wrote in his report: ``It is my opinion that 
the process to privatize and redevelop Terminals 1 and 2 at 
Pearson fell short of maximizing the public interest''. That 
conclusion is in every regard similar to the position of the 
official opposition.
<P>
	That whole Pearson deal is not only a matter of figures and 
companies. There are also key men involved I would describe as 
professional schemers, including a former political organizer of 
the present Prime Minister and well-known lobbyist, a Liberal 
lobbyist who was a deputy minister at Transport Canada at the 
time the request for proposals was sent out and who apparently 
has close ties with the right hon. Prime Minister. Not to mention 
this dear Liberal senator who, it appears, was a director of the 
lucky company and hosted key political figures at a 
$1,000-a-plate dinner at his residence, right in the middle of an 
election campaign. Some of these guests maybe had special 
interests in the Pearson Airport deal. Allow me not to refer to the 
many Liberal as well as Conservative lobbyists, who were 
involved in this deal. I have little use for them.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4032"> 4032 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	In his report, Mr. Nixon emphasizes: ``This, together with the 
flawed process I have described, understandably may leave one 
with the suspicion that patronage had a role in the selection of 
Paxport Inc.''.
<P>
	The Pearson Airport affair proves once again the need to 
review the law on the registration of lobbyists in order to stop 
scheming and patronage by certain lobbyists, including those 
who have ties to the party in power.
<P>
	Knowing the Prime Minister, I hope he will order such a 
review as soon as possible. Besides, he has already committed 
himself to this in the Liberal Party's red book.
<P>
	The people of Ontario, Quebec and Canada as a whole have a 
right to know what happened. You and I, all my colleagues and 
all taxpayers entitled to know if they will get their money's 
worth. When he says that ``failure to make public the full 
identity of the participants in this agreement and other salient 
terms of the contract inevitably raises public suspicion,'' Mr. 
Nixon only touches on the problem. We parliamentarians must 
go one step further and let the people know what really 
happened.
<P>
	Given the disturbing facts in this whole affair, we, members 
of the Bloc Quebecois, ask for a public inquiry to get to the 
bottom of the whole situation. Refusing this inquiry, Mr. 
Speaker, will be interpreted as wanting to hide things and 
prevent taxpayers from knowing the plain truth. It is only by 
holding a public inquiry that we will be able to determine if 
compensation should be paid. And it is Parliament's duty to set 
the amount, if any. The public interest must prevail and guide 
our action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I want to 
make sure that I understood well. I think I heard the hon. 
member accuse some members of this House of being in conflict 
of interest on the Pearson Airport issue. If I understood well the 
scope of the hon. member's words, you will realize, Mr. 
Speaker, that one cannot accuse other members of this House of 
committing illegal, and possibly, criminal acts and get away 
with it.
<P>
	So, I would ask the hon. member opposite to explain exactly 
what he just said to us and, if he accused some members of this 
House, he should at least tell their names. Then, Mr. Speaker, 
you will take the action that you see fit regarding the people who 
make such accusations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre: </B>Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleague to 
reread my speech; I attacked the party, not the members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> There is a fine line.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There seems to be a 
conflict of interest here. It depends on the circumstances; if one 
says that the other members committed some, let's say, criminal 
acts, that is one thing, but if one says that this is a conflict of 
interest in general, that is another thing. After hearing the hon. 
member's remarks, I think that this is an issue of debate,  
because I did not hear an hon. member accuse someone else of a 
criminal act.
<P>
	I will look at the blues. If there is another problem, I will be 
able to get back to this. For the time being, I think that the hon. 
member has concluded his remarks. Does he want to continue, 
because he has still-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member: </B>He has finished.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> He has finished. 
Resuming the debate. I will then give the floor to the hon. 
member for Ahuntsic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic):</B> Mr. Speaker, during my 
last intervention in this House on Bill C-22, I had the 
opportunity to deal somewhat with the work done by some 
lobbyists and some friends of the government.
<P>
	I will remind you particularly of the following names: Léo 
Kolber, Herb Metcalfe, Ramsey Withers, Ray Hession, Don 
Matthews, Fred Doucet, without mentioning the names of the 
companies and consortiums on behalf of which they interceded 
in this contract on the Pearson Airport privatization.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	This is only the tip of the iceberg. I will spare you the list of 
the generous direct and indirect financial contributions made by 
all those people and firms to electoral funds of the Conservative 
and Liberal Parties.
<P>
	So, what are we going to do about this tangle of ties woven 
over the years between those firms, their lobbyists and 
governments that follow one another and look strangely similar? 
One really has to bury his or head in the sand to ignore the real 
political weight of all those people crawling around the 
government and within organizations of traditional political 
parties.
<P>
	Lobbyists have learned how to influence governments. You 
will better understand why we demand not only a real act on 
lobbyists but also an act on the financing of political parties. An 
act that would prohibit any financial support from corporations 
and that would limit individual contributions, because by 
contributing judiciously to the electoral funds of the two main 
political parties, corporations are able to negotiate iron-clad 
contracts through their lobbyists. That way, each new 
government does not really have any choice but must honour 
those contracts or offer compensation, as it seems to be the case 
with the bill we are discussing today.
<P>
	Bill C-22, with clause 10, brings into question the so-called 
openness of this government in this matter. What is the 
difference between the Liberal government and the previous 
Conservative government? There is very little difference.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4033"> 4033 </A></B>
<P>
	With regard to lobbyists and Bill C-22, I would like to refer to 
some aspects of Bill C-44, an act respecting registration of 
lobbyists, which was sanctioned on September 13, 1988 and 
which came into effect on September 30, 1989. It was the first 
act of that type ever to come into effect. The act was amended by 
Bill C-76, wich was passed on February 22, 1993, but it never 
came into effect. Rather strange, is it not?
<P>
	Regulations were adopted under power given by Bill C-44, 
but they only deal with procedural issues, undoubtedly 
important but raising few substantive questions.
<P>
	What is the purpose of the act on lobbyists? It is based on 
several fundamental principles, among which are:
<P>
	The public has the right to make its views known and to have 
free access to the government. That is the principle of 
accessibility. Activities with the government should be clear 
and open, and the system should be easy to manage. 	
<P>
	A standing committee has been struck to study, in particular, 
this whole issue of lobbyists and released, in 1993, a ninth report 
on the registration of lobbyists.
<P>
	I would like to discuss a few points of this report, because 
there is an obvious link with Bill C-22, and this link is the lack 
of openness. For example, it is reported that many witnesses 
acknowledged that lobbyists were playing a role in effective 
policy development and improving communications with 
government decision makers. They are said to be an essential 
part of a modern decision making process. Nevertheless, 
lobbying is as old as the hills.
<P>
	However, and according to me, that is the heart of the 
problem. It is reported too that when lobbying is conducted 
without the public knowing anything about it, there is greater 
opportunity for decisions to undermine the public interest.
<P>
	The purpose of the act respecting the registration of lobbyists, 
Bill C-44, was to create a system for paid lobbyists to register 
with a public office holder. Lobbyists were to be divided into 
two categories, tier I, or ``professional'' lobbyists, and tier II, or 
``other'' lobbyists.
<P>
	Each category was to have its own set of reporting rules. 
However, let us simply say that those rules are not the same for 
each category. There are two sets of rules.
<P>
	I do not intend to explain to this House all the elements of this 
complex act. We will have an opportunity to come back to those 
if the government fulfils its commitment to implement the 
report of the standing committee which reviews the Lobbyists 
Registration Act. For now, I will just raise a few problems 
related to this act and establish a link with Bill C-22.
<P>
	As regards registration and subject matter disclosure 
requirements, Bill C-44 provides that tier II lobbyists, the other 
lobbyists, only have to give their name and the name of their 
employer. The standing committee argues  that by doing so, one 
cannot discern all the matters of interest to an organization. It 
recommends that the disclosure requirements for all lobbyists 
be made uniform.
<P>
	Thus, let us try to know why lobbyists got involved in the 
privatization of Pearson airport. That cannot be done without a 
thorough and independent inquiry.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the committee feels that the current method of 
facilitating subject-matter disclosure is clearly unsatisfactory 
and fails to meet the needs of office holders, lobbyists, and, 
most importantly, the Canadian public.
<P>
	Finally, the report on the lobbying industry recommends that 
the Act contain a general anti-avoidance provision to 
encompass abusive or artificial schemes designed to circumvent 
the registration provisions. The committee also recommends 
that a professional association with an industry-wide code of 
ethics be established.
<P>
	Should not this government nominate an independent adviser 
whose mission would be to write a code of ethics for lobbyists? 
What is this government waiting for? Is it waiting for Bill C-22 
to be passed?
<P>
	In his report on the Pearson review deal, Mr. Nixon himself, 
notes that the role of the lobbyists exceeded the permissible 
norms. That's where the shoe pinches. The whole issue of the 
transparency of lobbyists' work and power is again questioned.
<P>
	Like my colleagues from the Bloc, I subscribe to the 
recommendations contained in the standing committee's report 
on the Review of the Lobbyists Registration Act because I feel 
that a number of lobbyists exceed the permissible norms and do 
not abide by the law. Only an independent inquiry commission 
will be able to prove it.
<P>
	Regarding the funding of the political parties, I would like to 
quote some numbers. My colleagues mentioned the generous 
contributions of our friends from the banks. But more generally, 
if one considers the contributions made to the federal political 
parties in 1992, at the corporate level, the Progressive 
Conservative Party received $6.7 million and the Liberal Party 
$3.5 million. At the individual level, the Progressive 
Conservative Party received $4.7 million and the Liberal Party 
$4 million. Which means that 58.9 per cent of the $11.5 million 
contributed to the Progressive Conservative Party and 46.7 per 
cent of the $7.5 million contributed to the Liberal Party came 
from the corporate sector.
<P>
	Surely, one can assume there will be an increase in the 
contributions made by businesses to the Liberal Party, now that 
they are in office.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4034"> 4034 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1993, the Bloc Quebecois, abiding by the Quebec law on 
the financing of political parties, was able to obtain $3.3 million 
from its 113 000 donors, compared to approximately 30 000 
donors to the so-called national parties. That means 113,000 
individual donors whose donations were limited to $5,000 each 
a year.
<P>
	Our hands are free. With such numbers, how can the 
government claim to be completely free in its decision making 
process when it is tied to our country's financial establishment?
<P>
	This Liberal government also received direct and indirect 
financial donations from friends of the party who are more or 
less associated with this contract. That is why we are requesting 
a public commission of inquiry.
<P>
	As Mr. Nixon himself said in his private inquiry report: 
``Failure to make public the full identity of the participants in 
this agreement''-once again the lobbyists bill-``and other 
salient terms of the contract inevitably raises public suspicion. 
Where the Government of Canada proposes to privatize a public 
asset, in my opinion, transparency should be the order of the 
day''.
<P>
	Mr. Nixon goes on: ``My review has left me with but one 
conclusion. To leave in place an inadequate contract, arrived at 
with such a flawed process and under the shadow of possible 
political manipulation, is unacceptable''.
<P>
	Could it be any clearer? In view of such comments, to 
compensate people or companies who tried to take advantage of 
these irregularities would be unacceptable. What about all the 
wonderful promises of transparency in the Liberal Party's red 
bible?
<P>
	That is why we insist that there be a public and independent 
inquiry, so that the government can get to the bottom of those 
sad events.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you can 
well imagine, I too am going to speak on Bill C-22, because 
apparently, our colleagues across the floor have not yet 
understood how essential and urgent it is to have a royal 
commission of inquiry to get right to the bottom of this matter.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	I am going to go over the arguments presented to help them in 
their reflexion. We have to know first if the plan to privatize 
terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson airport in Toronto was in the best 
public interest. If not, who benefited from this project?
<P>
	I remind you, because this was repeated time and again, that at 
the end of the request for proposals process which was rather 
brief, only two bidders had made a proposal for a 57 year 
lease-yes, Mr. Speaker, you heard it right, 57 years-to 
administer the two terminals.
<P>
	In fact, we had a proposal from Paxport and another one from 
Claridge. Then, on December 7, 1992-and I am quoting the 
Nixon report here-``Paxport Inc. was announced as the best 
overall acceptable proposal''. Very  interesting: between two 
bidders, they chose the best. Well, yes and no.
<P>
	No, because on February 1, 1993, Paxport and the other 
company, Claridge, joined forces to form a joint venture 
partnership called T1 T2 Ltd.; T1 was probably for terminal 1 
and T2 for terminal 2. These two distinct bidders whose 
proposals had certainly been prepared separately decided to join 
forces when one of them was awarded the contract. I am sure it 
was pure coincidence.
<P>
	However, on October 7, 1993, the then Prime Minister gave 
explicit instructions that this transaction, that is the signature of 
the agreement with the new company, be concluded the same 
day, even though the current Prime Minister, who was then the 
Leader of the Opposition, had indicated clearly during the 
election campaign that if ever an agreement was signed, he 
would cancel it.
<P>
	We can ask ourselves this question: Why would a Prime 
Minister get up one morning and decide that on this marvellous 
day, she was going to act stupid? No, a Prime Minister does not 
get up one morning with such a thing in mind. I am convinced 
she believed she was doing something intelligent. Well, 
according to the Nixon report, that intelligent thing was, and I 
quote: ``-the concluding of this transaction at Prime 
Ministerial direction in the midst of an election campaign where 
this issue was controversial, in my view flies in the face of 
normal and honourable democratic practice. It is a well known 
and carefully observed tradition that when governments 
dissolve Parliament they must accept a restricted power of 
decision during the election period. Certainly-and I am still 
quoting the Nixon report-the closing of a transaction of 
significant financial importance, sealing for 57 years the 
privatization of a major public asset should not have been 
entered into during an election campaign''. And Mr. Nixon 
concludes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is my opinion that the process to privatize and redevelop terminals 1 and 2 
at Pearson fell far short of maximizing the public interest.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My question thus brings out a first conclusion: it is not likely 
in the best interest of the population that one morning the Prime 
Minister decided to have that agreement signed. In whose 
interest then? Or for what reason? And why?
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	I would like to be naive, but as you can see I have a hard time 
believing, and an even harder time stating, that this decision was 
made only for altruistic purposes on the part of the parties 
involved.
<P>
	Therefore, I am quite happy that the Prime Minister of this 
35th legislature decided to terminate that agreement through 
Bill C-22. However, a second question comes to mind. That bill 
gives the minister the authority to pay compensations, which are 
for all intents and purposes quite discretionary, to those 
involved who might have sustained losses. I repeat: Is that in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4035"> 4035 </A></B>
<P>
best public interest? There again, I might be a bit naive, but I 
must say that anyone with a twisted mind could say that strictly  
speaking this section of the bill is tantamount to a blank cheque 
to the minister, with taxpayer's money. This is not only 
dangerous, it is unacceptable.
<P>
	Once more, to whom could this benefit? Who are these 
altruistic people who were part of this deal for the greater 
interest of the public? Let me give you a few names of these 
generous people. Who was part of Paxport, the company which 
won the contract? A few key figures: Don Matthews, former 
chairman of Mulroney's leadership campaign, in 1983; Ray 
Hession, former Industry deputy minister and a top civil servant 
at Supply and Services during the Trudeau era; Bill Neville, 
Conservative lobbyist, hired by Hession when Paxport was 
formed; Hugh Riopelle, a lobbyist hired by Hession as soon as 
the call for tenders went out. He had access to Mr. 
Mazankowski, the Deputy Prime Minister and strong-man of 
the Mulroney cabinet. John Llegate, another lobbyist hired by 
Hession and who had access to the Conservative cabinet, more 
precisely to Michael Wilson. Fred Doucet, another Conservative 
lobbyist, former chief of staff of Brian Mulroney, and senior 
advisor to Kim Campbell during the election campaign. This is 
for Paxport.
<P>
	Let us look now at Claridge, because we know that the two 
companies have merged. Peter Coughlin, a senior officer; 
Senator Léo Kolber, member of the board according to the 
<I>Financial Post Directory of Directors</I>. He was host to Charles 
Bronfman at a $1000 a plate dinner at his residence, where the 
present Prime Minister went at the beginning of October during 
the election campaign. Herb Metcalfe, lobbyist with the group 
Capital Hill, which represented The Claridge Properties, and 
former organizer for the present Prime Minister. Pat MacAdam, 
Conservative lobbyist and college chum of Brian Mulroney. Bill 
Fox, Conservative lobbyist, former press secretary and personal 
friend of Mr. Mulroney. Harry Near, Conservative lobbyist and 
long-standing Conservative activist. We could also mention 
Gary Ouellet, David MacDonald and Scott Proudfoot, all 
well-known Conservative lobbyists. Ramsey Withers, Liberal 
lobbyist with strong links to the present Prime Minister. Otto 
Jelinek, former Conservative minister, now chairman of the 
Asian branch of the Matthews group.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am convinced just as you are, because you and I 
are, shall we say, somewhat naive that all these people acted in 
the best interest of the public. They all deserve to have their 
name cleared, their reputation absolved of any wrong-doing, 
and for that we have to know what really went on.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	That is why, Mr. Speaker, we need a royal commission of 
inquiry. My colleague from the Reform Party said that it would 
be too costly and that a committee would be more appropriate. A 
committee does not have the authority to subpoena witnesses 
and to have them testify under oath. What we want is the truth 
and the only way  to get it is a royal commission. Quebecers and 
Canadians deserve it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis):</B> Mr. Speaker, once 
again I welcome the opportunity to speak to the bill before the 
House today. A number of opposition members apparently do 
not understand that this bill is necessary in order to close a 
gaping hole left by the previous federal administration.
<P>
	I say necessary, because we must establish certain 
parameters, which is not at all what the opposition has tried to do 
in this debate today. The motion of the Bloc Quebecois is aimed 
at shooting down the bill because it allegedly contains no 
provisions aimed at making the work done by lobbyists more 
transparent.
<P>
	Let me start by explaining what to me seemed quite obvious: 
the purpose of the bill before the House today is to cancel a 
particularly unsatisfactory agreement. Granted, this agreement 
has shown that the process left much to be desired. We will learn 
from the mistakes of the previous government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This bill will fix a leak in the roof and we intend at the 
appropriate time to fix the way roofs are built so that they all get 
built the right way. The hon. Minister of Industry has made it 
quite clear that he will bring forward the legislation to do just 
that.
<P>
	This motion is a rather pitiful attempt to combine the two 
issues and frankly it is a smokescreen to delay a necessary task.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I must say I look forward to the debate on future amendments 
to the Lobbyists Registration Act, and I am sure the Leader of 
the Official Opposition will be able to give us all the details on 
the system that caused all this, a system that turned out to be a 
disaster. If it were not for the abuses to a system he helped put in 
place, he would not be here today to criticize one of the most 
flagrant abuses of that system.
<P>
	One wonders why the Bloc Quebecois insists on delaying the 
passage of a bill whose purpose is to establish the parameters for 
an agreement. We do not claim this bill deals with all the 
problems of excessive lobbying. The bill is clear, however: the 
government will pay no compensation to lobbyists for this 
agreement. There is nothing to add.
<P>
	And how does the Bloc Quebecois react? It wants another 
study. Why? Everything has been said. In his report, Mr. Nixon 
stated that there was no evidence of any illegal action. He 
observed that relations between political staff and lobbyists 
were tainted by excessive influence, but there was nothing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4036"> 4036 </A></B>
<P>
illegal. If there had been, we would need a police investigation, 
not legislation.
<P>
	As so often happens, there comes a time we must concede that 
enough has been said and it is time for action. And why is it time 
for action? So that a major transportation facility can become 
operational, and so we can decide how this utility will be 
managed in the future. Why can't we do that now? Because there 
are some very tough obstacles to be overcome before we can 
make decisions concerning the future of Pearson International 
Airport.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What does the opposition propose? That we sit back and 
conduct another study, another inquiry, and probably another 
one after that if it does not like the outcome any better than it 
seems to like the one from Mr. Nixon?
<P>
	Have opposition members thought through what they would 
need to do after their inquiry was finished? Maybe then they 
would realize that they have to draft legislation to put an end to 
this deal. Maybe then they would realize that they would have to 
draft legislation to set the parameters for negotiating a 
settlement with the developers. Maybe they would even realize 
that the legislation should contain a provision to ensure that 
negotiations do not drag on interminably; that when enough is 
enough tell the developers that they will not get anything.
<P>
	That sounds like pretty good legislation. I wonder what words 
they would use. I suggest they have to look no further than the 
legislation before us today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We never spoke of compensating developers and I want to 
stress this point. The only possibly negotiable item is the 
amount of compensation for any expense qualifying under a 
signed agreement with the state.
<P>
	Lost opportunities and profits are excluded. Fees paid to 
lobbyists will not be refunded, and we must remember that last 
October, members opposite wanted us to pay some 
compensation after the contract with Paramax was cancelled. 
The Leader of the Opposition even said that we should pay one 
billion dollars in compensation to Paramax, after its contract 
with the government was cancelled. Just think, on the one hand 
they tell us not to compensate and on the other to do it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have to say that I have been surprised by the attitude of the 
Reform Party on this also. It supports the motion from the Bloc 
with its own particular brand of subamendment. I am truly 
surprised to know that it wants to delay a resolution to the 
situation facing Pearson airport, that it too wants to conduct an 
inquiry at taxpayers' expense. We on this side of the House 
always thought it was against any frivolous expenses on 
inquiries.
<P>
	Sure, it is redefining its position to say that the standing 
committee could do it. It does not need to be a  royal 
commission. I hate to point out the obvious, but the standing 
committee does not need any special direction from the House to 
conduct a study; it already has all kinds of authority to choose 
what kind of business it will conduct. Does it need to conduct a 
huge and expensive inquiry? I submit the answer is no, at least in 
part because I am sure the members of the committee have all 
read the Nixon report and recognize that no further information 
is required to reach the conclusion that this deal needs to be 
ended.
<P>
	I have let myself get carried away here a little.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I simply wanted to take this opportunity to set the record 
straight. First, under clause 10, the Minister of Transport must 
obtain the approval of the governor in council to enter into any 
negotiated agreement.
<P>
	Besides, the criteria governing such an agreement could not 
be more specific: no compensation is to be paid for any loss of 
profit or any fee paid to lobbyists. Out-of-pocket expenses, 
evidence of which must be provided, are really what developers 
have spent on any fully-justified activity related to the 
transaction concluded with the previous government.
<P>
	The government must ensure that there is no roundabout way 
for developers to claim that profits totalling such and such 
amount could have been made had they received the green light. 
As well, the approval of the Governor in Council ensures that the 
decision is up to the government, and not strictly up to one 
minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Fourth and finally, I wish to remind the House that there is an 
incredibly wide range of opportunities for further and 
continuing scrutiny of any potential settlement by members of 
the House, by the media and by the public at large.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let me only say, for example, that the financial commitments 
made by the Canadian government can be duly examined by the 
Auditor General.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	They can also be discussed and called into question here daily, 
or be included in budgetary review process in the House and in 
committee. Detailed questions can be asked about them. Under 
the Access to Information Act, the public and, of course, the 
media can follow the matter closely. These commitments can 
also be the focus of letters and petitions sent to the minister and 
to the government.

confusion the amendment has attempted to cast over a perfectly 
straightforward piece of legislation.

	All that needs to be done is to fix the plumbing, so let us get to 
work. You can rest assured, however, that I will speak again 
about our treatment of the plumbers. For that, I will certainly 
rely on the help of the opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on this bill and on the motion 
tabled by the Leader of the Opposition. I listened carefully to the 
hon. member for Saint-Denis and, before her, to the hon. 
member for Portneuf.
<P>
	Before pointing out a few ill-chosen comments made by the 
hon. member for Saint-Denis, I will briefly discuss the general 
provisions of Bill C-22, and particularly clauses 9 and 10. 
Clause 9, which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No one is entitled to any compensation from Her Majesty in connection with 
the coming into force of this Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is absolutely clear. No recourse is possible against the 
Crown. If Bill C-22 is passed, an individual will not be allowed 
to go before the courts, explain how he suffered a prejudice, and 
ask to be compensated following a measure taken by the 
Parliament of Canada under the powers granted to it by the 
Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	However, the following section has the effect of undoing what 
is established in section 9. In fact, section 10 goes even further, 
since it provides that the Minister may provide for the payment 
of such amounts as he considers appropriate. In other words, the 
government is saying: Do not sue us; we will give you 
something. There is no need to sue the government. People who 
have, or who claim to have suffered a prejudice, will simply 
submit their claim informally, without any legal proceedings, by 
simply making a phone call, or through a behind-the-scenes 
lobbyist, and they will receive a cheque from the government of 
Canada. It is much more faster than an open process, either court 
proceedings or public hearings, that can be appealed to the 
highest courts, so we close that door.
<P>
	We should be more honest and clear about section 9. Instead 
of saying that no one is entitled to any compensation from Her 
Majesty, we should say that no one is entitled to compensation 
from the courts, because the companies seeking compensation 
can always go directly to the minister. To say that no one is 
entitled to compensation is not exactly true. No one is entitled to 
compensation from a court of law.
<P>
	I would bet a few dollars that the compensation that will be 
awarded by the minister will probably be much more generous 
than any that would have been granted by the courts, because it 
is so much easier to come to an agreement between friends about 
any loss suffered. When we talk about friends, we always come 
back to the same basic question: ``Tell me who pays you, and I 
will tell  you who you work for''. Who is financing the current 
government? The current government is being supported, 
although to a lesser degree, by the same backers than the 
previous Conservative government.
<P>
	Why do these big companies and corporations give huge 
amounts of money to political parties? Because they support the 
leader or his or her colleagues, or even the party's platform? Of 
course not! They do it in order to have access to the government. 
They want a good return on their investment.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition gave us, in the Bloc Quebecois, 
a meaningful demonstration of that when he demanded that each 
and every contribution to our party be made only by people who 
can vote in Canada. The Bloc Quebecois is financed only by 
individuals; we do not take contributions from legal entities, 
which are not always good citizens, especially when it comes to 
the funding of political parties. Indeed, one can wonder why 
they finance political parties.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois can freely discuss this bill, since 
our hands are free. Individuals who give $20, $50 or $100 to the 
Bloc Quebecois know very well that they will have no influence 
on their member of Parliament or that they will not be able to 
blackmail him into doing anything. If voters wanted to 
blackmail us for their $200 or $300 contribution, we would 
simply write them a cheque for $200 or $300 and bid them 
goodbye. It is as simple as that in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Thus, the motion recently put forward by my friend, the hon. 
member for Richelieu, and aimed at limiting the public 
financing of political parties to a maximum of $5,000 per person 
would allow for great progress in the control of their elected 
representatives by voters, giving them reasons to regain 
confidence in this institution.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saint-Denis mentioned earlier in her 
speech that the Leader of the Opposition had made remarks 
about Paramax, among others, to the effect that people must be 
compensated. Quite on the contrary, what the Leader of the 
Opposition demanded in the Paramax issue was that the funds 
which were not invested in the helicopter contract be reinvested 
in the development of a high-speed train. That is quite different. 
We asked to reinvest the same amounts, not to pay lobbyists or 
to compensate speculators for anticipated losses. We asked the 
government to reinvest that money in high-technology 
industries so that it is not lost for Quebec. We never ever asked 
that money be paid to people who had stood to gain in any form.
<P>
	For me, the most difficult provision of Bill C-22 to swallow is 
that some people who remain anonymous will be compensated 
because their speculative scheme failed. The previous 
government, the Conservative government, had decided to 
privatize the airport. People thought that it was a good 
opportunity to make 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4038"> 4038 </A></B>
<P>
money but now that their deal failed, they will be compensated 
for any lost profit, if the bill is adopted without amendment.
<P>
	That is not how the Liberal Party said that it would deal with 
the Pearson airport privatization contract during the election 
campaign. They said it would be terminated but never talked 
about compensation. We could compare the situation to some 
marriages: it is not the same thing before and after the 
ceremony. Once the Liberals were elected, it was the same old 
story: they are the servants of those who finance them. So we 
have clause 10 allowing compensation.
<P>
	Yet, the situation was clear. The Prime Minister's position 
was clear, at least as I heard it during the election campaign: 
Pearson Airport would not be privatized and nobody would 
receive compensation. Things like that may be partly true while 
other people are given to understand that there is nothing to 
worry about, the losses will not be too great. I would almost 
wish that clause 9 were not included in the bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>9. No one is entitled to any compensation from Her Majesty in connection 
with the coming into force of this Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let us allow people who feel that they are wronged to appeal 
to the courts. Let people plead their case in court according to 
the rule of law and the general principles of law, but let us say no 
to the payment of administrative compensation, no to 
government by decree acting behind closed doors or negotiating 
over the phone or in person with party organizers. Let all these 
people who feel that their rights were infringed on ask the courts 
for redress, as all other citizens do. I submit that justice by order 
in council is not justice and it is unacceptable. That is why the 
Official Opposition cannot support the provision now before the 
House.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will now give the floor to the hon.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, so there is 
no confusion, I want to remind everybody that I do represent the 
riding of Témiscamingue.
<P>
	I was in my riding over the weekend and people asked me 
some questions. They noticed that we were debating the bill 
before us at considerable length and they asked me to explain a 
little bit to them what was going on. They said: ``We see a lot of 
members of the Bloc Quebecois express some reservations 
about this bill, but the government is not saying much. The last 
time we heard it speak on that subject was during the election 
campaign''.
<P>
	I tried to explain to them the difference between the contents 
of this bill and what they heard during the election campaign. 
After listening to what I had to say, they were wondering what 
happened to the transparency that the government had been 
talking about so much since it came into office and that had been 
promised during the election campaign.
<P>
	I explained to the people of my riding that this bill provides in 
principle for the cancellation of a very bad contract, a contract 
which was concluded as a result of considerable lobbying that 
was not done maybe in the most positive way. I also told them 
that it may be necessary to call into question the way lobbying is 
being done, something that the government promised to do, 
something that it says it will eventually look at.
<P>
	A party that spent more than eight years, almost nine, in 
opposition and that has a long-standing tradition like the 
Liberal Party should be able to act quickly to control lobbyists 
and to put something on the table immediately if it really wants 
to do so. But now that the Liberals form the government, they 
want to try to take advantage of the situation a little bit before 
doing a clean-up job.
<P>
	I also explained to my constituents that some compensation 
payments will be made following the cancellation of this 
contract. Clause 9 states that there will be no compensation, but 
clause 10 provides for exceptions with the approval of the 
Governor in Council; this amounts to allowing the Minister to 
give compensation for costs incurred to whomever he considers 
it appropriate to do so. It might not be quite abnormal, but it is 
very worrying.
<P>
	Of course, we are dealing with respectable people, but if their 
integrity were above reproach and if we were sure that things 
would be done in a more open way, we would be a lot less 
worried. However, I am not sure that public opinion is extremely 
confident about the process and that it will ultimately provide 
for fair compensation.
<P>
	They might even be able to differentiate between good and 
bad friends among those people who incurred costs, since it 
would be up to the Cabinet to determine which costs are eligible 
for compensation and which are not. Will we even be able to 
know the total cost of all that? I do not know, we will see at the 
end of the day, but that might be cause for concern. Maybe we 
will not even know. Maybe they will not even have to report to 
this House the whole cost for that operation.
<P>
	I would like to refer back to the electoral campaign for a 
moment, because this government made many commitments 
during the campaign, all the while often making reservations in 
a much lower tone of voice, with a lot less strength. What made 
the headlines was simply: ``We will cancel the Pearson airport 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4039"> 4039 </A></B>
<P>
deal''. They never mentioned compensation. They never talked 
about this compensation mechanism. Once in office, of course, 
probably under the advice of influential people, they got to that 
point.
<P>
	That leads me to make the connection with what is probably 
the real cause of the problem. One of my colleagues, the hon. 
member for Richelieu, put forward a motion here in this House. 
We discussed the financing of political parties by the people. Of 
course, our friends opposite were not very talkative on the 
subject, nor, in fact, were members of the Reform Party, who 
expressed support for the matter. Yet, this appears to me as 
something that would help solve in part a lot of problems, as we 
now see with these rather doubtful transactions. I will elaborate 
a little further, because people tell us: ``You talk about financing 
by the people, but what do you mean exactly?''
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	As a political party not even subject to Quebec's law on 
political party financing, we nevertheless complied with this 
obligation during the election campaign in order to have a lot 
more freedom.
<P>
	Those who finance a political party, be they individuals or 
companies, are not disinterested. But, of course, the person who 
donates $5, $10 or $15 does so out of conviction, as a show of 
confidence in the local member, the party and the leader. They 
donate small amounts. It is ordinary people who come to 
political rallies, who are phoned, who register as members, who 
are canvassed each year; they are canvassed very often, in fact.
<P>
	These people contribute according to their means at the time. 
Also, political parties are not sheltered from recessions. 
Financing campaigns are made. There is truly a direct contact 
with grass-roots militants. It is an excellent operation.
<P>
	Sure, it is not the most interesting thing for a policital party to 
do because it is a lot of work. We must ask volunteers in the 
entourage of members and local associations to get together, call 
people, drive to the far end of the riding to get $5 or a 
membership renewal. But we do it. We do not necessarily look at 
what it costs to do it; we do it out of principle. Those people, 
when we call them or contact them, express their opinion, say 
what they like or do not like about the government, about the 
party which has the finances; they say what they would like to 
have, say what their expectations are. It is a contact with the 
grass roots.
<P>
	I was talking with people whom I will not name on the 
government side and they told me: ``I find it much easier to get 
donations than new members. I have difficulty recruiting new 
members, but for donations, it is not a problem''.
<P>
	When their party, during the election campaign, asked them to 
get a certain number of new members, they simply did not 
understand that approach at all. It is the very principle of a party 
that is in touch with its grass-roots members. We do not sell 
membership cards just to win a leadership race. In major parties, 
leadership conventions are about the only occasions when there 
is a flurry of recruitment activity. Those parties concentrate 
more on lucrative fund-raising. They make a cost-benefit  
analysis of the time to be invested and conclude that they should 
concentrate on big contributors. Some people, including some 
of our members, asked: ``Why not do the same? You would stop 
asking us for funds, we would enjoy more freedom, and we 
would still believe in you''. I objected.
<P>
	When business people or representatives of companies or big 
private interests give considerable amounts of money, you 
should not think they are not hoping for something in return. It is 
not true that they dish out big money just for the sake of the 
democratic process.
<P>
	What are their real motives? They frequently hope for favours 
and they often get them. That is the root of a real problem. We 
never talk of that new way of looking at political party 
financing. Nobody ever talked about that before we did. We are 
the only ones who raised that question in the House.
<P>
	But we get no reaction whatsoever. We cry out in the desert. 
Somebody asked me: ``Why should you bother? Bloc members 
want to leave this Canadian system, anyway''. My answer is that 
if there is a heritage we would like to leave before we go, if that 
is the will of Quebecers, it would be a law on the financing of 
political parties that would introduce a much higher level of 
public morality.
<P>
	Such a law would force parties like the Liberal Party to be 
much more in touch with its membership. They would realize 
that getting a much greater number of smaller contributions of 
only $5, $10, $15, or $20 would bring them much closer to their 
grass-roots. They would hear people say they do not like the 
budget because of drastic cuts in unemployment insurance. 
They would get that message, which they are not getting now.
<P>
	Liberal members could have an even more direct response 
from their grassroots, and even from their own rank and file; 
they would notice it and make some pressure on their ministers 
and tell them: ``Listen, even our own rank and file say we are 
taking unpopular actions. There are things that are not 
working''.
<P>
	Of course, the government cannot be only popular, but it 
would be able to know if its actions are appreciated. In that way, 
even to a certain point, that would be a major gain for 
democracy. That is where real transparency should start, even 
before the lobbyists control. Even before that, the government 
should deal with political party financing. It should adopt much 
more severe legislation.

<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, my colleague from Richelieu had tabled a 
motion where he suggested a ceiling and proposed copying the 
Quebec model that already exists. There is no need to start all 
over again. We are not talking about something that we have to 
get from nowhere. There is a model, and Quebec's political 
party financing legislation has been recognized all over the 
world as a model. But here, and for all kinds of reasons, now that 
the Liberal Party is in office, it is tempting to go around those 
people who hope to benefit from the financing of a political 
party in office, and who will do so. It can wait a couple years, in 
order to fill its coffers and, of course, to take advantage of the 
fact that the coffers of their former political enemies are empty 
and they have a lot more trouble getting financing because they 
are very far from power.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I spoke briefly on Bill C-22. I had talked 
about it previously because there are too many things that were 
obscure in the old transaction and that the government does not 
necessarily want to solve. This government could have shed 
much more light on that issue in order to get to the bottom of the 
problem, but it is not really interested in doing that. It is then 
impossible for the members of the Bloc Quebecois to support 
this bill. In concluding, I would even like the government to get 
this message well: if it wants to deal with real problems, it has a 
golden opportunity to connect this with the Pearson Airport 
issue and to put on the table a reform of political party financing 
which could very widely be inspired by the Quebec legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today in this House to discuss Bill C-22 
regarding Pearson airport. The Minister of Transport stated in 
this House that the government decided that the agreements 
were not in the public interest, that the negotiating process was 
questionable and that there even might have been some political 
patronage in the Pearson airport issue. In cancelling the 
contract, the government is trying to negotiate amounts they 
consider to be fair and reasonable to compensate for expenses 
incurred in this transaction.
<P>
	We feel that this gigantic issue is fishy in many respects, 
given the millions of dollars involved. It is why the Bloc 
Quebecois refuses to support second reading of Bill C-22 
because it says the principle of it is flawed since it does not 
provide for any measure to make the work of the lobbyists 
transparent. In fact, as we all know, the matter of the Pearson 
airport contract is closely related to the role played by lobbyists. 
It is very disturbing. We all know the influence lobbyists can 
have on the government when it comes to legislation. We all 
know they can get from the government millions of dollars 
which should probably be allocated to more constructive projets 
than this one. This is why we would like a royal inquiry 
commission to be set up. This particular issue could end up 
being one of the most serious cases of  political patronage in the 
history of Canada. It is therefore an issue which deserves 
attention and which could help us clarify the role of lobbyists 
and the wasteful spending of the government.
<P>
	As I said, this very large transaction of $700 million would 
have given a private firm control over Pearson airport for 57 
years. Several irregularities can be found in the process. The 
bidding process took only 90 days, that is three months, a period 
of time which is quite unusual. Only two firms participated in 
the bidding, one directly linked to the Conservatives, the other 
to the Liberals.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Of course, the firm which was close to the then Conservative 
government was chosen. That firm was not required to give any 
guarantee of financial capacity. Sure enough, it got in financial 
trouble later on.
<P>
	Then, there was a merger with a firm which was close to the 
Liberal Party. Part of the reason why the government is 
attempting, with Bill C-22, to give financial compensation to 
lobbyists is because many of them are friends of the Liberals, 
who are now in power.
<P>
	During the electoral campaign, the Prime Minister promised 
to bring to light the circumstances under which the agreement 
had been reached and to cancel the deal. It is done, the deal was 
cancelled, but we are still waiting for an explanation on how it 
was reached in the first place. There was only an in camera 
inquiry conducted by a former Liberal minister from the Ontario 
government who was close to the Liberal Party.
<P>
	In fact, the only purpose of Bill C-22 is to cover up the whole 
thing without getting to the bottom of it. The government wants 
to determine, without Parliament having one word to say about 
it, the amount of potential compensation to be given to those 
thwarted investors.
<P>
	Imagine! The government wants to have all the powers, to 
determine the amounts to be paid and to decide to whom those 
amounts will be paid. What a great way to deal with their 
friends. That is why the Bloc Quebecois is asking for a royal 
commission of inquiry. That is the only way to know if the 
investors who were involved in this deal have to be 
compensated, to determine the amount of compensation and to 
know the role that lobbyists played with the government.
<P>
	Bill C-22 is unsatisfactory in several respects, and above all, 
it falls short not by what it says but what it does not say. 
According to the government, the bill sets no limit on the 
amount of potential payments and does not prevent 
negotiations. It says what the government is prepared to 
consider and what it is not prepared to consider. It says 
negotiations may not continue indefinitely. However, the nature 
of such payments should be specified. This bill should specify 
the kind of payments that may be made and not the kind of 
payments that will not be made.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4041"> 4041 </A></B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the decision is restricted to cabinet itself. The 
government will use section 9 to discourage all kinds of people 
from trying to make a case, and the rest will be up to the decision 
of the minister, in the privacy of cabinet. It is unacceptable to 
exclude Parliament, as the government is trying to do here, from 
such important decisions and to give Cabinet a blank cheque. 
And on top of that, to give so much latitude to the Minister of 
Transport who has already made a mess of the grain situation in 
western Canada. It is unacceptable to authorize payment of 
compensation without being sure such compensation should be 
paid.
<P>
	There are several reasons why we would like a royal 
commission of inquiry.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Why a royal commission? To find out why the government 
officially requested proposals for the privatization of Terminals 
1 and 2 at Pearson. Why would everything be done in a single 
phase? No pre-qualifications, unlike the process for Terminal 3, 
which included two phases. Why was the time frame in the 
request for proposals so short? Only 90 days. It was impossible 
for groups that, unlike Claridge and Paxport, were not already 
involved in the airport's management, to submit a valid bid.
<P>
	Why was the contract signed on October 7, 1993, in the 
middle of an election campaign, after some reluctance on the 
part of the chief negotiator who demanded written instructions 
before signing? What was the exact role of the lobbyists? Whom 
did they approach? What was the cost to the taxpayer of this 
hasty decision? Who really benefited? Why did the 
Conservative government want to privatize Pearson, the most 
profitable airport in Canada?
<P>
	In fact, there are a number of questions that arise, a number of 
fundamental questions about lobbying and the government's 
role. The government wants to try to cover up this affair. The 
Bloc Quebecois, including me, will vote against Bill C-22, and 
we will demand a royal commission of inquiry to shed light on 
what happened.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, while 
interventions are limited to ten minutes, I would like to say a 
few words on that horrible and surprising bill. Surprising, yes 
and no, since, in this Parliament, when the Liberal Party forms 
the government, we are used to hearing two different tunes: one 
during the election campaign and another after the election. In 
my region, we call that speaking out of both sides of one's 
mouth. When they were in the opposition, they sang another 
tune.
<P>
	When we started the debate today, I think that the hon. 
member for Bellechasse, who is a notary, did a marvelous job of 
outlining the legal aspect and the legal contradictions of that 
bill. The hon. member for Québec-Est has just finished his 
speech with at least ten questions. Very precise questions calling 
for clear answers. Only a commission of inquiry empowered to 
call  for sworn testimony could find the answer to those 
questions.
<P>
	Yet, the deal was made by the previous government. Why is 
this government covering up a deal made by its predecessor? 
Previous speakers of the Bloc Quebecois also mentioned that. 
The reason is that the same gang is running both parties. This is 
why we had a budget similar to Conservative budgets. This is 
why the reform of the unemployment system is similar to the 
one brought forward by the Conservatives with Bill C-113. This 
is why the elderly are now under attack as they were under the 
Conservatives.
<P>
	This is the reason why the salaries of our courageous civil 
servants are frozen. The constables that I see up there have their 
salaries frozen for six years, but that is not a problem. All this is 
done in an official way in order to be transparent. But when time 
comes to pay friends that are part of a gimmick like the one at 
Pearson airport, then it is left to the discretion of the minister or 
of the cabinet. That is the situation and this is why we are asking 
for a royal commission of inquiry.
<P>
	Why should a minister be allowed to reward a chum? And the 
list of chums of the party is known. The list is there with the 
names of organizers, senators, people who have generously 
contributed to this party, as well as to the other, both of which 
are maintaining such an unacceptable system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order. I would like a ruling from you. Is it appropriate 
that the member from the opposition could say that there was a 
payoff involved with the Pearson airport and Liberal Party 
funds? That is not really appropriate for this type of debate.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary will 
appreciate that the word payoff is a word that means many things 
to many different people. I will not find that a point of order in 
these circumstances.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I see the hon. parliamentary 
secretary is afraid of the truth, so he raises points of order to 
interrupt me and gain time. They had ample time to say what 
they wanted between the four or five Bloc Quebecois members 
who just spoke; they did not do so simply because they have 
nothing to say. They just want this debate to end because they 
are ashamed, they bow their heads so as not to see their own 
minister, their own party say today exactly the opposite of what 
they said during the election campaign. It is now time for them 
to reward friends of the party, those who brought them to power. 
They have to return favours.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4042"> 4042 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a clear explanation for the 22 committees announced 
in the last budget. Why create so many working committees 
when they had the red book and said that it contained solutions 
to all problems? According to them, there were solutions for all 
issues and the government had plans in all areas. But that was 
not enough, they had to create 22 advisory committees with the 
last budget. Why? Because these committees will need 
communication companies, lobbying firms and people to 
subpoena witnesses so it will be possible to reward friends of the 
party and financial contributors. So they spread favours around 
generously, just like the Tories did in 1984. They reward people 
and then they will present a bill on lobbying and say: ``We must 
change things now that we have taken care of our friends''.
<P>
	This Pearson operation is typical; let us not call it the bill, but 
rather the Pearson operation. This operation rewards friends of 
the party. If you are sincere when you say you want to solve the 
problem, as you seemed to be during the election campaign, then 
throw down your masks, show your face, accept a commission 
of inquiry; you will not be smeared if you are really sincere, if 
you did nothing wrong. Take off your masks, create the 
commission of inquiry and then we will see. We will see if you 
are so innocent and if your are sincere when you speak about 
lobbying. If the commission of inquiry concludes that changes 
are required, we will then invite you to go even further. That will 
be the real step, the first real step in the right direction, the 
direction of party financing by the people.
<P>
	I presented a motion on that point. What did the Liberal 
members reply?
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	They ridiculed a motion which exemplifies the beauty and the 
greatness of Quebec in the area of political transparency. Other 
provinces share the same desire since seven of them limit the 
amount of donations to political parties. At least, they set a 
limit. Here, in the House of Commons, we will not set any limit. 
The government knows which side its bread is buttered on. I 
understand why the Liberal members remain silent, their heads 
bowed low in shame. They were financed by these people.
<P>
	When I was a senior at l'Académie de Québec, my philosophy 
teacher, after a particularly brilliant argument which had left us 
speechless or totally unable to counter, used to say: ``Dear 
friends, it is not given to swines to appreciate pearls''. Of 
course, he said that in jest. I wonder what he would think-he is 
long dead now, but I cannot help thinking of him and he might be 
doing the same right now-if he saw this scandalous piece of 
legislation. Bill C-22 could have heralded a new approach 
regarding lobbying firms and transparency. But instead, what 
we have is a Conservative document.
<P>
	This bill is no different from those the Tories used to pass to 
protect their buddies, their clique. No wonder we  have a deficit. 
No wonder no decision is made. It is because the government is 
waiting. It just came to office and is giving its financial 
supporters a chance to fill their own pockets, under the same 
system as we had with the Tories.
<P>
	That is why we say that it is high time for the government to 
make a move, and order a commission of inquiry as requested by 
the Bloc Quebecois. It would go a long way, not only to get to the 
bottom of this, but also to expose all the secret manoeuvring of 
lobbying firms and, eventually, to control their actions through a 
well-structured piece of legislation that could remedy this 
situation.
<P>
	I see that my time has expired but I am sure that I will be 
granted unanimous consent to continue for another ten minutes 
or so. The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is 
signalling me. I thank him. I will then continue for just 10 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The member asked the 
question. Is there unanimous consent for him to go on?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It does not look like it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
speech of my colleague, the member for Richelieu, prompts me 
to take part in this debate, even though I do not have much 
influence in the Toronto Lester B. Pearson airport deal, as 
member for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	In any case, this contract poses a problem and I am glad this 
government did something to correct the situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What we have been faced with is a filibuster by members of 
the party opposite who seem to think that when the government 
tries to fix something they had better jump on bandwagon.
<P>
	I know what happened. Throughout the election campaign 
while we were criticizing this deal and indicating that it was 
unacceptable to the people of Canada, we heard absolutely 
nothing from the hon. member for Richelieu and his colleagues. 
They are busy trying to make up for lost time and they are doing 
it by making windy speeches in the House, saying how awful 
this is. They are trying to find fault with a perfectly reasonable 
and sensible government bill that gives the government the 
power to abrogate this deal. That is my understanding of it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4043"> 4043 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood made an 
excellent speech on this subject the other day and so did the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. I was impressed 
because I was hearing the facts about the bill for the first time 
instead of the distortion we have been faced with from hon. 
members opposite.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	I know the hon. member for Richelieu used to be a 
Conservative. He was part of the bunch who cooked up this deal. 
I can understand why he left that party; he had some sense of 
shame. He knew a bad deal when he saw one. He could smell a 
rat. That is what this deal was.
<P>
	We saw it and we talked about it. The hon. member was not 
speaking about it and he should have been. He should have been 
denouncing this deal up and down the country. Instead of that, he 
was off talking about Quebec independence. He could have been 
talking about this deal because he knows a bad government. He 
was elected to support that government. That is the shame of it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is why he changed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member now says that is why he 
changed. I am glad he saw at least some light. Unfortunately 
there was not quite enough light to bring him to the other side of 
the House.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the hon. member realized it was the previous 
government that caused this calamity. It made this deal and 
made it in a great rush before it got defeated at the polls. Those 
members knew that government was going out, so what did they 
do? They ran to their friends and said: ``Quick, let's make a deal. 
We will sell the airport to you because those Liberals won't sell 
it to you, not on these favourable terms. Let's make a quick deal 
and we do not care if we hoodwink the Canadian taxpayers on 
the way by''. Of course the Tories had been doing that for nine 
years anyway. Everybody knows that.
<P>
	They cooked up this deal to get it through in a hurry while the 
hon. member opposite stayed silent. Our party, to its credit, 
denounced the deal from the very beginning and announced it 
would review the deal. That was the right thing to do.
<P>
	We announced we would review the deal on taking office and 
that was done. It was a promise made and a promise kept. Hon. 
Robert Nixon was appointed to review this deal thoroughly and 
capably and he prepared a report. He said the deal was no good, 
that it was a bad deal for the Canadian taxpayers. Accordingly, 
the deal was rescinded by the government.
<P>
	We have acted entirely properly on this. Now we are faced 
with a filibuster in the House by the opposition because it 
somehow wants to try to find fault with this thing. That is what it 
says.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Johnny-come-latelys.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Johnny-come-latelys is right, as the hon. 
member says. Not only are they Johnny-come-latelys, they are 
busy trying to pretend it was they who opposed  it all along and 
that somehow the government has not followed through and 
done its bit.
<P>
	The government has done its bit. It is asking for authority 
from this House to make a negotiated deal on very reasonable 
terms with the purchasers of the airport. If the deal is not 
favourable, then there will be no compensation at all. That is my 
understanding of the effect of the bill and I think it is great.
<P>
	I will not bother expressing my own personal views on how 
much these people should get, but I can tell members it is a very 
low figure. I will go that far. The argument is that it should not 
be done retroactively but I do not think this argument holds 
weight.
<P>
	These people went into this deal with their eyes open. They 
knew they were faced with an opposition party at the time, the 
Liberal Party of Canada, which announced it was going to 
review the deal. The investors knew they were at risk of losing 
any money they put into the deal when they went ahead with it, 
with the previous government which one could almost describe 
as crooked in its dealings in this case.
<P>
	The deal has been canned by the government. The legislation 
is asking the House for authority to correct the situation. It is 
good legislation. The opposition should be supporting it 
enthusiastically. Instead, what do we get? An amendment has 
been moved. Since we are debating the amendment, let me read 
the words of the amendment to the House because some hon. 
members opposite may have forgotten what it was they moved 
many days ago, early in this debate.
<P>
	I want to point out that no bill has taken anywhere near as long 
as this one to get through the House. This is a fairly minor piece 
of legislation, yet the opposition has gone berserk on it. It is 
amusing to listen, but honestly one would think they would have 
had their priorities better placed. They have run out of stuff to 
criticize. That is the problem. The government is so good they 
do not know what to criticize.
<P>
	The amendment says that the House declines to give second 
reading to Bill C-22 and so on ``because the principle of the bill 
is flawed due to the fact that it contains no provisions aimed at 
making the work done by lobbyists more transparent''. What 
utter nonsense. Of course it does not. This is not a lobbyists bill. 
This is not one that seeks to change the law relating to lobbyists. 
This corrects one mistake in one contract and gives the 
government authority to correct the mistake. That is all it is for.
<P>
	The bill does not say it is to change the rules relating to 
lobbyists. It never purported to do that. The government 
announced it is going to bring in such a bill. All we hear is 
criticism from the other side because we have not moved 
quickly enough on that. The bill will be forthcoming shortly. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4044"> 4044 </A></B>
<P>
Hon. members opposite need only hold their breath for a short 
time. I recommend they do so and the bill will appear.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	When the bill appears they will have ample opportunity to 
discuss the law relating to lobbyists. They do not need to do it on 
this bill, but I am delighted they have taken the opportunity. At 
least we have the advantage of receiving their views on a 
lobbyists bill. We know when it finally comes before the House 
the debate will be extremely short because they have all made 
their speeches on it ad nauseam on this particular amendment.
<P>
	I am looking forward to a very short debate on the lobbyists 
bill and getting it studied in detail in committee. I know hon. 
members of the Bloc Quebecois particularly, the Official 
Opposition in the House, will participate in the committee 
enthusiastically when that bill comes before us.
<P>
	In the meantime, why are we delaying this very important 
piece of legislation? Is it because they want a general discussion 
on lobbyists? Maybe. If so, they have not said a lot about that. 
They have been busy denouncing this deal, which we all agree is 
a bad deal.
<P>
	I do not think anybody in the House is at variance on that, 
except possibly that former cabinet minister who sits in the back 
over there now, the hon. member for Sherbrooke. His views may 
be shared by the hon. member for Saint John. I would not want to 
accuse her of supporting a deal like that because of course she 
was not elected to this House in the last Parliament, although she 
ran as a candidate for the party that did make the deal.
<P>
	I think they are the only two in the House who would support 
it. Of course we have not heard their views that I recall in this 
debate, so I do not know for sure whether they support this bill. 
However the opposition does not. The Reform Party does not. 
The government does not. The New Democratic Party, to the 
best of my knowledge, does not.
<P>
	So why all the debate? Hon. members opposite are simply, as I 
say, trying to jump on a bandwagon to make up for the fact that 
they failed to criticize this deal, failed to make their criticisms 
known publicly before the election.
<P>
	Why was that? Is it because so many of the members of the 
party opposite were once Conservative and they feel some 
kinship with the former government that made this deal? Could 
it be that the hon. member for Richelieu and his colleagues who 
used to be Tories before they became members of the Bloc feel 
they ought not criticize the fellow that got them elected in the 
first place, Mr. Mulroney? It was his government of course and 
his successor government that made this deal. The deal was 
clearly made with the friends of the previous government, 
although it was the Kim Campbell government that made the 
arrangement.
<P>
	Is that why there has been this reticence on the part of the 
opposition? The Leader of the Opposition of course was a 
Mulroney puppet at one time. He owes his whole political career 
to Mr. Mulroney.
<P>
	It cost $143 million, was it not, to get him elected? Is that not 
what they paid to get him elected in his riding in a byelection? If 
that is what it cost, maybe that was the price of his silence on this 
issue until the debate came up here in the House of Commons, 
long after the event, instead of a level criticism dumped on this 
deal early on, way back during the election campaign. That is the 
kind of thing that should have happened.
<P>
	Here the government is seeking to do the right thing and all we 
get is a long debate with criticisms thrown at the government as 
though somehow we had made this deal. We unmade the deal; 
we cancelled it. We have brought the bill in to correct the 
situation. Hon. members opposite instead of criticizing the 
government for this should be offering their enthusiastic support 
for this legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take the 
opportunity given me by this debate on Bill C-22 to draw the 
attention of hon. members on the links between several, 
apparently unrelated, circumstances.
<P>
	On May 4, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported that federal contracts 
to the private sector, which amounted to $2.9 billion in 1984-85, 
reached $5.2 billion in 1992-93, and will reach an even higher 
level in 1993-94. The largest item, $332 million, is related to 
the maintenance of the air fleet.
<P>
	Strange coincidence when talking about the sale of 
Pearsonairport to private interests. The second item, $330 
million in 1992-93, is for the management of foreign aid. This 
expenditure is important when you realize the problems and the 
complexity of managing CIDA, an agency which, following the 
Auditor General's report, is trying to prepare a management 
plan for its activities scattered, as we know, in 115 countries 
around the world. Federal contracts for the department of 
defence have gone up from $740 million in 1984-85, to $1.5 
billion in 1992-93.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The budget for temporary employment has jumped from $52 
million to $101 million in the same period, this means that it has 
doubled in nine years. What is more disturbing is that, still 
according to the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, almost half the 36,166 
contracts signed in 1992-93 were awarded without call for 
tenders. I would like to quote Mr. Daryl Bean, president of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4045"> 4045 </A></B>
<P>
Public Service Alliance of Canada who said in this regard: ``Too 
often selected firms are friends of the government''.
<P>
	Mr. Martin's budget of February 22 is revealing on that 
subject. According to the minister's statement on that day, it is 
giving corporations a series of tax benefits in order to promote 
job creation.
<P>
	Money for these tax benefits comes from the cancellation of 
the age credit and cuts in the unemployment insurance program. 
We are asking the elderly and the unemployed to make 
sacrifices. As the members know, these sacrifices were to no 
avail because of the interest rate increase which added further to 
the Canadian debt these last few weeks. The government is 
robbing the needy with one hand while giving to its friends with 
the other. What is it waiting for to cut tax credits and corporate 
funding, to impose a minimum tax on corporations and large 
fortunes, to go on with the broadening of the tax base that the 
minister is boasting about, to broaden it in order to include 
family trusts?
<P>
	In his 1993 report, the Auditor General denounced the federal 
government's permissiveness when dealing with 
resource-based companies. As we all know a legal dispute that 
has been going on for 14 years between the government and 
these companies cost the Consolidated Revenue Fund some $1.2 
billion.
<P>
	The whole question of federal contracts and taxation of 
corporations and shareholders leads to considerations about 
political party financing and transparency in the central 
government's management which have not been exactly the 
strong points of our new government since election day, last 
October 25. While the Bloc Quebecois has adopted the principle 
of financing by the public, the Conservative and Liberal parties 
always objected to such a financing system and still receive 
their funds from both companies and individuals.
<P>
	We only have to consult the list of big donors of the traditional 
political parties, it is in the public domain. We can see that those 
two parties are like two peas in a pod as far as election financing 
is concerned.
<P>
	Both Liberals and Conservatives have big donors and 
Canadian banks are among the biggest. During a recession, these 
institutions always make record profits, pay very little tax in the 
end and can only profit from an asset sale to private investors or 
the buying of lame ducks from private sector by the government. 
The banks know that the federal government cannot in theory, 
even if in theory only, go bankrupt, so they will always be eager 
to finance the government's buying or selling of assets. Lending 
institutions can only benefit from the proliferation of asset 
transfers they have helped to bring about.
<P>
	Mention should be made at this time of one Canadian lending 
institution which took the liberty of intervening in the debate 
during the Charlottetown referendum. Like other corporations, 
it now prefers to operate behind the scenes and avoid public 
discussions. Lending institutions are always connected with 
federal contracts and with major government transactions such 
as the sale of  Pearson airport, the only truly profitable airport in 
the country.
<P>
	Obviously, all of the aspects of this deal are interconnected. In 
planning to compensate the Conservative and Liberal investors 
involved in the aborted deal to purchase Pearson Airport, the 
Liberal government is merely returning the favour to those who 
contribute to the campaign coffers of the old parties. These 
investors took a business risk. If they had made windfall profits, 
would a bill have been introduced to tax these too easy or 
fantastic profits? Obviously, the answer to that question is no. 
Why then pay compensation to investors at the expense of the 
average taxpayer? If this agreement had been concluded 
between two private parties, one would not have received any 
compensation at all. Why then use taxpayers' money to 
compensate private investors who took a normal business risk 
which ultimately did not pan out?
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	The same phenomenon occurs when a call for tenders goes 
out. Bidders often incur administrative charges and professional 
fees in preparing their bid. Obviously, the contract can be 
awarded to only one bidder. Are all of the other bidders 
compensated for the expenses they incurred? No. Why are there 
always two standards, one for the private sector and one for the 
government? Is it because most of the principal stakeholders in 
this deal have ties to the Liberal and Conservative parties?
<P>
	Consider the $1,000 a plate fundraising dinner held in 
Westmount during the last election campaign. A number of 
those closely connected with the sale of Pearson Airport were in 
attendance. Consider as well the $300 a plate benefit dinner held 
last week in Montreal which attracted a crowd of 1,600 people. 
We can safely say that a number of those in attendance were very 
interested in Bill C-22 and in the compensation to be paid 
eventually to investors in the deal.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois objects to any form of compensation 
being paid to investors and therefore, I will vote against Bill 
C-22. To quote the excellent legislative summary prepared by 
the Research Branch of the Library of Parliament, ``pursuant to 
clause 10 of Bill C-22, the Minister of Transport may, with the 
approval of the Governor in Council, enter into agreements to 
provide for the payment of such amounts as considered 
appropriate in view of the cancellation''. We are opposed to 
clause 10. Why should compensation be paid to some people if 
they were able to take advantage of their relations?
<P>
	We ask the government to legislate as soon as possible to 
control the activity of lobbyists as it promised to do in the last 
election campaign. Why do the Liberals not change Bill C-44 on 
lobbyists that the Conservatives passed in 1988? According to 
the report of the inquiry by Mr. Robert Nixon, whom the present 
Prime Minister charged with reviewing the Pearson Airport 
affair:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4046"> 4046 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The exact amount of money received by the lobbyists is not known. 
According to the real estate developers' sources, it would amount to $1.5 
million over 18 months.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Nixon also questions the excessive rate of return granted 
to the airport tenant. He also mentions the role of patronage and 
pressure groups in this transaction. The role of lobbyists in this 
affair went beyond what is usually expected. The investigator 
tells us that lobbyists were directly responsible for the 
reassignment of several senior officials and the request from 
some other officials to be replaced.
<P>
	We ask the government to get to the bottom of this transaction 
and to hold an independent public inquiry which alone can 
reassure disillusioned taxpayers. Is this another promise in the 
red book that will remain a dead letter or be postponed 
indefinitely? When does the government intend to keep the 
promise mentioned in the red book during the election campaign 
of a code of ethics for ministers, senators and members of 
Parliament, political staff and public servants, to provide a 
proper framework for their relations with pressure groups? The 
openness and accountability of government are at stake.
<P>
	In conclusion, for us in the Bloc Quebecois, in future, Pearson 
Airport in Toronto should be run by a non-profit airport 
authority, like the airports in Montreal and Vancouver.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure 
that I speak again on the issue of Pearson Airport, a subject close 
to our hearts. I would like to start by responding to a point the 
hon. member for Kingston and the Islands made earlier in his 
speech. My friend opposite said the Bloc Quebecois was 
criticizing and that we might be criticising for the sake of 
criticizing or because we could find nothing else to criticize.
<P>
	First, the people across the way should not forget they are the 
ones responsible for the legislative agenda. Bring in something 
else and we will go along. It is just that so far in this Parliament, 
the legislative agenda has been rather light. The people of 
Canada and Quebec have a right to see things happening here.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Many promises were made in the red book. Now, the 
government is getting political mileage out of making good so to 
speak some of these promises. But we need more than mere 
promises to make this country work.
<P>
	There is an echo in this place, Mr. Speaker. So, I will carry on 
with my speech to make sure the Bloc Quebecois' position on 
this is perfectly clear. For the information of the hon. member 
for Kingston and the Islands, I would like to quote, if I may, 
from an article published on May 9 in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>. I think 
it shows pretty clearly why the Bloc Quebecois is questioning 
the Liberals' motives for wanting to pass this motion so quickly.
<P>
	I am not perfectly bilingual, but I will read this article in the 
language of Shakespeare, as it was written in English. This will 
give the anglophones in my riding an  opportunity to hear how I 
speak this language I am trying to learn but have not yet 
mastered.
<P>
	Here is what Mr. Greg Weston wrote. I will spare you certain 
points of detail, but the part that I found particularly interesting 
reads as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given the billions in potential profits the developer lost in all this and the 
government's apparent bazooka-like approach to compensation, the silence 
from the negotiating table seems rather deafening.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Cela veut dire que ça rend sourd un peu.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In that respect one observation from the recent compensation meeting in 
Toronto is perhaps worth noting: The firm with the largest stake in the 
development consortium and therefore the most to lose is Claridge Properties. It 
happens to be controlled by Montreal billionaire Charles Bronfman who 
happens to be a friend of the Liberal Party.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	L'histoire commence à être intéressante.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As it also happens the Liberal government still wants to develop Pearson 
airport in a big way, will be looking for a suitable developer and is eager to get 
the work started this fall. One of those at the recent compensation meeting in 
Toronto observed a pretty relaxed group of Claridge executives. Interesting, 
no?</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is what our friend Greg Weston wrote in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> on May 9. How can we, from the Bloc Quebecois, give 
the Liberals opposite a blank cheque when there is already talk 
about games being played behind the scenes?
<P>
	We want to know what we are dealing with before any 
compensation is paid. We want to know what happened, and who 
was involved in particular, to see how Pearson airport could be 
developed later on.
<P>
	We sense certain things. We hear that the government wants to 
develop Pearson Airport, still. So, it would be very interesting to 
start over with a clean slate, instead of using what I might call 
the ``humus'' borrowed from the previous government and the 
current one as well.
<P>
	I also wanted to stress the importance of this case. We are not 
talking about something minor. Some 57,000 passengers go 
through this airport. Twenty million passengers a year. Three 
hundred destinations in 60 countries. Plus 56,000 direct and 
indirect jobs and some $4 billion in economic spinoffs in 
Ontario.
<P>
	So this is very important; we cannot remain silent and trust 
them when they say that there were no lobbyists. The $4 billion 
at stake is very important for the economy.
<P>
	The contract still has not been made public. However, if we 
believe what journalists have told us about it, the Nixon report 
points out that lobbyists' involvement of this case seems 
unusual. Lobbyists were more active in this case than in any 
other where the government must make decisions. So it is very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4047"> 4047 </A></B>
<P>
important that Canadians and Quebecers be aware of what goes 
on behind the scenes.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Another thing that struck me is how fast the contract was 
signed in the midst of last year's election campaign. The former 
Prime Minister hastened to sign this contract, this agreement, 
despite the current Prime Minister's election promise to cancel 
it. However, the same bunch of friends seem to be hiding behind 
all this. I think that Canadians and Quebecers have the right to 
know what is going on.
<P>
	The other thing that bothers me is that, in the redevelopment 
and operation of Pearson Airport, the government had promised 
not to finance the modernization of Terminal 1. Nevertheless, it 
has apparently granted rent reductions worth several millions of 
dollars, which amounts to investing. It seems as though the right 
hand does not know what the left hand is doing.
<P>
	The Nixon report also lists 10 unusual deductions for 
calculating gross revenue on which the rent is based. Again, are 
friends of the current and former governments pulling the 
strings to help themselves? For us, it is very important that all 
this be disclosed.
<P>
	The other point, as there are two kinds of opposition in this 
country: Opposition members and the media. The Toronto <I>Star</I> 
also tells us that, according to its own research, the transaction 
would probably have triggered an increase in the per passenger 
cost related to the use of this airport. The increase would have 
been passed on to users. If it is a government responsibility to 
develop transport networks in Canada, I think that the 
government must assume the responsibility of facing Canadians 
and telling them that this transaction will result in increased 
costs to them, instead of relying on a friend to do that dirty job.
<P>
	Let us say a word about this government which refuses to shed 
light on the issue and refuses to conduct an inquiry into that 
transaction. We are dealing with the transport sector. On 
Thursday, I must go back to my riding. I will sit on a rural 
dignity committee and listen to people who have things to say 
about railroad transport in Eastern Quebec, and specifically in 
my riding of Gaspé. This is an initiative taken by local people, 
because the government refuses to hold such hearings. As a 
member of the opposition, I agreed to sit on that committee and 
report back to Ottawa the grievances of those people.
<P>
	But why does the government refuse to assume its 
responsibilities? People have things to say. We are talking about 
transport. Why do people in the Gaspé Peninsula have to take the 
initiative and set up their own committee, without the means 
available to a House committee, such as interpreters and a staff 
to type transcripts? They will do a very good job, but some 
people may feel somewhat prejudiced by the way hearings will 
be conducted. Indeed, although I understand English, I cannot 
speak it as fast as those people. But I will be there and I wanted 
to point that out.
<P>
	My time is running out. I will conclude by mentioning two 
major points which will more or less summarize what I said 
earlier. How did the previous government come to approve a 
project which goes totally against public interest? Are there 
interests other than the public's interest at stake, such as friends 
of the former and current governments?
<P>
	We, Bloc Quebecois members, feel that a public inquiry is 
absolutely necessary in this case. The credibility of the 
government opposite depends on such an inquiry. If members 
opposite continue to hide behind closed doors and let lobbyists 
govern the country, you can understand that it will give us strong 
arguments for the upcoming referendum. Indeed, it will be very 
easy to say: Look, if you want to continue to live in a type of 
federation which lets lobbies make decisions, you can have it.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to participate again in this debate on 
Bill C-22.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to tell you how surprised I am to see a 
government that, just weeks ago, contended it was bound by a 
secret verbal agreement-more bounded than that, you 
choke-now be able to get out of a written, signed agreement.
<P>
	I notice also that the government refused categorically to 
provide us with any information whatsoever, not one single 
document, on the verbal agreement regarding Ginn Publishing. 
In the case of the signed agreement between Her Majesty and T1 
T2 Limited Partnership however, it produced a schedule 
attached to the bill listing 24 agreements and leases, as well as 7 
other agreements and 19 other documents, for a total of 46 
different documents. But again this was an agreement the Prime 
Minister had signed herself with her Minister of Transport.
<P>
	How the government can so easily break that many 
agreements and leases while the Minister of National Heritage is 
incapable of getting out of a verbal agreement remains a great 
mystery to me, a mystery I hope we will be able to clear up 
someday.
<P>
	That being said, I would like to address two questions: first, 
did the government negotiate a secret, possibly verbal, 
agreement with regards to compensation that could be paid 
under clause 10? Second, does the government intend to favour 
unduly, as it has in the past, Pearson Airport at the expense of 
other airports in the Toronto region and elsewhere in Canada?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4048"> 4048 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us start by looking at a possible secret deal. This bill 
makes use of the well-known Liberal technique of concealment. 
For example, clause 9 reads, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No one is entitled to any compensation-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That sounds clear and simple. Finally, we think, the 
government is taking a firm stand.
<P>
	Wrong. Again, the government is concealing its real 
intentions, because paragraph 10(1) of the bill states, and I 
quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If the Minister considers it appropriate to do so the Minister may, with the 
approval of the Governor in Council, enter into agreements on behalf of Her 
Majesty to provide for the payment of such amounts as the Minister considers 
appropriate in connection with the coming into force of the Act, subject to the 
terms and conditions that the Minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, for my hon. opponents who have not yet 
understood, the government is giving itself the authority, 
without telling anyone, as is its way, to pay its friends what it 
wants, without reporting the amount.
<P>
	Because remember, several friends of the Conservatives and 
also of the Liberals, of course, are in the T1 T2 Limited 
Partnership. For the information of some Liberal members who 
always made it a duty under the former government to point out 
the shadow of a doubt about conflicts of interest, I remind them 
that several of their fund-raisers and affiliates took part in the 
limited partnership in question, which will benefit from clause 
10(1) of the bill which we are discussing.
<P>
	Since the lunch hour is often a time for game shows on 
television, I suggest we play a game of Jeopardy.
<P>
	Here are the clues for the first question: He owns Claridge 
Properties Inc., which controls T1 T2 Limited Partnership; he is 
also a great Liberal and contributor to the party's election fund. 
You are right, the question is: Who is Charles Bronfman?
<P>
	Second question: He is a lobbyist for Claridge Properties and 
a former organizer for Jean Chrétien. Once again, you are right: 
Who is Herb Metcalfe?
<P>
	Third question: He is a Liberal senator and held a 
$1,000-a-plate benefit supper during the election campaign; 
coincidentally, he is on the board of Claridge Properties, the 
majority shareholder of T1 T2 Limited Partnership. You are 
right: Who is Leo Kolber?
<P>
	And I could go on.
<P>
	Again I ask: Is there a written or verbal agreement 
guaranteeing payments to shareholders of T1 T2 Limited 
Partnership that this bill would implement?
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I want to pay particular attention to the written or verbal 
agreement as one of the people involved in the Pearson Airport 
case is Fred Doucet, the lobbyist who managed to convince the 
Liberal minister of heritage to sell part of the Canadian heritage 
to foreign interests by invoking a verbal agreement.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport must table all the documents kept 
secret on this bill, and especially its  virtual or potential 
agreements to prevent the government from wasting public 
funds, as it seems to be doing, to thank its friends and 
compensate them for an election promise that cost them a juicy 
contract. It must be as transparent as it claims to be and set up a 
royal commission of inquiry to shed light on the case and its 
history.
<P>
	Otherwise, Quebecers and Canadians will know that under 
their Liberal government, a beer drinker can have his benefits 
cut without qualms while a distillery owner gets breaks such as 
Clause 10 of this bill.
<P>
	Bill C-22 does not say anything about the government's 
intentions regarding Pearson airport. We already know that the 
government intended to favour this airport at the expense of 
other Metro Toronto airports by prohibiting Transport Canada 
from making, at any airport located within a 75-kilometre 
radius of Pearson airport, investments likely to decrease traffic 
at Pearson. In Montreal, Transport Canada forced the Montreal 
airport society to keep Mirabel and Dorval airports open as a 
requirement for privatizing airport operations. Unfortunately 
for Montreal, while Jean Chrétien and his then colleagues were 
plunging the country into an astronomical deficit-the last of 
which, in 1984, has never been matched in constant dollars-, 
they did not choose the same path as that taken for Toronto, that 
is expanding the existing airport instead of creating two lame 
ducks to Toronto's great delight.
<P>
	I will quote Jean Lapointe, the spokesman for the Reaction 
group that includes airline and aircraft industry employees as 
well as the Canadian Manufacturers' Association. Mr. Lapointe 
made the following comment regarding the decision of the 
Montreal Airports Advisory Board to keep both airports in 
operation: ``It is clear that Ottawa has opted in favour of 
Toronto. Can Quebec have a competitive airport system? The 
answer is no. Quebec will only manage to do that through 
sovereignty, because its hands will no longer be tied by the 
decisions made in Ottawa''. So, what is that decision made by 
Ottawa all about?
<P>
	Claude Picher, who is a journalist with <I>La Presse</I>, tells us that 
entrusting the management of Dorval and Mirabel airports to a 
non-profit corporation was conditional upon maintaining two 
major airports for the greater Montreal area. This is a case of 
double standard.
<P>
	There is also the issue of investments. Does this government 
intend to invest massive amounts of money in Pearson Airport, 
to the detriment of other airports which must be self-financing? 
Let us not forget that the cancelled contract provided for 
investments of some $700 million for terminals 1 and 2 at 
Pearson Airport. We still do not know if the government will 
make these investments before entrusting the management of 
the airport to who-knows-whom. By contrast, the Montreal 
Airports Advisory Board, which does not have the financial 
means of the government, will invest some $150 million, or $30 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4049"> 4049 </A></B>
<P>
million annually over a five-year  period, to modernize and 
improve the infrastructures and facilities at Dorval and Mirabel.
<P>
	The previous and current governments chose Toronto, and 
Montreal is still paying the price. According to the daily <I>Le 
Soleil</I>, in 1990, 20.5 million passengers were processed at 
Pearson Airport, compared to 8.9 million for Dorval and 
Mirabel combined. In the same editorial, Michel Audet points 
out that, in 1952, Montreal had 20 per cent more head offices 
and financial institutions than Toronto. But by 1988, it had 60 
per cent fewer. Mr. Audet also mentions the fact that between 
1975, which is the year Mirabel opened, and 1980, the number of 
passengers increased by only 13 per cent in Montreal, compared 
to 37 per cent in Toronto. This pattern has persisted and is even 
more pronounced now. This bias also led to significant job loss 
in the greater Montreal area. For example, an official of the 
Public Service Alliance mentioned that he now represents only 
900 employees in the Montreal area where he used to speak for 
1,200 workers in 1978.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I leave you with the conclusion Claude Picher came to while 
reviewing the study conducted by Aéroports de Montréal, a 
study which concluded that the greater Montreal should keep 
both its airports. Mr. Picher said, and I quote: ``Hundreds of 
millions of dollars have been thrown in this venture which did 
nothing to improve the competitiveness of Montreal. Quite the 
opposite in fact, since the Mirabel fiasco is partly responsible 
for redirecting traffic to Toronto.''
<P>
	Since airports in Dorval, Mirabel, Edmonton and Vancouver 
were handed to non-profit corporations, why should we have 
something different for Toronto? Is it that what is good for the 
rest of the country is not good enough for Toronto? The 
government does not seem to want to answer to the requests 
made by the greater Toronto area, why is that so? Why does the 
government not entrust the management of Terminals 1 and 2 to 
a non-profit organisation immediately?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am very sorry, but I have to inform 
the hon. member that her time is up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, for more 
than two weeks, we in the Bloc Quebecois have been constantly 
raising what is now usually called the Pearson affair. We do not 
have to reinvent the wheel, we only have to use it properly.
<P>
	In other words, even if what I am about to say is not all new, it 
is important to repeat it until concrete action is taken on this 
problem. The aspect I wanted to underline concerns the popular 
financing of federal political parties. This debate is related to a 
motion presented in the House by my friend and colleague, the 
member for Richelieu. The reason for popular financing is so 
simple that even a child would understand it.
<P>
	You know, Mr. Speaker, if you are a student and your parents 
pay your rent, your dearest wish is to find a job so you can meet 
your own needs and do as you please. It  is easy to understand, 
you are indebted to your provider. In politics, it is exactly the 
same. The ultimate goal of any political party should be to be as 
independent as possible. The only way to reach this goal is to be 
financed by public contributions. We are elected by the people 
and are answerable to them. If our hands are tied by 
multinationals which finance us, our room to move will be very 
limited, particularly if the interests on the one side do not 
necessarily go together with those on the other. If financial 
reasons did not guide the actions of governments, people would 
pay more attention-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. As my hon. friend knows, you have a 
few minutes left for your speech. You will have the floor again 
after Question Period.
<P>
	It being two o'clock, pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the 
House will now proceed to Statements by Members, pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois would like to stress the importance of 
that event, because the CNTU has contributed over the years to 
fostering co-operation between all economic agents, and to 
consolidating collective values in Quebec.
<P>
	Since co-operation and joint action are required if we are to 
succeed in an economy where competition gets stronger by the 
day, the Bloc Quebecois praises the CNTU for its efforts in that 
direction and reminds the Minister of Human Resources 
Development that social contracts are not negotiated 
unilaterally, but collectively.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the impasse the Liberal government has reached 
in its co-operation with the Quebec government shows that 
Ottawa has much to learn from the CNTU.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, acts of 
violence across Canada have sparked further calls for a 
complete review of our justice system, in particular the Young 
Offenders Act. The slap on the wrist punishments handed down 
to young offenders are ineffective and far too lenient. Justice 
reform is needed desperately but Canadians have yet to see 
action from the government.
<P>
	As a result of the federal government's inaction the province 
of Alberta has taken the unusual step of reviewing federal 
legislation. Five MLAs will gather the opinions and suggestions 
of Albertans on how to make the Young Offenders Act more 
effective and present their findings in a final report in 
September.
<P>
	Justice rallies were held last weekend in Calgary and 
Edmonton with a turnout of approximately 5,000 people. It is 
frustrating to see what lengths honest law-abiding citizens and 
the Alberta government must go to in order to bring the 
government's attention to the fact that Canadians are deeply 
concerned about their safety.
<P>
	For the sake of all Canadians I sincerely hope the government 
is listening to Albertans.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERNATIONALYEAROFTHEFAMILY">INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE FAMILY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed 1994 as the 
International Year of the Family. However this is not as much a 
celebration as it is a warning.
<P>
	Over the last 20 years the percentage of families with both 
spouses working has increased from 34 per cent to  62 per cent, 
thereby reducing the amount of direct parental care. In addition 
each year over 20,000 unmarried women aged 12 to 19 give birth 
with the majority choosing to raise the children themselves. As a 
result most do not finish their education and are likely to 
become dependent on subsidized housing and welfare. Their 
offspring are at a higher risk of being premature or a low birth 
weight, more likely to experience difficulty in school, and more 
likely to become single parents themselves.
<P>
	Accordingly policies and legislation for strengthening the 
traditional family should be a primary concern to our 
government. As well employers and parents must also realize 
they have increased responsibilities to ensure that the family 
remains the basic unit of society.

Africa. Nelson Mandela invited all his fellow citizens to forget 
about the past and he called for their unity. He said and I quote: 
``We can have our differences, but we form one single people, 
with a common destiny within our rich variety of cultures, races 
and traditions.''
<P>
	In contrast with such remarkable developments and this 
lucidity, in Canada the Opposition Leader has told a radio 
audience that our differences were irreconcilable.
<P>

France cannot see the link between what is going on elsewhere

<P>
	This summer Ontarians will get advance notice of high smog

	The federal-provincial program informs people when high

which can affect the health of people and vegetation and can 
corrode various materials.
<P>
	Short term exposure to smog can irritate the nose and throat 
and can produce symptoms such as coughing and difficult or 
painful breathing. The advisory program is therefore very 
important for the well-being of all citizens.
<P>
	Smog advisories are issued the same way as weather forecasts 
through the media, Environment Canada, weather offices and 
weather radio. They focus on pollution prevention and 
recommend individual action to spare the air such as using 
public transit or car pooling and using fewer chemicals and 
solvents.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENT">UNEMPLOYMENT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. Last Friday, 
Statistics Canada reported that the national unemployment rate 
rose to 11 per cent in April, while the rate in Quebec increased 
from 11.7 per cent to 12.6 per cent. According to this latest 
report, 65,000 more  people have joined the ranks of the 
unemployed. These figures which are, to say the least, 
disconcerting, contradict the optimistic news that we have been 
hearing from the Prime Minister for the past month about lower 
unemployment and job creation.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that six months into his 
mandate, the unemployment rate continues to increase and his 
government has reneged on its promises, given that 65,000 more 
people have joined the 1.5 million who are already out of work?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since our government was elected, unemployment has not 
decreased as much as we would have liked. Just last month the 
situation had markedly improved, statistically speaking, but it 
has now changed. According to the reports, 60,000 people who 
had all but given up looking for work re-entered the job market.
<P>
	These were not people who had lost their jobs, but rather 
people who started looking again, believing they could find 
employment. It is a positive sign when people regain some 
confidence and get back into the labour force. We will continue 
to do our best. Our policies reflect this government's priority, 
which is job creation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is nothing encouraging about this response in that 
it does not reflect any willingness on the government's part to 
change the situation. The government seems to find these 
statistics positive, whereas the fact of the matter is-and these 
are not merely statistics but the reality of the situation-that if 
we compare the unemployment rate in November when this 
government came to power with the rate today, we see that there 
are 15,000 more people out of work.
<P>
	On the other hand, the government's only initiative, the 
infrastructure program, is clearly inadequate in terms of 
creating lasting jobs. Instead of taking it out on the unemployed, 
is the Prime Minister prepared to commit this time to 
implementing a real job creation strategy for the high-tech 
sector based on concrete initiatives?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
115,000 new jobs have been created in Canada since February. 
That is a fact. I have just explained to the Leader of the 
Opposition that some people who had likely given up looking 
for work quite some time ago had re-entered the job market. 
This is a positive sign that the job situation is rebounding. This 
morning's Toronto <I>Star</I> reported that the number of people on 
welfare in Toronto had declined considerably, while a 
significant number of persons had found jobs.
<P>
	This is an indication that our strategy, which is to focus on 
jobs, is working. There are those in Canada who believe that the 
economy is recovering. Economic indicators nationwide show 
that the growth rate will be greater than that forecast by the 
Minister of Finance. We must therefore stay the course set out in 
the budget.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="4054"> 4054 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister would have us believe that 
economic indicators are positive. He claims it is a positive sign 
that people are returning to the job market, that they are 
regaining some confidence.
<P>
	However, there are those who are able to work and cannot find 
a job. They are called the unemployed, and their numbers are 
increasing because of the policies of this government.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister, who says he is concerned, justify 
his government's decision to renege on its red book commitment 
to put forward a strategy for converting defence industries from 
military to civilian purposes when it is a known fact that this is 
the only strategy that would give dignity and hope back to 
people, as the Prime Minister said during the election 
campaign?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> This policy of 
helping some of the defence industry to work in new fields has 
been a policy of this government. We are looking at all the 
proposals. When there is a good one, we are happy to help.
<P>
	I would point out to the Leader of the Opposition that a lot of 
housing units were created last month and that the confidence of 
the people of Canada has increased by 13 per cent. It is a sign 
that we are on the right track. This development is not as fast as 
everyone in this House would like to see, but everybody 
recognizes that for 1994 Canada will outperform virtually every 
nation of the western world.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last Saturday, the daily <I>Le Devoir</I> was reporting that 
Bell Helicopter had decided not to go ahead with its $40 million 
investment plan to develop a new helicopter. You probably 
realize that this decision follows the about-turn of the federal 
government which now reneges on its commitment to set up a 
conversion program for defence industries.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that the cancellation of this 
expansion program at Bell Helicopter, which would have 
created 100 new jobs, is the direct result of the decision of his 
government not to participate in conversion activities through 
DIPP? Is the Prime Minister aware of the catastrophic 
consequences of that decision?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> I would like to say to the hon. member, through 
you, Mr. Speaker, that even though the province of Quebec has 
given partial approval on the Bell Helicopter project there has 
not been a final and  formal position taken by the board of Bell 
Helicopter right now. There will be no decision forthcoming 
until we hear that formal presentation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the minister not recognize that the decision not to 
proceed with a conversion strategy for defence industries will, 
in effect, threaten and jeopardize the activities in this important 
industrial sector which has already lost 10,000 jobs in Quebec 
since 1988? Will the Prime Minister tell the Minister of Industry 
to review his policy while it is still possible?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I again repeat to the hon. member 
that we did discuss this issue in debate last week and in fact we 
do have a strategy.
<P>
	Mind you, because of the very tight fiscal framework that we 
are involved with here it is not the old strategy where we just 
sort of write cheques. Right now we are using very creative 
approaches. We are giving advice and counsel and marketing 
assistance. In fact many companies under the previous DIPP 
program are now converting with assistance and guidance in 
new marketing techniques. There are many success stories. That 
will be the way that we will approach it.

<P>
	The Prime Minister may remember being in this House on 
October 7, 1971 when his colleague, Jean-Pierre Goyer, the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I watched with interest the 
reports of the rallies both in Calgary and in Edmonton on the 
weekend. Those rallies were attended by people who have 
genuine concerns that I respect. I read the reports of some of the 
things they were concerned about, including the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	As I have said to the House before, within weeks I am going to 
have a bill before this House to make changes to the Young 
Offenders Act that I think will fulfil commitments we made 
during the campaign and that I think will improve the statute.
<P>
	In so far as the safety of Canada is concerned we ran for 
election on a platform that I think is a balanced one which was 
intended very much to secure the safety of our communities 
across the country, in Alberta and everywhere else in this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Do you agree with the '71 change?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> In terms of the '71 change, I do not think that 
statement can fairly be applied to all legislation that has been 
through this House over the last 23 years.
<P>
	I think the answer to achieve safer communities in this 
country is to follow through on our election commitments which 
we intend to do, a balance between making the laws more 
effective and coming to grips with the root causes of crime and 
that is exactly what we intend to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what we are endeavouring to try to do is find out when our 
government policy fell off the rails and we started to put the 
rights of the criminal ahead of the rights of the victim. When 
was that particular moment?
<P>
	Today, 23 years after that infamous decision, what comes first 
to this Liberal government? I again ask the Prime Minister, is it 
the protection of society or the rehabilitation of individuals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Young Offenders Act 
contains in its statement of principles the primacy of the 
protection of society as an objective of that act.
<P>
	We in government believe that the protection of society is best 
achieved by a combination of laws that are effective and 
effectively enforced and social programs and government 
policies that are intended to get at not just harsher penalties and 
longer jail terms but the underlying causes of crime in society. 
Those are the objectives of this government in its mandate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again to the Prime Minister. Across this nation from one coast to 
the other Canadians are sick and tired of this mollycoddling of 
criminals at the expense of law-abiding citizens through this 
Cappuccino Liberalism.
<P>
	On October 7, 1971 the Government of Canada approached a 
fork in the road and took the wrong turn. The government chose 
to stress the rights of the criminal rather than the rights of the 
victim.
<P>
	My question for the Prime Minister is this. What specific 
steps will the government take to ensure that the rights of 
victims are paramount to the rights of criminals? What specific 
steps?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me make it clear, if I have 
not already, that I reject absolutely the characterization the hon. 
member has given to the policies of this government about 
preferring the rights of criminals to the rights of victims.
<P>
	This government is not interested in that kind of rhetorical 
exchange. The fact is we have an agenda of proposals in our 
platform which we are going to follow through with legislation 
in this House that is intended to achieve both an improved 
justice system and legitimate efforts toward crime prevention.
<P>
	I do not think it advances the discussion to characterize a 
statement from 1971 as what has been going on in the justice 
system in the last 23 years. The fact is we have made our agenda 
for legislation clear and we intend to follow through on it.

in opposition, Liberal members were dead set against Bill C-91, 
an act regarding drug patent protection. As a matter of fact, they 
all voted against it, except for the Minister of Finance, who was 
then the member for LaSalle-Émard.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said recently that he would not reopen this 
act. However, there is considerable pressure within his party to 
review Bill C-91 before 1997, and to give less protection to 
patent drugs.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister confirm that, in spite of the intense 
pressure within his party, his government will not review Bill 
C-91 before February 1997, as planned?

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
said clearly that we intend to abide by the legislation which was 
passed, but we must do our job, and make sure that the 
companies that promised to invest are doing so and, secondly, 
that they are honouring their commitment not to increase drug 
prices. It is also our duty to check that they are discharging the 
obligations they have towards the government.

too want stability in this country. If he wants to be of assistance,

questions.

recognize that, according to the Patented Medicine Prices 
Review Board, since Bill C-91 was enacted, the Canadian 
pharmaceutical industry has invested nearly 10 per cent of its 
revenues in R &amp; D and that drug prices have more or less 
followed the consumer price index since 1987?

taxes.
<P>
	Now that he is in government, can the Minister of Finance 
finally tell us if he intends to abide by the stands his own party 
had taken when in opposition and show some consistency by 
refusing to allow any tax, whether hidden or not, to be applied to 
food?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member 
knows full well, during the election campaign, we said the 
whole issue of the GST would be referred to the Finance 
Committee, which was done, and the committee is now 
preparing its report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, seeing 
that the reasons supporting the Liberal Party's position in 1989 
are still valid, does the Minister of Finance's failure to answer 
the question mean that he has changed his mind and wants to 
replace the GST with a hidden tax that would also apply to food?
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional

is that we intend to make good on our promise. We have kept our 
word by referring the issue to the finance committee on which 
opposition members sit. As you know, the committee will be 
presenting its report before long.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	I too had the opportunity to attend the rallies that were held in 
Calgary and Edmonton this weekend. There were thousands of 
voices crying out: ``If you do the crime, do the time''. I know 
that does not make sense to the group across the way but it does 
represent the voice of millions of Canadians.
<P>
	What I would like to know is will the Solicitor General 
declare a moratorium on paroling violent offenders until 
Parliament completes its review of this crucial issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
reviewed the legislation and I do not find anything in it which 
gives the Solicitor General the authority to declare a 
moratorium on any kind of work done by the parole board in 
deciding who may be entitled to a release.
<P>
	In fact, I ask the hon. member to consider whether he and his 
party really want the members of the parole board in their 
decisions to be subject to political direction or interference. I do 
not think they would really want that on reflection. I do not think 
the House would want that. I do not think the public would want 
that. In any event, the law does not give the Solicitor General 
permission to give the kind of order that he is seeking.
<P>
	I also want to add that the legislation talks about the 
protection of the public as a principle the parole board has to 
follow, and protection of the public is certainly the priority of 
the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first 
comment with regard to the fact we cannot do anything is a cop 
out. Second, I am really pleased to hear the Solicitor General say 
the safety of the people is of utmost importance.
<P>
	Therefore I urge the Solicitor General to consider this request 
carefully. With the parole moratorium for violent offenders 
future tragedies will more than likely be prevented. If a 
moratorium is not introduced is the Solicitor General prepared 
to be held accountable by the people of Canada for needless 
tragedies that will certainly occur?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have already pointed out that the legislation adopted by 
Parliament does not give the Solicitor General the authority to 
order such a moratorium. It is not a matter of a cop out. It is a 
matter of stating what the law says.
<P>
	However, I have said in the House and outside that it is the 
intention of the government to present legislation which will 
update and improve the parole and correction system. I look 
forward to the support of the hon. member  and his party in 
expediting that legislation when it comes before the House.

question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Many times in this House, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has championed consultation on the fisheries 
industry adjustment strategy, especially on the issue of 
individual contracts. However, on Saturday, his press secretary 
confirmed that the government would no longer require 
individual contracts:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is really no need for a separate contract.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My question is this: Did the minister not consult with the 
unions on the obligation to sign individual contracts, which in 
the words of the union president added unnecessary stress and 
pressure to the people and that as a result, he had to retreat?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that the 
hon. member is simply trying to stir a pot in which there is no 
tempest. Why try to create a problem when one does not exist?
<P>
	We are introducing a program of $1.9 billion to assist 30,000 
people to get a chance to go back to work and to find new 
careers.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	Each of those individuals, as part of the process, will sign an 
agreement that will commit the Government of Canada to 
provide all available resources to help them to be retrained, to 
start their own businesses, to develop projects in the 
environment, to enhance the fisheries. In return, each of those 
individuals commence becoming involved, being an active 
participant.
<P>
	That was a discussion that we started last February with the 
provinces. That is a discussion that we had with the unions. That 
is the same discussion we had on Friday when an official from 
my office met with members of the union and they agreed to the 
process.
<P>
	I do not understand for the life of me why the hon. member is 
getting so exercised about something that is clearly agreed to by 
all the parties and that will be to the benefit of all those in the 
fishing industry of Quebec and the Atlantic provinces.

the social contract is really being renewed?

rely on an article in the newspaper for my information. I deal 
directly with the people involved.
<P>
	As a result we get the information right. The right information 
is, as I have said previously, that every individual in the fishing 
industry in all the provinces involved will be signing an 
agreement as part of the overall plan in which they agree to put 
their own time and energy to helping themselves develop an 
active involvement in the labour market.
<P>
	In return we provide the resources to help them make those 
choices. It is an opportunity of mutual responsibility. It is an 
opportunity to develop a way that individuals can work together

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Yesterday the Ontario Association of Police Services Board 
said the one-year minimum sentence for using a firearm during 
the commission of an offence was no deterrent, describing the 
penalty as laughable.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to increase the minimum penalty

<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

more strictly those guns that are purchased in Canada and 
getting at the problem of weapons in the hands of criminals.
<P>
	In fact, we have under consideration now in the Department of 
Justice the question of whether the penalty under section 85(1) 
of the Criminal Code should be increased so that it is a greater 
deterrent and more effective.
<P>
	I have written to my counterparts in the provinces and 
territories. I have asked them to urge the crown attorneys in the 
courtrooms where these charges are prosecuted to ensure they 
are pressed with vigour, that they result in the appropriate 
sentences, and that the charges are not dropped as part of plea

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. Last Friday, the Minister of 
Transport said he delayed his decision concerning MIL Davie 
because he wanted to act in the best interest of Magdalen 
islanders and he needed MIL Davie's business plan. Yet, 
Magdalen islanders did say they wanted a new ferry and the 
federal government has had MIL Davie's business plan for a few 
weeks.
<P>
	Now that MIL Davie has met all the conditions set by the 
federal government, does the Prime Minister intend to act and 
award the contract for building the ferry to MIL Davie, rather 
than consider buying a used ship as the daily <I>Le Soleil</I> reported 
this morning?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I am convinced that when the hon. member reads last Friday's 
<I>Hansard</I>, he will realize that I never said that the Department of 
Transport delayed its decision because it was waiting for MIL 
Davie's business plan.
<P>
	Having said that, however, I must point out that two very 
important things are involved here: we must provide an 
adequate and safe service between Prince Edward Island and the 
Magdalen Islands, and we must solve the problems that MIL 
Davie will face at the end of the current contract for the frigates. 
We are very aware of what is at stake in both cases, and I want to 
assure the hon. member that the business plan submitted is being 
scrutinized by the appropriate departments and that we, in the 
Department of Transport, have always been prepared to 
participate in a solution which would meet both needs, as long as 
it is fiscally sound.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question for the Prime Minister. Will the Prime 
Minister recognize, as his chief of staff who ran unsuccessfully 
for the Liberals in Quebec City did, that the sustainable recovery 
of MIL Davie depends on the development and construction of 
the multipurpose smart ship? What does his government intend 
to do about this high-technology project which would be 
suitable for exportation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
as I said, the recovery of MIL Davie depends on a lot of things. 
Last week, when I met the Quebec Minister of Industry, along 
with my colleague, the federal Minister of Industry, it was 
obvious that the situation would be very difficult if the survival 
of MIL Davie were to depend solely on the construction of a 
ferry and  maybe a smart ship sometime in the future. That is one 
of the reasons why representatives of both the Quebec and the 
federal governments are doing their best to find a logical and 
responsible solution which would help to protect jobs at MIL 
Davie and provide a ferry service. This is a very complex issue.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	The matter is under study, but I want the hon. member to 
understand that no final decision has been made yet about the 
financial contribution of both levels of government, the ferry 
operator, and the contracts needed to make the smart ship 
construction project a viable initiative.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Last week the Minister of National Defence told Michel 
Cormier, on the public affairs program ``Le Point'': ``Some 
ministers are now renting private planes at huge costs to the 
departments rather than using the government Challenger jets''. 
The minister went on to admit that this practice is not cost 
effective and is done simply for appearance.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister confirm that his ministers have 
chosen the most expensive option imaginable, that is, renting 
aircraft while still maintaining the Challenger jets simply to 
avoid political pressure?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member cannot have it both ways. She claims that when 
a minister gets on board a government plane it costs $20,000 an 
hour. She is sticking to that and we are listening to them. If it is 
costing that much money, why use it? We are looking into this 
issue to make sure the real costs will be known.
<P>
	When the planes are not being used they still cost money. The 
pilots are still there. Reform Party members are so narrow 
minded on that and do not want to look at the facts. Now they are 
claiming because they are not objective they are causing the 
government to spend more money.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all 
let us make the Challenger jets for sale. Second, let us all use 
commercial airlines.
<P>
	Since 1985 the government has spent $11 million training 689 
technicians to service the Challengers. At the same time 
national defence has contracted out $12 million of maintenance 
to another firm. When Mr. Cormier added up all the costs of the 
Challenger program he confirmed the Auditor General's asser-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4060"> 4060 </A></B>
<P>
tion that the Challengers are almost three times more expensive 
than the Prime Minister cares to admit.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister stop fooling the Canadian 
people about the real costs of the Challenger jets? When will he 
accept the Auditor General's suggestion to drastically reduce 
the Challenger jet fleet?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are looking into this matter. There is a committee and the 
Auditor General. These planes are made in Canada and the 
government uses them. Canada is a vast country. Ministers have 
to move around the country if they want to do their jobs.
<P>
	Because of the irresponsibility of Reform Party members they 
do not want to look at the real costs. Even when the plane is in 
the garage we pay for the pilot, we pay for the plane, for 
everything. When the plane is flying the only other cost is the 
fuel, but they say it is costing much more money. That is why we 
are not using them. We are looking into that. We will make sure 
this is managed better than it was with the previous 
administration.
<P>

because it is not costing-

Minister of Justice, the Minister of National Revenue, the

activities?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no such official committee. Quite often, our ministers 
who work together meet to discuss certain problems, but we 
have significantly reduced the number of Cabinet committees in 
order to increase efficiency. A committee such as the one to 
which the hon. member referred does not officially exist.

assuming there is such a committee, since we are dealing here

question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Last week the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the 
government's appeal of the case involving the E and N Railway 
stating that the government had no constitutional obligation to 
run the line in perpetuity.
<P>
	Can the minister advise the people of Vancouver Island if he 
now intends to follow through with the earlier Tory decision to 
scrap VIA passenger service on the E and N?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my hon. colleague would know that the decision of the Supreme 
Court of Canada simply indicated there was not a constitutional 
obligation on the part of VIA to maintain that service. It did not 
relate to the continuation of the service; it simply stated there 
was no constitutional obligation.
<P>
	The review of services on Vancouver Island, as is the case 
across the country, will depend on what VIA can achieve faced 
with its budget constraints and the reality of the level of service 
across the country for passengers wishing to use VIA services.
<P>
	The answer to the question is that VIA in its good time will 
assess the viability of that line. Also, I am sure my hon. 
colleague knows that any abandonment of VIA service is subject 
to cabinet approval.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the minister for his answer but it is precisely that we on the 
west coast and Vancouver Island are trying to get at the facts 
here.
<P>
	Unfortunately the minister's department has refused a 
personal request for a copy of the contract between the people of 
Canada and CP rail and is now stalling again on our access to 
information request for this contract which would give us the 
information we need.
<P>
	Can the minister first explain why the people of Canada are 
being denied the right to see how their money is spent? Second, 
will he promise to enter into negotiations to turn the line over to 
local interests?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is going to be very important as we continue with this process 
of dealing with rail lines, both freight and passenger across the 
country, that people such as my hon. colleague understand what 
has to happen.
<P>
	First of all with respect to this particular situation, we will 
have to look and see why there has been any refusal to provide 
information that should be available to Canadians. I undertake 
to look into that.
<P>
	As far as the decision on whether VIA should continue to 
provide services on Vancouver Island, that is a decision that will 
be based on business principles, whether there is sufficient 
volume to be able to do it and to ensure that there are alternate 
means of travel as is the case when we deal with it right across 
the country.
<P>
	I want to point out to my hon. colleague that there are many 
parts of Canada already that do not enjoy VIA passenger 
services for all kinds of reasons, usually because those 
particular services were found to be too much of a drain on the 
Canadian taxpayers who, I have been under the impression since 
I came into this place for this session of Parliament, were the 
major concern of the members of the Reform Party, to try to treat 
the taxpayers as fairly as we can.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-22, an act respecting certain agreements concerning the 
redevelopment and operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before the hon. member for Frontenac 
resumes his intervention, I want to tell him that he has four 
minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
not want to sound like a discontented child, but it seems to me 
that I had more than four minutes left. I hope you will show 
some indulgence if I ever need a few seconds more.
<P>
	As I was saying earlier, a government is responsible to its 
electors first and foremost. Since we are elected by Canadians, 
we are responsible to them. If, in addition, we were to be bound 
hand and foot by the multinational corporations that are 
financing political parties, we would not have much room to 
maneuver, especially when the people's interests do not 
necessarily go hand in hand with those of the corporations.
<P>
	If financial considerations did not motivate those who govern, 
people would listen with greater attention to explanations of 
nebulous situations, as is the case here. Since they know 
perfectly well that corporations contribute to the electoral 
coffers of political parties, people put their fingers in their ears 
and do not want to hear anything. And rightly so, Mr. Speaker, 
rightly so.
<P>
	It is obvious that situations like that would not happen if 
people financing political parties were ordinary people, the 
electors, not the corporations investing where it is profitable for 
them.
<P>
	At this point, I would like to talk to you about the executive of 
the Bloc Quebecois for my riding, under the direction of Éric 
Labonté, Vincent Carrier, Raynald Paré and myself. We have 
visited or called most of our 2,049 members. Those are the 
people financing the Bloc Quebecois in the riding of Frontenac. 
As the member for Frontenac, I am accountable to my 
constituents who with their donation of $5, $10, $20 and, 
exceptionally, $100, will help us collect between $15,000 and 
$20,000 for the Bloc Quebecois. I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, 
that as the member for Frontenac, I owe absolutely nothing to 
the multinationals or to our big corporations. I am proud of my 
constituents, and I am proud of the members of my party who 
help us finance our election expenses.
<P>
	During the last election campaign, all Bloc Quebecois 
members in this House accepted contributions only from 
registered voters, not from interest groups or companies.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	We cannot blame the companies, because their purpose is to 
make a profit. However, we have a different situation when we 
look at the Liberal government and the groups to whom the 
political parties are accountable which are no longer the average 
citizen but the big multinationals.
<P>
	Since this government came to power, it has blamed the 
Conservatives for every peccadillo that might hurt the party. 
Now it has a chance to shed some light on a number of 
questionable procedures and to remedy the situation. Why has 
the Liberal government opposite, in the six months it has been in 
power, not done that?
<P>
	Is there more than meets the eye? Is it afraid of a commission 
of inquiry that would find out the real reasons behind the 
privatization of Pearson airport, the only airport that was 
profitable and self-financing? Why did it not privatize the other 
airports?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4063"> 4063 </A></B>
<P>
	No, they privatized the only one that was making money. As 
the farmers in my riding would say, they privatized the best milk 
cow. It was easy, you see. They sold the best milk cow to friends 
of the government. So they stuffed their pockets at the expense 
of the taxpayer.
<P>
	On the weekend I went to a meeting. There were 47 people 
there. The meeting was organized by the regional committee for 
the Thetford Mines region and was chaired by Nicole Jacques. 
Monsignor Couture, the archbishop of the diocese of Quebec 
City, was there, together with local authorities. These included 
the industrial commissioner, several mayors and the presidents 
of various interest groups in the riding of Frontenac.
<P>
	The purpose of the meeting was to discuss how to get Quebec 
out of the poverty cycle, and Saturday morning, several speakers 
blamed poor management. And we heard the same comment this 
afternoon.
<P>
	There was a question on the trips taken by ministers on 
government jets. My constituents wonder how the government 
can raise taxes and try to cut assistance to people who, 
unfortunately, have to go on welfare or on employment 
insurance, while the hon. member for Hull-Aylmer, spent 
nearly $170,000 of taxpayers money just so he could make a 
short ten-minute speech on good management in the public 
sector.
<P>
	People in my riding who live on the poverty line have trouble 
understanding this kind of poor management. It does not make 
sense that taxpayers have to pay for the government's mistakes. 
When the investors signed the contract, the Conservatives were 
on their way out. The investors were taking a calculated risk.
<P>
	Of course, there were Liberals as well as Conservatives 
among these investors. As you know, when there a buck to be 
made, people often set aside their political allegiance and, just 
to make sure they are not on the wrong side, they give to both. 
They gave as much to the Liberals as they did to the 
Conservatives.
<P>
	That way, they were guaranteed a place at the public trough. 
And you know perfectly well that when an investor gives $1 to a 
political party, it is in the hope of getting back not $5, but $100, 
$200 or even $1,000. It always sounds strange to me to hear 
about the Minister of Justice attending a $1,000 a plate dinner 
for 23 guests. Those people do not really pay $1,000. Besides, 
none of them earn $25,000 or $30,000.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	My time is already up, Mr. Speaker. I want to thank you for 
giving me a few minutes more since I had been interrupted 
before Question Period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleagues are saying: ``We are in for it''. Indeed, because it is 
an amazing not to say an ugly issue.
<P>
	This is a perfect example of an issue in which government 
officials involved have acted in such a way that doubt remains 
and will do so forever unless a public  inquiry takes place. Doubt 
as to the way this whole issue was dealt with. Doubt as to the 
dealings which may have occurred behind the curtains, behind 
the scenes, under the tables, in places where, unfortunately, the 
general public, our constituents, those who elect us are not 
allowed.
<P>
	We would like to be able to speak about government integrity, 
about transparency, honesty, justice, fairness of commercial 
transactions well conducted, about people who justly and rightly 
claim a profit, a transaction. Unfortunately, this transaction 
was, I dare say, thrown together in the twilight, in places where 
one does not know exactly who had what to gain. One does not 
exactly know what was the goal pursued by the previous 
government, even less so by the present government.
<P>
	What is astonishing with that deal-and I will not repeat the 
long list of friends of the Conservative government that has 
unfortunately grown longer with the list of friends of the Liberal 
government-is that the Prime Minister had announced firmly 
and clearly during the election campaign his intention to cancel 
that contract because, as he put it, it had been reached in an 
incorrect fashion and was benefitting friends of the government 
of the time. What a noble way to campaign by denouncing a 
government that unfortunately had its hands partly tied with 
regard to the signature of a contract as important as the 
privatization contract of Pearson Airport terminals 1 and 2.
<P>
	Despite the fact that the Prime Minister had virtuously 
announced during the election campaign his intention to review 
the whole deal, slowly and gradually friends of this government, 
people in the Liberal financial comunity, friends of the Prime 
Minister, friends of former colleagues, acquaintances, 
``sponsors'' are in direct contact not only with the Prime 
Minister but also with ministers of this government. This issue, 
which was dominated by Conservative ``sponsors'' who finance 
the Conservative Party, is now in the hands of Liberal 
``sponsors''.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the reasons the Prime Minister gave at one point 
for saying that the whole issue of Pearson Airport would be 
reviewed and the privatization of the airport would be cancelled 
because what had happened in this whole deal was ugly are still 
valid today. Nevertheless,-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Yes, that is what we are doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> The member from New 
Brunswick says: ``Yes, that is what we are doing.''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> That is what we are doing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4064"> 4064 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Yes. That is what they are doing, 
Mr. Speaker, except that a small, a very small clause in this bill 
gives the minister in charge all discretionary powers to pay 
financial compensation according to his own evaluation of the 
harm done to the one losing the contract.
<P>
	They propose a bill seemingly with the best of intentions, but 
if by chance you examine that bill further, if you analyze the 
situation thoroughly, you discover some hidden truths that are 
not very edifying.
<P>
	Friends of the Liberals, Liberal lobbyists, friends of the 
people in place have taken over that issue and now, beyond 
political parties, one can see in the Canadian financial world 
that some politically diverging financial interests are 
coincidentally linked to the same group of companies, the same 
group of persons.
<P>
	Now the government is asking us to terminate the contract for 
Pearson Airport and we want to be part of that, but the way this 
cancellation is being done is totally unacceptable. Here we have 
an unhoped-for opportunity to pass a law on lobbyists, to clarify 
the relationship that should exist between the government and 
professional lobbyists who intervene in that kind of case, but the 
Prime Minister will not seize it. He had promised a law on that 
question, he had promised to clarify the lobbyist issue, but all of 
the sudden it is out of the question.
<P>
	The second thing is that the ministers are giving themselves 
an unacceptable discretionary power, which will allow them to 
give, from time to time, compensation that they consider 
appropriate. We can see that in many different ways. The 
minister responsible will be able to decide who deserves 
compensation, how much and for what prejudice. This is a much 
too general discretionary power, when one considers that the 
compensation is going to go to people who are, I remind you, 
financing the activities of the party across the floor.
<P>
	Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, the kind of conflict of interest 
situation that minister is going to be in, considering that, for the 
survival of his party he must also raise money? He will have to 
negotiate on his own-that is without guidelines-and 
determine by himself the amount of compensation.
<P>
	This is unacceptable. I still have a minute, Mr. Speaker. If it is 
true that these people are full of good intentions, why is the 
government steadfastly refusing a public inquiry on the 
circumstances surrounding the Pearson Airport deal? If its 
hands are clean, which I am willing to believe, Mr. Speaker, 
since I do not assume it is ill-intentioned, if it has good 
intentions and did note enough irregularities or faults in that 
deal to warrant a bill cancelling the transaction, considering 
what it implies, if it is ready to give ministers the discretionary 
power to compensate those affected by the cancellation, if the 
question of the Pearson Airport is really that serious, there is 
only one question remaining: Why does it object to a public 
inquiry which would shed light on  the whole deal? The question 
begs an answer and it is up to the government to give it.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Bloc Quebecois refuses to support second reading of Bill C-22, 
an Act respecting certain agreements concerning the 
redevelopment and operation of Terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport, in Toronto. The principle behind 
the bill is flawed, because it does not include whatever measures 
need to be taken to make the work done by lobbyists more 
transparent.
<P>
	What we have to expose here is the questionable ways some of 
the political parties are financed. Except for the Bloc Quebecois 
and the Parti Quebecois in Quebec, all individuals and 
corporations can currently support political parties.
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, are proud, because we are the only 
ones who can claim that all of our financial supporters are 
individuals. By relying on $5, $10, $20 or sometimes higher 
donations, when we got lucky, we collected the money we 
needed to be elected to this House. You have to understand that it 
is not illegal to get financial support from big corporations and 
even mega-corporations, it is just dangerous. It is so dangerous 
in fact that, since April 26, this is all we have been dealing with, 
this contract for the privatization of the Pearson Airport in 
Toronto. This is a fine example of the secret power lobbyists 
have. Thanks to what? Mainly the financing of old political 
parties. As the old saying, which still holds true after all these 
years, goes: ``Never bite the hand that feeds you''.
<P>
	That saying applies to all members of this House, including 
members of the Bloc. However, with a funding arrangement like 
the one our party has, we could never propose transactions such 
as the Pearson deal. Why? Because the hand that feeds us is not 
the hand of businesses seeking ever higher financial summits, 
fearing neither clouds nor turbulence. The hand that feeds us is 
that of people who work hard to earn their salary, of unemployed 
people who are constantly looking for jobs, of senior citizens 
who want to be sure that their old age pension will not be cut and 
also of people who stay at home to take care of their children.
<P>
	The Toronto Pearson airport privatization project puts the 
government in what I would call a dangerous position. When I 
talk about political party financing, I relate that to Pearson 
Airport and also to the Moisie military base in my riding. Six 
years ago, in the riding I represent, we experienced a similar 
situation which caused quite a stir in this normally quiet area. Of 
course, it was on a smaller scale, but we can see that nothing has 
changed.
<P>
	To give you a brief history of what happened then, I will take 
you back to 1985, when the government of the day had to close 
the military base in Moisie. That closure  was very hard on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4065"> 4065 </A></B>
<P>
local economy because it meant the loss of over 200 military 
jobs and of over 40 civilian jobs.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	The town of Moisie, a small community near Sept-Îles, with 
about 1,200 residents at the time, saw its budget cut by 30 per 
cent, which is enormous for a small community. That 
represented a loss of several millions of dollars for the regional 
economy.
<P>
	In early 1986, the Department of Public Works called for 
tenders to dispose of the CFB Moisie as well as seven or eight 
other bases at the same time. So representatives of the town of 
Moisie and of Public Works Canada sat down together to set 
certain criteria. I will list a few of them that had priority, in the 
opinion of the town of Moisie.
<P>
	Job creation was important for us. It was also important to 
make sure that the company was financially sound, since a 
military base is more or less like a small town. It has absolutely 
everything that one could find in any town: bowling alleys, 
swimming pools, streets, water and sewer systems, churches, 
schools, everything. So it takes a lot of money to buy it and a lot 
of money for maintenance. For us, it was important to have a 
local developer. And it was important that the project help offset 
a long-term loss of earnings for the regional economy.
<P>
	In the winter of 1987, we finally got down to two developers 
who were bidding more or less the same amounts of money, but 
it was important for us that the spin-offs in the region be as 
interesting as possible. So, the town of Moisie was naturally in 
favour of a local developer, whereas the government was in 
favour of a developer from elsewhere, described by the office of 
the then Prime Minister, who happened to be the member of 
Parliament for the riding, as a good friend of the party. 
Therefore there was a small struggle about that.
<P>
	Of course, the town of Moisie did not wield as much power as 
the office of the Prime Minister. In the spring of 1987, 
negotiations came to a standstill. In the summer of 1987, the 
good friend of the party was forced upon the town of Moisie. 
That developer promised 35 permanent jobs and 15 seasonal 
jobs. What is the situation today, six years later? No permanent 
jobs and no seasonal jobs. However, 50 houses were sold for a 
net profit of more than one million dollars.
<P>
	When we go through the data to find out why, at the time, the 
Prime Minister's Office and the government insisted so much 
for that person to acquire the military base site, we realize that, 
during the 1984 election, the developer had provided to the 
party's fund $1,500 directly and heaven knows how much 
indirectly. That is awful. That has to stop.
<P>
	Quebec and Canada's taxpayers can no longer afford to favour 
to excess good friends of the party at the expense of regional 
economic development. With examples such as the Pearson 
contract in Toronto and the Moisie military base, it is easy to 
imagine how many  such dubious transactions there must be, 
transactions which, instead of serving those who pay their taxes, 
shamefully favour those who, on the contrary, constantly try to 
avoid paying them.
<P>
	Yes, the Pearson transaction must be denounced, but it is not 
enough for the government to pass a bill such as Bill C-22 to 
pretend that it is doing its job. Pontius Pilate also washed his 
hands of the matter. Mature and responsible people will see to it 
that a mechanism is put in place to ensure that the real leaders of 
the country are those who are democratically elected by the 
population, and not those who pull the strings of some elected 
officials that are too well placed.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois says no. We want a royal commission to 
get to the bottom of this obscure matter. The Canadian people 
have the right to know all about the hidden side of that affair and 
the role that lobbyists played and continue to play with the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, several 
questions remain unanswered regarding Bill C-22, an act 
respecting certain agreements concerning the redevelopment 
and operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. Pearson 
International Airport. The thorough study of this bill and the 
privatization agreement entered into at Pearson airport are very 
important to us, since it has become such a controversial matter.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	This bill contains blatant contradictions with the 
commitments made by the Liberals during the campaign. They 
seem to have forgotten their commitment about restoring the 
confidence of citizens in the political institutions, even though 
they wrote an entire chapter on the subject in the red book. We 
are confused by their attitude. Therefore, we believe it is 
relevant to remind them of the promise they made to Canadians 
during the last campaign, which is, and I quote: ``A Liberal 
government will take a series of initiatives to restore confidence 
in the institutions of government''. And further, they wrote, and 
I quote: ``We will follow the basic principle that government 
decisions must be made on the merits of a case rather than 
according to the political influence of those making the case. We 
will take an approach of openness in decision making''. To win 
public confidence, you need to take some concrete measures but 
unfortunately the population is still waiting.
<P>
	Clause 10 of Bill C-22 gives the minister in charge the 
discretionary power to sign agreements in order to pay 
compensation pursuant to the legislation. Furthermore, we are 
told no compensation will be paid for paper profits that never 
materialize or for lobbying. How can the public be certain such 
compensation payments will be made according to the 
legislation and be entirely free of any favouritism? Just from 
looking at it, and without investigating any further, one can see 
that this case reeks of political manipulation; we are not the ones 
to say 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4066"> 4066 </A></B>
<P>
so, it is the opinion of the Nixon report author who had  neither 
the resources nor the time to complete a comprehensive inquiry.
<P>
	That is why we maintain that the only way to ensure 
transparency in this case is to form a royal commission of 
inquiry which would shed light on the whole issue. The Minister 
of Transport himself said, as quoted in <I>La Presse</I> of last 
November 29, that the federal government intended to form a 
royal commission of inquiry on the privatization of the Pearson 
airport. Unfortunately, the government did not follow up on that 
project which, need I remind you, would be essential to the 
demonstration of proper public funds management. What do 
Liberals want to hide? We cannot remain idle in front of such an 
attitude. Where is the promised transparency? What happened to 
the noble Liberal promise?
<P>
	A royal commission of inquiry remains the only efficient way 
to bring things up to date in this case which has all the makings 
of a scandal. Illegal acts must be brought out in the open. Why 
are the Liberals not taking any action? Whom do they want to 
protect? Why not follow up on their project to establish an 
inquiry commission? Such a commission could bring out in the 
open illegal or unacceptable actions. In such cases, it would not 
be necessary for the minister to pay compensation. In other 
words, section 10 of Bill C-22 would be irrelevant. One must 
also keep in mind paragraph 8.6.3 of the contract.
<P>
	We are speaking now about public funds, about the taxpayers' 
money. We cannot stand idle while the government refuses to 
act. As the Minister of Transport said so eloquently in his speech 
of April 26 about the Pearson Airport privatization, and I quote: 
``We believe matters that could significantly affect our economy 
and our competitive position as a nation should be decided in an 
open and accessible process''. Which process could be more 
open and accessible than a royal commission of inquiry? How do 
the Liberals plan to shed light on this deal?
<P>
	Regarding compensation, Bill C-22 seems to make an 
exception of lobbying. If I may, I want to remind the House that 
lobbying services are already tax deductible.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, taxpayers already paid part of the expenses 
supported by the companies which used such services. Nobody 
should be conned into believing that the shell games, all too 
common in this case, will not cost a penny to taxpayers. On the 
contrary, all the political connections that came to the fore lead 
us to predict that there will be much waste of public funds.
<P>
	There are more than Conservative lobbyists and key figures 
involved in this. There are also lobbyists and money-men for 
the other big party, as it likes to be called. Clearly, this deal was 
put together by people from the two rival parties. If the minister 
exercises his discretionary power it will cast a dark shadow on 
the government and this House. Without a royal commission  of 
inquiry Quebecers and Canadians will never be certain of the 
integrity of their government. This is a far cry from the openness 
the Liberal Party promised the people.
<P>
	Moreover, without a commission, it is quite possible that 
innocent people could be painted with the same brush as the 
others. The fact that the government refuses to shed light on this 
affair will tarnish the reputation of all the people involved. The 
government cannot act like nothing happened, like it did not 
have any suspicion regarding the integrity of some of the 
stakeholders. A public inquiry would restore, among ordinary 
citizens, confidence in the honesty of the system.
<P>
	To conclude, I wish to underline the controversy which 
surrounds this whole affair. True, friends of the previous 
government are involved, but some people very close to the 
present government have also a hand in this sordid mess. 
Quebecers and Canadians have the right to get to the bottom of 
this saga. That would be transparency, not the kind we talk about 
but the kind we live everyday of our lives; the kind people 
expect of their elected representatives and that would help 
restore people's confidence in their government.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians are tired of playing games with 
their governments. It is their money which is at stake. Let us put 
an end to political manoeuvring and dirty tricks, whether real or 
apparent. People have the right to know. It is fundamental. A 
democratic country, which takes pride in its Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms, cannot afford to put a lid on this whole thing. The 
only way to get to the bottom of the Pearson Airport 
privatisation deal is to order a royal commission without further 
delay. In view of the fact that voter confidence for their elected 
representatives is the cornerstone of democracy, it is 
unacceptable to allow the minister in charge to pay any 
compensation as long as all the ins and outs of this deal have not 
been made public through an independent and impartial process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 
3, the House of Commons rejected the amendment of the Reform 
member for Simcoe Centre.
<P>
	Although my colleagues in this House made this decision, I 
will now try to convince them to pass the amendment proposed 
by the Leader of the Official Opposition, whereby a royal 
commission of inquiry would shed light on the circumstances 
surrounding the signing of the contract between the government 
and T1 T2 Limited Partnership.
<P>
	As I pointed out in my last speech, Bill C-22 contains 12 
clauses. We find it impossible to agree with one in particular, 
namely Clause 10(1) authorizing the Governor in Council to pay 
T1 T2 Limited Partnership such amounts as considered 
appropriate in connection with the coming into force of this act, 
subject to the terms and conditions considered appropriate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4067"> 4067 </A></B>
<P>
	When I say I cannot agree with clause 10(1), I am also 
confident that the people I represent would not agree with a 
party refusing to shed light on disturbing facts, when the Liberal 
Party of Canada claims to be transparent and to protect the 
interests of taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal Party of Canada now in office made the decision 
to cancel the privatization of Pearson Airport because it knew 
the facts that led the former Conservative government to sign 
this agreement.
<P>
	Most of these facts have been confirmed by the Nixon report. 
This government is also aware that it did not give the Nixon 
commission enough time to uncover all the facts behind this 
peculiar decision by the Conservative government.
<P>
	They still uncovered enough to allow the current government 
to end the scandal and give back to the Canadian people an asset 
that belonged to them.
<P>
	Why would the Liberal government now spoil things by 
granting an organization compensation for losses and damages 
that are not clearly identified? Why would it refuse the public 
the right to know how lobbyists acted, people who we rightly 
thought we were getting rid of along with the Conservative 
government? Why would it assume the right to distribute our tax 
money to an organization that may have no legal right to it?
<P>
	Although the Prime Minister thinks that he is still popular, he 
can be sure that he will lose his popularity, what remains of it, if 
he takes this action that is fraught with consequences. We will 
not be shy about reminding the people that this government 
refused to allow a royal commission of inquiry in order to hide 
from the people the doings of the former Conservative 
government and perhaps of some lobbyists close to the Liberals 
now in power.
<P>
	This is in order to protect the friends of the Conservative 
regime, which could lead people to believe that the two 
traditional parties have the same friends. We will not be shy 
either about letting the people know the reasons for which the 
Leader of the Official Opposition called for such an inquiry. 
They are numerous and I will give some:
<P>
	First, the present government itself administers the Toronto 
airport through the Department of Transport, instead of 
entrusting it to a non-profit organization, as in Montreal, 
Calgary, Vancouver and Edmonton, where the managing 
authorities are made up of community representatives who are 
therefore able to defend their interests.
<P>
	I give the Montreal airports authority as an example. It 
administers Montreal's two airports and its board is made up of 
seven representatives of the business community, who are also 
on the board of the corporation that promotes Montreal's 
airports, SOPRAM.
<P>
	The eighth member is the chairman and chief executive 
officer of Montreal airport authorities. It is also  interesting to 
note that SOPRAM is a non-profit organization, whose 21 
members are appointed by the following: the City of Montreal, 
the City of Laval, the conference of suburban mayors, the 
Chambre de commerce du Montréal métropolitain, the Board of 
Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, the corporation for promoting 
Mirabel airport (COPAM), the Société montérégienne de 
développement (SMD), and the City of Longueuil. This 
representation ensures that the Montreal airport authorities have 
an approach which is sensitive to local interests, and which is 
deep-rooted in business.
<P>
	Second, we are asking for a commission of inquiry because, 
on reviewing the Nixon report, we noted that the time frame for 
the call for tenders was surprisingly short, namely 90 days, 
which made it impossible for groups not already involved in the 
management of the airport, as Claridge and Paxport were, to 
come up with a competitive bid. That explains why only two 
bids were received. Indeed, Paxport had already submitted a 
privatization proposal in 1989, which it had had to withdraw, 
and Claridge was operating terminal 3.
<P>
	Third, why was the contract signed on October 3, 1993, in the 
midst of the election campaign, and after the chief negotiator 
expressed reservations and demanded written instructions 
before signing?
<P>
	Fourth, what was the precise role played by lobbyists, and 
whom did they approach? Fifth, how much did Canadians have 
to pay for this hasty decision, and who benefited from it? Sixth, 
why did the Conservative government want to privatize Pearson 
Airport considering that it is the most profitable airport in 
Canada?
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Seventh, why did the government allocate T1 T2 Limited 
Partnership a rate of return of 24 per cent before taxes, and 14 
per cent after taxes?
<P>
	Eighth, why does the Nixon Report recommend no 
compensation for lost opportunities and lobbyists' fees? Did 
Mr. Nixon uncover even more irregularities than we know of?
<P>
	Ninth, what was the role of some stakeholders with close ties 
either to the Conservative Party or to the Liberal Party of 
Canada?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4068"> 4068 </A></B>
<P>
	Tenth and last reason-but more could be found-why this 
Liberal government did not include in Bill C-22 a clause 
authorizing the transfer of the Pearson Airport management to a 
non-profit corporation?
<P>
	These are a few of the reasons why a royal commission of 
inquiry is required, to make an informed decision. It is essential 
that this commission show clearly the impact lobbyists have had 
in this matter. It will look into the costs to the public purse, 
employment implications in the greater Toronto area and impact 
on transportation in Canada in particular.
<P>
	These are but a few of the reasons we will clearly set out to the 
people to make them realize this government should have 
allowed a royal commission of inquiry to be held if it was 
rejecting the amendment put forward by the Official Opposition.
<P>
	The House will notice, based on the evidence provided, what a 
far-reaching decision the federal government has made in 
cancelling the privatization contract and putting back in the 
hands of the people of Canada the control of one of the means of 
transport essential to Canadian industry and economic 
development.
<P>
	As I said earlier, and I am saying it again, let us not spoil the 
whole business by paying compensation to friends of the 
regime. Instead, let us invest that money in the transport 
industry, whether air, rail or water transport. And I am quoting 
examples of which the Minister of Transport will approve, I am 
sure.
<P>
	The Jean Lesage International airport is in dire need of 
financial support to be international in more than name only. 
Over the last few months, our party has asked several times in 
this House that the radar control facility at the Quebec City 
airport remain in operation and serve as a back up for Montreal's 
system, in case of a breakdown. Moreover, Quebec City airport 
needs investments to improve its infrastructure and adequately 
serve our provincial capital which, we hope, will host the Winter 
Olympic Games in 2002.
<P>
	The marine transport sector would also be pleased to receive 
the compensation which the government is about to pay to T1 T2 
Partnerships and use it to have a safe ferry built by the best 
people in the trade, MIL Davie's employees, in Lauzon, for the 
proud Magdalen islanders. This compensation could also be 
used to build the so-called ``smart ship'', which would do so 
much for MIL Davie's recovery, while also helping Canada to 
fulfill its role in international peacekeeping missions.
<P>
	Also, I cannot help but mention again what would be the 
greatest achievement, namely the construction of a high speed 
train line. Given the statement made by VIA Rail's president, I 
am convinced that he would gladly accept that compensation to 
launch this prestigious project. The Minister of Transport is 
delaying his answer by arguing that he is consulting with the 
provinces and that a report will be tabled in June. Does the 
minister intend to wait until the House recesses for the summer? 
It would be unacceptable if the elected representatives of  this 
House did not make a decision on a project of that magnitude. 
We do hope that we misread the minister's intentions and that a 
bill will be tabled in early June.
<P>
	I will conclude by discussing the amendment proposed by the 
Leader of the Opposition to Bill C-22, and by reminding hon. 
members of the importance of the vote which will be taken in a 
few hours. If we are to keep some level of credibility-and I do 
say ``some'' level of credibility, since Canadians are more and 
more losing confidence in their politicians, as I am told during 
the week-ends, while I am working in my riding, by my 
constituents who say that, from what they can see on television, 
the House of Commons proceedings are turning into a real circus 
and politicians are no longer credible-we must show that we 
are not afraid of transparency and do everything we can to make 
our work more transparent. What better than an unbiased royal 
commission of inquiry to do so? This is the kind of initiatives 
that will allow us to govern with the support of the people when 
we have tough choices to make.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Even with a majority in the House, the government cannot 
afford to dismiss the fair demands made by the Official 
Opposition, because its popularity rating outside Quebec could 
melt away like snow and turn into an angry outcry the Liberal 
government will remember for a long time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> You can be sure, Mr. 
Speaker, that I am pleased to speak for the second time on Bill 
C-22, an act respecting certain agreements concerning the 
redevelopment and operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport, in Toronto.
<P>
	The Pearson Airport is the biggest airport in Canada, with 20 
million passengers yearly, that is some 57,000 daily. It occupies 
1,792 hectares, includes three terminals and employs 15,000 
people. Some 800 aircraft land every day at Pearson and take off 
for 300 destinations in 60 foreign countries. This is the only 
Canadian airport that can be considered a true crossroads.
<P>
	According to a 1987 Transport Canada study, Pearson has a $4 
billion direct economic impact on the economy of the province 
of Ontario and was directly and indirectly responsible for over 
56,000 Ontario jobs. It is by any estimation more than the sum of 
its parts or the total of its assets and liabilities. It is a critical 
national gateway and a hub service to travellers, families and 
shippers. It cannot be duplicated by any other facility in the 
area, indeed the province or the country, although Vancouver is 
getting there and Montreal has the potential. This combination 
of its economic and social importance to the region, the 
province and the country, and the fact that it is a unique service 
for which there is no alternative, transforms the airport, in my 
opinion, from a simple transportation facility into one of the 
most important public assets in the southern Ontario and 
Canadian economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4069"> 4069 </A></B>
<P>
	After all the speeches we in the Official Opposition made on 
the subject, you surely know that our biggest reservation about 
the bill, indeed our strong protest, relates to clause 10, which 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>10.(1) If the Minister considers it appropriate to do so, the Minister may, with 
the approval of the Governor in Council, enter into agreements on behalf of Her 
Majesty to provide for the payment of such amounts as the Minister considers 
appropriate in connection with the coming into force of this Act, subject to the 
terms and conditions that the Minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the problem. You also know by now that the opposition 
supports the cancellation of this shocking contract because there 
are many reasons to do so. What convinced me, I must say in all 
humility, is the Nixon report that I read in full several times. I 
understood why Mr. Nixon, Liberal as he is-and an honourable 
man, close to the circles we are talking about, including the 
Prime Minister's friends-because of his fairness and his sense 
of responsibility, had no choice but to talk about ``manoeuver''.
<P>
	A careful reading of his report shows why he used such strong 
language. In Webster's New World Dictionary, ``manoeuver'' is 
defined thus:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To manipulate or scheme.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So this is indeed strong language.
<P>
	I would like to bring to the attention of the House some 
excerpts from the report that are very informative and illustrate 
the cloudy, obscure and shocking nature of this affair.
<P>
	As we in the Official Opposition have repeated on many 
occasions, we need a royal commission of inquiry to determine 
whether or not there were shady dealings involved.
<P>
	For example, on page 5, there is a short paragraph that gives 
us a hint on the scheming. Scheming is the common thread that 
runs through the entire Nixon Report. Let me quote the 
following paragraph:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the calculation of gross revenue (on which rent will be based), there are 10 
deductions which I am advised are unusual in commercial transactions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Nixon also goes on to say that T1 T2 Limited Partnership, 
which would oversee the airport's administration, is a multiple 
rather than a sole purpose corporation.
<P>
	According to Mr. Nixon:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The lease does not restrict the freedom of T1 T2 Limited Partnership to carry 
out an undertaking other than the management, operation and maintenance of 
Terminals 1 and 2. Therefore, the financial health of T1 T2 Limited Partnership 
could be adversely affected by the financial failure of a venture which has 
nothing to do with the management, operation and maintenance of Terminals 1 
and 2.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	With respect to passenger traffic, the report states the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Government of Canada undertakes not to permit development of any 
airport facility within 75 km of the T1 T2  complex that would reduce passenger 
traffic at Pearson by more than 1.5 million persons per year, until the volume of 
passenger traffic at Pearson reaches 33 million people per year. Present 
projections predict this number to be reached by approximately the year 2005. If 
the Government of Canada chooses to engage in such proscribed development-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The scheming is clear, as is the understanding between those 
who are close to and exert undue influence on the government.
<P>
	Another interesting and revealing point is worth citing:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>About the end of September 1993, T1 T2 Limited Partnership represented to 
the Government that it had entered into 10 contracts with non-arms length 
parties-</BLOCKQUOTE>
therefore parties with ties to the project, Mr. Speaker-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-prior to October 7, 1993. One of these was said to be a construction 
management agreement with Matthews Construction. This information was not 
publicly disclosed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We must know that Matthews is directly involved. It is a party 
to the whole deal and closely linked to Paxport's operations. It 
goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After permitting the privatization of Terminal 3 at Pearson, the process to 
privatize Terminals 1 and 2, the remainder of the largest airport in Canada, is 
inconsistent with the major thrust of the policy of the Government of Canada 
announced in 1987.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is under this policy that the government rejected the offer 
made in 1989-90 by the same players. Time and undue influence 
having done their job, the government showed a great deal of 
interest in 1993, and we know what happened.
<P>
	Another very important finding of the Nixon report concerns 
the proposal submission time frame:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The RFP having as it did only a single stage and requiring proponents to 
engage in project definition as well as proposal submission and, all within a 90 
day time frame-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As we know, even with a $700 million investment, people 
have only 90 days to decide. I now continue with the quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-created, in my view, an enormous advantage to a proponent-</BLOCKQUOTE>
namely Paxport. That is what I call scheming, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Nixon goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-that had previously submitted a proposal for privatizing and developing 
T1 and T2.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is why, Mr. Speaker, given everything surrounding this 
deal, we are surprised, first, that the report itself does not make 
that suggestion and, second, that the Prime Minister and the 
Liberal Party, despite all its claims to transparency in the red 
book, did not do it. A royal commission of inquiry must be set up 
to shed light on this shocking event that, in my opinion, brings 
shame to Canada and its institutions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4070"> 4070 </A></B>
<P>
	I remind my friends opposite that the Liberal red book 
emphasizes in several places the need to restore people's trust in 
their government by making it more transparent. Disturbing 
facts in this case lead us to question the transparency of the 
Liberal government and the previous government as well as the 
legitimacy of any decision to compensate the businesses 
involved. The Lobbyists Act is a key element of this 
transparency. I will close by quoting an excerpt from chapter 6 
of the red book dealing with the question of transparency and 
lobbying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most important asset of government is the confidence it enjoys of the 
citizens to whom it is accountable. If government is to play a positive role in 
society, as it must, honesty and integrity in our political institutions must be 
restored.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, during the 
last election campaign which led to the formation of this 
Parliament, our government colleagues travelled across the 
country waving their philosophy manual, better known as the 
red book. Making all kinds of promises in their speeches, our 
colleagues were particularly keen on promising all Quebecers 
and Canadians that a Liberal government would restore integrity 
to our political institutions-red book, chapter 6.
<P>
	The essence of that promise was a formal commitment to 
giving our country a government that would be more 
transparent, a government that would not play cat and mouse 
with taxpayers, a government made up of people who would 
preach by example and give back to Canadians the confidence 
they had lost in their elected representatives. I heard the Prime 
Minister make that kind of statement in a formal tone that would 
leave absolutely no doubt in anybody's mind. I heard him say 
very convincingly that his government would clean up the way 
politics are played in our country and would stay away from all 
the questionable practices that we had grown accustomed to 
under the Conservative government.
<P>
	Now, it seems to me that the Pearson airport privatization deal 
is a golden opportunity for the government to follow up on its 
election promises. The influence exerted by friends of the 
government in this deal gives the present government the chance 
to fulfil its commitments. If it does not seize this opportunity 
right now, does that mean that it will not keep the promises of 
integrity and transparency made during the election campaign? 
Why is the government refusing to get to the bottom of this 
matter? If we have any respect for taxpayers, we have to tell 
them how their money is spent, who makes the decisions and in 
whose interest. If we do not agree, and rightly so, on a matter 
such as the Pearson Airport deal, we have to say why we do not. 
If we fear that there have been some shady dealings, we should 
not avoid the subject.
<P>
	On the contrary, we have to face up to it so that leniency does 
not resurface in the future and we do not  fall into the same traps. 
Quebecers and Canadians have the right to know about this, not 
just a small part of it, from a government that refuses to talk 
about it and is quick to evade its responsibilities by trying to ram 
through Bill C-22. We have to get right to the bottom of this 
matter through a genuine commission of inquiry and leave it to 
the House to determine, after the inquiry, whether compensation 
is appropriate or not.
<P>
	I am rising in this House to tell you so because, as members of 
Parliament, we have to denounce the actions of some members 
of the political class of this country. More particularly, we have 
to denounce the quasi-incestuous practices that are part of the 
culture of persons who daily try to influence government 
decisions.
<P>
	Using every lever at their disposal, from childhood 
friendships to favours done, right through electoral organizing 
and political party financing, these persons contribute to trade 
public interest for private good and, sadly, contribute to relegate 
the role of duly elected Parliamentarians to a position of 
secondary importance. I rise therefore in this House with this 
bitter aftertaste left by Bill C-22, by the nebulous aspect of the 
Pearson Airport privatization matter that seems to involve 
lobbyists, politicians, former officials and friends of the 
government.
<P>
	The investigation into the Pearson airport issue should not be 
restricted to the debate on Bill C-22. The government is making 
a mistake by refusing to go to the bottom of this issue. By simply 
repressing the whole matter and granting under clause 10 
generous compensation payments that it wants to set as it 
pleases behind closed doors and without consultation with 
parliamentarians, is the government revealing the real truth to 
the Canadian people and the Quebec people, a truth which is 
quite different from what we read in the red book about a code of 
ethics and lobbyists? Have the powerful lobbyists that hound the 
government already managed to change its mind? I hope not. 
The government is faced here with a perfect situation where it 
can demonstrate its good will, propose a new way of dealing 
with government business, and restore in the population a 
minimum of trust for the political class.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	At a time when all surveys and opinion polls indicate that 
people mistrust and have little respect for their political leaders, 
should we not face the old demons that dwell in the back rooms 
of government and give the people what it wants, that is 
openness and the simple, plain truth? The Pearson airport issue 
is the perfect opportunity for that exercise, and I am sure that 
with a free vote, all members would act acording to their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4071"> 4071 </A></B>
<P>
conscience and lean towards openness, parliamentary 
legitimacy and restriction of ambitions.
<P>
	It is the government's duty to launch a public inquiry into the 
privatization of the Pearson airport. If it refuses to do so, it will 
be remiss in its duty, it will break its electoral commitments and 
pardon the ways of the Conservatives in order to better follow 
them. Quite clearly, the only thing that will have changed is a 
few of the people at the trough.
<P>
	I would like to give you a little bit of background, Mr. 
Speaker. Mr. Nixon wrote in his report that the Pearson airport 
privatization is an obvious example of political manipulating, 
improprieties and manoeuvering. Whence the importance, if we 
have nothing to hide or to protect, of fully examining this matter 
so that it can serve as an example and ensure that such a situation 
does not happen again.
<P>
	In 1987, when the federal government announced a new 
management policy for Canadian airports, it did so mainly to 
involve local authorities in airport affairs and sites 
development. Such was the case for Vancouver and Montreal, 
among others, where non-profit organizations manage airport 
installations. In Toronto, however, things were quite different. 
Is it because Pearson Airport was Canada's most profitable 
airport? In this era of sacro-sanct economic liberalism, why let 
the government manage a profitable facility when there are so 
many that are not profitable within its reach?
<P>
	Far from protecting the public interest, the transaction 
occurred right in the middle of an election campaign to the 
benefit of the only two bidders, two former competitors now 
united to make a profit. Paxport Inc., whose bid was selected by 
the government without any financial analysis, could not get 
enough money to complete the transaction for terminals 1 and 2. 
Paxport Inc. joined with Claridge Inc., which already controlled 
terminal 3, through the Pearson Development Corporation. This 
alliance was sealed in the T1 T2 Limited Partnership. And there 
you have it. Pearson Airport, a very profitable airport, was 
completely privatized in the hands of the same group.
<P>
	We in the Official Opposition are not attempting to launch a 
witch hunt or to bring back the rules of the Grand Inquisition. 
We simply want to get right to the bottom of the issue and 
regulate certain types of questionable practices that have no 
place in our parliamentary system.
<P>
	When we analyse the disturbing facts referred to in the Nixon 
Report, we cannot just forget about this issue, as the government 
is doing with Bill C-22.
<P>
	In his report, Mr. Nixon refers to political manipulation, 
which is a serious observation. Are we going to keep moving in 
that direction and give the minister, under section 10, a blank 
cheque for the payment of compensations as he sees fit to do? 
The Nixon report shows that lobbyists in the financial 
community really tried to take us all for a ride, taxpayers of 
Quebec and Canada, in that project. Are we going to help them 
do it again?
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	No, Mr. Speaker, the taxpayers have already paid too much 
and moreover, they must know why. Therefore, we must reject 
Bill C-22 and quickly set up a royal commission of inquiry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, finally I am rising after many 
months on a point of order that has to do with references made 
by hon. members in the Bloc Quebecois to Canada and to 
Quebec as separate entities.
<P>
	In fairness, I do understand the wish of the Bloc to separate 
from Canada. However it is also not permitted in the House for 
members to indicate any information which they know is not 
true or is somehow misleading.
<P>
	I would therefore simply ask the Chair if it would please rule 
on whether Canada in fact includes Quebec today and whether 
the language the member has used is in fact inappropriate in the 
House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the same point of order, if you 
intend to rule on this matter, I would appreciate it if you would 
also give us some indication of how we should behave and what 
words we should use in the House, because I would like to know 
whether it is wrong to mention the words Canada and Quebec. 
Does this mean, Mr. Speaker, that in this House, we can no 
longer use the word Quebec? If that is the case, let us be frank 
and forthright about it. If the hon. member wants us to stop 
talking about Quebec in this House, he should say so. I am not 
saying we will change, but at least we will know what he thinks.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I see I will have to watch what I say in 
both languages.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is very evident that one can get up and refer to Alberta and 
Canada or Quebec and Canada and certainly the Speaker will 
never rule that a member cannot use whichever language he or 
she chooses to use.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So this is a matter for debate, and I respect the hon. member's 
sincerity in making his point, but I think it is quite clear that in 
this House we have the right to use the term that was used.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-22 is part of the pendulum process which has 
become a tradition with successive governments. The 
Conservatives privatize, and the Liberals deprivatize. Each step 
costs the Treasury money and provides goodies for a few 
friends. The bill before the House today says that the Minister of 
Transport will play Santa Claus, but it does not offer any 
information on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4072"> 4072 </A></B>
<P>
kind of management the government is planning for Pearson 
airport. Will it be a local authority? A crown corporation? The 
Department of Transport? Who knows!
<P>
	Without wishing to take sides, I can say that the management 
of Montreal Airport by a local authority has proved satisfactory. 
Aéroports de Montréal is the name of the corporation which has 
been responsible for the management of Dorval and Mirabel 
since 1989.
<P>
	Originally, we had the Société de promotion des aéroports de 
Montréal, also known as SOPRAM. This advisory body, created 
in 1987, consists of 21 members belonging to seven 
organizations in the community, including municipalities and 
chambers of commerce. Each organization delegates one elected 
representative, one permanent member and one person from the 
business community. The seven members of the business 
community constitute the Board of Directors.
<P>
	For instance, among the seven organizations that are 
represented, we find the Corporation de promotion à Mirabelle, 
also known as COPAM, which represents the interests of the 
region north of the Rivière des Milles-Îles, where my riding is 
located. COPAM consists of representatives of development 
corporations, chambers of commerce, municipal counsellors, 
and so forth. Thus, the ``Aéroports de Montréal'' corporation, 
the ADM, is the leader, at the top of a pyramid where the base is 
largely made up of all decision-makers and development 
officers of the sector. That original structure ensures perfect 
representativeness of the board of directors and the integration 
of regional development issues into the organisation's 
objectives.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	There is also a local airport authority in Vancouver and 
Calgary. Some good minds think that the same formula could 
apply to ports, the port of Montreal among others.
<P>
	ADM must however deal with the major problem of the two 
Montreal airports, Dorval and Mirabel. There is no rapid link 
between the two that would ensure quick transit for passengers 
and freight. Quebec freeway 13 which was supposed to be the 
main link was never completed; it is still 13 kilometres short.
<P>
	In March 1988, Quebec and Ottawa had agreed to share the 
costs of completing the freeway, which came to a total of $78 
million at that time. With a bit of nostalgia I read yesterday an 
article which appeared during those days in the <I>Voix des 
Mille-Îles</I>, a regional paper.
<P>
	It said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All the members of Parliament of our region were thrilled at things moving 
again on that project because the completion of the freeway will no doubt have 
positive impacts on the regional economy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I stop here the reference to that 1988 article. In any case, since 
then, nothing has happened, Mr. Speaker, absolutely nothing. It 
still takes 40 minutes to go from Dorval to Mirabel on four 
different highways and freeways. This is what humorists call 
cost-effective federalism.
<P>
	In spite of this handicap, last year, ADM made an estimated 
net profit of around $25 million. The company accounts for 
43,000 direct and indirect jobs. The economic spin-offs are 
$2.73 billion.
<P>
	Spurred on by this example, and in spite of the recession, 
regional dynamism has led to the creation of new industries and 
new jobs. Given the present sad state of the economy, this is 
nothing short of remarkable. One of these new industries is a 
fencing company, Bolar Inc.; its president, Mr. Lazare, listed 
Mirabel International Airport as one of the factors which 
weighed in favour of locating in the Blainville industrial park, 
just a few minutes from Mirabel.
<P>
	Of course, industries involved with air transportation are well 
advised to locate near a major airport. Cases in point are 
Aerospace Welding, a specialist in the production of engine 
parts and exhaust systems, and the well-known Air Transat, 
which are both situated in my riding, near Mirabel.
<P>
	Light industries, such as high-tech firms, which are the 
leading edge of the economy, also seek to locate near 
well-managed airports. For instance, Dowty Aerospace 
manufactures electronic equipment in Mirabel. DLGL, which 
recently moved to Blainville, specializes in human resource 
management software. Teknor manufactures computer 
components in Boisbriand. Multimeg, also in Boisbriand, 
produces electronic controls. In Saint-Eustache, Électromed 
manufactures X-ray generators for hospitals in Paris and 
Strasbourg. Triton, a firm which produces electronic equipment, 
is also located in Saint-Eustache.
<P>
	Other industries, which export most of their production, have 
moved there recently. For example, Lumec from Boisbriand 
which assembles lighting systems sells abroad most of its 
production. We could go on and on naming the companies 
which, with the help of development corporations, industry 
commissions and municipalities, have chosen to locate in our 
area because of its exceptional qualities, most notably the 
airports of Mirabel and Dorval.
<P>
	However, an international airport is also dependent on other 
things, and its development, and the development of the 
surrounding area, is tied to the air route policy of the 
government. In this regard we are not much favoured.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4073"> 4073 </A></B>
<P>
	Can we expect that once the government has dealt with the 
Conservative legacy, it will move to give the country an air 
transport policy?
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The other countries did not stay idle. Well aware of the 
growing importance of the quality of the airline network for the 
competitiveness of a country, the United States began to build 
super-airports. In Europe, just to give you an example, the 
Dutch airport of Schipol is going to undergo a remarkable 
structure development project which will enable it to become 
one of the most important transportation hubs in the world. 
Meanwhile, we are quietly debating deprivatization.
<P>
	That incredible lack of vision of the government, its stubborn 
determination to remain down-to-earth in the development of 
policies can be felt in the railroad sector. These days, England 
and France are celebrating, in euphoria, the opening of the 
railway tunnel linking them together. England and Belgium are 
starting to build the high-speed trains that will link them to that 
tunnel. In the United States, Amtrak is getting new equipment 
and four HSTs are under review or under construction. And what 
are we doing meanwhile?
<P>
	Our government is reviewing with solicitude the umpteenth 
study on the implementation of a HST in the Quebec-Windsor 
corridor that might create 120 000 jobs for many years. One can 
measure its high level of creativity by looking at its 
infrastructure program which is necessary, of course, but which 
is not likely to make Canada one of the most outstanding and 
innovative countries in the world at the end of this century.
<P>
	Bill C-22 is perfectly in line with the wheeling and dealing 
policy which lacks grandeur and vision and which is the earmark 
of this government. I will vote against this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had started to give the chronology of events 
surrounding the Pearson affair during the debate on the 
amendment to the amendment. As I did not have time to finish, I 
will take the opportunity that is offered by this debate on the 
amendment to continue with that analysis.
<P>
	We are asking for a royal commission of inquiry, and I think 
that no one can explain better than Robert Nixon why we must 
ask for such a commission. Mr. Nixon tells us, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My review has left me with but one conclusion. To leave in place an 
inadequate contract, arrived at with such a flawed process and under the shadow 
of possible political manipulation, is unacceptable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	One cannot speak more clearly, particularly when one sees 
that the political manipulation does not come from supporters of 
only one party. There were two colours in that manipulation, 
blue and red.
<P>
	With such words, those of Mr. Nixon, the government cannot 
justify compensating people who tried to take advantage of 
these irregularities without first shedding  some real light on the 
whole matter, and the way to do that is to have a commission of 
inquiry look into it.
<P>
	And I still quote Mr. Nixon, because he held an inquiry, 
without however giving himself the means to ultimately 
intervene. He says to us:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Failure to make public the full identity of the participants in this agreement 
and other salient terms of the contract inevitably raises public suspicion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Not with our friends opposite, but in general. And Mr. Nixon 
goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where the Government of Canada proposes to privatize a public asset, in my 
opinion, transparency should be the order of the day. The public should have the 
right to know the full details of the agreement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is on page 11 of the Nixon report. That is why we are 
asking for a commission to allow us to know the full details.
<P>
	At the beginning of his mandate, when he had just been 
appointed, in November 1993, the Minister of Transport told us 
that he was considering the establishment of a royal commission 
of inquiry into the Pearson Airport privatization. But he only 
considered it. He did not make a decision. He was won over, on 
the advice of his party and following discussions, I guess, with 
more experienced colleagues of his, who had been ministers 
longer than him in their days and no doubt told him that, as a 
minister, one must not think too much. And when it comes to 
acting, one has to act correctly, meaning not to make decisions 
that could reveal facts which could prove incriminating for 
some secret contributors to the party's campaign coffers.
<P>
	If we go back to 1986, Mr. Don Mazankowski, who was 
Minister of Transport at the time, had appointed a task force to 
examine alternatives for the management of Pearson Airport. 
The report tabled in 1986 stated, and I quote:
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The prime objective of enhancing the airport's relationship 
with the local economy could not sufficiently be ensured under 
private sector management. The task force does not consider the 
private sector option a viable alternative''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The task force rejected the private sector option for the 
management of the airport. Why then did the Conservative 
government of the day, just before an election, in the midst of an 
election campaign, say an agreement had been reached and 
Pearson Airport would be privatized?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4074"> 4074 </A></B>
<P>
	Now we are stuck with that irresponsible decision, denounced 
by the Liberals, who were in opposition back then and wanted to 
get right to the bottom of the matter. It sounds like they are not 
prepared to dig as deep now, not right to the bottom. We are 
asking that they keep the commitments they made during the 
election campaign. After all, that was not so long ago.
<P>
	The year after the 1986 task force report was tabled, the 
Conservative government proceeded with the first call for 
tenders concerning Terminal 3 at Pearson Airport. Internal 
documents submitted last August to former Prime Minister 
Campbell described the risks associated with this transaction, in 
particular the increase in the fees to be paid by carriers and the 
fact this could result in substantial loss of income to the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	In these documents, legal advisors indicated the exact 
make-up of the partnership in question was not known. It is 
disquieting to think the federal government would go ahead with 
a privatization plan without having all the facts at hand. It is 
even more disquieting to see the government which denounced 
the situation back in the days it was in opposition now refuse to 
get right to the bottom of the matter.
<P>
	In September 1990, the federal government announced that it 
would privatize terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson Airport, while the 
civil service was negotiating the establishment of public bodies 
to manage airports in many parts of Canada, like Montreal. 
After terminal 3 opened, the bureaucrats realized that the airport 
was half empty and concluded that not only was privatizing 
terminals 1 and 2 questionable, but that the whole expansion 
project was anything but urgent.
<P>
	What is not necessarily pressing in normal times can become 
urgent just before an election when people have contributed to 
the election fund. I suppose that it became very urgent when the 
Conservatives realized that they would no longer be on the 
government side of the House, although they did not think that 
they would not be on this side of the House either.
<P>
	So senior officials used their contacts then to promote an 
option. That is what specialists on lobbying call the revolving 
door: officials leave the public service to sell their connections 
and contacts. I am thinking of Ramsay Withers. A code of ethics 
should be issued; it was promised in the red book. They have 
learned very little since then. That is why we want a more 
thorough inquiry than Robert Nixon's.
<P>
	Remember that Mr. Nixon had no authority to order the 
production of documents. Documents are important. In the Ginn 
Publishing case, we were told that there were documents related 
to oral agreements that had left traces, as the heritage minister 
said, and that this contract would reveal discussions from the 
Cabinet of that time. It is very surprising that a contract would 
contain Cabinet discussions, but that is what we were told.
<P>
	Mr. Nixon did not have the power to compel some witnesses 
to appear before him, so the irregularities he  mentioned could 
be much more serious than those he suspects did occur. That is 
why we think a royal commission of inquiry should be appointed 
without delay. Moreover, why all the secrecy surrounding Bob 
Wright's negotiations, given the Prime Minister's commitment 
to shed some light on this deal? Do the Liberals have something 
to hide? If not, there is a very simple way to avoid such an 
accusation and that is to disclose all the facts. A royal 
commission of inquiry must be appointed. Then, we will know if 
the government was really determined to get to the bottom of 
this matter, to settle the lobbying issue, not do away with all 
lobbyists, but with the unscrupulous ones involved with 
companies that finance both parties' election campaigns.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are indicating that I have only two minutes 
left, so I will skip a few lines and talk about the Prime Minister 
who promised, during the election campaign, to order an 
independent review of the Pearson transaction. In spite of all 
Mr. Nixon's qualities, on the one hand, he had no authority and, 
on the other, he was a known Liberal supporter with close ties to 
the current government. Some Liberals are involved, 
undoubtedly. We know their names, we have seen them. No 
contractor gets involved with operations like these without 
having friends on both sides. That is precisely what happened in 
the Pearson Airport deal.
<P>
	When Mr. Chern Heed, who had been Pearson International's 
chief executive officer since 1987, tells us that his departure is 
not unrelated to Pearson's privatization, this is troubling news 
indeed. I also remember reading in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> that 
people wondered why Prime Minister Chrétien remained silent 
on the privatization of Pearson Airport early in the election 
campaign, while three weeks later, once the details of the 
transaction were known, he said that he would intervene. Is it a 
coincidence that the Prime Minister waited until the agreement 
was signed before intervening?
<P>
	Is it also a coincidence that the then Minister of Transport, 
Jean Corbeil, waited until early October, when the leaders 
debate took place, to conclude the agreement? Is it yet another 
coincidence that the government now refuses to shed light on 
this issue? That is a lot of coincidences for a single case! I might 
add that several issues have been characterized by such 
coincidences.
<P>
	Such coincidences will occur as long as we will have a 
permissive law regarding the activities of lobbyists, and as long 
as we will not have an elections act that ensures democratic 
financing of political parties. Indeed, until we have here a law 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4075"> 4075 </A></B>
<P>
such as the one in Quebec, we will be subject to all kinds of 
transactions of this sort, to all kinds of suspicious dealings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
lobbying really became part of the decision-making process in 
the early 1980s. In Canada, lobbyists have mostly influenced the 
public service and the government. Prior to that date, Canada 
had no legislation concerning the registration of lobbyists, and 
the public interest went unprotected.
<P>
	In 1986, the Standing Committee on Elections, Privileges and 
Procedure was set up to review the lobbying issue. Some of the 
witnesses before the committee argued that Parliament had no 
reason to study this matter. They thought the duty to disclose 
information would interfere with the right to privacy.
<P>
	Under the Conservative government, a bill stating the guiding 
principles behind a lobbyists registration system was drafted. It 
was based on Bill C-82, known today as the Lobbyists 
Registration Act, hereinafter called Bill C-44, which was 
approved on September 13, 1988, and came into force on 
September 30, 1989. This Act was amended by Bill C-76 passed 
on February 22, 1993.
<P>
	The definition of a true lobbyist varies in every country. 
However, the fundamental principle is always the same, 
transparency. The public must be kept informed in order for 
democracy to develop. In Australia, lobbyists are cursorily 
defined. The word means any individual or corporation that 
receives benefits, financial or otherwise, from a client during 
negotiations with ministers or representatives of the 
Commonwealth government. In Canada, lobbyists are defined 
as corporations or individuals who will, for a fee or any other 
benefit, make representations for a client to ministers or public 
servants.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Before addressing the issue of this outrageous Pearson deal, I 
want to briefly review the events that surrounded the 
expropriation process in Mirabel, in the province of Quebec. 
This gorgeous area is in my riding of Argenteuil-Papineau.
<P>
	On March 27, 1969, the federal government officially 
announced its intent to build a new Montreal International 
Airport, subsequently known as the Mirabel Airport. That 
airport was to be built in the village of Ste-Scholastique. 
Sixteen years later, on March 27, 1985, the bells of the 
Ste-Scholastique church rang to tell the people that an 
agreement had been signed between the Mirabel people whose 
land had been expropriated and the Canadian government. 
Under this agreement, farmers and homeowners were given 
back a large part of the land they had been unfairly stripped of. 
Some 80,000 acres out of the 97,000 acres that had been 
expropriated were retroceded. I was among the citizens who 
were unfairly stripped of their property.
<P>
	His Eminence Charles Valois, bishop of St-Jerôme, stated in 
1988: ``The inhabitants of 11 small towns affected by the 
Mirabel expropriation order also went into exile. Many left 
under unfair and short-sighted pressure; others became 
strangers on the very land their  forefathers had cleared. Those 
who expropriated their land thought they would take it lying 
down. They underestimated how deeply attached these men and 
women were to their land''.
<P>
	Their ancestral houses and farm buildings were 
unscrupulously burnt to the ground, sometimes under their very 
own eyes, before they were relocated in an urban area. Some of 
these farmers suddenly found themselves without work or a 
future.
<P>
	That decision taken under the government of Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau reminds us of the role then played by the lobbyists. 
Farmers did not get rich nor happy following the expropriation. 
Only sponsors and friends of the government really benefited 
from this expropriation as is the case in the Pearson deal, which 
is now before the House.
<P>
	At that time, the Conseil régional de développement des 
Laurentides chose to direct long-distance flights to Mirabel and 
short-distance ones to Dorval. They maintained they had 
adopted this position to promote the economic interest of the 
Greater Montreal area rather than individual local interests.
<P>
	Moreover, the Sommet socio-économique des Laurentides, 
held around the same time, had already favoured Mirabel as the 
main Montreal Airport, arguing that this would allow Mirabel to 
fully play its role as an international airport and to have the 
necessary interconnections on the domestic and transborder 
networks.
<P>
	If Mirabel Airport was one of the worst planning mistakes of 
the Trudeau administration, we will not correct it by making 
another mistake.
<P>
	The entire region of the Lower Laurentians benefits from the 
economic impact of the airport. Closing down Mirabel Airport 
to help Dorval would slow the economic development of the 
Lachute and Mirabel area where unemployment rate is already 
high. One of the options to stimulate the development of 
Mirabel would be the completion of highways 13 and 50 but it 
seems that the two levels of government do not yet see the need 
for it.
<P>
	Today, the Montreal airports authority, also called the ADM, 
is launching a development strategy including reorganized 
public and shopping space on the mezzanine floor, preventive 
maintenance of the facilities, enhanced access and a review of 
the mode of operation. Indeed, large billboards on the airport 
grounds announce works totalling some $150 million. It is clear 
Mirabel airport was not the result of an open process nor was the 
Pearson airport transaction.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	The idea of openness brings me to the financing of political 
parties. In this respect, I would like to remind you of the motion 
presented in this House by my colleague from Richelieu on 
March 18, which called for the imposition of an annual 
maximum of $5,000 on political donations by individuals. That 
motion reminds  us of who we really work for. It is the people 
who elected us. The member said in his speech: ``Some may 
believe that present measures are sufficient to limit undue 
influence and that it is in no way necessary to cap donations. Yet, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4076"> 4076 </A></B>
<P>
during the last ten years, charges of influence-peddling made 
against Senate and House members tend to prove the contrary.''
<P>
	The voters have to regain control of our electoral system. 
Quebec's legislation on this matter should serve as a model in 
every respect. The sources and amounts of contributions have to 
be disclosed. Moreover, the recommendation of a code of ethics 
for elected and other officials is essential if we want 
transparency.
<P>
	There were many players in the scandalous Pearson Airport 
transaction and I need not name them again since they all made 
the headlines. As a matter of fact, the person appointed by Prime 
Minister Chrétien to examine this issue, Robert Nixon, 
recommended that the contract be cancelled.
<P>
	In light of all the troubling facts surrounding the Pearson deal, 
we must ask the Prime Minister to appoint a royal commission 
of inquiry to look into the activities of these lobbyists.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Quebec-Pay equity; the hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's 
Crossing-Social programs; the hon. member for 
Mercier-Unemployment insurance; the hon. member for 
Regina-Lumsden-Bill C-91; the hon. member for 
Richelieu-Indian Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleagues 
of the Bloc Quebecois have tried to demonstrate with the only 
tool at their disposal, the Nixon Report, that what could be 
referred to as the ``Lester B. Pearson Airport affair'' was in fact 
a financial venture cooked up by the closest friends of both this 
government and the previous one. ``Money has no smell''. We 
have all heard that proverb as old as the Liberal and the 
Progressive Conservative Parties. I would even add that it has no 
colour either.
<P>
	Things happen without anybody or almost anybody opposite 
raising any question, because this is part of political tradition. If 
you wander through a foul-smelling swamp, after a while, you 
can no longer smell a thing.
<P>
	When I say that money has no colour, I am pointing to the fact 
that some of the wealthiest Canadian businessmen were caught 
backing both horses in the federal political raceway, the blue 
and the red, to the great displeasure of the Liberals who believed 
in the exclusivity of their audience with these partisan patrons.
<P>
	The names of top-ranking civil servants and politicians have 
been mentioned as important if not pivotal players in the 
monumental blunder that was the Pearson Airport deal. It is 
needless to twist the knife in the Liberal wounds by mentioning 
names like those of the Metcalfes, the Withers, the Hessions and 
the Kolbers, all  well-placed and well-known people who used 
for their own purposes the experience they acquired while 
holding very well paid functions.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The values of our society have been quite disrupted in the last 
few decades; people are valued more for their money than for 
their moral values.
<P>
	Canadian political practices are such that people maintain 
their reputation in spite of the most scandalous attempts to rob 
the government, with the most brazen impunity. Has the election 
process become a game of musical chairs where, without further 
ado, one party replaces another but keeps the same spirit, 
proceeds the same way to the benefit of the same mentors?
<P>
	Is there an unwritten rule according to which preceding and 
new governments pass on power to one another without 
attacking each other? Does nothing offend the party in power or 
make it shudder when its own investigator, Mr. Nixon, reveals 
strange facts, secret dealings, people operating in secrecy and 
anonymity? By itself, Mr. Nixon's report should have given rise 
to the worst apprehensions.
<P>
	Millions of dollars disappear and fall by chance into the 
pockets of the regime's best friends. Still, no one is shocked, no 
one is concerned, it is part of the game, that is all.
<P>
	How much of our national debt has found itself by chance in 
the bank accounts of the regime's friends? Sleep soundly, 
Liberals, because Statistics Canada, the Conference Board, 
Quebec's Conseil du patronat, among others, are not interested 
in compiling such statistics; our society has not reached that 
point yet.
<P>
	Our society and political parties are not even aware that top 
civil servants or former ministers profit from an expertise 
acquired at taxpayers' expense, after, in most cases, having 
received substantial severance bonuses as well as the traditional 
gold watch and farewell party.
<P>
	A farewell that is rather short. As soon as they get down 
Parliament Hill, these people who have been members of 
political caucuses, know the tendencies of some, the weaknesses 
of others, the legal loopholes, the traps to avoid or to set off; 
these people sell their knowledge, which should belong to the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	The surest way to prevent these back-room games is to forbid 
all tax deductions for lobbyist or canvassing expenses, as the 
Minister of Transport himself said.
<P>
	If society sees nothing wrong in that, can we blame our 
leaders for not being offended by it? The opposition will not 
neglect its mandate. The heart has its reasons of which reason 
knows nothing. Liberals too, have reasons of which the people 
know nothing, reasons that no government should have. Things 
then get very complicated. That is what the Liberals want: they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4077"> 4077 </A></B>
<P>
want to thwart all our efforts to discover the truth and they want 
to leave the House in the dark.
<P>
	Nearly half the members in this House did what they could in 
good faith with a piece of legislation that can almost be 
described as a political obscenity or even legislative 
pornography. In this seemingly odious approach to 
peace-buying, they tried, in keeping with their mandate, to 
understand the reasons behind this bill, the remedy it sought, 
and the reason for that remedy.
<P>
	It is hard to understand the stubbornness of the government in 
view of what seems to be the boldest attempt to misappropriate 
public funds in decades.
<P>
	Neither the Official Opposition nor the Reform Party are 
trying to bring disrepute to any people,and they do not want to 
engage in witch-hunting or blame people who acted in good 
faith. Most of the suspicion here stems from the reluctance of 
the government to answer legitimate questions.
<P>
	The relentlessness with which the government tries to avoid 
anything that could irritate any of the players in this miserable 
affair can only generate confusion and fear. The official 
opposition and the Reform Party also, undoubtedly, would be 
pleased to make amends if it turned out that our suspicions, 
which the Liberal Party seeks so eagerly to dispel, could not and 
should not touch our most respectable citizens who are involved 
in this unfortunate deal.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Our Parliament has certain powers that are sometimes similar 
to judicial powers in the sense that, when a court makes a 
decision, it must not only be fair but also be seen to be fair. It is 
the same thing for our laws; the ones that are voted here must not 
only be fair but also be seen to be fair. The perennial character of 
laws makes them offensive when they are compromising in 
nature and their observance is somewhat uncertain.
<P>
	History will soon judge their authors, often while they are still 
alive. A book recently published in Quebec did not wait out the 
thirty-year prescription to attach to a politician who is alive and 
well the attribute of ``cheater''.
<P>
	Why these hesitations, why so much reluctance on the part of 
the party in office? Does it not agree, as it is stating, that any 
inquiry would only dispel any suspicion? But precisely there is 
suspicion; so let us treat it as we should and everyone's 
conscience will be eased.
<P>
	Jean de La Fontaine (1621-1695), a renown writer of fables, 
undoubtedly a Liberal lobbyist, was hated by Louis XIV but, as 
any good lobbyist having managed to get around the problem, 
became a protégé of Fouquet and of the duchess of Orléans.
<P>
	His easy access was guaranteed, which allowed him to 
describe so well the lobbies of his time in the famous tale 
entitled <I>Les Animaux malades de la peste</I>.
<P>
	They were not all dying from it, but all were stricken, so that 
in caucus, it was decided that the biggest sinner would be 
sacrificed to expiate the sins of all the others.
<P>
	The lion admitted to have eaten some sheep on a few 
occasions, even the shepherd sometimes; the donkey, whose 
only sin was to have grazed in the neighbour's meadow, was 
immediately found guilty and sacrificed.
<P>
	Does that anecdote not remind you of a story that happened 
here recently? A little effort, Liberal gentlemen.
<P>
	In a modest flight of oratory, the Prime Minister showed the 
door to one of his MPs, who had committed the big blunder of 
being imprecise in writing his resume. On that occasion, the 
Prime Minister's sensitive scruples suggested that he would 
change things. But it seems that will not happen.
<P>
	For his unforgivable, reprehensible sin, the culprit was 
executed without further ado.
<P>
	Does the party have two value systems? One for its intimate 
funders and other close relatives, the other one for plebeians, the 
unemployed and welfare recipients?
<P>
	I think we can assume that La Fontaine knew what he was 
talking about when he said: ``la raison du plus fort est encore la 
meilleure''.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, the Official Opposition has tabled an amendment 
to have a royal commission of inquiry instead of adopting the 
bill before the House today. I have said before in this House that 
there was a taint of manoeuvring around the contracts, of which 
there are a quite a few, which were concluded when Terminals 1 
and 2 were privatized. This taint could only be removed by a 
commission of inquiry that would investigate this matter. My 
colleagues have said so repeatedly, but apparently that has fallen 
on deaf ears, not yours, Mr. Speaker but those of our colleagues 
opposite.
<P>
	It should be clear to them since the Liberals are involved 
through the people who contribute to the party's coffers, that if 
compensation payments are not made in full public view, the 
suspicion will linger that money changed hands under the table. 
There will always be some suspicion that ties between the 
traditional parties and governments and the contributors to party 
coffers remain intact and that this is a case of you scratch my 
back and I scratch yours. People will wonder: How much will 
the government secretly agree to pay to a certain investor and 
why? How much, to whom and why? These questions should be 
considered, or at least the answers to those questions should be 
given publicly, and the underlying reasons should also be made 
known.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4078"> 4078 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Why will the government not let a third party evaluate this 
deal, a third party with an obligation to answer to the citizens of 
Canada? Otherwise, consider the opportunities for collusion 
among individuals who are in a position to benefit from such 
deals, at the expense of taxpayers in Quebec and Canada? Of 
course this may not happen, but people will never be sure.
<P>
	My colleagues have said that not only must justice be done, it 
must be seen to be done. In this case, we will never be sure there 
was no collusion.
<P>
	Who does the government want to protect and why? That is 
the question. Why does not the government want to know all the 
facts? Is the strong taint around these transactions not 
convincing enough? Does the government think that by cleaning 
up mess, it may be contaminated in the process? How much is 
this going to cost taxpayers? Can we accept the risk that several 
hundred or several thousand or even several million dollars will 
be misspent?
<P>
	In this connection, I feel I must recall what was said in the 
course of another debate we had in this House, which will be 
resumed after the committee has done its work, and I am 
referring to the cuts in the unemployment insurance program. 
When an unemployment insurance applicant signs his form and 
makes a mistake, be it of a week, a day or an hour, not only can 
the government claim back the money paid in excess, but it can 
also brand the person a cheater. Even if the Act were not 
amended, that is what would happen. The government which 
wants a free hand to give compensation it calls just to investors, 
some of whom, as we know, contribute to the party's coffers, 
that same government introduced Bill C-17 which seeks to 
increase the number of weeks necessary to qualify for 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	That same government wants to limit the number of weeks of 
entitlement and in that case we are not talking about thousands 
or hundreds of thousands of dollars, we are talking of a few 
dollars that the workers really need. Yet, in many cases, these 
workers are going to be deprived of sums of money very 
important to them. Of course, the sums involved would not be a 
suitable compensation for an investor, but to unemployed 
workers they would help pay the rent and feed the family.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I wish to stress that too often there are two categories of 
people in this country. The ordinary citizens who have a hard 
time earning a living, because jobs are scarce, and must respect 
the law to a tee or be faced with costly penalties. And there are 
the others, who belong to an ill-defined circle, but can easily 
take advantage of the gravy train.
<P>
	At a time when it is so hard for ordinary citizens to make ends 
meet, when jobs are hard to get, when it is very difficult to raise 
children and give them an education, we cannot in any way let 
the government  apply a double standard and compensate 
investors, who certainly spent time and energy, but have 
probably been compensated already. We cannot let the 
government yield to undue pressure. Justice is not enough, there 
must also be appearance of justice.
<P>
	I should say that Torontonians and Canadians who rely on 
Pearson Airport should be glad to be spared this deal. The 
contract provisions which were brought to light in the Nixon 
report-it was not a royal commission but it makes you want 
one-reveal that Toronto's economic development would bear 
little resemblance to the projections based on 30 years and even 
on 57 years. Without a doubt Torontonians have had a narrow 
escape.
<P>
	I can say that because in Quebec, the Liberal Government of 
the time ordered the construction of a new airport based on 
projections that said it would lead to the area's prosperity. In 
fact, it was all the contrary for Montreal. So Torontonians are 
lucky, but the price to pay must not be too expensive for ordinary 
Canadians. Even if they are investors who contribute generously 
to political parties, that does not mean we should give them 
special consideration. The government, in particular, should not 
be allowed to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I speak today 
on Bill C-22 because I believe in democracy, in the ideal that 
demands that governments legislate while taking into account 
the interests of the population and the common good. The 
decisions taken in this House allow us to reflect and promote the 
democratic values.
<P>
	I am among those who believe it is still possible to send 
people to Parliament so that they can work hard to defend the 
interests of their fellow citizens. I believe that political 
representation is based on a confidence relationship between 
voters and elected representatives.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Democracy is also the process underlying all of our 
institutions. It is through them that all the great values of 
transparency, ethics, justice and fairness are conveyed. It is on 
them that rests the confidence relationship between a 
government and its citizens. When politicians break that special 
relationship, the society is faced with individualism, 
profiteering, cynicism and disillusionment to name but a few.
<P>
	The Liberal government likes to repeat, in this House, its 
intentions to make sure that Canadians regain confidence in 
their political institutions through a better transparency. I do not 
believe that Bill C-22, as worded, could do it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4079"> 4079 </A></B>
<P>
	All the ploys and the jiggery-pokery surrounding the 
privatization of Pearson airport under the previous Conservative 
government are a sad example of incidents which diminish the 
people's respect and confidence vis-à-vis their government.
<P>
	Allow me, Mr. Speaker, to remind the House of some 
elements of this deal we should now call the Pearson saga. The 
Canadian government announced its political intention to 
privatize Terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. Pearson International 
Airport in March 1992. Less than three months after this 
announcement, the Request for Proposals process was over. 
They had received only two bids from Paxport and Claridge. 
Given the importance of this transaction, everybody agrees that 
the time limits were too short.
<P>
	In December 1992, the Paxport proposal was accepted. Later 
on, Paxport was unable to respect the government's conditions 
concerning its financial viability. In February 1993, Paxport 
merged its activities with those of its competitor, Claridge; that 
merger put them in a monopoly situation which was contrary to 
the government's guidelines. But this is not the first incongruity 
in this deal nor is it the last. Be that as it may, a few months later, 
in the middle of the election campaign, on October 7, 1993, the 
government and the corporation resulting from the merger of 
Paxport and Claridge hurriedly signed a legal agreement for the 
privatization of Terminals 1 and 2 of Lester B. Pearson 
International Airport.
<P>
	When returned to office, the Liberal government ordered an in 
camera review of the situation. That review was completed by 
Mr. Robert Nixon, a former Liberal minister at Queen's Park. 
The conclusion of the Nixon report is, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My review has left me with but one conclusion. To leave in place an 
inadequate contract, arrived at with such a flawed process and under the shadow 
of possible political manipulation, is unacceptable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On December 3, 1993, the Prime Minister announced the 
cancellation of the airport privatization contract and on April 13 
last, the Minister of Transport presented Bill C-22 which 
reflects the government's will.
<P>
	The secret maneuvering and shameless favouritism 
surrounding this deal hide a reality which is even less edifying. 
On the one hand the Liberal government claims to be asking for 
the cancellation of that contract in the public interest but, on the 
other, it does not worry about public interest when it gives 
discretionary powers to the cabinet allowing it to pay 
compensation according to its own judgment. This may well 
cancel out the positive effects the government says it wanted in 
the first place. As a matter of fact, the government is asking us 
today to sign a blank cheque to compensate the companies 
involved in this transaction. Quite a few political personalities 
and lobbyists, of Conservative and Liberal allegiance, are 
closely connected with this whole sorry affair.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	In spite of the fact that the Liberal Party promised to get to the 
bottom of the Pearson saga and to introduce an in-depth reform 
to better control lobbyists'actions in the backrooms of 
Parliament, we are forced to notice that the same old 
manoeuvring is still taking place.
<P>
	The people's cynicism for politicians is the fruit of 
misappropriations similar to the Pearson saga. Let us not forget 
that Quebec and Canadian taxpayers pay for lobbying expenses 
and political party contributions through corporate tax 
deductions. When patronage occurs, they pay again for the cost 
overruns of lucrative contracts, or the sale of public property to 
friends of the government at bargain prices. Taxpayers have 
every right to say enough is enough.
<P>
	And yet, there are solutions such as those proposed by the 
Bloc Quebecois to put an end to this cover-up. They go from the 
public financing of political parties to a stricter control of 
lobbying activities and the adoption of a code of conduct for 
elected representatives and high officials. By amending Bill 
C-22 and by calling for a royal commission of inquiry, as 
requested by the Bloc Quebecois, the Liberal government could 
show that transparency is more than wishful thinking, more than 
an abstract idea.
<P>
	Georges Burdeau said: ``The overriding concern of a 
democracy is to ensure that the power that the people hold is not 
corrupted by the demands of the masses. What is important is to 
ensure that freedom is not subjugated by passions, by factional 
tyranny or by special interest groups''.

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development)</B> moved that Bill C-25, an act to amend the 
Canada Petroleum Resources Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the House on Bill C-25, 
an act to amend the Canada Petroleum Resources Act.
<P>
	As parliamentarians we are required to absorb vast amounts 
of information. Pages and pages of documentation can 
accompany even the simplest request for a decision. It is 
remarkable that such a brief piece of legislation as Bill C-25 can 
be so important.
<P>
	Bill C-25 proposes only a minor administrative change to the 
Canada Petroleum Resources Act in order to exempt the Norman 
Wells oil field which will now include additional lands. This 
change and, more important, the reasons behind it will have 
major ramifications for northern communities, for northern 
aboriginal people and for Canadians.
<P>
	The amendment is important because it will allow production 
from the Norman Wells oil field in the central Mackenzie valley 
to continue under existing arrangements for as long as the field 
is commercially producible. This is now estimated to be at least 
to the year 2020, a full 12 years longer than originally 
anticipated.
<P>
	Without this extension the community of Norman Wells will 
lose an important economic stimulus. Jobs will be lost both in 
Norman Wells and in other northern communities. Governments 
and taxpayers will also lose as millions of dollars of potential 
corporate and personal tax revenues, royalties and other income 
will disappear. In the process a vital resource will be needlessly 
and negligently left in the ground.
<P>
	Extending the production agreement for Norman Wells, on 
the other hand, will rekindle investor interest in the Canadian 
north. As hon. members know, the economic well-being of both 
territories will very much benefit from healthy resource 
industries.
<P>
	With the recent settlement of a number of aboriginal 
comprehensive land claims in the north, we are now in the 
process of opening lands to private enterprise. Establishing 
certainty of land and resource ownerships is one of the principle 
objectives of a comprehensive claims settlement.
<P>
	From this standpoint, the extension of the Norman Wells 
project could not be more opportune. It will focus attention on 
the great resource potential of these northern areas at a time 
when lands are becoming available for exploration and 
development.
<P>
	This in turn will result in additional drilling and service 
contracts for northern firms. There will also be new business 
opportunities for other service industries. The economic 
benefits of Norman Wells will continue and broaden. In order to 
put Bill C-25 into perspective I would like to briefly explain 
some of the history behind the Norman Wells development.
<P>
	Although the Norman Wells field was discovered around the 
turn of the century, it was not significantly developed until the 
second world war when northern inland oil supplies became 
strategically important. In 1944 at the height of the war effort 
the Government of Canada entered into an agreement with 
Imperial Oil Limited to develop the Norman Wells field, the 
so-called proven area, set out in that agreement as based on the 
technology that was available at the time.
<P>
	Today we know that a small proportion of the field extends 
beyond the current proven area boundaries. As well, the 1944 
agreement had an expiry date of 2008, which was considered to 
be more than enough time to extract all the oil.
<P>
	Based on new exploration and production technology, 
Imperial Oil now believes the field will be productive well 
beyond this date, an assessment backed by the National Energy 
Board.
<P>
	Hon. members may be aware that the governor in council has 
the authority to extend the duration of the 1944 agreement with 
Imperial Oil and to expand the proven area. However, a minor 
amendment is required to the Canada Petroleum Resources Act 
to ensure that the act which specifically excludes the 1944 
agreement refers to the 1994 agreement.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-25 accomplishes this with an amendment that is 
inconsequential to the application of the act in any other region 
of Canada.
<P>
	Proclamation of this legislation will have an immediate and 
very positive economic impact in the north and other parts of 
Canada. Bill C-25 will pave the way for a $30 million drilling 
program that will be undertaken by Imperial Oil this year, 
assuming Parliament acts quickly enough to allow the company 
to take advantage of a short window of opportunity this summer 
for drilling work in the north.
<P>
	This drilling program will be undertaken mostly in the 
expanded proven area. About one-third of the money, $10 
million, will be spent directly in the north. Most of the 
remaining $20 million will be spent in Alberta.
<P>
	As a result of the drilling program and the extension of the 
field's producing life, short term employment in the Norman 
Wells area will increase and long term employment will be 
stabilized.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4081"> 4081 </A></B>
<P>
	This government is committed to working with Imperial Oil, 
other companies, the community of Norman Wells and the Sahtu 
Dene and Metis to ensure that local people benefit from the 
employment. At least one-third of the on site jobs generated by 
the drilling program will be guaranteed to local residents. 
Indirect employment is estimated at an additional 25 person 
years in the north.
<P>
	Aboriginal people in particular stand to benefit from this 
extension. Under their land claim agreements the Gwich'in, the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis are entitled to a share of the royalties from 
Norman Wells. The extension will give them a guaranteed 
revenue flow beyond 2008 and perhaps to the year 2020.
<P>
	As well, Shehtah Drilling which is jointly owned by the Dene 
Metis and Imperial Oil holds a $6 million drilling contract that 
is conditional on this project moving forward.
<P>
	The Government of Canada's financial position will also 
benefit from the continued production of oil from Norman 
Wells. In addition to receiving millions in additional royalty 
payments from Imperial Oil, I remind hon. members that 
Canada is a one-third owner in Norman Wells development. The 
extension of production is expected to bring the government 
millions of dollars in return on this investment. We will also 
increase revenues from federal, territorial and municipal 
corporate taxes and from personal income taxes.
<P>
	Bill C-25 provides clear evidence of this government's 
commitment to economic renewal in all regions of Canada. The 
Norman Wells extension project will not only keep some 
Canadians working, it will contribute directly and indirectly to 
the creation of many new jobs both in the north and in Alberta.
<P>
	This is a positive initiative that has the support of all the key 
players: aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in the Northwest 
Territories, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, 
the petroleum industry and of course the Government of Canada. 
It deserves the support of this House so that the planned drilling 
program can proceed this year and the affected northern 
communities, families and workers can be assured of a stable 
economic future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, the bill 
before us today is a piece of legislation which, in our opinion, 
must reconcile several aspects.
<P>
	First, there is a concrete reality, namely the natural resource 
that oil is. But there is also the notion of environmental 
protection, as well as the close relation to Bill C-16, which was 
referred in second reading to the Standing Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois looked at the issue in that whole context 
and will support Bill C-25. In fact, this bill is somewhat similar 
to previous pieces of legislation, including one tabled in 1944, 
and another one tabled in 1983, when amendments were made to 
the Canada Petroleum Resources Act, precisely to allow for the 
inclusion of provisions to the effect that this bill is not covered 
by the Canada Petroleum Resources Act.
<P>
	I would like to go back to some historical details. I did that in 
the case of Bill C-16, but then I did not go over the whole 
historical aspect. I think it is important to put Norman Wells in 
its proper context. This was the first Northwest Territories 
community set up exclusively for the development of 
non-renewable resources. At the time, there was a lot of 
prospection in that area and it was discovered that the region 
was rich in oil, even almost at ground surface. Starting in 1918 
and 1919, oil was discovered in commercial quantities.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Imperial Oil Limited and Canada jointly own these producing 
fields. Canada owns the equivalent of one third of these fields, 
while Imperial was always very active with about a two-thirds 
interest.
<P>
	The Can-Oil patch was created during World War II to allow 
Norman Wells' light oil, which was then a strategic resource, to 
be shipped in large quantities to Alaska and to southern centres. 
Roads were already being built so that this very high-quality oil 
could be transported to the South. Norman Wells is also the 
northern end of the oil pipeline which goes from the Northwest 
Territories to Zama, in Alberta.
<P>
	I think it is really important to put things in context to see why 
Norman Wells was always at the heart of oil exploration. What is 
also important, as I said earlier, is that we just looked at the issue 
of land claims by the Dene and the Metis. We just told these 
people that they would be allowed to occupy a certain territory, 
over which there are major oil sites.
<P>
	I think that we cannot disregard the link between the two bills. 
It would be dangerous to vote on Bill C-25 without taking into 
consideration Bill C-16 which was before the House last week 
and which recognized the settlement agreement reached with the 
Dene and Metis. Under this agreement, the federal government 
has settled a land claim and retroceded, if you recall, over 
230,000 square kilometres of land, 1,800 square kilometres of 
which include royalties for underground resources. I think it is 
important to link those two bills.
<P>
	Ever since 1944, the government of Canada and Imperial Oil 
have had an agreement about these fields and the projected 
recovery we are talking about, because that is the real issue. 
Imperial has found a new way to market and develop petroleum 
resources. In fact, it has developed a water-injection system that 
extends the area it can work on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4082"> 4082 </A></B>
<P>
	Since the company can, with this new process, extend the 
territory it wants to develop, we are being asked here, in the 
House of Commons, to stretch the rules and use Bill C-25 to 
amend the Canada Petroleum Resources Act.
<P>
	According to 1983 estimates, oil exploration was supposed to 
come to an end around the year 2008. Of course, this new 
technology is not environmentally unsound, since, and I will 
come back to this issue in a little while, even the National 
Energy Board has examined and approved it.
<P>
	So, this new process could extend the development activities 
to the year 2020, which would mean millions and millions of 
dollars in benefits for Imperial, as well as for the government of 
Canada and the Dene and Metis living on this territory.
<P>
	As I said, the National Energy Board has approved the 
company's project. That is very important because, of course, 
when an oil company wants to intensively exploit a field and 
take that exploitation further, very seldom will it come with a 
study where, on the environmental impact side, it will say: 
``This has terrible environmental impacts, but we want to 
exploit it anyway''. So, it is important that we have an 
independent organization from Imperial that would come and 
say: ``Indeed, your new way of doing things on the field 
exploitation side is interesting and, most of all, it has no impact 
on the environment.'' That environment issue is very important 
in the present context, not only for Canadians, but also for 
Canadian Metis and Dene, who are on those territories because 
they always had a very privileged relationship with the 
environment. We know that their culture was focused on hunting 
and fishing at the time, and it is still the case today.
<P>
	And the project is a beneficial combination that allows Dene 
and Metis to develop the new resources, that is oil resources, by 
giving them, through Bill C-16, their say on the matter, and also 
protects their old culture which, incidently, they are very proud 
of.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The National Energy Board did an independent review that 
supported the Imperial study and that company decided to get 
into a drilling program worth about $30 million. That program 
will deal with 12 already drilled wells and others that will be 
drilled along the field limits. The new technologies will allow to 
exploit it without any cost to the environment.
<P>
	I think that this Bill C-25 provides us with the good oilfield 
conservation and management methods.
<P>
	I was saying earlier that all indicates that the project will go 
until 2020. I have myself contacted the Sahtu council this week. 
People say they agree. They were consulted. It is true that the 
Northwest Territories and the Canadian Association of 
Petroleum Producers were consulted. Everyone agrees. 
However, I feel-and so does the Bloc Quebecois-that it would 
be a shame for this House to adopt Bill-25 immediately and then 
tell the Sahtu Tribal Council who represents the Dene and Metis:  
``Now that we have decided on your behalf how the Norman 
Wells Development should be done, we are ready to settle your 
land claims.''
<P>
	We feel it is extremely important that Bill C-16, which is now 
before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, be 
examined first. One way or another, Bill C-25 is also going to be 
referred to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. We 
intend to see that Bill-16 is adopted before Bill-25.
<P>
	If we make comparisons between the guarantees given by the 
James Bay Agreement, we find that the government is on the 
right track, as far as land claims are concerned. We talked a lot 
about that. I talked about that when Bill C-16 was introduced in 
the House. I talked about the James Bay Agreement which was 
passed as an act of the Quebec National Assembly and called the 
Cree-Naskapi of Quebec Act, and the federal government did 
that too.
<P>
	It is a bit for the same reasons that we thought important to 
hold this debate and tell you that we agree with that bill. It will 
be very important for Bill C-16 to be passed by the standing 
committee and to come back to this House before Bill C-25 is 
passed.
<P>
	For all those reasons, I am pleased to announce that the Bloc 
Quebecois will support Bill C-25 provided that Bill C-16 is 
adopted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak on the bill before us today. Some consider 
Bill C-25 a minor amendment to the Canadian Petroleum 
Resources Act, but I would like to think it can be viewed as an 
important message to industry.
<P>
	Thousands of jobs in my riding are directly or indirectly 
dependent on the current boom in the petroleum sector. But if 
industry's confidence in government intentions were to be 
eroded many of those jobs could be lost.
<P>
	Although this amendment only directly affects one oil 
company and community, I hope it is an indication this 
government realizes the importance of providing our resource 
based industries with predictability and stability in the policy 
environment. If this government starts sending signals to the 
private sector that it is safe to make long term investment plans, 
it will lead to economic growth and the creation of far more 
permanent jobs than government can hope to achieve through 
any temporary make work projects.
<P>
	There is a long history leading up to this current amendment. 
The first oil well was drilled at Norman Wells in 1920. Since 
then it has grown to be the fourth largest producing field in the 
country. In 1944 Imperial Oil and Canada signed the Norman 
Wells proven area agreement which included just under 3,300 
hectares within its boundaries. When the Canadian Petroleum 
Resources Act came into force the Norman Wells proven  area 
was exempted from the new act. Just as the bill before us does 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4083"> 4083 </A></B>
<P>
today, subsequent renewals and agreements have been similarly 
exempted.
<P>
	This amendment does two things. It extends the timeframe 
past the current expiration date of 2008 which allows Imperial to 
plan for long term recovery. The amendment also changes the 
1944 boundaries to incorporate the entire field. Changing the 
boundaries to exclude non-productive portions and include new 
fringe areas results in an addition of 350 hectares to the old 
proven area.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	Canada and Imperial will not have to determine whether oil 
comes from pockets inside or outside the former boundaries. 
This will solve potential administrative problems for royalty 
and share calculations.
<P>
	The government undertook numerous consultations when 
arriving at this agreement. Pursuant to the spirit and intent of the 
land claim agreement under negotiation with the Sahtu Dene and 
Metis during the same period, the government initiated 
discussions with them to ensure that the views of the long term 
stakeholders would be taken into consideration when 
contemplating any prospective changes to the proven area 
agreement.
<P>
	Most other people living in Norman Wells are in some way 
directly dependent on the oil and gas extractive industries. 
Many will leave once oil production ceases, however the vast 
majority of the Sahtu peoples will remain.
<P>
	The Sahtu agreed to this amendment at the end of March. It 
became apparent that Imperial's planned investment of $30 
million for this fiscal year might be jeopardized if concurrence 
from the Sahtu was not forthcoming. Although it is probably not 
binding, the Sahtu made their acceptance contingent upon the 
enactment of Bill C-16, the Sahtu Dene and Metis Land Claims 
Settlement Act.
<P>
	I am not generally a cynic, but I cannot help wondering about 
the timing of these two respective bills in the House. What 
would happen if Bill C-16 were held up indefinitely or even 
defeated? Would the government also have to repeal this bill?
<P>
	I fully appreciate that this represents a significant opportunity 
for the Sahtu peoples to apply some indirect pressure on the 
government to proclaim an agreement they have anticipated for 
decades. But is it responsible of the government to enter into 
verbal agreements of this nature linking any two pieces of 
legislation?
<P>
	The government also consulted with the Canadian 
Association of Petroleum Producers to seek its views on the 
principles of the amendment. The government assured CAPP 
this agreement would not set a precedent for the issuance of 
rights anywhere else in Canada.
<P>
	Again the government gave assurances it cannot guarantee, 
this time promising this agreement would not  be linked to 
decisions in the future. As we all know it is the job of lawyers to 
find precedents they can use to the advantage of their clients. 
Governments have also been known to fall. How can this 
government give a guarantee to other petroleum producers that 
this agreement does not set a precedent down the road?
<P>
	Over the past decades the resource based industries have 
struggled against global recession, depressed prices, 
unpredictable policy and investment climates and increasing 
taxation from all levels of government.
<P>
	Although the Ministry of Natural Resources has just released 
a report stating that Canada falls somewhere in the middle of the 
international competitive range with respect to taxation rates in 
mining, that is not the perception of the industry. The mining 
industry looks at the high marginal tax rates. Those have driven 
Canadian exploration and investment dollars overseas to South 
America. This government has the opportunity to reverse that 
trend by developing policies to encourage domestic investment.
<P>
	In the petroleum sector depressed oil prices have resulted in 
massive layoffs and extensive restructuring of the industry. In 
the last couple of years we have seen a surge in natural gas prices 
leading to the current boom, but oil prices remain low and the 
future uncertain.
<P>
	The cost overruns at <I>Hibernia</I> would not have been debated so 
strenuously if oil prices were stable at $50 U.S. a barrel, but they 
are not. Oil prices have just barely hit $17 on the heels of a five 
year low, dipping below $14.
<P>
	In this erratic global market, oil companies must make 
significant investment decisions based on many factors, not just 
the price of oil. Confidence in government policy is a critical 
component in those decisions.
<P>
	This amendment in giving force to the Norman Wells 
amending agreement signed in April provides Imperial Oil with 
the security of tenure it needs for long term planning. It has been 
assured there is time to realize a return on major investments in 
new technology. These investments are essential to maximizing 
production from this field.
<P>
	This amendment is good for Imperial because it provides a 
stable planning environment. It is good for the Sahtu Dene and 
other local residents because they can rely on employment 
opportunities and a cash infusion into the local economy for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4084"> 4084 </A></B>
<P>
several more years. It is good for the Canadian people because it 
will generate additional oil revenues and royalties.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	I hope this amendment means that the government now 
recognizes it cannot cripple our natural resource industries 
through unfair taxation or short-sighted policy initiatives.
<P>
	Canada is very dependent on revenues generated by the 
petroleum sector. The imposition of additional taxes such as the 
rumoured carbon tax could dramatically curtail growth in this 
sector, throwing many thousands of people out of work. There 
must be a balance between environmental concerns and jobs for 
young Canadians.
<P>
	According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, Canada is 
expected to remain a net oil exporter until 2008. Within 25 years 
we will still export 75 per cent of our heavy oil production but 
we will import almost twice as much light oil. To offset these 
effects government must encourage domestic exploration for 
more reserves.
<P>
	The decline in northern exploration has been so dramatic that 
even the National Energy Board was scheduled to permanently 
close its office in Yellowknife in March.
<P>
	To date, aside from Bent Horn in the eastern Arctic offshore, 
no new major oil or gas prospects have been found in the 
Northwest Territories, indicating there are not enough reserves 
to warrant field development or pipeline construction.
<P>
	With exploration levels falling off, industry must invest in 
technology to improve recovery from known reserves.
<P>
	Since 1981 new technology has increased the yield from the 
Norman Wells field from 17 per cent to 40 per cent. This is 
attributable to horizontal drilling, water injection and other 
improvements in recovery techniques.
<P>
	More recently, in February approval was granted for a 
propane injection pilot project in the proven area. It will assess 
the technical merits of a propane miscible flood for achieving 
increased levels of recovery over a three year period. At the end 
of that time Imperial should have a pretty good idea how much 
more oil is recoverable from the field.
<P>
	As of December 1992 a little over half of the recoverable 
reserves remained in the ground, approximately 125 million 
barrels, but this may improve substantially if the propane 
injection proves feasible. It could ensure that the field produces 
far more oil than previously thought possible thus ensuring 
stability in the regional economy for another 20 to 25 years.
<P>
	Major investment in this technology is practical in light of the 
security that this amendment offers.
<P>
	In summary, I would like to voice my support for this bill 
because it provides predictability for Imperial's planning 
horizon and is profitable for the regional economy. It will give 
Imperial the confidence and security of tenure necessary for it to 
invest in new technology to maximize recovery from this field. 
This amendment will also provide economic stability and long  
term employment opportunities in the Norman Wells region.
<P>
	Finally, it is my hope that the royalties and revenues which 
accrue to Canada from maximizing the productive capacity of 
this field will contribute to the reduction of our national deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Loney (Edmonton North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address the House on Bill C-25, an act to amend the Canada 
Petroleum Resources Act.
<P>
	I want to join my colleague, the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, in urging hon. members to support this 
minor administrative change to the act.
<P>
	Bill C-25 will permit extending the duration of production 
from Norman Wells oil field probably to the year 2020 thereby 
continuing an important source of income from which northern 
families have benefited for the past five decades. This will 
provide a tremendous boost to the local economy. The economic 
activity and new investments associated with Norman Wells will 
possibly provide an additional 90 jobs in the north.
<P>
	I would also point out to hon. members that the Norman Wells 
project is directly responsible for creating jobs elsewhere in 
Canada. For instance about 70 jobs have been created in Alberta.
<P>
	It is no exaggeration to say that the community of Norman 
Wells depends on its oil industry. For many Canadians the words 
Norman Wells are inextricably linked with oil. Take away the 
right to produce every available drop of oil and you take away 
the right of economic well-being from this community.
<P>
	However, by agreeing to extend the field's production life we 
will accomplish just the opposite. We will be making a decision 
that will lead to additional and longer term employment, 
ensuring the survival of Norman Wells for the next 25 years.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-25 will help create continued prosperity to the 
community which is already the transportation hub for the 
region and is fast becoming a regional centre for government 
services and tourism. Norman Wells has a promising future but a 
future that needs a healthy northern petroleum industry.
<P>
	I would like to briefly outline for hon. members just how 
important the Norman Wells project is to the economy of the 
Northwest Territories.
<P>
	In 1993 expenditures in Norman Wells production activities 
totalled $36 million, about half of which was spent in the north 
and all of which was spent in Canada. The oil field provides 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4085"> 4085 </A></B>
<P>
some $3.7 million in wages to northern workers each year. More 
than 30 companies in Norman Wells and over 20 companies in 
other northern communities owe at least part of their annual 
business to the project.
<P>
	By revising the proven area agreement of 1994 the 
government will extend the life of the field by 12 years or more 
and ensure that these annual expenditures continue well into the 
next century.
<P>
	Hon. members can appreciate that Imperial Oil's plan to 
undertake a $30 million drilling program is extremely good 
news for northern businesses and communities. Northern 
businesses will supply about 37 per cent of the goods and 
services used in the drilling program. They will also benefit 
from the opportunity to learn up to date horizontal drilling 
techniques. This capability will enhance future business and 
employment opportunities for northern firms not only in the 
Territories but also in northern Alberta and British Columbia 
where there is currently a shortage of such expertise.
<P>
	As the minister has already stated, some $20 million of the 
proposed $30 million drilling program will be spent in the south, 
mostly in Alberta. Even without the drilling program Norman 
Wells is responsible for annual wages of $2.8 million in the 
south.
<P>
	Looking at this issue from a different perspective, it is clear 
that Canada cannot afford to abandon a project such as Norman 
Wells until the field has produced to its fullest potential. This, 
too, would be an irresponsible course of action. We have 
significant oil reserves in this country but that is no excuse to be 
wasteful.
<P>
	Norman Wells is currently the fourth largest producing field 
in Canada. It yields about 33,000 barrels of oil a day and 
generated more than $50 million in revenues to the government 
in 1992. The Norman Wells field has made an important 
contribution to Canada's energy supply over the past 40 years. 
With this amendment it can continue to play an important role 
for at least the next 25 years.
<P>
	In 1994 the agreement was thought to capture the entire field 
and the anticipated termination of the agreement in 2008 was 
believed to be the full productive life of the field. Today, 
however, information gathered from prolonged production and 
advance technology demonstrates that the extent of the field 
should be redefined and expanded and the expiration date should 
be extended to capture the full productive capability of the field.
<P>
	The National Energy Board has conducted an independent 
review of Imperial's assessments and has corroborated the 
conclusion that the oil field extends beyond the 1944 boundaries 
as well as the corporation's projections on the remaining 
production life beyond 2002.
<P>
	The National Energy Board's technical assessment supported 
Imperial's view that effective reservoir management is best 
accomplished by expanding the existing proven area to include 
the fringe areas.
<P>
	The current practice under the Canada Petroleum Resources 
Act to issue production rights involves a competitive bidding 
process, but the fringe areas of the field lying outside the proven 
area agreement are unlikely  to be developed if removed from 
the context of the entire field. There is a risk, therefore, that if 
the current policy is adhered to sound management of the field 
would be compromised since the outlying reserves would be left 
in the ground and maximum recovery of the field would never be 
achieved.
<P>
	The proposal to extend the agreement to ensure that full 
commercial production of the reserves is achieved is consistent 
with all the federal and provincial oil and gas legislation.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Given the special circumstances, the proposal to expand and 
extend the Norman Wells proven area agreement has been 
supported by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. 
The proposed Norman Wells amending agreement of 1944 has 
two components.
<P>
	First, it marginally adjusts the boundaries of the proven area 
to capture the fringe areas so that the field is developed as a 
single entity and, second, it extends the term for as long as there 
is commercial production.
<P>
	Production from this field is governed under the Norman 
Wells proven area agreement and therefore this unique 
agreement has always been excluded from the Canada 
Petroleum Resources Act. For this reason revisions to the 
agreement must also be referenced in the act.
<P>
	Hon. members should be aware that the proposed changes to 
the proven area agreement have been reviewed according to the 
government's environmental assessment process for policy and 
program proposals. No significant environmental impacts were 
identified. Nevertheless further reviews will be carried out prior 
to the approval of the drilling program.
<P>
	Following a period of restructuring and downsizing, Canada's 
oil patch is showing signs of a strong and sustained recovery. 
Exploration and drilling activity has increased significantly. 
Investor interest is also up. Last year, approximately $6 billion 
was invested in the Canadian petroleum industry.
<P>
	In this time of resurgence, Bill C-25 will draw attention to the 
vast resources and the new opportunities for opening up in the 
north. Junior oil firms may find the north particularly appealing 
since these smaller firms can often develop projects that would 
not be profitable for the more major firms.
<P>
	With the ongoing development of northern land claims, the 
affected aboriginal people have indicated a strong desire to 
participate in resource development projects. The territorial 
governments also welcome new resource development activity 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4086"> 4086 </A></B>
<P>
because of the employment, tax revenues and new business 
opportunities generated.
<P>
	With the right signal from Ottawa, northern Canada could 
become the focus of significant investor attention, exploration 
and development activity over the next two or three years. This 
House can send that signal by giving prompt approval to Bill 
C-25.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus and as natural 
resources critic for the New Democratic Party in this House, I 
am pleased to participate in the debate regarding Bill C-25.
<P>
	Our party throughout the last number of years has taken a very 
active interest in the natural resources sector in Canada. In 
Saskatchewan we have been involved at least in terms of the 
provincial government in encouraging oil companies to pursue 
enhanced oil recovery techniques.
<P>
	I am happy to say that in Saskatchewan we have seen Morgan 
Hydrocarbons, Sceptre Resources, North Canadian Oils and a 
number of other companies pioneer the technology of horizontal 
well drilling. It has been very successful.
<P>
	Before I get into that, I want to say that on behalf of our 
caucus I give our commitment that on condition we will support 
this bill. We believe the bill is important in terms of economic 
activity in the north. We believe it is extremely important with 
respect to creating jobs in the north and other parts of the 
country.
<P>
	We particularly support the aspect where the country receives 
one-third of the profits from this project. One of the conditions 
in terms of our support is that the agreement continues to give 
Canadians one-third of the profits from this project in its 
expanded mode.
<P>
	The reason I say that is with enhanced oil recovery and 
particularly horizontal oil well drilling, that increases 
production of wells in the Saskatchewan experience up to 500 
and 600 per cent. That means when the production increases so 
dramatically, it shortens the life of the resource in the ground in 
terms of how long one can do this.
<P>
	The other reason I am concerned about this bill, and I will be 
asking these questions in committee, is this. We in the House are 
not quite sure whether there will be any reduction in royalties as 
a result of the increased production that horizontal oil well 
drilling will provide.
<P>
	If we continue to get our 5 per cent royalty and we continue to 
receive one-third of the profits and the spinoff from the 
expenditures by Imperial Oil with respect to jobs, that will be 
suitable in terms of our requirements with respect to supporting 
the bill.
<P>
	We are very pleased to hear that the bill will only be passed on 
the condition that there is some commitment to provide the 
Sahtu nation with the bill it is interested in seeing put through 
the House of Commons as well.
<P>
	As a member of the House and as a Canadian I am concerned 
that we monitor the impact on the environment as this project 
proceeds, in particular with  horizontal oil well drilling. We 
have found in Saskatchewan's experience that the EOR which 
takes place is not dramatically problematic for the environment, 
but there are some concerns in very environmentally fragile 
areas. I would hope the government would certainly ensure the 
monitoring process involve the government when these things 
are watched from time to time.
<P>
	I am not sure whether the other questions I have are for the 
House or for the committee. The New Democrats will be 
monitoring the length of time Imperial Oil will recapture its 
capital costs. We believe there is an opportunity because of the 
longevity of the resource project for the oil company to 
recapture its capital costs over a more moderate period of time 
as opposed to an accelerated period of time.
<P>
	Imperial Oil is telling the government that the resource is very 
solid, that there is a lot of it in the ground, and that it is a long 
term project. I have every reason to believe that to be the case. I 
think as an assurance our government should say if that is the 
case it will allow it to write off its capital cost allowance and 
other capital costs over a moderate period of time as opposed to 
a very short period of time. This would be a responsible 
approach to the project. The other upside to doing so is that 
when it is done Canadians can share, as can the Sahtu, in the 
profits those wells will provide over the short term.
<P>
	I thank members of the House for allowing me to raise our 
questions on the matter. In summary, we will support the bill as 
long as the concerns we have raised are addressed in a 
reasonable fashion.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)

<P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">PROCEEDINGS ON ADJOURNMENT MOTION</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PAYEQUITY">PAY EQUITY</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue 
of pay equity affects a large number of women in Canada and 
Quebec. The issue is one of equity and equality between men 
and women. Through pay equity, an employer, which includes 
governments, recognizes the equal value of work done by men 
and women and, in so doing, enables female employees to reach 
a standing of living comparable to that of male employees.
<P>
	However, this government apparently does not want to move 
on this issue. I have risen in my seat several times to condemn 
the government's failure to act in this respect. Twice, I asked the 
president of Treasury Board how he intended to correct the pay 
inequity existing in Canada's public service. I also asked when 
the government intended to pay its female workforce the 
amounts it was granted under a judgment by the Human Rights 
Tribunal. I was given reassurances but no firm commitment.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	On January 20, at the beginning of this Parliament, I was told 
that this government was most committed to the matter of pay 
equity and had made a formal commitment to public service 
employees that it would set an example in this respect. I may 
recall this was back in mid-January.
<P>
	On March 8, International Women's Day, I twice condemned 
the government's failure to act on the issue of pay equity. In 
reply, the Secretary of State responsible for the Status of Women 
said: ``Women must have a place in the job world, receive equal 
pay for work of equal value and contribute their fair share to our 
collective wealth''.
<P>
	She went on to say: ``I feel privileged to be part of a 
government which is determined to accelerate the advancement 
of economic opportunities for women''.
<P>
	With all her eloquence, the Secretary of State was carefully 
avoiding mentioning any concrete projects aimed at achieving 
this goal.
<P>
	Finally, on April 19, I again tried to get a real answer from the 
government. At the time, the media had announced that an 
agreement had been reached by the Government of Quebec with 
its employees, under which the employer was committed to pay 
$115 million in various forms of salary adjustments for certain 
employment categories. I took this opportunity to  encourage 
the Liberal government to follow Quebec's example but to no 
avail.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board gave me a very brief 
answer: he used the fact that legal procedures were in process 
not to answer.
<P>
	I rise this evening to remind the government how important 
pay equity is for women. I want to remind the government of its 
campaign promises. I want to ask this government why it 
relentlessly carries on legal proceedings which cost $2 million a 
year according to the Chief Commissioner of the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission.
<P>
	I want to ask the government when it will stop this shameless 
squandering of money in the courts and when it will give these 
amounts to those who need it the most, that is the female 
employees of the Public Service of Canada.
<P>
	I want to ask this government when it plans to respect the 
court orders and to pay back the salaries it owes its employees.
<P>
	I ask this government to let us know what schedule it has 
established for honouring its moral and legal obligations 
towards its employees.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to be able to answer the question of the hon. member, a 
question I asked in the House often from a seat very near to 
where she is sitting at this moment to the previous government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to point out to her and to others who may be listening 
that pay equity is not simply a matter that affects women, but 
women and men working in groups that are dominated by 
females in any employment situation.
<P>
	Since the proclamation of the Canadian Human Rights Act in 
1978 by a Liberal government and the enshrinement of the 
principle of equal pay for work of equal value within section 11 
of the act, the government, the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, unions and employees have all worked in different 
ways to try to make it a reality.
<P>
	Between 1985 and 1990, for instance, the government of the 
day sponsored a joint union-management study to actively seek 
out sex based disparities in salary. When this process collapsed 
the previous government unilaterally determined to pay over 
70,000 employees retroactive payments of approximately $317 
million and ongoing annual salary adjustments of roughly $81 
million. As of March 1994 the government had paid over $700 
million to affected employees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4088"> 4088 </A></B>
<P>
	The unions, however, believed that these payments were 
inadequate and submitted five new or revised equal pay 
complaints covering nine predominantly female occupational 
groups and asked for the appointment of a human rights tribunal.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the assumption of the member's question, 
this tribunal has not yet rendered a decision. Another human 
rights tribunal did render a decision three years ago. This 
decision applied only to employees in the hospital services 
group. This decision has been implemented at a cost of 
approximately $32 million.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	This government is interested in results and wants to achieve 
the important goal of economic equality for women in the public 
service. We have, therefore, already invited a dialogue with the 
unions. There has been one meeting and there are others planned 
with the purpose of reaching a mutually agreed upon negotiated 
settlement of the pay equity issue that is now before the human 
rights tribunal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, the government wishes to build ties of co-operation 
and confidence with the unions representing federal public 
servants. As for the agreements at the provincial level, the 
Quebec Government and the unions representing its workers are 
continuing their negotiations. There is no agreement yet.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on March 7, I raised with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development the concern that Canadians have at the 
breakneck speed with which social security reform is taking 
place in Canada.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that the provincial governments have put a 
break on that breakneck speed and have slowed the process 
down to give people in Canada more of an opportunity to look at 
the implications.
<P>
	I also raised with him the concern that one in three Canadians 
have that the main aim of his social policy reform is to in fact cut 
social program expenditures. He responded that the objective of 
reform was to get programs to meet needs. This is a noble goal 
but one which the government is falling far short on because we 
have in Canada 1.3 million children living in poverty. We have 
1.6 million Canadians on unemployment insurance, 2.4 million 
Canadians on social assistance and who knows how many 
Canadians underemployed, working  part time when they want 
to work full time, not making full use of their qualifications.
<P>
	We have a crisis in unemployment in this country which the 
government is sitting back and watching, preferring instead to 
focus on social policy reform and not dealing with the matter at 
its core which is to make this economy function effectively for, 
as I say, those over four million Canadians who are without work 
and who want work.
<P>
	It is clear, as everyone in this House will know, that the best 
social policy is a job. Yet we are still seeing unemployment rates 
hovering over 11 per cent. Recent studies show that if half a 
million more Canadians were working full time, provincial and 
federal governments between them would collect approximately 
$12 billion in additional revenue on top of savings to 
unemployment insurance. Clearly if we get Canada working 
again the problems about social programs become much less 
significant.
<P>
	Even dealing with some of the government's successes in 
terms of providing 80,000 young Canadians with job 
opportunities, that still leaves over 320,000 unable to find work; 
320,000 of our future, our young people in Canada not able to 
find work.
<P>
	There are other ways the government seems to refuse to 
pursue. For example, there are opportunities to raise tax dollars 
from the richest in our country and from corporations. Indeed, 
over $140 billion in corporate profits have gone untaxed in the 
last nine years. If Exxon in Canada had paid its 1992-93 
deferred taxes $600,000 child care spaces would have been 
created. Imagine what we could have done about getting 
Canadians back to work through that process.
<P>
	We know that half the government's debt is due to tax breaks 
and loopholes for wealthy Canadians. Statistics Canada has told 
us that. We know that 44 per cent is due to high interest rates. 
Only 6 per cent is due to program spending and only half of that 
from social program spending.
<P>
	However, the government attacks just 3 per cent social 
program spending rather than attacking the core problem which 
is that Canada does not work for 4.5 million Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Also we could look at a wealth taxes, we could look at more 
effective tax auditing and we could even look at lowering the 
limits for RRSPs if we were looking to balance some of the 
problems that Canadians face and if we were looking to respond 
with adequate social programs.

	We now have confusion within the government. Once the 
Prime Minister said that there would be no more need for budget 
cuts, now he has agreed with his finance minister that there will 
be need for budget cuts. They look to be severe budget cuts in 
order to respond to the way this government is looking at dealing 
with the deficit which is the same way all Conservative and 
Liberal governments across the country have dealt with it, 
which is to attack the most vulnerable in society.

	I think what we should do is slow down the speed. We should 
give those who support the least well off in society the 
opportunity to develop adequate-

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians know that programs introduced in the fifties and the 
sixties are no longer adequate. They simply do not meet the 
challenges that we as individual Canadians face in our society.
<P>
	It is for this reason that the Liberal government under the 
leadership of the Minister of Human Resources Development on 
January 31 this year outlined a three stage process to bring about 
positive change in the lives of Canadians.
<P>
	We are looking at the whole issue of child care, 
unemployment insurance, support for families, social services, 
social assistance and other forms of income support. This 
initiative is comprehensive in nature. It will through the 
redesigning of the programs give Canadians the type of social 
security system that they have been certainly calling for for 
decades.
<P>
	This government has seen the need and certainly has the 
political will and courage to address those concerns. We will in 
the coming weeks be releasing an action plan which will provide 
direction and options for reform for Canadians.
<P>
	This process will be extensive, open and will engage 
Canadians from coast to coast so that when we are speaking 
about modernizing, when we are speaking about restructuring 
Canada's social security system, when we are speaking about 
giving our young people, our older workers and the working 
population the types of skills required to face the challenges of 
the 21st century, Canadians will be given that by this 
government.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
On March 25, I asked the Minister of Finance the following 
question, after reminding him that we had just learned that for 
the next two years, unemployment insurance cuts would amount 
to $630 million a year in the maritimes, and $535 million in 
Quebec. We do not know what they will be this year, and it 
appears that Employment and Immigration does not know 
either.
<P>
	My question was: Is the Minister of Finance prepared to defer 
cutbacks in the unemployment insurance system at least long 
enough to put in place a real job creation strategy to help the 
jobless find work instead of forcing them onto welfare? Six 
hundred and thirty million dollars a year in Atlantic Canada and 
$535 million in Quebec, and I am not mentioning cuts in Ontario 
and western Canada because cuts in Quebec and the maritimes 
represent 60 per cent of the total whereas they only have 33 per 
cent of the Canadian population.
<P>
	Such cuts will have a devastating impact on the economy and 
yet, the government went ahead and announced these cuts 
without further consideration. That is why I am asking today if it 
is prepared to defer its decision at least long enough for these 
cuts to be preceded by a real job creation program. I will keep on 
asking the same question as long as Bill C-17 has not been 
passed, hoping that the minister will change his mind.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	In the words of Alain Dubuc, a <I>La Presse</I> columnist with 
whom the Official Opposition does not always agree, ``Finance 
Minister Axworthy is mistaken, because the cuts can be found in 
the budget. He is cutting before helping people''. Not only is he 
going ahead with the cuts, he is targeting the regions which will 
be deprived of substantial sums of money. This money, when 
awarded, usually goes to pay rent, buy food and pay for goods 
which are not only essential to people's survival but also help 
keep the local economy humming.
<P>
	Therefore, before depriving these regions whose industries 
have already been hard hit from a structural standpoint, why 
does the minister not postpone his decision so that a true 
program can be implemented, one that will restore hope. Hope is 
what the people want, but instead, the government has fostered a 
climate of despair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
measures in the February 22 budget affecting the unemployment 
insurance program are intended first and foremost to protect the 
jobs of workers across Canada.
<P>
	These changes will result in lower costs for Canadian 
employers, contributing to an increase in exports and helping 
Canadian products to offer stiffer competition to imports. In 
fact, the UI premium reduction will lead to the preservation or 
creation of some 40,000 jobs.
<P>
	In addition and to clarify some of the statistics mentioned by 
the hon. member for Mercier, the impact of these changes will 
be distributed fairly across all regions of the country. Even after 
all budget measures are implemented, workers in Quebec will 
continue to receive more than 31 per cent of all UI benefits paid 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4090"> 4090 </A></B>
<P>
out in spite of the fact that Quebec only has one quarter of 
Canada's population.
<P>
	In fact, last year Quebec received approximately $1.5 billion 
more in UI benefits than it paid in UI premiums.
<P>
	The member for Mercier implied that changes will have a 
significant impact on welfare numbers. In fact, most UI 
recipients go from UI to a job. Three quarters of all people on UI 
do not use all of the weeks of benefits to which they are legally 
entitled. Not many of the people who use up the UI end up on 
welfare. It has been estimated to be about 10 per cent of those 
who run out of UI or about 2 per cent of 3 per cent of all UI 
recipients.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BILLC-91">BILL C-91</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
May 3 last I asked the Minister of Industry if he would be 
waiting until after the Quebec election to repeal Bill C-91, the 
Drug Patent Act, or if he would act in the best interests of all 
Canadians who use prescription drugs and repeal Bill C-91 now.
<P>
	This bill costs Canadians between $1 billion and $2 billion a 
year in extra drug costs.
<P>
	In question period today the member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie asked the Prime Minister again if he 
would be reviewing the legislation. He claimed that any review 
of this legislation brought instability to Quebec. This accusation 
is of course outrageous in the context of his party's goal to break 
up Canada.
<P>
	My sense is that the government will not do anything until 
after the Quebec election or even until after the referendum in 
1995. Why is this government caving in to this pressure from the 
official opposition?
<P>
	I was particularly shocked by the Prime Minister's response 
today when he said that the Minister of Industry would not 
review the legislation if he was satisfied that the pharmaceutical 
manufacturers were spending money on research. This is 
contradictory to comments made by the Minister of Industry in 
April. The minister stated at that time that a review was 
imminent. Why is this government now stalling? Why is there 
this disagreement?
<P>
	I have a quote here from the <I>Kitchener-Waterloo Record</I> of 
Saturday, April 30, 1994 and I quote: ``Foreign Affairs Minister 
Andre Ouellet admitted that this Bill C-91 will cost the country 
billions in higher pharmaceutical prices by granting 20 years of 
patent protection to brand name drugs''. He is now saying: ``We 
are not going to review it because we don't want to rock the 
boat''.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-91 has caused grief to Canadian consumers. There 
should be no further delays in repealing this legislation. We 
have some prescription drugs which have increased by up to 120 
per cent since Bill C-91 was passed. Bloc members have made a 
great deal of noise about how upset they would be if the 
government made any changes to that bill. They voted in favour 
of the bill when it was passed in the House in the last session 
when they were Tories.
<P>
	It is strange that Bloc members, who take pride about 
representing Quebecers, could be so out of touch with their 
constituents. In a recent survey conducted by the Canadian Drug 
Manufacturers Association, 79 per cent of drug consumers said 
that the costs of prescription drugs were too high. This is 16 per 
cent higher than the national average outside Quebec.
<P>
	Many Liberal candidates including the Prime Minister and the 
Deputy Prime Minister campaigned on repealing Bill C-91. 
They knew that Canadians were angry at how expensive their 
drugs had become. They spoke about repealing the bill with 
respect to prescription drugs. They knew what Canadians 
wanted and now is the time to follow through on their promise. 
By delaying to make changes in this legislation is to say to 
Canadians that this is no longer a priority. It is a betrayal to 
Canadians. It is a flip-flop.
<P>
	The Liberals are saying they are not serious about the issue. 
They are having second thoughts about making changes to Bill 
C-91. That would truly be dishonourable, if that were to be the 
case. However it is not much different from the former Tories: 
Liberal, Tory, same old story.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry mentioned in his response to me that 
he was looking into the implications of changes to this bill under 
GATT. I remind the government there was a clause in GATT for 
``reasonable exceptions'' under which the old system of 
compulsory licensing could be introduced. Canadians should 
not be surprised that the Liberals have a change of heart. After 
all, it is not the first time we have seen Liberals campaign on one 
side of an issue only to change their position later on after the 
campaign. For some people who have forgotten, NAFTA is an 
example, as is cruise missile testing.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt but the 
member's four minutes are up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by saying to the 
member for Regina-Lumsden that we are not running away 
from our election commitment. We are committed to reviewing 
this legislation. We are not having second thoughts.
<P>
	I want to talk about the challenge we are facing to ensure the 
development of a strong pharmaceutical industry and to make 
patented drugs available to consumers at reasonable prices in a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4091"> 4091 </A></B>
<P>
manner consistent with our international obligations under 
GATT and NAFTA.
<P>
	Multinational pharmaceutical companies have committed to 
reaching an R and D sales ratio of 10 per cent by 1996. They 
have also made investment announcements now exceeding $680 
million for the 1992 to 1996 period. We want to ensure these 
commitments are realized.
<P>
	On the price side, pharmaceutical companies cannot charge 
any price they want for patented medicines. Prices are regulated 
by the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board. The increase in 
prices of existing patented medicines from 1987 to 1992 average 
2.9 per cent versus 4.2 per cent for the CPI.
<P>
	Let me close by saying that the government is committed to 
both a strong economy and the needs of consumers. We are not 
running away from our election commitment.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INDIANAFFAIRS">INDIAN AFFAIRS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week, 
on Wednesday, to be exact, I asked the Minister of Indian Affairs 
two questions about the forgotten people of Oka. Of course, the 
questions were based on a letter from the Kanesatake Chamber 
of Commerce written on April 26 to the Right Hon. Jean 
Chrétien, with copies to Lucien Bouchard, Claude Bachand and 
Ron Irwin.
<P>
	In this letter, the president of the Chamber of Commerce 
mentions several irregularities, including the diversion of funds 
from the band council; that is, economic development funds 
were used for other purposes.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	In answer to the question I asked him, the minister said that he 
did not have the letter, which as I just told you was dated April 
26. I would really like to have an answer concerning the 
allegations of diversion of funds.
<P>
	The second question concerned the decline in economic 
development in the Kanesatake community. The Chamber of 
Commerce represents 80 per cent of the native businesses in 
Kanesatake and of course all the violence, insecurity and 
instability in Kanesatake have led to huge economic losses.
<P>
	Naturally, all businesses are facing economic decline. On that 
subject, the minister reminded me that it was the previous 
government that had brought the army out, while this 
government was prepared to negotiate and was bringing natives 
from Kanesatake to Ottawa to deal with them. In that respect, I 
think the hon. minister is mistaken; economic development 
problems in Kanesatake are due to a greater extent to 
mismanagement on the part of the government.
<P>
	Examples abound where it has become almost indecent to see 
how the federal government is washing its hands of an economic 
situation created mainly by a small group of offenders known to 
everyone out there. The government must know who they are as 
well. So, what  does the government do to solve the problem? 
Nothing at all.
<P>
	Theft, vandalism and violence continue. It is no small task to 
go shopping in Kanesatake when you are greeted with machine 
gun fire and wonder if you are not in a western movie.
<P>
	Unfortunately, reality in this case goes beyond fiction. Audio 
material show that night after night, there is non-stop shooting 
in Kanesatake. You do not have to think too long to figure out 
why businesses are on the decline.
<P>
	People wonder what the government intends to do to curb this 
decline and why it does not take seriously the whole issue of 
public safety in Kanesatake.
<P>
	Just yesterday two gas tanks blew up in Kanesatake; one in 
``la Pinède'' in Oka, and the other one in Les Terrasses 
Raymond, with the result that the entire community had no sleep 
all night.
<P>
	Every day violence breaks out. Even the children in the 
Kanesatake school have written the Chief to tell him this has to 
stop. This must be stopped because I think the children even said 
in their letter that they were afraid to ride their bikes and walk in 
the village.
<P>
	People are unable to insure their homes and businesses. 
Mortgages are not being renewed because of the unstable 
climate, and nobody is doing anything. The government is 
acting with carelessness in this matter.
<P>
	My question is this: Regarding the alleged misappropriation 
of funds, what is the government doing to correct the situation 
and, regarding economic development, what concrete measures 
does the government intend to take to restore public safety in 
Kanesatake and give businesses the help they expect from their 
government to overcome this crisis once and for all?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to respond to the question raised on May 4 by the 
hon. member for Saint-Jean regarding the letter sent by Roger 
Simon, chairman of the Kanesatake chamber of commerce, 
dated April 26.
<P>
	Mr. Simon is blaming the carelessness of the federal 
government particularly for the collapse of native businesses 
and for the alleged misappropriation of federal subsidies by the 
band council in an unstable situation where public security is 
concerned.
<P>
	Public security in the Oka-Kanesatake area is the 
responsibility of le ministère de la sécurité publique du Québec. 
It is la sûreté du Québec that provides security services to all 
residents of this area.

<P>
	The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
met on several occasions with Grand Chief Peltier to discuss 
properties bought by the federal government since the Oka crisis 
of 1990. These discussions were conducted in order to establish 
a unified land base.
<P>
	The minister has proposed various solutions in order to settle 
the transfer of properties to the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake. 
This is a very complex file. It remains a priority and requires a 
mutually acceptable solution to all parties involved.
<P>
	Regarding the alleged misappropriation of economic 
development funds, the band has flexibility to manage the funds 
according to the agreement signed with the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development. The Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development does not interfere 
with the day to day business of a band's operations. Such 
interference would be paternalistic. Band councils and chiefs 
are accountable to the band members who elect them.
<P>
	Those economic development funds are included in the 
recovery plans signed between the Department of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development and the Mohawk Council of 
Kanesatake last January.
