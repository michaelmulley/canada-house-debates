	<B>Hon. StÃ©phane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have the honour to inform the House that, later 
today, I will be giving notice to bring this constitutional 
amendment resolution before the House and to refer it to a Special 
Joint Committee, which will be asked to report back to Parliament.
<P>
	One week ago, on April 15, 1997, the Quebec National 
Assembly voted unanimously in favour of a resolution for a 
constitutional amendment that would end the application to Quebec 
of subsections (1) to (4) of section 93 (education) of the 
<I>Constitution Act, 1867.</I>
<P>
	On receiving such a proposed amendment, members and 
senators must ask themselves three fundamental questions. First: 
what amending formula is applicable to this particular case? 
Second: is the proposed amendment a good thing for the citizens 
affected by it? And third: does this amendment enjoy a reasonable 
degree of support from the citizens affected by it? I will give the 
Govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10030"> 10030 </A></B>
<P>
ment's answers to each of theses three questions  in the case of the 
amendment we have received from the Quebec National Assembly.
<P>
	First question: which amending formula applies? In the opinion 
of the federal government, section 93 can be amended pursuant to 
section 43 of the <I>Constitution Act, 1982.</I> Section 43 deals with the 
provisions applicable to one or more, but not all, provinces. The 
amendment can be made with the approval of the House of 
Commons and ``chaque province concernÃ©e'' in the French version, 
or ``each province to which the amendment applies'' in the English 
version, which is more specific here. This means that the 
amendment will affect only Quebec, but will not change the 
constitutional provisions applicable to the other provinces.
<P>
	Before the constitutional amendment of 1982, it would have 
been impossible to amend section 93 unless the traditional means 
provided by the <I>Constitution Act, 1867</I> had been used. It would 
have been necessary to ask the Westminster Parliament to ratify the 
amendment.
<P>
	The constitutional amendment passed by the National Assembly 
clearly falls within the class of bilateral amendments provided for 
in section 43 of the <I>Constitution Act, 1982.</I> The legal opinions we 
have received are quite definite on that point. And that is what I 
told my counterpart Jacques Brassard, Quebec's Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, at our first meeting on this matter on 
February 7 this year.
<P>
	Since this is a bilateral amendment, it must be debated by each 
of the two Parliaments. But these debates should not be 
simultaneous, in order to avoid possible confusion. For each of the 
four bilateral amendments made to date, the debate was held first in 
the province's legislative assembly, since the initiative came from 
the province. And again on this occasion, since the initiative came 
from the province, and in view of the fact that it concerns one of its 
areas of jurisdiction-education-it was necessary for the debate 
to take place first in the National Assembly. That debate has just 
ended with a unanimous vote in favour of the proposed 
amendment.
<P>
	The Canadian Parliament can now play its part. Since the 
Constitution requires its assent, it must make its own decision as to 
the value of the proposed amendment. Indeed, it is its duty to do so, 
since it represents the citizens affected by the amendment, as does 
the provincial assembly. The Parliament of Canada is also the 
Parliament of Quebecers. Federal institutions are also the 
institutions of Quebecers.
<P>
	The Canadian government believes that the proposed 
constitutional amendment is a good thing, and I will now explain 
why.
<P>
	The origins of section 93 of the <I>Constitution Act, 1867</I> predate 
Confederation. This section was included in the Canadian 
Constitution to grant education to the provinces and to reassure 
religious minorities as to their rights at the time when the single 
Province of Canada  was about to be divided to create the provinces 
of Quebec and Ontario. The purpose of the sections was to protect 
the Catholic and Protestant religious minorities. Those guarantees 
were then extended to other Canadian provinces.
<P>
	Until the Quiet Revolution, Catholic and Protestant Quebecers 
were apparently satisfied with this system based on 19th century 
political and social values. However, following the report of the 
provincial commission of inquiry on education in 1966, there were 
many discussions in Quebec on the appropriateness of a system 
with denominational foundations. Like most other western 
societies, Quebec society was now secular.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	On the francophone side, the present organization of school 
boards makes it more difficult to integrate newcomers into 
francophone society, as provided by provincial legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The anglophone community long regarded the Protestant school 
board as an institution vital to its development. However, these 
school boards have never encompassed Catholic anglophones. On 
the other hand, they have accepted a growing number of children 
whose language of instruction is French. As a result, there is a 
danger that in the medium term the anglophone community may 
lose control of boards that are an increasingly inadequate reflection 
of the social reality and that, in any case, cannot respond to the 
needs of the Catholic populations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why many voices, both francophone and anglophone, 
Catholic as well as Protestant, have been heard over the last twenty 
years advocating a system based on language rather than religion. 
A consensus on the need to reorganize school organization along 
these lines has existed in Quebec for some time.
<P>
	However, for various reasons, all previous attempts have failed, 
including the proposal by Quebec's Minister of Education, Pauline 
Marois, last June. The Government of Quebec then contemplated a 
constitutional amendment to allow secularization of school 
organization. This amendment raises the issue of religious rights, 
but also, indirectly, the issue of linguistic rights, in view of the 
historically close links between Protestant school borads and the 
anglophone community.
<P>
	Let us look first at the religious issue. The contemplated 
amendment will end application of subsections (1) to (4) of section 
93 of the <I>Constitution Act, 1867</I> to Quebec, and will accordingly 
eliminate these religious guarantees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10031"> 10031 </A></B>
<P>
	Although Quebecers approve of secularization of school 
organization, many are attached to religious instruction. Quebec's 
Minister of Education, Pauline  Marois, has already indicated that 
schools that so wish may retain their denominational orientation. 
Furthermore, the right to religious instruction is still guaranteed by 
section 41 of the Quebec <I>Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms</I>.
<P>
	Let us now consider the language issue. The proposed 
amendment would not weaken the constitutional rights of the 
anglophone minority. The Act which amended the Canadian 
Constitution in 1982 guaranteed minority language educational 
rights for the first time, in section 23 of the <I>Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms</I>.
<P>
	While it is true that the National Assembly does not recognize 
the <I>Constitution Act, 1982</I>, the resolution it is sending us is 
preceded by a ``whereas'' clause which ``reaffirms the established 
rights of the English-speaking community of Quebec''. Indeed, 
section 23 of the Charter was drafted at the time bearing in mind 
Quebec's policies on the language of education. And the 
Government of Quebec does not contest its applicability. The 
resolution I am tabling today is preceded by a ``whereas'' clause 
which reaffirms that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
applies everywhere in Canada.
<P>
	Section 23 of the charter provides strong constitutional 
guarantees to the minority language community. Section 93 
guarantees only the existence of denominational administrative 
structures in Montreal and Quebec City, and the right of dissent in 
the rest of the province, but it does not protect language rights. 
Furthermore, the control and management of linguistic school 
organization are in fact guaranteed by the case law flowing from 
section 23 of the charter and not from section 93.
<P>
	In the <I>MahÃ©</I> judgment (1990), the Supreme Court ruled that 
section 23 ``<I>confers a right which places positive obligations on the 
government to alter or develop major institutional structures.</I>'' 
Since that time, other judgments have confirmed the interpretation 
of the <I>MahÃ©</I> decision.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is true that the scope of the right to instruction in the minority 
language provided in section 23 varies according to the number of 
students involved. In the case law, however, the bar for granting the 
minority the right to establish and control an administrative 
structure such as a school board, or simply to participate in it, has 
not been set very high. Although there were only 242 francophone 
children attending a school in Edmonton at the time of the MahÃ© 
decision, the Supreme Court ruled that this created a right for the 
minority to manage and control its schools through a system of 
linguistic minority representation within the school boards.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is, in a way thanks to the constitutional amendments of 1982 
that the Government of Quebec can proceed as it is intending to do 
today. It is precisely because the right to instruction in the language 
of the minority and the concomitant right to administer structures 
are protected by the <I>Constitution Act, 1982</I> that it is possible for the 
Quebec government to propose that denominational rights no 
longer apply within the province.
<P>
	Now, moving to the support for the proposed amendment, the 
third question, it is certainly preferable that a proposed 
constitutional amendment garner the support of the population in 
question, including minorities if they are affected. This is 
especially important when dealing with constitutional matters.
<P>
	Not that minorities are always right. (By that logic, we would 
still be under the sway of aristocrats!) But members of Parliament 
are duty bound to be guided by a favourable bias towards 
minorities. This princicple applies to constitutional matters in 
particular, for constitutional democracies exist to protect individual 
rights as well as minority rights. At least, that is the Liberal 
government's vision of Canada.
<P>
	In the matter before us, the Government of Canada notes the 
unanimous vote in the National Assembly and the existence of a 
reasonably broad consensus, which includes members of all 
components of Quebec society.
<P>
	Some Catholics are opposed to the amendment but their bishops 
do not object to it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some groups from the anglophone community would have liked 
the national assembly to take this opportunity to strengthen the 
linguistic minority's constitutional rights. This is, to be sure, a 
noble objective. The Government of Canada would welcome with 
open arms any province that wanted to strengthen the rights of its 
linguistic minority and become an example to the other provinces.
<P>
	We did not demand of the province of New Brunswick that other 
provinces adhere to official bilingualism before agreeing to New 
Brunswick's request to entrench the equal status of its two 
linguistic communities in the Constitution in 1993. Our passion for 
equality must never be synonymous with the lowest common 
denominator.
<P>
	However, the fact that the constitutional amendment does not 
strengthen the minority is not a sufficient reason to object to it. The 
important thing is that the amendment not infringe on this 
minority's rights and that it garners a reasonable level of support 
with the minority community.

	The broader the consensus, the easier it will be to implement the 
constitutional amendment under the right conditions. The 
Government of Canada believes that the parliamentary committee 
it intends to form could provide an opportunity to broaden the 
consensus. The important issues raised by the amendment will be 
studied within a parliamentary framework, in accordance with the 
democratic culture that Quebecers share with other Canadians. A 
variety of experts, groups and citizens could thus be given the 
opportunity to express their points of view and to listen to the 
responses of their members of Parliament.
<P>
	In order to match speed with due parliamentary procedure, this 
will be a joint committee, enabling MPs ans senators to do their 
word simultaneously.
<P>
	To conclude, the government is of the view that the proposed 
constitutional amendment we have received from the National 
Assembly falls within the class of bilateral amendments provided 
for in section 43 of the <I>Constitution Act, 1982</I>. The government 
believes that this amendment should be passed expeditiously, in 
accordance with parliamentary procedure, for it will have positive 
consequences for Quebec society, including both of its linguistic 
communities.
<P>
	Quebec society has succeeded in reaching a consensus on a 
constitutional issue which touches upon the vital issues of 
schooling language and religion.
<P>
	This demonstrates the remarkable nature of Quebec society and 
the extent to which it contributes, in its way, to Canada's greatness.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to the proposal of the 
Government of Quebec to amend the Constitution Act, 1867. The 
Quebec government's objective is to abolish the denominational 
school system it inherited from Queen Victoria and establish, 
within its territory, linguistic school boards which reflect the 
reality of Quebec society today.
<P>
	The proposed amendment to the Constitution Act, 1867, is 
relatively straightforward. It would involve adding a new section 
93A providing that subsections (1) to (4) of section 93 do not apply 
to Quebec. The new section would have many advantages. It would 
fully maintain the application to Quebec of the preamble to section 
93, in which the provinces are given exclusive jurisdiction over 
education, and it would free Quebec of all the constraints in 
subsections (1) to (4) of the section 93, an essential prerequisite for 
rebuilding the school system on any other than a denominational 
basis.
<P>
	For some time there has been a very broad consensus among 
both francophones and anglophones on the need to secularize the 
school system administration in Quebec.  More than 30 years ago, 
the Parent commission appointed by the Liberal government of 
Jean Lesage recommended replacing denominational school boards 
with unified school boards that would administer all schools, both 
French and English, in their respective districts.
<P>
	Since then another trend has developed favouring linguistic 
school boards, an approach strongly supported by anglophones. All 
the governments that tried to replace denominational school boards 
with unified school boards and linguistic school boards came up 
against the uncompromising provisions of section 93.
<P>
	In 1984, the National Assembly passed legislation to reorganize 
school boards on the basis of language of education. This 
legislation was thrown out by the courts because of section 93, 
although it merely diminished the territory of denominational 
school boards, without removing the boards.
<P>
	Subsequently, we had Bill 107 in 1988. To comply with the 
provisions of section 93, this legislation provided that linguistic 
school boards would be established but denominational school 
boards would continue to exist. This legislation never came into 
force, because implementation would have led to unprecedented 
fragmentation of the public school system.
<P>
	For instance, the City of Montreal would have had four school 
boards: one Catholic, one Protestant, one francophone and one 
anglophone. By adding linguistic school boards on top of existing 
denominational school boards, the new plan would create a school 
system that was fragmented, segregationist and costly, at a time 
when the emphasis was on streamlining administration, on 
integration and intercultural dialogue and bringing together 
citizens of all origins and faiths.
<P>
	We must realize that section 93 clearly puts certain constraints 
on attempts to modernize school boards in Quebec.
<P>
	Some may think that the proposed constitutional amendment 
violates the rights of the anglophone minority in Quebec. However, 
section 93 does not have the slightest connection with the rights of 
the anglophone minority in Quebec. It concerns neither the 
language of education nor language teaching. It concerns only the 
privileges granted at the time to two specific groups on the basis of 
their religious affiliation. In the 19th century, in Quebec City and 
Montreal, some English speaking Catholics preferred at the time to 
be identified as Catholics.
<P>
	The assumption that constitutional guarantees for Protestant 
school boards were intended to protect the anglophone minority 
has already been rejected by the courts.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10033"> 10033 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	In this regard, I refer you to a decision by the Supreme Court in 
1981 in which the court stated that section 93 provided religious 
and not linguistic guarantees. The theory that section 93 protects 
the anglophone minority was not upheld either by the drafters of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, who felt it 
appropriate to introduce section 23, which serves to guarantee 
rights to education in English in Quebec and the right for this 
education to be provided in institutions of the anglophone minority.
<P>
	If we want to promote the rights of the anglophone minority in 
the area of school administration, we would do much better to 
permit the creation of linguistic school boards, as the Government 
of Quebec is proposing, than to maintain the Protestant school 
boards. Quebec's demographic reality imposes this approach.
<P>
	Of the students enrolled in primary or secondary public 
education in Quebec, whose mother tongue is English, 34.3 per 
cent consider themselves Catholic, 32.4 per cent consider 
themselves Protestant and 33.2 per cent practice another religion or 
declare none.
<P>
	On the Island of Montreal, the variances are much more 
impressive: 43.4 per cent of anglophone students consider 
themselves Catholic compared with 10.4 per cent who consider 
themselves Protestant. The others, some 46.2 per cent of 
Montreal's anglophone students, hold other religious beliefs or 
have none.
<P>
	Maintaining existing Protestant school boards is no guarantee 
for either the Protestant or anglophone minorities. Furthermore, no 
political party in Quebec and none of the organizations involved in 
the matter to a varying degree has any argument with maintaining 
the English educational networks in Quebec from kindergarten to 
university.
<P>
	Raising the spectre of alleged language persecution as a means 
of opposing the reform of school boards, as Alliance Quebec is 
doing, it totally absurd. The effect of the reform will in fact be to 
enable anglophones to administer the schools that provide teaching 
in English.
<P>
	Since the National Assembly voted unanimously in favour of a 
resolution to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, since 
a broad consensus was formed in Quebec on the question, since the 
Government of Quebec has given the anglophone community some 
reassurance in amending its proposed resolution to reaffirm the 
enshrined rights of English speaking Quebecers, we are entitled to 
ask why the federal government now wants to put the proposed 
constitutional amendment to a joint parliamentary committee.
<P>
	In his speech, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said 
there had been a consensus for 20 years in Quebec on the need to 
reorganize the educational system. By setting up a joint 
parliamentary committee,  the minister now wants to establish a 
broader consensus on the constitutional change. However, the 
scope of this consensus leaves me with the impression that he 
wants unanimity on the issue.
<P>
	Is this a stalling tactic? Democracy has spoken in Quebec, and 
Parliament has no lessons for Quebec on the democratic process. 
The 15th anniversary of the patriation of the Constitution serves to 
remind us. On the subject of democracy, it is absurd to have 
senators, who have no democratic legitimacy in either Quebec or 
Canada, on the joint committee. Need I point out that the senators 
are not elected but appointed directly by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs states that the 
committee will submit its report on May 31. We all know that the 
general elections will be called in a few days, thus dissolving the 
committee. This means then that we are not about to see the 
actualization of the Government of Quebec's proposed 
constitutional amendment.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Despite all, the Bloc Quebecois is prepared to take part in and 
work with the special standing joint committee on the Quebec 
government's proposed constitutional amendment, so long as it sits 
this week to permit passage of the amendment before Parliament is 
recessed.
<P>
	I hope that the federal government will act in good faith in the 
process so that the amendment of section 93 of the Constitution Act 
may be done as quickly as possible and in accordance with the 
wishes of the government and National Assembly of Quebec.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a privilege to respond today on behalf of the Reform Party of 
Canada to this ministerial statement.
<P>
	I note that the Reform Party has not taken a position as a caucus 
on the issue since it was just tabled in the House today. However I 
would like to express a few thoughts which may guide individual 
members during the discussion of this important issue and which 
may help members of the Reform Party in their decision about 
whether to vote for the resolution.
<P>
	I am somewhat surprised but pleased that this request to change 
the Constitution comes from a legislature which denies the validity 
of the Constitution. I suppose we in Parliament are pleased that 
although the political rhetoric from Mr. Bouchard is running high, 
his actions run contrary to his words in actual fact with his 
recognition of the Constitution as the rule of law in the country. He 
is abiding by it. We in the Reform Party wish that he would make a 
public commitment to abide by the Constitution with respect to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10034"> 10034 </A></B>
<P>
question of the  sovereignty of Quebec. I will return to that theme 
in a moment.
<P>
	Reformers are committed to the principle of grassroots 
participation in decision making, especially when it comes to our 
most basic law, the Constitution. Decision making on political 
issues needs to be pushed as far down the political ladder as 
possible to those most affected by the decision.
<P>
	Although politicians in the legislature of Quebec have voted 
unanimously for the resolution, there is a large group of people 
from whom we have not heard. Those are the parents of the 
children in the schools. They may support the resolution or they 
may be against it, but the point is that we simply do not know. 
There have been no public hearings held on the resolution in 
Quebec as far as I know. That is a fundamental flaw in the political 
process which the government has not addressed.
<P>
	Many Reform Party members will vote against the resolution for 
this reason alone. We are changing the legal rights of religious 
minorities and other minorities without hearing from the people 
who might be affected. As I mentioned, many Reformers will find 
that very unpalatable and very hard to support.
<P>
	I am pleased that at least the federal government is referring the 
resolution to a joint committee. It is my hope that the government 
will take its time and not rush the matter through without hearing 
from all those affected, simply because there is an election in the 
offing and the federal government may want to appease the 
Government of Quebec. I hope that will not happen.
<P>
	In my province constitutional change must be approved in a 
provincial referendum before any change is accepted by the 
province of British Columbia. I believe that is the proper way to do 
it.
<P>
	The last time we dealt with a change to the Constitution in 
Parliament was at Newfoundland's request. Most Reform Party 
members found that although we had questions about whether it 
was a wise decision and questions about minority rights and all the 
things that concerned us, most of our concerns were put at ease. 
There had been wide public consultation in the province of 
Newfoundland. There had been public debate. There had been a 
referendum on the question. The people of Newfoundland 
expressed the opinion that they were in favour of the change.
<P>
	If the province of Quebec had done that on this issue and come to 
the House asking for the change, it would have been so much easier 
to support, knowing full well that the people had been consulted in 
the most democratic way by having a referendum on the question.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	When the joint committee begins its investigation some 
questions will be raised, if the committee is allowed to do its work 
properly, by parents, bishops, minority  groups in Quebec, Alliance 
Quebec and others. They will come before the committee to raise 
several questions.
<P>
	They will raise the question that it is not wise or prudent to toss 
aside a century old tradition and constitutional requirement to have 
confessional schools. They will say it is not good enough to make a 
blanket declaration that Quebec society is now secular and 
therefore that justifies broad changes to the Constitution.
<P>
	Many Quebecers may well want these changes. That question 
will be put by the bishops and by many others that have contacted 
our office and other MPs' offices saying they want to have a say in 
the matter. They want to put some questions and bring their 
concerns to the table. I am sure that would be one way they would 
do that.
<P>
	People will come forward to say that in the past there has been 
positive contribution from many confessional schools or religious 
schools. The schools have been a check and balance on the 
Government of Quebec using its influence within the school 
system to mould the future youth. It is interesting how so many 
different players are involved in moulding our youth. Certainly the 
parents have the primary role but many other factors mould the 
next generation.
<P>
	Our schools are a big factor. Our religious institutions suffice it 
to say have a huge influence on the next generation. I do not know 
the numbers exactly of how many are Catholic or Protestant and 
how many are French or English. They help to balance the third 
influence, the government.
<P>
	People will raise the question that it is a good check and balance 
on the system to have different players such as parents, religious 
authorities, the government, people devising curricula and all the 
different factors coming into play to help mould the next 
generation. Sometimes those checks and balances are necessary to 
make sure that no one group forces its agenda on the table.
<P>
	I hope the hearings will allow those people to come forward. The 
government will realize that sometimes it is not always wise to 
throw the baby out with the bath water. There are some necessary 
checks and balances. Many people will be coming forward to 
indicate that these changes take some of those checks and balances 
away.
<P>
	The rights of linguistic and religious minorities must be 
respected in Quebec as in all of Canada. The resolution has the 
potential, many people will argue, to abuse those rights. We have 
assurances from the minister that he does not believe that will 
happen. We have assurances from the Bloc that will not happen.
<P>
	The record of the separatist government in Quebec is not very 
good. In some statements its members have made they have 
blamed ethnic minorities and other people for different actions, 
everything from unemployment to whatever. During the hearings 
people  will be bringing forward the idea that religious and 
linguistic minorities may be losing some of their rights through this 
change. Again that will be discussed. The joint standing committee 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10035"> 10035 </A></B>
<P>
that will be struck will want to review that in detail to make sure it 
is not the case.
<P>
	I hope the federal government will avoid any rash political 
decisions in this most important debate because an election is 
probably only three or four days away.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	I hope it is sincere in that it does want to allow a joint 
Senate-Commons committee to do the investigative work, to call 
witnesses, to put people's minds at ease where it can be done, and 
to raise any troubling concerns that people in Quebec may have 
about this proposed constitutional change.
<P>
	I hope the federal government will do that. I think this is a most 
important debate that we will be entering into and it will centre 
around our desire to preserve our values of tolerance, our 
appreciation of the past, our religious freedoms and our national 
unity. I look forward to that debate. I thank the minister for his 
intervention.

	He said: Madam Speaker, this bill is co-sponsored by my

1991 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
<P>
	It was agreed at that convention that country members will 
harmonize all their legislations when dealing with the definition of 
a child so that a child is defined as anyone under the age of 18.
<P>
	Currently Canada lacks a uniform legal definition of who is 
considered a child. This lack of legal definition poses particular 
difficulties when we try to describe rights and responsibilities of 
older teenagers, especially those between the ages of 16 and 18.
<P>
	In Canada inconsistent and often contradictory laws and 
regulations do not always provide a sufficient basis for a stable and 
adequate policy toward children. In some cases contradiction can 
be found in existing legislation. For example, the definition of a 
child as defined by the Income Tax Act set the upper limit of 
eligibility for the child tax benefit at age 18. At the same time, 
under the goods and services tax, a child is considered to be a 
dependent child until he or she is 19.
<P>
	In light of Canada's commitment to children, it would seem only 
logical that we undertake a task of harmonizing all federal 
legislation dealing with children, in particular by ensuring that our 
legislation is in conformity with the UN Convention on the Rights 
of the Child.

agreement which was ratified by Canada.
<P>
	To date there is no uniform legal definition of child in Canada. 
The word child is both broadly defined and used commonly in 
everyday language. As a result this contributes significantly to the 
legal ambiguity which often occurs when the court attempts to

frequently use terms such as minor, dependant or young person to 
refer to those individuals under the age of 18.

	There are many bizarre things in federal legislation and we have

<P>
	We are dealing with children in the law. In 1991 about 146,000 
or 22 per cent of the 670,000 federal statute charges were laid 
against young offenders. About 18,800 or 13 per cent of the 
146,000 charges laid against them were for the perpetration of 
violent crimes. This represents an increase of 102 per cent, up from 
9,300 cases in 1986.
<P>
	The number of charges laid against young offenders for 
committing violent crimes has risen steadily in the last number of 
years, especially when compared to the number of charges laid 
against adults for committing similar crimes. For example, of the 
2.6 million non-traffic Criminal Code offences that were reported 
by the police in 1990, 22 per cent were committed by young 
offenders.

Liability Act. I am trying to harmonize this act with the definition 
of a child and to ensure that child means anyone under the age of 
18.
<P>
	This is part of a series of legislation I have proposed today. There 
is a lot more to come over the next few days. The intent is to bring 
to the forefront the whole notion of the United Nations Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and the issues that were dealt with at that 
time.
<P>
	We have started to see movement by the provincial governments. 
In particular the province of Alberta set up a task force to deal with 
the involvement of children in prostitution. The committee 
unanimously recommended to the federal government that it 
amend the relevant Criminal Code sections to reflect all provisions 
and all prostitution related offences perpetrated against youths as 
those involving persons under the age of 18.
<P>
	The same task force said that at the provincial level Alberta 
should change all of its legislation in order to define a child as 
anyone under the age of 18. We are starting to see movement at the 
provincial level to harmonize legislation in terms of children.
<P>
	There is one more important thing to put on the table. My 
colleague from the NDP tried to harass me earlier about why I am 
introducing so much legislation that deals with children. In the 
province of Ontario the NDP was in power for a number of years 
and had plenty of time to address the provincial legislation that 
dealt with the notion of children. It had plenty of time to harmonize 
its legislation to be in conformity with the UN Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. There are in  excess of 75 pieces of provincial 
legislation that deal with the issue of children. In many cases the 
legislation is extremely contradictory.
<P>
	I am proposing this legislation at the federal level with the hope 
that it will be considered. We have no authority over what the 
provincial governments do with their legislation. We have a moral 
authority and a moral obligation collectively as taxpayers and as 
elected officials across the land to collectively harmonize all of our 
legislation provincially and federally.
<P>
	A committee was struck by the UN and in passing, I thank 
Senator Landon Pearson and her capable staff member, Yolande, 
who supplied me with a copy of a UN committee report. It praises 
Canada for what it has done in terms of its commitment to children. 
The committee took note of the effort made by Canada in 
participating in international projects relating to children in 
co-operation with UNICEF and other governmental and 
non-governmental organizations.
<P>
	The same committee indicated its concern about the lack of 
conformity and the lack of uniformity when it comes to federal, 
provincial and territorial legislation in Canada. The committee has 
given Canada the deadline of 1999 to harmonize all federal, 
provincial and territorial legislation for consistency and conformity 
with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
<P>
	Unless we have that consistency we cannot take collective 
action, set priorities or take our proper responsibility. We cannot 
devise a national action plan to deal with the notion of children 
unless we agree on what constitutes a child. Parents must know 
when they legally stop being responsible for their children. When 
do children have rights? When does society as a whole have to take 
action? All those elements were addressed by the UN Convention 
on the Rights of the Child.

Madam Speaker, I have the privilege and pleasure today to present 
a petition pursuant to Standing Order 36.
<P>
	The petition is signed by in excess of 5,000 Canadians from 
coast to coast, all of whom are concerned about the future of Parks 
Canada.
<P>
	The petitioners note that the federal government is making plans 
to ``offload functions at Parks Canada through employee 
takeovers''. This is a contracting out scheme that will have a 
devastating impact on many remote communities where national 
parks are located.
<P>
	They also note that they care a great deal about the national parks 
system and the environment and state they will lose the integrity of 
the park system if it is privatized.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament stop the employee 
takeover proposal and work with the citizens and Parks Canada 
workers to develop cost saving ideas while at the same time 
preserve Canadian heritage.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALHIGHWAYSYSTEM">NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have a second petition today signed by a number 
of residents of my constituency, specifically from the city of North 
Battleford, the towns of Speers and Jackfish Lake, and a few 
others.
<P>
	The petitioners note that 38 per cent of the national highway 
system is substandard and that the national highway policy study 
identified job creation, economic development, national unity, 
saving lives, avoiding injuries, lower congestion, lower vehicle 
operating costs and better international competitiveness as benefits 
of the proposed national highway program.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to urge the federal 
government to join with provincial governments to make national 
highway system upgrading possible.

	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, pursuant to 
Standing Order 36 it is my honour to table a petition on behalf of 
my constituents in Lincoln.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that charitable organizations are being called upon to provide an 
increasing number of services for individuals in need.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners request that Parliament change the 
taxation formula so that an equal percentage of political and 
charitable donations are deductible.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT,1997">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1997</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
Bill C-93, an Act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on February 18, 1997, be read the third time 
and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with enthusiasm 
that I begin the debate for third reading on Bill C-93, the omnibus 
bill implementing the budget for 1997. As we know, this legislation 
will ensure the implementation of a whole series of measures 
introduced in the budget tabled in February 1997.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance has 
spoken in support of the legislation on previous occasions prior to 
second reading and when the legislation was reviewed by the 
Standing Committee on Finance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It must of course be remembered that before this bill was 
introduced for passage in the House, the issues it deals with were 
broadly discussed in the debate over the last budget.
<P>
	Since these issues have already been discussed at length, my 
comments will be brief, and I hope my colleagues will pass this bill 
shortly.
<P>
	As I have already said, the 1997 budget not only builds on the 
government's remarkable progress in putting its fiscal house in 
order but makes first class strategic investments for the benefit of 
Canada and Canadians. The bill before us today will allow these 
investments to be made.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It will invest in immediate employment and growth by 
enhancing the ability of small businesses to create new jobs. It will 
invest in long term jobs and growth by improving Canada's 
infrastructure for innovation. It will  invest in a stronger society 
and improve support for children in low income and lower income 
families.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	As I have said before in the House these issues should not be 
divided along partisan lines. On the contrary, they should bring us 
together with an urgent and truly national sense of purpose. I can 
think of no more worthy a national purpose than our country's 
children, particularly those children who are not getting everything 
they need for a proper start in their lives.
<P>
	Bill C-93 takes an important step in advancing the welfare of 
these children now that fiscal improvement has given us some 
scope for renewed social investment. The bill will pave the way for 
a national child benefit system by launching an enriched child tax 
benefit. Under the proposed approach the enrichment of this 
federal benefit will enable the provinces and territories to redirect 
some of their spending to better services and benefits for low 
income working families.
<P>
	The enrichment of the current $5.1 billion child tax benefit to 
create a new $6 billion Canada child tax benefit will take place in 
two stages. Effective this July the working income supplement will 
be enriched by $195 million or $70 million more than that 
proposed last year. This will directly translate into an increase in 
the maximum working income supplement from $500 per family 
regardless of size to $605 for families with one child, $1,010 for 
those with two children and $1,440 for those with three children. A 
further $330 will be paid for each additional child.
<P>
	The second stage will occur in July 1998 when the working 
income supplement will be combined with an enriched child tax 
benefit to form the Canada child tax benefit. The maximum benefit 
for low income families will be $1,625 to the one-child family, 
$3,050 to two-child families and increasing by $1,425 for each 
additional child.
<P>
	Overall more than 1.4 million Canadian families with 2.5 
million children will see an increase in federal child benefit 
payments by July 1998.
<P>
	The government is committed to doing more for Canada's 
children as the resources become available. In the meantime, I am 
confident that no hon. member can object to the increase in benefits 
for children proposed under Bill C-93. It is fitting that children be a 
priority of the government, not only because they are the most 
vulnerable in our society but because they are in a very literal way 
our nation's future, society's future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10044"> 10044 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-93 proposes other investments in Canada's future, 
including one of the most important initiatives we have seen in 
recent years for long term growth and jobs in the country. I am 
referring to the Canada foundation for innovation.
<P>
	It has become commonplace to acknowledge that education, 
knowledge and innovation are keys to seizing the economic 
opportunities of tomorrow, but scientific knowledge and industrial 
innovation demand a commitment to research. The foundation will 
provide much needed financial support for research infrastructure 
at Canadian post-secondary education institutions and research 
hospitals in the areas of health, the environment, science and 
engineering.
<P>
	What is more, the federal government's $800 million investment 
in the foundation could lead to as much as $2 billion in needed 
investment in research infrastructure through partnerships with 
research institutions, the private sector and/or the provinces.
<P>
	The foundation for innovation has been widely hailed as an 
important measure to enhance Canada's longer term growth and 
job prospects, but Bill C-93 also includes initiatives that will help 
Canadians who want and need jobs. I am referring in particular to 
the new hires program which will provide employment insurance 
premium relief to small firms that create new jobs this year and 
those that create new jobs in 1998.
<P>
	Under the bill eligible firms, those with less than $60,000 in EI 
premiums in 1996, will pay virtually no employer premiums for 
new employees hired this year. They will benefit from a 25 per cent 
reduction in premiums for new employees in the year to come.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	The new hires program, together with the general 1997 EI 
premium rate reductions, is expected to generate as many as 20,000 
new jobs in Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-93 includes a broad range of proposed measures. Others 
in the Chamber have spoken about this legislation at earlier 
readings and I have confined my remarks today to those which 
carry broad significance for a large number of those of us living 
and working in this country.
<P>
	However, the other elements of Bill C-93 are nevertheless 
important to the stakeholders they affect. They include measures 
that will discourage tobacco consumption, provide greater 
self-reliance and autonomy over taxation to First Nation bands and 
measures to help assure the continued viability of a national airline 
in a way that is fiscally responsible and, at the same time, 
competitively equitable.
<P>
	I have outlined today an important and widely beneficial piece of 
legislation, good news legislation, whose merits are apparent and 
whose review by the House have been extensive. I urge all 
members, all colleagues on all sides of the House, to give support 
to this worthy bill, C-93.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard BÃ©lisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill 
C-93 is an Act to implement the 1997 budget. I will describe its 
major elements.
<P>
	Compared to the billions of dollars cut from social transfers and 
taken from the unemployment insurance fund, the meagre $50 
million spent this year on the child benefit sounds like a drop in the 
bucket. This is the extent of the compassion felt by the Minister of 
Finance for the poor children of this country. We will not see the 
$600 million announced until 1998-99, while we now have 1.5 
million children living in poverty in Canada.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance could have taken advantage of the 
present favourable conditions to lower UI premium rates by three 
or four times as much in order to really create jobs while spending 
the billions of dollars in the UI fund to increase the protection lost 
in the wake of the employment insurance reform.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance could also have taken advantage of 
those three and a half years in his portfolio to undertake a real 
reform of corporate and personal taxation, as the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois 
has been calling for since the beginning.
<P>
	We know, for example, that he could have used up to $3 billion 
per year from corporate tax expenditures to support small and 
medium size business which create jobs, as we demonstrated last 
November.
<P>
	The minister could have done all this and more while getting the 
deficit down to zero by the year 2000 thanks to the government's 
room to manoeuvre, the extent of which the finance minister is 
trying to hide from us.
<P>
	This budget is hiding the true face of deficit reduction. On page 7 
of the budget speech, the minister claims, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-we will meet our objectives, as in the past, by focusing on getting spending 
right-not by raising taxes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The truth is the minister has hardly done anything to better 
manage government finances. The brunt of his deficit reduction has 
been borne by the taxpayers, who, in the last four years, have had to 
put up with $2 billion in tax increases and $14 billion in cuts, over 
half of which were made to transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	Departmental operating expenditures were reduced by only $3 
billion or 8 per cent between 1993-94 and 1997-98, while transfers 
to the provinces were cut by 27 per cent during the same period.
<P>
	To stimulate job creation, the minister is announcing a scant $25 
million-or one dollar per Canadian-in new money, including 
$15 million for tourism and $10 million to connect the region to the 
Internet, compared to the billions he can play with. I would say the 
budget the minister brought down is anti-jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10045"> 10045 </A></B>
<P>
	As I said before, this budget is full of misinformation, 
especially when it comes to the finance minister's forecast of the 
amount of money at his disposal.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	He is hiding something. The deficit cannot have dropped by a 
mere $2 billion between 1997 and 1998 when it fell by $9.6 billion 
between 1996 and 1997. The minister is hiding behind a margin 
which he narrows deliberately to justify his inaction and the 
absence of true job creation measures. Most of all, he is hiding the 
real anticipated deficit for 1998-99 in order to avoid taking a stand 
on an extremely important question before the next election, that is, 
what to do with the eventual surpluses.
<P>
	We should have commended the minister for the $800 million 
spent on setting up the Canada Foundation for Innovation, but we 
suspected all along that there was something fishy. Not 
surprisingly, transfers to the provinces for 1997-98 will be $800 
million lower than anticipated in the 1996 budget, mainly because 
the economic situation has improved.
<P>
	Instead of giving the money to the provinces, the federal 
government is using it to create a foundation which duplicates and 
competes with measures already implemented by the provinces. 
Finally, there is not a single word about compensating Quebec for 
the harmonization of the GST in 1991, even though it would be 
appropriate given the $1 billion paid to the maritimes.
<P>
	This is clearly a pre-election budget. The minister does not shy 
away from repeating, in the budget, all the good news already 
announced over the last few months, but he keeps silent on the $4 
billion in cuts to take effect this year. In our opinion, the Minister 
of Finance is showing a total lack of respect for the voters by 
offering them ``electoral goodies'' when he just cut social 
programs in a very unreasonable way.
<P>
	All the new initiatives of the federal government really infringe 
on the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec, adding to duplication, 
overlap, inefficiencies and costs, naturally borne by all taxpayers. 
The game the government is playing is very simple: cut ruthlessly 
in social transfer payments and implement new initiatives, often 
partisan in nature, without any regard for the common good.
<P>
	Having created new social programs, the federal government 
withdraws its financing unilaterally, but continues to insist on 
so-called national standards.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance did not revise his deficit forecast for the 
next two years, he is keeping it at $17 billion for 1998 and $9 
billion for 1999, although he was more than $5 billion under target 
for 1996-1997, that is $19 billion instead of the $24.3 billion 
forecast. Therefore, the minister is allowing himself considerable 
leeway and his measures for employment and the fight against 
poverty are ridiculous when you compare them to  what could have 
been done while, at the same time, aiming for a zero deficit in year 
2000.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that the Minister of Finance has $8 
billion to work with this year, 1997-98. He is one year ahead of his 
deficit reduction schedule. He will probably reach the $9 billion 
mark next year, instead of $17 billion, hence the $8 billion I just 
mentioned.
<P>
	The finance minister refuses to reveal exactly how much money 
he can play with, because he does not want to be pressured by the 
provinces and by public and labour associations that would ask him 
to refinance social transfers to the provinces, which have been 
greatly reduced, as we have seen.
<P>
	Thus, from 1993-94 to 1997-98, the deficit has dropped from 
$42 billion to $17 billion, a $25 billion reduction. To achieve this, 
revenues were increased by $22 billion and spending was cut by 
$14 billion.
<P>
	Consequently, over 52 per cent of the $14.2 billion reduction in 
program spending between 1994 and 1998 comes from reductions 
in transfers to other government levels, mainly the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	We know how the Quebec government's budget was directly 
affected by these transfer reductions. Between 1993-94 and 
1998-99, the deficit will have fallen from $42 billion to $9 billion, 
a $33 billion reduction. In this case, to achieve this, revenues will 
be increased by $28 billion and spending reduced by $16.5 billion.
<P>
	We may conclude that over 49 per cent of the $16.5 billion 
reduction in program spending between 1994 and 1999 comes from 
reductions in transfers to other government levels, mainly the 
provinces.
<P>
	Since the Liberals came to office, personal income taxes have 
grown faster than the economy, than the GDP. This increase in the 
personal tax burden does not come from a review of the tax system, 
which the Bloc Quebecois had asked for in order to increase 
fairness. On the contrary, it comes especially from several subtle 
tax increases, such as the non-indexing of tax tables and credits.
<P>
	The cuts announced in the 1994, 1995 and 1996 budgets will 
reduce the federal deficit by $4.6 billion this year. We may then 
talk about $4.6 billion in cuts and tax increases that were 
announced in the past, but that will come into effect this year. In 
1998-99, the cuts announced in the past will reduce the deficit by 
$28.9 billion, that is $2.8 billion more than in 1997-98 and $7.4 
billion more than in 1996-97.
<P>
	The finance minister has gotten into the habit of putting off his 
bad news until later. But, in his 1997 budget, he bragged that he 
was announcing no new cuts or tax increases. Nevertheless, there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10046"> 10046 </A></B>
<P>
are $4.6 billion in  cuts and tax increases being implemented this 
year, as announced in the three previous budgets.
<P>
	An election year is no time for the Liberals to spend billions. By 
artificially increasing future deficits, the Minister of Finance has 
avoided setting off a debate on the use of possible future budgetary 
surpluses. Indeed, as long as people think we are still deeply in 
debt, the Liberals can go on saying that we must stay the course.
<P>
	On the other hand, if a zero deficit had been announced for 1999, 
the next election campaign could have centred, for example, on the 
use of the surpluses created in the federal government's next 
budget, compelling the Liberals to commit themselves on this 
important issue.
<P>
	These past few months, several economic forecasting firms 
commented on future deficits. Their estimates are quite different 
from what the Minister of Finance predicted in his last budget. The 
minister already had more than $1 billion in leeway this year, in 
1997. Moreover, we are heading toward a $9 billion deficit in 1998, 
rather than $17 billion as claimed by the minister, which will give 
us the $8 billion surplus that I mentioned earlier. Finally, we will 
have a zero deficit in 1999, at least one year ahead of schedule, 
which will definitely allow a surplus that could even reach $9 
billion.
<P>
	There is nothing very original about the infrastructure program. 
The federal government is investing $425 million in a second phase 
of the Canada infrastructure works program. This amount is in 
addition to the $175 million remaining from the first phase, for a 
total of $600 million in 1997.
<P>
	The budget provides that the funds allocated to the Canadian 
Tourism Commission will increase by $15 million a year over the 
next three years. This is very little, considering that the 
commission's partners from the private sector are already investing 
more than $65 million this year. An amount of $50 million will also 
be set aside for the Business Development Bank of Canada, so it 
can help finance tourist facilities in the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	The budget also provides for a $7-million increase, in 1997-98, 
in the funds allocated to the National Literacy Secretariat. This is 
somewhat ridiculous, given the efforts required and already made 
by the provinces, which have jurisdiction over this area.
<P>
	There is nothing original about the federal government's new job 
creation strategy. The government is dragging its feet and 
proposing an antiquated job creation strategy that lacks originality 
and dynamism. Here is a government which got elected under the 
slogan ``Jobs, jobs, jobs'', but which no longer has any idea on how 
to create employment.
<P>
	There is nothing in the Liberals' election-minded budget for 
those Quebecers and Canadians who are looking for work. In terms 
of new money for active job creation measures, the government is 
only allocating $25 million for the coming year, that is $10 million 
for connecting the regions to the Internet and $15 million for 
tourism. This amounts to less than one dollar per Canadian and less 
than $20 per unemployed for this year.
<P>
	Yet, as we showed earlier, the Minister of Finance has a financial 
margin of several billion dollars. For example, he could have 
undertaken a review of the corporate taxation system, free up $3 
billion per year, and reinvest the money in the system, so as to 
concretely support job creation.
<P>
	The budget announces a 10-cent reduction in employment 
insurance premiums, as of January 1, 1998. This will bring 
premium rates to $2.80 per $100 for employees, and to $3.92 for 
employers. Such an announcement is usually made in November. 
The finance minister will then have the opportunity to announce 
this good news twice. The 10-cent reduction is much less than what 
it could have been, in view of the annual surpluses accumulated in 
the UI fund.
<P>
	The accumulated surplus is large enough to allow more 
flexibility in the insurance eligibility rules as well as a more 
substantial reduction in the level of contribution. You will agree 
that any additional yearly surplus is a hidden tax. The estimated 
cost of cutting 10 cents from the contribution rate in 1998 is $700 
million. When this cost is compared to the annual surplus expected 
to reach about $5 billion in 1998 and to the accumulated surplus 
that should come to about $15 billion by the end of 1998, we see 
that the minister is not making much of an effort.
<P>
	The yearly surplus in the UI account expected for the coming 
years will presumably come to between $5 billion and $6 billion, 
basically because of the new provisions that came into effect on 
January 1, 1997 and make it even harder to qualify for benefits in 
addition to decreasing benefit levels.
<P>
	Here are some figures which illustrate how little effort has gone 
into reducing the level of UI contributions. Each percentage point 
change in unemployment rates could affect the cost of the program 
by some $1.2 billion a year. Likewise, each-10 cent change in 
employee contribution rates, such as a decrease from $2.95 to 
$2.85 per $100 of insurable earnings, means about $700 million in 
contribution revenues for the government.
<P>
	The last recession has engulfed about $20 billion in UI costs. 
However, the chief actuary, Mr. BÃ©dard, told the <I>Financial Post</I> on 
October 1, 1996, that because of the government's permanent cuts 
to program spending, the next recession would not be as costly. The 
current and projected surpluses in the UI account are outrageous. In 
fact, it is thanks to workers and employers that the  finance minister 
is able to artificially reduce his deficit. The UI contribution rates 
are a hidden job tax. The surplus should go into a distinct account 
so that it cannot be used to artificially reduce the deficit. We agree 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10047"> 10047 </A></B>
<P>
that there should be an accumulated surplus in the unemployment 
insurance fund, but it should not be excessive. Relatively stable 
contributions are needed if we are to avoid raising contribution 
levels during economic downturns. Unemployment insurance 
contributions are by far the most important of payroll taxes.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	If unemployment insurance rules in 1996 had been similar to 
those in 1989, only $3 billion more would have been available for 
the unemployed in Canada. Eligibility requirements are 
increasingly restrictive for maternity leaves also.
<P>
	While the Government of Canada, out of compassion, is about to 
spend a few hundred million dollars on poor children, it is taking 
billions out of their parents' pockets. In 1996 alone, UI benefits 
were cut by $3 billion, while the Canada social transfer for health, 
education and welfare, the cost of which the federal government is 
deftly unloading onto the provinces, fell by $4.5 billion over two 
years.
<P>
	The government has undertaken to improve the child tax benefit 
by injecting $600 million in new money and reallocating $250 
million already announced in the 1996 budget.
<P>
	This will be a two-step process. First step: in 1997, the 
government will increase the working income supplement, which 
will now be calculated per child rather than per family. The 
maximum annual level of the working income supplement, now set 
at $500 per family, will climb to $605 for the first child, $405 for 
the second child and $330 for the following children. This will cost 
$195 million in 1997-98, $125 million of which has already been 
included in the 1996 budget.
<P>
	Second step: more concrete measures are to follow discussions 
with the provinces. The current proposal is to merge the tax benefit 
and the working income supplement into a single benefit. The 
increase will be higher for low income families with many 
children.
<P>
	The interim measure and the measures to be taken in 1998 do not 
affect families with an income over $25,921. Also, the bill does not 
provide for cost-of-living adjustments.
<P>
	So, from all of this, we can conclude that, after making the 
parents poorer by cutting the social transfer and UI benefits and 
failing to create jobs, the Liberal government suddenly cares about 
the children and has cynically decided, five years later, to recycle 
the money promised in 1993 for child care.
<P>
	Family policy and the fight against poverty are provincial areas 
of jurisdiction. Continuing interference  by the Canadian 
government in these provincial areas of jurisdiction is unacceptable 
to us and is hampering the implementation of a truly consistent 
policy by the provinces.
<P>
	Thus, after ripping their shirts on the non-indexation of benefits 
by the Conservative government, the Liberals have yet to remedy 
the situation.
<P>
	The Caledon Institute and anti-poverty organizations estimate 
that an additional $2 billion a year is a minimum needed to start 
fighting poverty whereas the government will spend only $850 
million starting in July 1998. Thus, this measure is quite 
unsatisfactory.
<P>
	The Liberal government is using the fight against poverty as an 
excuse to slash social programs like unemployment insurance and 
social assistance.
<P>
	The Liberal government broke its promise to create new child 
care spaces and the money that was supposed to be spent in that 
regard, that is, $720 million, vanished into thin air. Will the same 
happen to the amounts set aside for fighting child poverty?
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Lastly, the Quebec government considers this new benefit to be 
another interference in Quebec jurisdictions. However, Quebec can 
hardly reject out of hand the federal proposal to inject additional 
funds into programs for children, since those funds can be 
reallocated by the Quebec government to other programs for 
children.
<P>
	In short, the Bloc Quebecois has already expressed its opposition 
to the following aspects: federal meddling in an exclusively 
provincial jurisdiction; the non-indexation of benefits, which hurts 
families with children; and replacing a sound family policy with 
the fight against poverty.
<P>
	In pretending to follow the recommendations of the National 
Forum on Health, the federal government has announced additional 
funds of $300 million for health care, including $150 million over 
three years supposedly to help the provinces launch pilot projects 
to provide home care or drugs; $50 million over three years to put 
in place a national information system on health; $100 million over 
three years to improve existing programs, namely the Community 
Action Program for Children and the Canada Prenatal Nutrition 
Program.
<P>
	It is difficult to imagine, at first glance, how the program will 
work. Will the health minister have a veto over how the funds will 
be allocated? Will there be new national standards? We can be sure 
of one thing: health being a provincial jurisdiction, the new funds 
announced amount to further federal interference in a provincial 
area of jurisdiction.
<P>
	The government ignored an important recommendation made by 
the National Forum on Health that cash transfers for health and 
social services be set at  a minimum $12.5 billion, the amount 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10048"> 10048 </A></B>
<P>
forecast for 1997-98, instead of reduced to $11 billion, as 
anticipated.
<P>
	The new funds concern activities which are a direct provincial 
responsibility. It will be tempting for the federal government to 
implement all these policies and continue to meddle in provincial 
areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	In conclusion, all these examples show without a shadow of a 
doubt that the finance minister is not making any serious effort to 
help the most disadvantaged in our society, to help small 
businesses to grow, which would help create jobs and ensure the 
financial independence of families and individuals. This is exactly 
the opposite of what the government has done in the budget tabled 
by the finance minister in February.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to address Bill C-93.
<P>
	This legislation and much of the legislation that passes through 
this place is remarkable not only for what is in it but especially for 
what is not in it. As we approach what probably will be an election 
call in the next few days it is very important to take a look at the 
agenda put forward by the government with respect to issues that 
are important to Canadians, particularly economic issues.
<P>
	The government blew a wonderful opportunity in this year's 
budget. It had a chance to get its priorities in line with the priorities 
of regular Canadians. As someone who has been to many different 
provinces this past year I can say that the government simply does 
not understand the priorities of the Canadian people.
<P>
	I was in Moose Jaw and Saskatoon last week. I was in British 
Columbia the week previous to that. I will be in Toronto this week. 
It seems that no matter where I go Canadians have a very different 
agenda from that which the government has proposed.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	When I talk to people I find that they have some very modest 
expectations. They do not ask a lot. They have very modest dreams. 
When I talk to people they say things like ``Would it not be nice to 
be able to find a job? Would it not be nice to be able to set some 
money aside so that I can buy a house or start a family? When we 
start a family, would it not be nice if we could set some money 
aside to put the kids through school? If we chose, would it not be 
nice if one of us could stay home to look after the children? 
Ultimately, would it not be nice to set money aside for 
retirement?'' I do not think these are exorbitant requests. They are 
very modest dreams. What we have run into is a succession of 
governments which seem to have worked against the very modest 
dreams which people have.
<P>
	On the one hand, people want opportunities. They want the 
chance to do those things. On the other hand, people want some 
security. If they become unemployed  through no fault of their own 
they want to know that there will be some kind of a social safety net 
to help them. If they become ill they want to know that the health 
care system will provide for them in a timely fashion. Again, those 
modest expectations of security are not being met by this 
government and they have not been met by previous governments.
<P>
	Husbands want to know that when their wives go out to a parking 
lot at night they will not have to fear for their lives. They want to 
know that when their kids go to school they will return home 
unharmed. Many Canadians do not have that sense of security. The 
government should be providing that type of security through a 
strong criminal justice system.
<P>
	I do not see those types of priorities being met by this 
government. Certainly I do not see that happening with this budget. 
The government should be castigated. The principal role of the 
government should be to get its priorities in line with the wishes of 
the Canadian people. It is simply not happening.
<P>
	I want to talk a bit about where the government should be going. 
Governments have completely reversed their priorities over the last 
many years. As I pointed out, people have very modest 
expectations. They are not asking the government to be involved in 
a lot of them. They just want the government to provide 
opportunities. If those expectations are to be met, the government 
must not tax the people to death. Obviously if a person wants to buy 
a house, go on a vacation or set money aside to put the kids through 
school, the more money that is left in the pockets of the taxpayers, 
the better chance they have of doing that.
<P>
	Somehow that pretty simple truth has alluded successive 
governments, including the Conservatives. They raised taxes 
endlessly, 71 times. This government has raised taxes 36 times. 
Those governments have missed the simple truth. If people are to 
be able to realize their very modest dreams those governments 
must stop picking their pockets.
<P>
	Right now in Canada we have three levels of government 
exacting about half the paycheque of the average family of four. 
That makes it virtually impossible to do the sorts of things that 
people want to do. According to a Decima poll, 74 per cent of two 
income families said that if they had their druthers, if they could 
afford to, they would have one parent at home looking after their 
children.
<P>
	We should respect those decisions. We should do what we can to 
get government priorities in line with the wishes of Canadians. 
Unfortunately Bill C-93 and other budget bills and legislation 
which has come before the House have failed to recognize how 
important these things are to Canadians, whom this place is 
supposed to serve. Governments somewhere along the line went 
drastically off track with what they thought they were supposed to 
be doing for Canadians.
<P>
<B></B>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="10049"> 10049 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Somewhere along the way we had a group of people who, 
admittedly, were extraordinarily well educated but determined that 
they knew better than Canadians themselves what was good for 
Canadians. Somewhere along the line, I would say 30 years ago, 
that happened. Since then we have seen the Ottawa agenda rise to 
the fore in this place and in the Senate.
<P>
	As a result, instead of Canadians expecting Ottawa to represent 
their views, they have come to expect Ottawa to bring forward an 
entirely different agenda from what Canadians want for 
themselves.
<P>
	I point to some examples of exactly what I mean. A minute ago I 
said that Canadians expect the government to provide them 
opportunity on one hand and some security on the other.
<P>
	Let us look at where the federal government is at today with 
respect to all the different types of things it does. Is it really 
providing Canadians with opportunity?
<P>
	In 1995 we set a record for bankruptcies in this country, an all 
time record. In 1996 we eclipsed that record by 20 per cent. We set 
a new record for bankruptcies. At the beginning of this year we are 
setting more records, more bankruptcies.
<P>
	The finance minister tried to put a good face on it but those are 
alarming facts that everybody should be concerned about. That is 
not all. We have record debt, $600 billion worth. That is a 
staggering amount of money, somewhere in the range of 75 per 
cent of our GDP.
<P>
	We will have another deficit again this year. The deficit will 
come in probably around $15 billion. It has been 30 years since we 
had a balanced budget. That is ridiculous. I cannot believe that we 
have staggered on as a country for that long without a balanced 
budget.
<P>
	It does not end there. Of course where there is a $600 billion debt 
there are massive interest payments of $46 billion, $47 billion a 
year in interest that we are paying; 37 cents of every tax dollar goes 
to pay interest on the debt.
<P>
	Flowing from that, when there are interest payments that are that 
high, evermore we pay taxes. That certainly is the legacy of the 
previous government. The Conservatives raised taxes 71 times.
<P>
	A Conservative government, somebody who believes in real 
conservatism, would never do that. They understand that money is 
much more valuable in the hands of taxpayers.
<P>
	Somehow conservatism got lost for the Conservatives and they 
embraced some other type of ideology, some other form of thinking 
which this government to a certain degree has also embraced. That 
is why we have had a further $100 billion increase in debt under the 
Liberal government and another 36 tax increases.
<P>
	We have had all that happen. It has not been without its 
repercussions. I mentioned a minute ago bankruptcies. I would 
argue very strongly that many increases in taxes could come only 
from one place, from taxpayers.
<P>
	There will be more bankruptcies. It is a pretty direct cause and 
effect relationship. One of the most startling facts I have uncovered 
since we have been here is the one that comes from the Fraser 
Institute. It tells us that since 1993 when this government came to 
power the average family has seen its disposable income fall by 
$3,000.
<P>
	That to me is a shocking statistic. We should all be very 
concerned about it. When there are those sorts of impacts on 
Canadian families, is it any wonder that we have staggeringly high 
levels of bankruptcies?
<P>
	One of the other major repercussions of record high debt, taxes, 
bankruptcies and all those sorts of things is unemployment of over 
9 per cent for 78 months in a row. It is the worst record since the 
Great Depression.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Economists tell us that our economy has been growing since the 
early 1990s, since about 1991. We have had six years of growth. I 
can assure the House that there are many Canadians who have been 
unemployed for a long time and who have not seen that growth in 
the economy. For them there has no been end to the recession. The 
recession has continued on and on.
<P>
	We have seen almost one-third of a generation grow up in a very 
recessionary economy. Certainly the domestic economy has been 
asleep for a very long time and has never fully recovered.
<P>
	This should give us all pause. We should be asking ourselves 
why this is happening. We should also refer back to what people 
have told us for a long time: is it not the responsibility of the 
government, with respect to our economic well being, to provide us 
with opportunity?
<P>
	I would make the argument as forcefully as I can that the 
Conservatives failed miserably to provide us with opportunity. 
Their record is shameful, sorrowful and speaks for itself. I would 
also say, with great respect to government members, that the 
government simply has failed to fulfil not only its election 
promises but the expectations of Canadians who have been asking 
successive governments to create the opportunity for jobs, hope, 
prosperity and growth in the economy, the things that typically 
governments have done in this country for decades.
<P>
	It was precisely because governments heeded what Canadians 
said with respect to living within their means. We took that for 
granted for a long time. It just seemed like such common sense. 
However, starting in about 1968, if I had to pick a date when former 
Prime Minister Trudeau came to power, we got some really strange 
ideas in our heads about what exactly an economy was capable of 
doing, especially when we continued to spend more  money than 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10050"> 10050 </A></B>
<P>
we brought in. We had some very strange ideas. I think those ideas 
have continued on even to this day.
<P>
	I know that some hon. members across the way will make the 
argument that yes, but they have done better. They have slowed 
down the amount of money that they spend relative to what they 
take in. I accept that they have. I think that is true. However, if the 
past week is any indication of how this government reacts the 
moment it looks like an election is coming, I think we are in big 
trouble.
<P>
	I have gone through the numbers. If we look at all the different 
things that could be construed as ways of currying favour with the 
public with an election pending, it amounts to billions of dollars 
that the government is proposing to spend.
<P>
	The GST harmonization deal with Atlantic Canada cost $1 
billion. That, in a way, relates to both the last election and this 
election. That was not something that was demanded by Atlantic 
premiers or the people of Atlantic Canada. It was done initially to 
get the government off the hook for its 1993 campaign promise but 
is now being done, I would argue, as much to prepare for the 1997 
election campaign.
<P>
	All of a sudden the government has realized that for all these 
years it has been wrong about pay equity. On the eve of an election 
campaign, seemingly or perhaps just a wild coincidence, the 
government has decided it needs to come up with a billion dollars 
for that.
<P>
	The Pearson airport deal was causing the government 
tremendous grief. Its name was being dragged through the mud. 
What did it do? It produced $260 million to deal with that. It goes 
on and on. We have the armouries in Liberal ridings.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You are exaggerating.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> My hon. friend across the way is trying to 
interject, but I would ask him to let me make my point because I 
think it is important.
<P>
	I do not see in this budget implement act money being set aside 
for armouries. I certainly do not see money being set aside 
precisely for the Prime Minister's riding, for the Deputy Prime 
Minister's riding and for the riding of the health minister. I am 
looking through Bill C-93 and I do not see it in here. I do not recall 
the reference to it in the budget speech.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	I do not recall the reference in the budget speech to the $63.7 
million for the sock factory in Montreal. I know Montreal has a lot 
of people and those people vote, but I am troubled because that is a 
lot money.
<P>
	The government went out of its way to ensure that it met its 
promise exactly when it said it would cut health care spending and 
it did. The government cut big time. It cut $7.5 billion from 
transfers to the provinces for health  care and education. It cut 
every penny of it. It made sure of that. It raises some questions 
when it comes to money for a sock factory in Montreal because 
there are a lot of people there and they have tended to vote in a 
certain way.
<P>
	Bill C-93 talks about the Canada foundation for innovation. The 
idea behind the foundation is to pay grants to modernize and 
enhance infrastructure for research in Canada. Is the $63.7 million 
for the sock factory part of an initiative from the Canada 
foundation for innovation? Is this the type of money that the 
government is spending on research? I hope not.
<P>
	Canadians have other priorities. Health care is 50 times more 
important to Canadians than spending money on sock factories. It 
is 50 times more important than spending money on armouries in 
the Prime Minister's riding, the Deputy Prime Minister's riding 
and the riding of the health minister. I am alarmed at some of the 
things the government spends money on.
<P>
	It was not very long ago that we raised the issue of the federal 
government spending money on golf carts. I cannot believe it either 
but it is true. Canadians would much rather see that money put into 
opening up hospital beds that the government closed when it cut 
$7.5 billion to the provinces for health care.
<P>
	In a round about way I am saying the government is off track 
with respect to paying attention to what the priorities are of regular 
Canadians. It is completely off track because way back when 
Canadians said-and I think they continue to say it-that they 
expect the government to provide opportunity. It has failed to do 
that. They also say they expect the government to provide some 
security. It has also failed to do that. I want to expand that argument 
a bit more.
<P>
	If Canadians are asked, there are 10 or 12 things they think the 
federal government and only the federal government can do and 
should do extraordinarily well. In my opening remarks, for 
instance, I talked about how nervous many Canadians are about 
going out on to the street at night. They are concerned about crime. 
I think my hon. friends across the way will agree that is a fact 
today, especially in big cities around the country.
<P>
	Instead of focusing efforts on putting money into sock factories 
or buying golf carts, instead of having the bureaucracy focused on 
doing those types of things, would it not make a lot more sense to 
take that money and those efforts and focus them on ensuring that 
we deal once and for all with our crime problem? Would that not 
make a lot more sense?
<P>
	I would love to see a country that is known around the world for 
having the best justice system. That should be the goal of the 
government. The federal government should set as its number one 
goal the provision of the best justice system in the world. It should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10051"> 10051 </A></B>
<P>
ensure the rule  of law is absolutely adhered to in Canada. The 
government could do it if it placed emphasis on it.
<P>
	With the election pending we saw yesterday that the justice 
minister was desperate to get through the anti-gang legislation. Our 
party co-operated fully because we have tried to make criminal 
justice a huge issue in the country. We want to protect ordinary 
Canadians from crime. We think that should be the number one 
responsibility of the government.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	It is not enough to try to rush something through in the last days 
of a regime. It is important the government make it a priority every 
day. Can we imagine if we focused all that government spending on 
fixing the criminal justice system?
<P>
	My friend from Fraser Valley West told the House about a 
woman in his riding who was brutally raped for 90 minutes-and I 
will spare the House the details-only to have the offender go 
before the court and because of legislation the justice minister 
brought forward, Bill C-41, he was allowed to walk free without 
spending a day in jail. Can we imagine instead of bringing those 
examples forward the hon. member was able to say he has 
discovered that crime is no longer an issue in his riding? Can we 
imagine that? It would be wonderful. That is something the 
government should focus on.
<P>
	Only when there are a couple of days left before an election 
campaign does the justice minister bother. He brought forward all 
kinds of stuff which, to be polite, are at the fringes of the whole 
idea of justice. Elementary things, the things most Canadians 
consider to be important, have been absolutely and completely 
ignored.
<P>
	The members for Fraser Valley West, Crowfoot, Wild Rose and 
Calgary Northeast have repeatedly asked the government about a 
victims bill of rights. That is the number one responsibility of a 
justice minister and a federal government. Somehow the 
government has forgotten its priorities.
<P>
	It fools around with legislation that deals with the fringes of 
criminal justice. Through Bill C-41 it provides judges with the 
opportunity and the latitude not to impose any jail time even for 
serious violent offences. That is what the government did. It saw it 
as more of a priority than giving victims the right to protection in 
the law. That is so wrong that it is unbelievable we should even 
have to discuss it.
<P>
	The federal government is not in line with the priorities of 
Canadians with respect to justice. It is not in line with the priorities 
of Canadians with respect to internal trade barriers, for instance. 
One thing the federal government should do, can do and has the 
right to do under the Constitution is to say to the provinces that it is 
time to have the same ability to trade between provinces as we do 
with the United States. At the risk of sounding like I am talking 
down to members across the way, that is  pretty much common 
sense. The people back home would agree it makes sense that 
Ontario should be able to trade with Quebec as easily as it can with 
Michigan.
<P>
	That is not the fact. There are internal trade barriers. There is an 
important role the federal government should assume. It currently 
does not play much a role, despite what the government has said 
about these things in the past.
<P>
	The government should focus on the military, something about 
which we have had a lot of discussion in the House. Approximately 
two weeks ago we celebrated the 80th anniversary of our great 
victory at Vimy Ridge. There are few veterans of that battle left but 
those who are left, and if others could return, are very concerned, if 
not ashamed, at the state of the leadership of the Canadian military 
today.
<P>
	If the federal government spent as much time working on 
matters such as fixing the Canadian military as it does handing out 
ridiculous grants to all kinds of special interest groups, we would 
have a far stronger military and Canadians would forever be in debt 
to the federal government.
<P>
	Many Canadians who served in both world wars, the Korean 
conflict and peacekeeping since then, and people who are currently 
serving today, are demanding that the federal government fix the 
problems in the Canadian military. They should not be put off. 
They should not wait for some other administration down the road 
to fix them. They should not be left to die a death of a thousand 
cuts. The government should find out what is wrong with it and fix 
it. We should be given the best military in the world for the size of 
our country. That should be the goal of the Canadian government.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	If it focuses on doing all the things only the federal government 
can do, such as foreign affairs, international trade, the monetary 
system, and does them extraordinarily well, Canadians will say the 
federal government has done something wonderful by giving them 
excellent government and great service. It would also mean the 
government would not be spending near the amount of money it 
currently spends on all kinds of things at the margin and pretty 
frivolous.
<P>
	If the government did that it would be able to balance the budget 
for the first time in close to 30 years. That would be a real step 
forward. If it were able to focus its spending it would also find that 
it had a big surplus, which is exactly what my party is proposing.
<P>
	Bill C-93 is talking about spending more money. Our party says 
that the federal government should focus on doing those things 
only the federal government can do and do them extraordinary 
well. It should give the provinces and municipalities more respon-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10052"> 10052 </A></B>
<P>
sibility for some of the other things. It should allow families and  
individuals the opportunity they have asked for, for a long time.
<P>
	If the government does that we will have a better country. It 
would make a lot more sense to ordinary Canadians who want to be 
left alone and have basic services provided. It would make a lot of 
sense for national unity to allow the provinces to play a bigger role.
<P>
	We read in the newspaper about how it took 32 years to get a 
labour training agreement with the Quebec government. With 
respect, that flies in the face of common sense again. The provinces 
are closer to the people and can provide training better. They know 
what their people need and want. Why in the world did it take 32 
years for that to happen? It is ridiculous.
<P>
	Why not allow the provinces to do what they can do better and 
allow lower levels of government closest to the people to do as 
much as they can possibly do? That makes absolute sense. Instead 
of continuing to usurp powers to the federal government, powers 
that according to the Constitution do not really belong to the 
government, it should allow provinces, municipalities, families 
and individuals, the private sector, charities and all various groups 
that in the past have demonstrated they know perfectly well how to 
run their own affairs, to take a leadership role. That is something 
the government should do.
<P>
	When the government does that it opens up some room. It gives 
it a big surplus. If it has a surplus the world is a much brighter place 
than when it has a deficit. It has a lot more options when it has a 
surplus. The government could heed the request of Canadians who 
say they would like more money to be put back into health care. 
The government took $7.5 billion out of health care and education. 
They want some money put back in. My party says that we should 
run a surplus, focus the government and give back money to the 
provinces for health care. It makes a lot of sense.
<P>
	It should put $4 billion back. When there is a big surplus it only 
makes sense to pay money toward the $600 billion debt. We must 
start to reverse the trend. If we start to pay down the debt we will 
not have to pay big interest payments any more. They would get 
smaller all the time. That would free up even more money for 
things that are important to Canadians.
<P>
	Let us take the rest of that money and offer it to Canadians in the 
form of lower taxes. I know what some members across the way 
will say. They will say one of two things. I have heard them say that 
Canadians do not really want lower taxes. They have also said they 
believe in targeted tax relief. That is fine. I accept that. After 107 
tax increases in the last 12.5 years I would argue Canadians need 
more than a targeted cut. Canadians instinctively know they will 
have a lot of trouble competing with the rest of the world if they 
have a much higher tax regime than other countries.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	My hon. friend from Prince Albert who sits across the way 
knows that personal taxes have gone up relative to GDP by about 
15 per cent since the government came to power. Personal taxes 
have risen exponentially compared with other G7 nations. They 
have gone through the roof in the past many years.
<P>
	We have to do something about that because it hurts our ability 
to compete in the world. It also hurts the ability of ordinary 
individuals and families to get the things they want. They are the 
priorities of Canadian families to which I referred earlier. They are 
people's fairly modest expectations. People want to set aside 
enough money to buy a house. That is not unrealistic. They want to 
set aside money to start a family which is okay with most people. It 
is okay to have money to go on a vacation. If the government is 
taxing half your income it becomes very difficult to do that. It is 
very difficult for a family to choose to have one spouse stay at 
home with the children if half your income is being taxed away.
<P>
	In order to realize those expectations it is necessary to give 
Canadians lower taxes. In order to create an economy that produces 
jobs for Canadians we must have lower taxes. I have heard the 
finance minister say that payroll taxes are a cancer on job creation. 
I agree with the finance minister but I wish he would heed his own 
observation.
<P>
	The EI surplus is building and building. It will be $10 billion or 
$15 billion by the time the government ever gets around to 
balancing its budget, if it ever does. Instead of allowing those 
premiums to stay so unreasonably high when unemployment is 
over 9 per cent, why not balance the budget quickly and start to 
lower EI premiums so the economy will create jobs and put 
Canadians back to work?
<P>
	I cannot believe when I go to Newfoundland that we have a 
province with a 20 per cent unemployment rate. That is alarming. I 
come from Alberta where the provincial government has been very 
responsible with its finances. Taxes are the lowest in the country 
and as a result the level of unemployment is relatively low. I was 
staggered when I went to St. John's last September and saw the 
unemployment. It is a national tragedy. I was in Cape Breton a little 
over a year ago and I could not believe the situation that economy 
is in. It is horrible, a national tragedy. It speaks volumes about the 
need for the finance minister to come to grips with the deficit and 
to start to lower payroll taxes. That is a contradiction of where the 
government is heading with respect to payroll taxes for CPP, but I 
will discuss that later.
<P>
	The government has gone really off track and does not recognize 
that Canadians have very legitimate aspirations. It has not been 
able to meet those aspirations, nor did the previous Conservative 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10053"> 10053 </A></B>
<P>
	My party believes we need a lot of tax relief. That is why we 
believe in a $2,000 cut for the average family of four by the year 
2000 as a start toward tax relief. We want to bring about $15 
billion in tax relief so that Canadians can take the money they 
previously gave to the government that very often spent it on 
things that I think are very unfortunate and quite wasteful in the 
worst instances and use that money to pursue their own dreams. 
That is what we would do with that money.
<P>
	I will backtrack to the government's priorities and speak for a 
moment on the government's approach to health care when you 
have a balanced budget. I am on the finance committee. The 
president of the Canadian Medical Association was before us not 
too long ago. She made the point that today if someone is waiting 
treatment for breast cancer or prostate cancer, on average, the 
waiting time is 14 weeks. People have to wait over three months for 
treatment for those two virulent forms of cancer. The cancer does 
not stop because the government does not have enough money to 
put toward treatment. The cancer rampages on.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I cannot believe that the government has decided that spending 
money on interest payments for money it has borrowed around the 
world, which is what it does when it does not balance the budget, 
that spending money on sock factories, golf carts, armouries and 
any one of a hundred different things is more important than 
spending money on health care and preserving the health of 
Canadians. I do not understand why the government is being so 
obstinate about dealing with this problem.
<P>
	Why does the government not recognize that health care is a 
priority? Why does it not get its agenda in line with the wishes of 
the Canadian public? Why will it not address the problem? Why are 
we being subjected to the Prime Minister lining up photo 
opportunities and giving out taxpayers' money for all these crazy 
ideas when Canadians have made it clear health care is the number 
one priority? It makes absolutely no sense.
<P>
	I am going to conclude my remarks where I began. The role of 
the government is to recognize what the priorities of Canadians are. 
The role of the government is to serve the public. It is a pretty 
radical idea, I know, but the government should listen hard to what 
Canadians are saying about their priorities.
<P>
	If the government listens hard it will come to the same 
conclusion to which the Reform Party came, which is that 
Canadians want smaller government and a government which 
focuses on the things that are priorities for Canadians. They want a 
balanced budget. They want to run surpluses and they want to 
reinvest in those things which are priorities. They want to take that 
surplus and give Canadians lower taxes. They want to use the 
surplus to pay down the debt.
<P>
	Ultimately, if the government can do those things, the country 
will have an economy which will provide Canadians the opportuni-
<P>
ty I spoke of earlier, which is the opportunity to create the jobs 
which Canadians so desperately want.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul CrÃªte (Kamouraska-RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to take part in the third reading debate on the 
Budget Implementation Act. It seems that this year's budget is not 
aimed at the real problem, which is unemployment, despite our 
numerous remarks on the subject.
<P>
	The budget is aimed at the wrong target. People tell us to repeat 
our arguments again and again, but what use is it? We recently had 
the example of the American pensions which showed that by 
insisting, by constantly asking questions and making request upon 
request, we can get somewhere. Getting results on an issue like that 
gives us renewed energy to try to bring the government to 
recognize our arguments. The fight against unemployment was 
totally omitted from the Liberal government's 1997 budget, but I 
have some concrete measures to propose to create jobs because we 
need jobs on an urgent basis.
<P>
	In my riding, be it the Kamouraska, RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup, 
TÃ©miscouata or des Basques regional county municipality, we need 
jobs to allow local workers to earn a living and to support their 
families so they can be proud to live and work in the area.
<P>
	The first measure would be to plan the use of the surplus in the 
employment insurance fund because, right now, this surplus is used 
to hide the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Because the federal government did not have enough discipline 
to cut departmental spending significantly, it is using the surplus in 
the employment insurance fund to mask that reality.
<P>
	In that regard, a concrete measure that could be taken would be 
to reopen the employment insurance reform to give control of the 
fund to the people who are paying for it, namely employers and 
employees. Right now, the situation is somewhat peculiar in that 
the people who are funding this insurance plan have no control over 
the way the money is used.
<P>
	Usually, when there is a surplus in an insurance company, it is 
used to improve the quality of services, to reduce premiums and so 
forth, but we have seen no such concrete measure from the 
government. Yet, had the government decided to reduce 
unemployment insurance premiums significantly, this would have 
left more money in the economy, which would have helped to 
create jobs.
<P>
	Another concrete measure that can be put on the table to 
stimulate job creation is to bring radical changes to the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10054"> 10054 </A></B>
<P>
procurement policy. Last week, the  Standing Committee on 
Government Operations tabled a report. I will read to you some of 
the conclusions contained in that report. This comes from both 
Liberal members and opposition members. There is a consensus on 
this issue. The problem is that it took three years to get to this point 
and, during those three years, the Liberal government did not do 
anything to make its procurement policy work in favour of regional 
development. We see no such trend for the future.
<P>
	This is confirmed by what the report says: ``The Treasury Board 
is not enforcing its policies, directives and guidelines for the 
approval and execution of contracts by departments, agencies and 
Crown corporations that fall within its jurisdiction''.
<P>
	In other words, the Treasury Board is not playing its role as a 
watchdog. The departments can pretty much do as they please. It 
also says: ``There is a general lack of public awareness of the 
federal government's contracting process in many sectors of the 
Canadian economy, including the small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SME's) as well as a general lack of understanding of 
how to access it''.
<P>
	It is even more complicated for francophone businesses, because 
although government requests for proposals are themselves often 
bilingual, when more specific documentation is sought, it is not 
available in French.
<P>
	In my riding, I have businessmen who have told me horror 
stories of their experiences with government procurement policies. 
One firm in Les Basques, for instance, went after a contract to 
manufacture fibreglass huts for the Minister of National Defence. 
This is one of the departments with the most impenetrable 
procurement policy. There is always a relative of somebody on the 
base, which is often located in Ontario, who wins the contract year 
after year; when a competitor turns up, there is no way to break in. 
This was one of the things we noticed.
<P>
	The result of this in 1994 was to deprive Quebec of $1.3 billion 
in contracts. When you compare our share of the population to the 
number of contracts received, the economy of Quebec comes up 
$1.3 billion short. When we are calling for ways to ensure the 
development of the economy of each of our regions, this is one 
concrete measure, because $1.3 billion represents 22,000 jobs, or 
an average of 300 jobs a riding.
<P>
	You can see that, with a policy of equitable regional 
procurement, 200 or 250 additional full time jobs in my riding 
would be a far cry from the situation we now have.
<P>
	As we head into an election campaign, we must therefore make 
sure that, in its next term of office, the government implements the 
committee's recommendations as quickly as possible. It has taken 
three years, and it should not take until May 1998, as the  
committee is recommending, before we know what action the 
government is going to take.
<P>
	During the election campaign, I think voters should ask each of 
the candidates the following question: What is your party going to 
do about procurement? The Bloc Quebecois's position on this is 
very obvious. It is essential that the government's procurement 
policy be amended quickly, that there be full and speedy access for 
small and medium size businesses, which create the most jobs in 
our society, in particular by making information available in 
French, thus allowing our entrepreneurs to win these contracts and 
eliminating the chance and often partisan nature of the current 
political decisions.
<P>
	Another specific proposal we have to ensure preservation of jobs 
is to loosen the federal government's grip on transfer payments.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	In health alone, the federal government has cut $750 million in 
two years in Quebec. If our health system in Quebec had had that 
$750 million available to it, would we not have been able to retain 
many more jobs in the health system? Could we not have carried 
out a reform that would have been both easier and more 
appropriate? Changes were needed, but with that money in hand 
there would have been far fewer problems relating to staff 
allocation and keeping jobs.
<P>
	The federal government could have chosen to loosen its grip on 
transfer payments; it could have made cuts to government 
operations. The 19 per cent cut planned there ended up as only 9 
per cent. The difference between the two can be seen in the cuts to 
transfer payments. This is very easily seen. The federal 
government is turning off the tap. The province has less money and 
is obliged to manage with what it has left. The bottom line is that 
the jobs cut are jobs in the health field, the main area of concern for 
Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	It is important to understand this because, in each province 
where adjustments had to be made, the tendency is to blame the 
provincial government for not doing its job properly, for not 
making cuts in the right places. The provincial government's 
problems are connected to this cut in the federal government's 
transfer payments, in particular.
<P>
	If the federal government really wants to implement an active 
job creation measure in the coming months, in the coming year, it 
still has time to loosen up on the transfer payments in order to 
ensure that each province will have sufficient funds. As well, it 
could re-examine the control of expenditures in each of the 
departments, in order to make sure that the mandate has been 
properly fulfilled, instead of just putting the cuts off to another day 
and never making them, while refusing to give an inch on transfer 
payments to the provinces. This is an issue that ought to be raised 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10055"> 10055 </A></B>
<P>
in the next election  campaign, and it is a major issue, one that 
could help create employment.
<P>
	We have three proposals, therefore. First of all, the government 
could draw up a plan to use the employment insurance fund 
surplus, ensuring that there will be more money spent in the 
communities, particularly those where there is seasonal industry, as 
there is in the region I represent. Then, revise the government 
procurement policy, in order to ensure that Quebec gets its share, 
and the regions get theirs. Finally, loosen the grip on transfer 
payments, so that a satisfactory employment level may be 
maintained, particularly in education and health.
<P>
	There are other suggestions as well. It has long been said that 
Quebec gets its share from the federal government. As an 
experiment, the Bloc Quebecois' presence has been very 
conclusive; because now that we sovereignists are in Ottawa, we 
can look into transportation and infrastructure spending, for 
instance, which have a bolstering effect on the economy, and we 
have discovered that there is much that has not been done.
<P>
	This is another proposal to get the economy rolling. There is the 
infrastructure program which is interesting but port infrastructure 
also offers interesting solutions. Now that Bill C-44 has been 
passed, it is of the utmost importance that the Department of 
Transport divest itself of ports as soon as possible so that local 
companies can take over under good conditions.
<P>
	It means, for instance, that in a riding like mine, 
RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup, we must create as quickly as possible the 
conditions that will allow industry to take over the ferry wharf and 
ensure that the development corporation in Cacouna can actually 
take full control of the facilities during the next mandate.
<P>
	It is the same in Trois-Pistoles. We have received financial 
support on an irregular basis, at election time. There has to be a 
guaranteed long term future for the ferry. Money must be invested 
there, money that would allow job creation.
<P>
	We see the same thing happening in TÃ©miscouata, a region that 
borders on New Brunswick. There is one highway, highway 185, 
where there has been a major increase in truck traffic for several 
years, ever since the railroad tracks were dismantled, and the 
highway badly needs repairs. We have to show some initiative in 
this respect. We can no longer expect the traditional ways of 
funding to kick in, so we suggested, as recommended in the report 
presented by the transport committee, setting up projects in 
partnership with the private sector in this country.
<P>
	Liberal members and members of the Bloc Quebecois made this 
suggestion so that our national highway network could be renewed 
faster than would otherwise be the case.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	We all know governments have less money than they did in the 
past. They had to find new and different ways to fund these 
projects. The private sector-public sector partnership works as 
follows: the government announces that it wants such and such a 
project to be carried out. The private sector responds to a call for 
tenders and says yes, it will take care of construction or renovation 
and maintenance over a period of 25 or 30 years, and the 
government awards a service contract for that period of time. The 
government continues to own the highway. The highway is not 
sold. It is not wholly privatized. The service contract is a way for 
the federal government or any other government to avoid having to 
provide funding during the first few years. This means the project 
can be fast-tracked.
<P>
	This approach was welcomed by the mayors of municipalities 
along highway 185, and I can understand why. For many years they 
have been waiting for investments. Since the highway is part of the 
Trans-Canada highway, it is important for the federal government 
to do its share.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Paul CrÃªte (Kamouraska-RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after this interruption that was quite beyond the House's 
control, I remind members that we are looking at Bill C-93 
concerning certain measures in the budget.
<P>
	Before the interruption, I was saying that this budget did not 
contain any real measures to combat unemployment, the major 
problem in Quebec and in Canada. I proposed several specific 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10056"> 10056 </A></B>
<P>
solutions to turn the tide and promote employment in our various 
ridings.
<P>
	The first was a plan to use the surplus in the UI fund not just to 
lower the deficit but to really create jobs, particularly in regions 
with a lot of seasonal employment. This would make it possible to 
diversify our regional economies.
<P>
	For example, the number of weeks of work could be increased 
for forestry workers, as is done in our region, by processing forest 
products, in order to increase the number of full time jobs in the 
forestry industry in the future.
<P>
	I also spoke about changing government policy on procurement, 
which has been sadly lacking in Quebec, among other places, in 
recent years. In 1994, Quebecers were short $1.3 billion compared 
to what they should have received, given their percentage of the 
population. That is 22,000 jobs for Quebec, or almost 300 jobs per 
riding. This would make all the difference between towns having 
trouble surmounting these difficulties and towns with an SMB that 
could win federal government contracts. This is a concrete way to 
do something about employment.
<P>
	The other way to do something is to loosen the federal 
government's grip on transfer payments, to ensure the return of the 
$750 million in health cuts over two years in Quebec alone because 
of lost transfer payments. If it had really decided to make cuts in 
departmental operating budgets, this kind of cut could have been 
avoided and the money would be there for jobs. The provinces 
would not be stuck with the problems they are now facing.
<P>
	There are also active measures under the infrastructures 
program. The federal government announced that it was divesting 
itself of ports and other infrastructures, that it was turning them 
over to the public, to interested groups. But when it does this, these 
facilities must be in an acceptable condition. Action must be taken 
rapidly. Market conditions are changing. Our economic 
stakeholders must, therefore, be able to take advantage of the best 
transportation infrastructures possible.
<P>
	Shipping as well as road, rail and air transportation are all 
sectors in which prompt action must be taken. However, where 
ports are concerned, the federal government has already announced 
its intention of unloading them. Let it hand the money over to the 
communities concerned, so that they may take things over, as soon 
as possible, in order to breathe new life into these really important 
elements for job creation.
<P>
	After Quebec became aware that it absolutely must assume 
responsibility for manpower, after 32 years of repeated 
demands-particularly in the past three years as the Bloc kept 
asking questions in the House in order to ensure that the money 
available for manpower was given to Quebec, which already had 
responsibility for education, which already possessed all of the 
tools necessary, and which was lacking only the necessary funds 
for these programs to be effective-it finally came to pass. In 
future, we will have to obtain the same type of responsibility for 
transportation.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	We became aware in the past that, because the federal 
government was responsible for rail, air and maritime 
transportation, while the provinces were responsible for highways, 
there had never been any true connection between the governments 
in order to ensure effective intermodal transportation.
<P>
	We have reached the point now where all means of 
transportation, and all infrastructures, must be brought in line with 
one another, so as to properly meet the new challenges of the North 
American markets created by the North American Free Trade 
Agreement with the United States, Mexico and South America. 
This, then, is another step that must be taken.
<P>
	Under the current system, it is certain that we will never obtain 
real jurisdiction, because the federal government has a sort of 
natural inclination to prevent such transfers. But at the very least 
we would need to obtain the same as for manpower, during the next 
mandate, so as to be able to act on the economic markets and to 
ensure that the economic strategy is consistent with a 
transportation strategy which takes all means of transportation into 
consideration.
<P>
	I will give an example of this. A few years ago, the rail line 
linking RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup with Edmundston was dismantled, with 
federal government authorization. Since that time, the highway 
system has been jammed with truck traffic. There is also increased 
economic activity between the maritimes and Quebec. Had there 
been only one government intervening in the two sectors, we would 
have realized that the solution lay not in making miserly savings by 
dismantling the railway system. What we needed was a more 
integrated approach which would have made it possible to put 
trailers on trains and move them by truck at the end of the line. 
There would have been economic choices, but they were not made.
<P>
	Today we face a new reality. The federal government is 
responsible for this highway. It is part of the Trans-Canada 
highway. We proposed with the Liberal members a public-private 
partnership project, which would mean the early completion of 
repair work.
<P>
	I think the federal government would do well in the next election 
to endorse public-private partnership projects and, as the Liberal 
and Bloc members of the Standing Committee on Transport 
recommended, pilot projects, with Highway 185 being an 
interesting example.
<P>
	In short, the budget we got in 1997 was along the same lines as 
those of previous years. The Minister of Finance tried to fight the 
deficit. He had some success, but the number one problem 
governments are facing today is not the fight against the deficit 
anymore, but unemployment and how to help people in the regions.
<P>
	If we want results, we cannot wait another year. Canadians will 
have to react quickly and tell the government, during the election 
campaign, that they  want corrections to be made, that they want a 
budget to implement such corrections as soon as Parliament returns 
after the election, so that, in one, two or three years, we will see 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10057"> 10057 </A></B>
<P>
results because something will have been about unemployment and 
about using the potential of all Canadians.
<P>
	I am thinking in particular of those who have no specialized 
training. We must make sure these workers have jobs. When I am 
told there are no jobs available and when I am asked what to do 
about it, I say that we must make money available, we must make 
the employment insurance surplus fund available to allow these 
workers to gain more experience and to accumulate more weeks of 
employment. For example, why not use the employment insurance 
fund to promote secondary or tertiary processing of forestry 
products?
<P>
	As you know, our softwood lumber exports to the United States 
are subject to a quota. However, when that wood is processed and 
given added value, it is no longer subject to that quota. This means 
that more wood can then be exported to the United States. We could 
use the surplus in the employment insurance fund to implement 
concrete projects and hire people who do not necessarily have 
specialized training, but who have practical experience in the 
forestry industry.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government will have to go back to the 
drawing board very quickly in order to deal with the number one 
problem: unemployment. Given its performance regarding the 
deficit, the government has no reason to brag. Canadians want 
action now.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member from the Bloc mentioned that the time for deficit control 
was over, that deficit control was no longer the issue.
<P>
	With all due respect to the member, in starting my speech today I 
really feel that is a bit of an irresponsible attitude to take toward the 
deficit. At $19 billion, and maybe it will get down to $10 billion, it 
is a little muddled about where the figures actually are, what an 
irresponsible attitude.
<P>
	It still adds $10 billion to the $600 billion that the federal 
government now owes. The way to get meaningful job creation is 
not to have that deficit balloon upwards. That could easily happen 
anyway if interest rates go up two or three percentage points. Our 
deficit could easily balloon right back over $20 billion or $25 
billion per year.
<P>
	We really must get that deficit under control first. We have to 
start running surpluses. Perhaps the hon. member who spoke before 
me and maybe many members of this House have had no direct 
business experience. However, speaking as a business person on 
behalf of my  colleagues in Reform, many of whom are business 
people with business experience, the way to create jobs is to get 
taxation down.
<P>
	When a business' taxes are lower, when its employees' taxes are 
lower, both the business and the employees have more disposable 
income. When the business has more disposable income it is easy 
to reinvest and to create new jobs, to expand, to advertise. That is 
how jobs are created.
<P>
	In addition, when the employees have more disposable income 
because their taxes are lower, they spend money on furniture, on 
cars and vacations, extra treats that maybe they would not have had 
before. This stimulates growth in the economy. It causes businesses 
in turn to reinvest the money that they have. That means massive 
job creation and that is the way to job growth. It is not by having 
the government spend money to create short term jobs, as it did 
with the infrastructure boondoggle where the auditor general 
calculated that each job created cost us something like $75,000. 
What a terrible waste of taxpayer money.
<P>
	We could have used that infrastructure money to help pay down 
the debt. Then we would be closer to tax reductions and meaningful 
jobs.
<P>
	A colleague of mine from the Reform Party, the member for 
Yorkton-Melville, brought in a private member's bill recently, 
Bill C-361, in which he proposed that there should be a people's tax 
form. The bill was called the people's tax form act.
<P>
	The member proposed that when people fill out their income tax, 
in the income tax envelope there should be a one page 
questionnaire inviting opinions about specific major programs.
<P>
	I suspect that defenders of the status quo would find three 
objections to the people's tax form act. First, they would say that 
too few people would be willing to fill it out. Second, too many 
people would fill it out and create too much work. Third, citizens 
do not know what they are talking about and should keep their 
noses out of the government's business. I do not suppose we will 
ever really know what the citizens think. I am certain the 
government would not have supported the bill anyway.
<P>
	In the experiment that was run by my colleague in his riding, the 
overwhelming results from the 500 people who returned the 
questionnaires were that the federal programs endorsed in one form 
or another were the ones that all four major parties in this House 
support. They are old age security, health care, justice, the RCMP, 
the Canada pension plan, debt reduction, veterans pensions, 
universities, natural resource development, environmental 
protection and practical research.
<P>
	Then there are the ten most strongly opposed programs. The 
budget we brought in last year could have dealt with them and 
saved taxpayers a bundle of money. The ten most strongly opposed 
expenditures were all the  fat little Liberal pet ponies: official 
bilingualism, subsidies for special interests, gun registration, for-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10058"> 10058 </A></B>
<P>
eign aid, multiculturalism, that National Film Board, subsidies for 
business, subsidies for sports, Indian affairs and the CBC.
<P>
	There are themes that are noticeable here. People want to retain 
public security for those who cannot afford it themselves. We have 
an obligation to help those who need our assistance. They want 
government to encourage but not interfere in the marketplace.
<P>
	Unfortunately we cannot seem to convince this government to 
take a more businesslike approach to the running of government. 
The policies of this government really do affect the average person 
on the street quite dramatically.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	I received a letter last week from a constituent by the name of 
Ms. Munday: ``I am a registered nurse, so every year I am charged 
GST on my registration fee and every year I have to waste time on 
the telephone getting through to the income tax office to send me a 
GST rebate form''. She describes in detail the process, the hassles, 
the number of hours she wastes to have a form sent out to her which 
she needs every year. She has made a suggestion which I hope the 
Minister of National Revenue will hear. Surely the revenue 
collection department can get its act together well enough to send 
out the appropriate form with the tax forms it sends to her every 
year, knowing that she will need them.
<P>
	I am sure the minister will act on that suggestion, but the 
underlying theme of the letter is that if we did not have the GST 
there would not be a need for this lady to fill out the form every 
year. The whole exercise of filling out the form to get the rebate is a 
waste of taxpayer money.
<P>
	There are a number of people involved in creating the refund and 
their time is not being used productively. First the tax has to be 
collected. It has to be processed and banked. Then a form has to be 
sent off to this lady, after hours of negotiation on the telephone. 
Then she has to fill it out using her time. It has to be mailed and 
processed again. Then there has to be a print run on stationery paid 
for by the people. It goes back to her. It gets processed through her 
bank account and out of the government account again. It is a 
wasteful process and the amounts can be very small. I am sure in 
many cases the amounts are extremely small. It must be a 
tremendously unproductive and costly exercise.
<P>
	There are places in the House of Commons where we could save 
a lot of money and cut the deficit significantly. For example, a 
couple of weeks ago I brought to the attention of the House an issue 
concerning the heritage committee. It was proposing to spend 
about $214,000 for a travel junket around the country to define 
Canadian culture. Defining Canadian culture? It is like trying to  
define what makes a cat a cat or what love is. What a ridiculous 
thing to be wasting money on.
<P>
	The heritage committee was not very happy with me. I know that 
because the chairman circulated a memo with a copy of my speech 
and complained bitterly about me at the subsequent committee 
hearing. Of course he did not invite me to the hearing. I found out 
about it by accident when I read the transcript.
<P>
	I am glad the election will interfere with the plans of that 
committee. It will save taxpayers about $214,000. I give notice to 
the committee that if it regenerates the plan after the election I will 
ensure it gets plenty of publicity.
<P>
	In terms of whether the government takes any notice of 
taxpayers desire to get rid of some of the waste, I saw a very 
interesting article in a local newspaper. It appeared in the February 
24 edition of the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>. It was about a gentleman who 
decided he had a problem with the finance minister. He discovered 
that the finance minister had an E-mail address. He promptly sent 
off an E-mail. He received a personal reply, in both official 
languages, with a ``thank you for taking the time''. It went on to say 
that this would be the only reply he would receive because of 
financial constraints.
<P>
	He was particularly impressed with the E-mail, noting that he 
had sent it at 1800 hours Vancouver time, nine o'clock at night 
Ottawa time, and within five minutes of sending it he had received 
the reply. He thought ``my goodness, we have a lot of very 
overworked public servants in Ottawa in the finance minister's 
office answering E-mail at five after nine at night''.
<P>
	He thought that a bit suspicious. Right away he sent another 
E-mail on a totally different topic and he received the same E-mail 
message five minutes later, in both official languages, thanking 
him once again for his opinion and saying that this was the only 
reply he would get because of financial constraints.
<P>
	More than a tad suspicious, he sent a third message to the finance 
minister which consisted entirely of ``fuzzy-wuzzy was a bear, 
fuzzy-wuzzy had no hair''. Five minutes later, sure enough, he 
received the same answer again, in both official languages, saying 
that this was the only reply he would receive because of financial 
constraints.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	This is a very good example of how taxpayers' money is being 
wasted on meaningless responses to concerned taxpayers. The 
government has no intention of taking their input seriously.
<P>
	I have another letter that was sent to me by a constituent who had 
written to the Prime Minister. This constituent received an answer 
from the Prime Minister's office dated March 27, 1997. This 
concerns input into the budget process. It reads:
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10059"> 10059 </A></B>
<P>
Dear Mr. Campbell:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On behalf of the Prime Minister, I would like to acknowledge receipt of your 
correspondence of March 16 regarding.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Yours sincerely, Jill Bowerman, Special Assistant.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	They forgot to even put in the topic. It just ends.
<P>
	This is probably another example of nobody having read the 
input or could care less about the input from this person. He was 
sending suggestions about the budget process and received a 
standard form letter where the person answering even forgot to 
plug in the topic.
<P>
	If there was a little bit more direct democracy in our system the 
people in this place would care a bit more about taking notice of the 
input they got on bills like this budget bill that is before the House. 
They would be concerned that the people would have power, if 
there was more direct democracy, to change the laws.
<P>
	I will give an example. An article appeared in the <I>Financial Post</I> 
of Wednesday, April 9 about California's affirmation action ban 
being upheld. Members may know about the controversial 
proposition 209, which was put forward in California a few months 
ago to get rid of the affirmative action programs in California. 
They had distorted, with discriminatory practices, the job 
marketplace in California showing preference to specific groups 
not based on their skills but because they could fit into certain 
boxes. It so outraged the people of California when they could see 
the unfair distortions that were created by these programs that they 
started proposition 209. They were successful in overturning this 
politically correct legislation that had been introduced by their 
politically correct legislators. On a court challenge, the result of 
that proposition was upheld.
<P>
	What a wonderful victory for taxpayers when they can take their 
legislators to task in that way and get rid of legislation which they 
see as improper that has been foisted on them because legislators 
think they know what is best for them.
<P>
	The pressure for change to give more meaningful input to bills 
like this is building all around the world. There was an article in the 
<I>Hill Times</I> a week ago headed ``polls show that Britons have a clear 
desire to radically change Parliament and the voting process''. It is 
quite an interesting article and is very easy to obtain here on the 
Hill. I would recommend to all members to get a hold of it.
<P>
	The article mentions that the British show a readiness for radical 
change in their system of government. Keep in mind that they are 
way ahead of us anyway. They permit free voting in the House of 
Commons. It is a commonly observed process for members to be 
voting on opposite sides. Yet they are still showing a desire to see 
even more change and more input into the process.
<P>
	Specifically there is a strong and accelerating dissatisfaction 
with Parliament and the parliamentary  system, but interestingly 
enough not with the local MPs. People feel that the local MPs listen 
to their concerns and perhaps even take them to Parliament. Much 
as happens in this place, the concerns can be expressed here but 
they end up falling into a big black hole and disappear.
<P>
	Every day we present petitions, sometimes tens of thousands, 
sometimes hundreds of thousands of names. I remember just after 
we came to this House after the election of 1993, Reform proposed 
that we have one day a month where we debate the major petitions 
so that we could get the government's position on these things. Our 
idea was defeated.
<P>
	These petitions still, to this day, get presented and then just go 
down to the vault in the basement. I do not know if any member has 
been down there to see the petitions that are stored from the turn of 
the century. Can anyone imagine the millions of names that are 
down there on petitions asking for things and the government has 
never taken any notice? There really is no democratic part to the 
process. It really is a great shame.
<P>
	Because of the lack of democracy, we get the type of examples I 
gave where letters remain unanswered, E-mails are answered with 
meaningless text and we get government dispensing money 
without requesting permission from the taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	The premier of Alberta has introduced legislation to make it 
necessary for the government to get permission from taxpayers to 
increase tax rates. What a wonderful sign that we are actually 
starting to get some improvements in the democratic process. What 
a radical idea, that taxpayers might actually be able to tell the 
government not to increase taxes. I congratulate the premier for 
doing that. I also congratulate the Ontario premier for seriously 
considering the introduction of meaningful initiative and 
referendum legislation to give the people the power to direct the 
government in the way it spends their money.
<P>
	There are certainly plenty of things we could do with direction 
here in spending taxpayers' money. The government has handed 
out vast sums of money to Bombardier. I have a letter from another 
constituent, Mr. Currie, that is dated March 27. It is actually 
addressed to the member for Waterloo. My constituent says: ``On 
March 21 in reply to a question from the member for North 
Vancouver regarding Bombardier's apparent use of a federal grant 
of $97 million to increase its reported profit by $93 million-''
<P>
	Bombardier reported a profit of $93 million last year but it 
received a federal grant for $97 million so it is very easy to see 
where its bottom line came from. I asked a question of the member 
for Waterloo about that. The member replied that it was a perfect 
example of a critical investment in research and development and 
that it was money we would get back with interest.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10060"> 10060 </A></B>
<P>
	Three days later, on March 24, Bombardier announced it was 
moving its production of the Sea-Doo water craft to Benton, 
Illinois. After receiving $97 million from the federal government, 
it promptly closed down a plant and put 165 employees out of 
work. Adding 165 people to Canada's unemployment roll hardly 
seems like an investment we will get back with interest. The $97 
million might have been better spent on transfers to the provinces 
to offset their increasing health care costs.
<P>
	That raises an interesting point because the Liberals claim to be 
the only party-I have seen it in advertisements-that can be 
trusted to preserve quality universal health care. The fact is the 
Liberals have cut more than $7 billion from transfers to the 
provinces in support of health care and social programs.
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign, in response to public input, 
Reform's zero in three plan to balance the budget specifically 
exempted health care transfers and transfers in support of higher 
education from any cuts. It was in the plan because people had told 
us that those two items were their highest priorities. The Liberals 
have cut $7 billion from those transfers and have pretended they 
have not done anything. Reform's fresh start program for the 1997 
election campaign states that we will restore $4 billion of the $7 
billion that has been cut by the Liberals.
<P>
	The Liberals also claim in some of their election campaign 
material that they have cleaned up federal finances and 
dramatically reduced the deficit. The fact is the Liberals have 
actually added $100 billion to the debt in the last three and a half 
years. That means taxpayers are paying about $8 billion more in 
interest payments than they were when the Liberals took office.
<P>
	Reductions in the deficit have not come from cuts to federal 
spending, not to the government's special departments. Only $5 
billion has been cut out of its $160 billion budget for federal 
departmental spending. The bulk of the reductions have come 
almost exclusively from huge cuts in transfers to the provinces, 
enormous increases in taxes and user fees and good luck in the 
form of lower interest rates.
<P>
	Sitting on the opposite side of the House is a member who comes 
from the banking industry. He knows very well the effects that 
increasing interest rates have on the amounts people pay for their 
mortgages. He is probably also well aware of the amount of 
Canada's debt that is in short term securities, two to three year 
periods or less. He knows that we are constantly rolling over that 
debt, that if these interests rates shoot up three, four or five points, 
that debt will be renewed at increasingly difficult payment levels. 
The country could quite easily slip into a terrible crisis if interest 
rates jump dramatically, especially if it is necessary to defend the 
rather failing dollar we have right at the moment.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	I can see that the other side of the House is getting a little bit 
antsy and that members would probably like to ask me a few 
questions which I always welcome.
<P>
	I will wind up by saying that if we want to get this country back 
on track and create jobs, we have to get taxes down, spending under 
control and begin paying off Canada's $600 billion debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a privilege to speak to this bill.
<P>
	I want to address a couple of matters about government spending 
that need to be said. Each night as we grow closer to an election I 
watch the government throwing out its usual dollars to encourage 
people to vote for them.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
Liberals says ``not me''. He may be the only one who says that.
<P>
	I wonder just how Liberal members feel when in fact they are 
borrowing this money from other countries and selling it to the 
very taxpayers that are footing the bill for interest.
<P>
	It is really alarming that we are overspending this year by some 
$19 billion-that is nineteen thousand million dollars-and yet the 
government believes that it can spend about $6.5 billion thus far 
just before an election. Why not take that money, try to write down 
the deficit or even pay down some of the debt? What is this 
preoccupation before an election of a government to think that 
people are standing there with their hands out waiting for money?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know the member has just started his speech for 
today but as it is almost 2 p.m., I wonder if we could go to 
statements by members and he will have the floor when we come 
back.

	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Alberta 
welcomes the world to experience Canada's magnificent, majestic 
Banff National Park, confident that its future will be protected and 
enhanced by the Banff management plan.
<P>
	The plan will be the basis for all decision making in the park for 
the next 10 to 15 years and will ensure the legacy continues into the 
21st century.
<P>
	In particular, the heritage tourism initiative will enrich the 
experience of all who visit. Parks Canada, the town of Banff and 
the tourism industry are developing a  heritage tourism strategy 
that centres around the park's natural, cultural and historical 
resources. This strategy supports a common code of ethics for the 
local tourism industry and its partners. It promotes the orientation,

and it focuses on heritage tourism activities.

	An annual round table, an open public forum to review the 
progress and to account for the action gives all Canadians an 
opportunity to be part of ensuring a sustainable future for Canada's 
national park.

	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of our most 
cherished values is volunteerism. Every day our citizens freely and 
selflessly offer a helping hand to those in need.
<P>
	Today I would like to say a few words about the work of the 
Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, a great Canadian story that 
seldom gets told.
<P>
	Since it began operations in 1978 auxiliary members have 
participated with risks to their own lives in upwards of 28,000 
incidents, 24 per cent of all marine search and rescue incidents 
annually, and 200 lives on average are saved each year.
<P>
	Working closely with the Canadian Coast Guard and made up 
mostly of fishermen and recreational boaters, the auxiliary 3,400 
members and their 1,300 vessels are an invaluable part of our 
marine search and rescue network.
<P>
	The auxiliary's work also extends to prevention activities as 
members dedicate their time to conduct demonstrations of marine 
safety equipment, give lectures on boating safety, conduct courtesy 
examinations of pleasure craft and fishing vessels, and participate 
in boat shows.
<P>
	These unsung heroes of the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary 
deserve all the support the government and the Canadian public can 
give them.

behaviour and the health of the planet.
<P>
	In Canada over 3,000 events are planned, including the planting 
of seedlings and the cleaning of streams and rivers. Community 
groups and schools are staging events on the protection of nature, 
conservation of our natural resources, reduction of air pollution and 
carbon dioxide emissions, protection of our drinking water, 
importance of recycling, energy efficiency and conservation of 
energy.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week Statistics Canada released the 
numbers from the 1996 census and revealed what British 
Columbians have known all along, that B.C. is home of the biggest 
population boom in Canada. B.C. grew by 13.5 per cent between 
1991 and 1996.
<P>
	In 1951 the first census that included all 10 provinces showed 
that B.C. had only 8.3 per cent of Canada's population. Today it has 
12.9 per cent. Another indicator of B.C.'s growth is a comparison 
with the second largest province, Quebec. In 1951 B.C. had 25 per 
cent of Quebec's population. Today it has 52 per cent.
<P>
	Despite these numbers B.C. gets only one-third of the amount of 
federal dollars that Quebec receives for each immigrant. It gets 
only 28 per cent of the money that Quebec got from the 
government's infrastructure fund.
<P>
	It is time for Ottawa to realize that Canada is changing and to 
start acting like it is 1997, not 1951.

Devco has just sold the Donkin mine site to a private company 
without tender for the princely sum of $1 so that the private 
company could undertake engineering studies about the feasibility 
of operating the mine as a private venture in the future.
<P>
	Devco employees want answers about this blatant pre-election 
ploy. Does it signal that the privatization of Devco is in the works? 
When the new mine is up and running will experienced miners at 
Devco be forced to leave behind their seniority and pensions and 
start from scratch with the new private company?
<P>
	If private interests think that Donkin is worth developing, why 
did Devco not commission the engineering studies rather than 
giving the mine away?
<P>
	Cape Bretoners whose livelihoods are most directly affected 
have been left out in the cold. Shame on the 32 Liberal MPs from

the green rug of the House of Commons symbolizes the village

bring their concerns to the speaker. This was a parliament with only 
the walls and carpet of nature.
<P>
	We are all members of the earth community and even though we 
now sit in a building of stone, mortar and glass, we must remember 
our connection to the earth. Human activity is threatening the basic 
fundamentals of life on our planet. This can no longer be ignored. 
As parliamentarians we must legislate as if all life on this planet 
matters.

<P>
	It was on May 1, 1947 that this act was repealed. It represents a 
milestone in the history of Canadians of Chinese descent. It meant 
that after decades of hardship Chinese Canadians were finally 
recognized as equal Canadian citizens.
<P>
	We all know the tremendous role the Chinese Canadian 
community has played in building our nation. The first Chinese 
immigrants arrived in 1858. Their achievements have included 
building the national railway, serving in two world wars and many 
major contributions to business and the arts.
<P>
	Today we say thank you to those early Chinese Canadian 
pioneers who helped to build the nation even under the hardship of 
the Chinese head tax and the Chinese Exclusion Act.

Canadian federalism means being flexible, and that being part of 
Canada is worthwhile for Quebec.
<P>
	As a Liberal, I applaud this great achievement, which no other 
government except our own would have been able to bring to 
fruition. This agreement on manpower training would not have 
been signed without the steadfast determination of our Prime 
Minister, for which we are very grateful.

	<B>Mr. Philippe ParÃ© (Louis-HÃ©bert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
terrible experience of Tran Trieu Quan and his family continues to 
speak to the emotions of their fellow citizens in the greater Quebec 
City area.
<P>
	In fact, 124,000 people have signed a petition sponsored by the 
archbishop of Quebec City, the mayor of Quebec City and the 
president of the Sainte-Foy Chamber of Commerce, asking the 
Vietnamese authorities to pardon Mr. Tran on compassionate 
grounds. Today, the sponsors will present this petition to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and ask him intercede more directly so 
as to obtain the release of Mr. Tran.
<P>
	I wish to welcome to our gallery some members of Mr. Tran's 
family and 30 students at the Rochebelle secondary school in 
Sainte-Foy who have become involved in this cause. Finally, I want 
to draw your attention to the presence of Janel Gauthier and his 
support group for the release of Mr. Tran.
<P>
	I am proud to see residents in my riding involved in so many 
actions to support Mr. Tran, and this has been going on for nearly 
four years. Many thanks to you all.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last year it was 
Quebec. This year it is Saskatchewan, Manitoba, British Columbia 
and now Alberta.
<P>
	All these provinces have residents who are experiencing the 
trauma of homes and businesses invaded and destroyed by flood 
waters. Most recently the communities of Peace River and Fort 
McMurray in Alberta have been hit by overflowing rivers.
<P>
	Our hearts go out to the people who are being affected by this 
phenomenon of nature. Many have worked for a lifetime to build 
and pay for their properties. It is devastating to them to see the 
results of their efforts destroyed. Families and individuals face 
huge challenges in coping with the trauma of losing valued 
personal possessions.
<P>
	However this also becomes a time of meaningful, helpful 
community. Friends and neighbours pull together to rebuild and to 
assist those whose loss is most severe or who have the most 
difficulty in recouping their losses.
<P>
	I ask all members of the House to join me in expressing our 
heartfelt concern and commitment to help.

	<B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Canadian government announced good news for the 
economic recovery of the Montreal region.
<P>
	It said it was providing assistance to a French company, Ubi 
Soft, to help it start up operations in Montreal. This should result in 
the creation of 560 jobs over the next five years.
<P>
	During this period, the software producer, editor and distributor 
will receive $14.8 million in funding from the federal government.
<P>
	The example of Ubi Soft shows that Canadian federalism is 
working well in Quebec. When everyone has this determination to 
find effective solutions to regional issues, it can truly be said that 
Canadian federalism is serving Quebecers.

pleased to note that today is Earth Day, an occasion celebrated 
throughout the world. On this date, the public is invited to do 
something, however small, to help improve their environment.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we must conclude that the Liberal government 
has never heard about this invitation, because its record in this area 
is dreadful. Just recently, the Minister of the Environment himself 
admitted that his government had failed in the fight against 
greenhouse gases. The latest ozone layer figures are extremely 
worrying. Recently, there have been news reports on the former 
American military bases in the Arctic that are posing a dangerous 
threat to that region's fragile ecosystem.
<P>
	This government does not hesitate, however, to implement 
legislation interfering directly in areas of provincial jurisdiction, 
thus leading to costly and unnecessary overlap.

we congratulate all those who are using this day to help improve 
the environment of the region in which they live.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in his ministerial statement this morning, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs admitted that many voices, both 
francophone and anglophone, Catholic as well as Protestant, have 
been heard over the last twenty years advocating a system based on 
language rather than religion.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs even indicated that a 
consensus on the need to reorganize school administration along 
these lines has existed in Quebec for some time.
<P>
	Since even the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs admits 
there has been a consensus for the past 20 years, how can he 
explain that his actions are again opening the Quebec consensus up 
to question, by deliberately delaying the start of the debate and the 
adoption of this motion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. StÃ©phane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is nothing to confess, and the repetition is 
starting to become a pain in the neck.
<P>
	What I have said since the beginning of this business is that, 
since the end of January, since the moment that the Government of 
Quebec began to indicate that it would be presenting a 
constitutional amendment, I have said that, on the one hand, there 
was a consensus in Quebec to have linguistic school boards and, on 
the other hand, that work was needed on a consensus about how the 
Government of Quebec wanted to proceed. Because it can be said 
that there will be a consensus on Bill 107, or on the 
Proulx-Woehrling solution, or on other possibilities, what was 
needed was to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10065"> 10065 </A></B>
<P>
find out whether  there was consensus on the way the Government 
of Quebec wanted to proceed.
<P>
	It will be recalled that, a week before the unanimous vote in the 
National Assembly, there was no consensus. It was the Mulcair 
amendment which made it possible to build a consensus, due to the 
highly positive action of the official opposition in the National 
Assembly.
<P>
	Now it can be stated that there is consensus. The Government of 
Quebec is very pleased to support the planned constitutional 
amendment and, as usual, no doubt the parliamentary committee 
will make it possible to expand the consensus even further, thus 
facilitating the implementation of a desired measure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when Quebec is involved, things always get really 
complicated with the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. Yet 
there is a precedent in New Brunswick, where there was no 
consensus. Their Legislative Assembly was even divided, yet the 
federal government moved quickly, even managing to get a motion 
through without a vote in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Whereas in Quebec there has been talk of education structures 
since the Parent report in 1966, and a consensus was reached, as 
even the minister admits, at least 20 years ago, and what is more 
this has again been confirmed with the general assembly in 
Quebec, and as well there is unanimity in the National Assembly 
on the matter.
<P>
	Here is my question for the minister. Why does the federal 
government insist on wanting to apply its old double standard 
policy where the wishes of the Quebec people are concerned?
<P>
	<B>Hon. StÃ©phane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have already explained to the House just how 
unfortunate it is that the official opposition uses the example of 
New Brunswick and the constitutional amendment which enabled 
New Brunswick to enhance bilingualism in that province.
<P>
	There was indeed no unanimity in the New Brunswick provincial 
legislature but, first, there had been a parliamentary committee on 
the provincial level-not the case in Quebec-and second, the 
amendment was very clearly aimed at expanding the rights of the 
linguistic minority. No one was opposed, and third, the only party 
which was opposed, and voted against it, was one that had been 
created expressly to fight bilingualism in New Brunswick, the COR 
Party.
<P>
	We see today that the official opposition, with its siege 
mentality, does not hesitate to make use of the argument of a 
political party which was created to oppose the French language, to 
make us believe that there is discrimination against Quebec, that 
there is a double standard involved here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us make things clear here. Why does the minister not 
agree that the real reason he and his government, the Liberal 
government, are dragging their feet on what Quebec is asking is 
that he does not want to get on the wrong side of his former allies, 
his natural and traditional allies, Alliance QuÃ©bec and <I>The Gazette</I>?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	That is the real reason. And what is more, he does not want to get 
on the wrong side of the disciples of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who are 
in the process of organizing into a common front, once again at the 
expense of Quebec. That is the real reason. Let him admit it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. StÃ©phane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we have before us an official opposition that cannot 
accept a piece of good news, because any good news on the 
evolution of Canadian federalism carries the risk of convincing 
Quebec that Canada is, in fact, a country that is functioning well, 
developing well, serving their interests well. However, the official 
opposition is in a conflict of interest situation.
<P>
	Trotsky wrote a book called <I>The Permanent Revolution</I>, and later 
Mitterrand wrote one called <I>Le coup d'Ãtat permanent</I>. I propose 
that the next book written about the Bloc Quebecois be titled <I>The 
permanent conflict of interest</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	In his notice of motion, the minister proposes to appoint a 
special joint committee of both Houses of Parliament. The 
committee will be asked to consider the various aspects of a 
constitutional amendment that would allow linguistic school 
boards in Quebec. It would submit its report on May 31, 1997.
<P>
	Does the minister realize he is insulting Quebec's intelligence by 
setting up a bogus committee that will never see the light of day, 
since an election call is imminent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. StÃ©phane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if an election is called, we will pick up the process 
after the election and the constitutional amendment will be taken 
care of by a re-elected Liberal government.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the various political parties would be well advised 
to say whether they are for or against the amendment. The Liberal 
Party of Canada will support the amendment. This information will 
be useful for the voters. We will have to say where we stand.
<P>
	The official opposition may prefer us to say we are against the 
resolution, but we support it. We agree with the National Assembly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10066"> 10066 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister ought to know that when Parliament is dissolved, the 
committees are dissolved as well.
<P>
	The minister should learn the ABC's of the Parliament of Canada 
and put a book on parliamentary procedure in his backpack. By 
setting up a committee that will include unelected senators, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is more or less telling the 
National Assembly and the Quebec nation to forget it.
<P>
	Would the minister agree it is not up to unelected members of 
Parliament to consider and approve a legitimate, democratic and 
unanimous decision by the Quebec National Assembly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. StÃ©phane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental </B><B>Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I repeat that if there is an election, even the opposition 
will be dissolved. And we hope it will be dissolved for a long time, 
and that includes when Parliament returns after the election.
<P>
	However, speaking of books on parliamentary procedure, the 
Canadian Constitution makes it quite clear it is not up to the Senate 
to decide. The House of Commons, not the Senate, will make the 
decision.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have had a glimpse of the government's spending priorities and 
they are not very pretty. Somehow over the last several weeks 
national priorities for the government have become things like 
armouries in the Prime Minister's riding, armouries in the Deputy 
Prime Minister's riding and the health minister's riding, a sock 
factory in Montreal and billions of dollars on other pre-election 
goodies.
<P>
	If the government has all this money lying around, which of 
course it does not, why is it not spending it on health care, by far 
the most important priority for Canadians? If it does not have this 
money lying around-and again I do not think it does-why is it 
racking up the national credit card in a pre-election spending spree?
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as usual the member has 
it all wrong. There is no armoury in my riding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, some 
would say there is not much of a minister in that riding either.
<P>
	When we start adding up the pre-election goodies the Prime 
Minister has thrown around to buy votes, it adds up to just under $7 
billion. When I look on my Doppler  radar, I see storm clouds ahead 
for the Liberal government.
<P>
	Given the desire of Canadians for a balanced budget, lower taxes 
and for a reinvestment in health care, why is the government 
resorting to this old fashioned, out of touch, smarmy attempt to win 
votes over?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to reply 
to the hon. member from smarmy. It is not something he would 
understand, but government does not operate on a day to day basis 
with respect to projects that take years to put in place and years to 
evaluate.
<P>
	If the hon. member is suggesting that in any part of the country, 
including his riding, the government should come to a complete 
halt and not proceed with projects and initiatives that have been 
undertaken by people who have had an interest in them over many 
years, then he should tell us. However, if the member looks closely 
into that radar-although I am not sure it is a Doppler, knowing the 
hon. member-he might want to look at what the future holds for 
the Reform Party in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
the minister was booed so loudly while giving a speech recently in 
his part of the country, I do not think things look so hot for him 
either.
<P>
	The Prime Minister says he is against broad based tax relief. I 
guess that becomes very obvious after he has gone out and spent 
just about $7 billion in the last little while. The fact is that if he had 
taken that $7 billion and given it back to Canadians in the form of 
tax relief, we would have had about 200,000 jobs created in this 
country.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell us why he thinks buying votes with 
borrowed money is more important than real job creation through 
tax relief?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again the member's 
facts are all wrong. Included in the figure that he is putting forward 
is a significant amount of money spent under manpower transfers 
which is currently going toward job creation.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	While spring brings joy to many, it brings anguish to a great 
many Quebec families and Acadian families facing the harsh 
reality of the spring gap. Between the time when unemployment 
benefits run out and the time when they get back to work, there is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10067"> 10067 </A></B>
<P>
waiting period during  which unemployed workers can be without 
an income for more than ten weeks.
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister say that the severe cuts 
made in the unemployment insurance program create jobs when 
they are forcing an inordinate number of families in Quebec and 
elsewhere to live on public charity?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
question has been asked by the member on a number of occasions.
<P>
	One of the key areas she fails to mention every time she gets up 
on her feet is the fact that the employment insurance system has 
been significantly changed. When the changes came in, included in 
the changes as she relates to Cape Breton and other high 
unemployment areas was the $300 million transitional jobs fund. 
This has created a significant amount of economic activity in 
ridings like the member's and mine. That extra $800 million we 
also put in the investment portion of the employment insurance 
system is helping people to find employment.
<P>
	To suggest that part two of the EI system is not improving the 
plight of the unemployed is factually incorrect.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
problem is that these millions are not nearly enough and there are 
thousands of families confronted with the spring gap.
<P>
	The unemployed are not fooled by the government's 
compassionate words. They can see that poverty has grown because 
of this government's actions. They know that there have been 
billions in cuts to transfers for social programs and to the 
unemployment insurance program.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister honestly think that making 
people poorer will boost consumption and stimulate employment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an unfortunate 
situation, and the one to blame for the welfare cuts in Quebec is not 
the Government of Canada but the Bouchard government.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians should and do know that on the eve of the election this 
government is creating last minute jobs. Unfortunately for 
Canadians, these jobs are in  appointments to the Senate, the 
Immigration and Refugee Board, agricultural boards, the IDRC, 
the National Research Council, the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. You name it, if 
there is a commission the government has appointed somebody to 
it.
<P>
	Meanwhile 1.4 million Canadians are out on the street looking 
for work with the highest level of unemployment since the 1930s.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister drop the Liberal agenda and come 
down to the people's agenda of jobs for ordinary Canadians, not 
just highly placed Liberal pals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it slightly 
hypocritical on the part of the Reform Party-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I encourage all hon. members to be very judicious 
in their choice of words.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party is publicly decrying 
the government for making investments in very important job 
creation issues. However, just before question period the member 
for Edmonton Southwest slipped me a note asking if he could get a 
$40,000 government grant for someone in his constituency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will let the member from Edmonton deal with this issue of funding 
for a centre for the handicapped. She can deal with that herself. It is 
interesting; once a rat packer, always a rat packer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Sheila, that was a shitty thing to do and 
confirms you are one bitch.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Day after day the papers are revealing more about 
the avalanche of pre-election goodies being poured out by Liberals 
for Liberals but they are being paid for by the taxpayers. The 
taxpayers would like to know the cost of these new measures.
<P>
	People are interested in the new armoury which the Prime 
Minister announced last week for his riding. But he has neglected 
to tell us exactly how much it will cost or how many votes he 
expects to get for it.
<P>
	What is the total amount the Liberal government is spending in 
the Prime Minister's riding just before the election? How much 
pork is enough pork?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to 
the hon. member's question concerning the armoury in 
Shawinigan, it is obvious he has not paid much attention to how 
that project has been set up.
<P>
	The announcement we made last week with respect to that 
armoury calls for a private-public partnership where the armoury 
would be built as a facility for the reserves, for the militia. It would 
also be privately owned. It could serve for many other purposes. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10068"> 10068 </A></B>
<P>
could be part of a  larger complex. It could be an existing building 
or a new building.
<P>
	The hon. member should look more closely at exactly what the 
government has proposed. He should understand that we are 
moving to meet what I thought his party supported. When I made 
the report to the government with respect to the future of the 
Canadian forces we said we were moving the reserves and the 
militia from 20,000 or 22,000 to about 30,000. Is the hon. member 
against the increase in the number of people who are going to be 
functioning in the Canadian forces as part of the militia and the 
reserves or is he not?

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-TÃ©miscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The federalist propaganda is spreading throughout the federal 
government. The Department of Foreign Affairs is taking part in 
this despicable process by tying financial support for Quebec 
artists performing abroad to the promotion of national unity.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	Will the heritage minister do like Quebec's Minister of Culture 
and Communications and call to order her colleague from foreign 
affairs? Will she tell him to stop using this unacceptable criterion 
and to provide support to artists strictly on the basis of the artistic 
merit of their projects?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I made it clear to the 
Quebec Minister of Culture that the government does not make 
political decisions regarding artistic issues.
<P>
	I find it confusing that the same people who accuse us of 
interfering with cultural decisions asked us last week to overrule a 
decision made by Telefilm. If we follow the principle of non 
interference, then we have to do it consistently, including the fact 
that Telefilm made its decision on the basis of artistic criteria, 
which has nothing to do with politics.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-TÃ©miscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is truly regrettable that the heritage minister does not 
know the artistic stature of Mr. Falardeau, whose project was 
turned down because it dealt with the Patriotes of 1837 and because 
Mr. Falardeau is a committed sovereignist.
<P>
	It comes as no surprise that the heritage minister would endorse 
the politicization of the Department of Foreign Affairs' grants 
process.
<P>
	My question to the heritage minister is: Why does her Liberal 
government refuse to recognize and respect Quebec's culture, and 
why is it in fact incapable of doing so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member claims 
that the decision is based on politics, when in fact we said clearly 
that any decision made by Telefilm to give a grant for any project 
should be made independently. Now, the separatists are asking us 
to interfere.
<P>
	If they want us to respect the cultural institutions' autonomy, as 
we do, then they should not ask us to overrule a decision which was 
made strictly on the basis of artistic criteria, not political ones.

in my riding, in particular at Matsqui prison.
<P>
	A judge said prisoners should have the right to vote because 
``preventing prisoners serving more than two years from voting is 
too sweeping an infringement''. This government must be really 
hard up for votes these days.
<P>
	Why did the justice minister not ask for a stay of the judge's

unable to vote in this election?

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is a great answer. He is going to take it under advisement a 
few days before they drop the writ. Great.
<P>
	This is about the rights of criminals versus the rights of victims 
and law-abiding Canadian citizens. That is what this is about.

	Criminals can now vote. They can play golf at Ferndale prison. 
They get Canada pension, old age security, the guaranteed income 
supplement, overtime pay and they can sue the crown at taxpayer 
expense.

	<B>Mr. StÃ©phan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Heritage Canada is at it again. For the second year in a row, 
young people applying for jobs in Heritage Canada's Young 
Canada Works Program will have to show that they are federalists. 
In order to get a job with Heritage Canada, young people, whom the 
department will transform into ambassadors for Canada, must 
write a 250 word essay telling their future employer what Canada 
means to them.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois takes exception to the government using 
young people to further its political ideology. How can young 
francophones in Quebec hope for a job with Heritage Canada when 
it is estimated that close to 75 per cent of them said yes to Quebec 
in the last referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, when you work for 
Heritage Canada, it is obvious that you must also belong to Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. StÃ©phan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage has obviously lost all common 
sense. In order to obtain a summer job with Heritage Canada, 
young Quebecers and Canadians will have to show that they 
believe in and are prepared to promote Canadian unity.
<P>
	Does the representative of the Prime Minister share this 
discriminatory opinion, yes or no?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it incredible that 
the member should question this. If we are looking for summer 
ambassadors for Canada, there is nothing unusual in asking them to 
write a 250 word essay on ``what Canada means to me''.
<P>

my question is for the minister responsible for emergency 
planning.
<P>
	For the past week we have watched in distress as flood waters 
have destroyed property and entire communities in both Canada 
and the United States. In Manitoba, as the Red River rises, people 
are afraid that their homes will be destroyed and their communities 
devastated.
<P>
	Can the minister assure Manitobans that he realizes the 
magnitude of this potential disaster and that our government is 
prepared to help both technically and financially in dealing with 
this potentially serious situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure that 
every member of the House understands the concerns of the people 
of Manitoba with respect to the potential disaster impending there.
<P>
	Obviously there is a very broad arrangement, led by the 
Government of Manitoba, which includes the municipalities and a 
wide array of Government of Canada departments, including the 
Department of National Defence.
<P>
	I want to say to the hon. member and to the people who 
obviously are very apprehensive about impending events in that 
part of the country that the Government of Canada will do 
everything it can. The Department of National Defence will do 
everything it can. As we know, the Government of Manitoba will 
do everything it can. The municipalities directly affected will 
participate in every way they can to avoid what appears to be an 
enormous natural disaster which will take place in a very short 
time.
<P>
	However, with respect to the inevitable, the cost, the dislocation 
and the disruption that will occur, the Government of Canada is 
absolutely committed, as I have indicated to my colleague in the 
Government of Manitoba today, to treating Manitobans equitably. 
We will give them every opportunity to respond to the problems 
they are faced with in a flexible way. We guarantee that the people 
of Manitoba will be treated as well or better than anybody who has 
ever been faced with this kind of disaster in Canada.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="10070"> 10070 </A></B>
<P>
increasingly coming to rely on in their  fight to prevent disease. A 
recent poll indicates a significant increase in Canadians' use of 
herbal and alternative therapies as a key part of their health care 
regimen.
<P>
	However, it appears that the health protection branch has other 
ideas. Canadians are witnessing the spectacle of health food stores 
being raided, products confiscated and stopped at borders and 
consumers denied access to products they have relied on for 
decades. At a time of soaring health care costs and limited 
resources, Canadians must be allowed freedom of choice.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Health. Will he impose an 
immediate moratorium on these activities until a full public review 
can be undertaken?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the only real and effective choice is 
one that ensures that the product is safe and effective.
<P>
	The mandate of Health Canada is to ensure that every product on 
the market, on the shelves, has already received the stamp of 
approval from Health Canada that the product fulfils the medicinal 
claims listed on the items.
<P>
	I am sure that the member opposite would agree that this is a 
basic responsibility that the government must fulfil.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's health care cuts make Canadians 
increasingly aware of the need to take preventive measures to 
remain healthy. Natural health products provide an important tool 
to help in that fight.
<P>
	What will the minister do to keep both his bureaucrats and 
natural health products on the shelf?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

that Health Canada already has a consultative group that includes 
practitioners who distribute and who are expert in the consumption 
of some of the remedies she is suggesting. Health Canada, over the 
course of every year, approves for distribution, for sale and 
consumption some 100 such items.
<P>

that relate to herbal medicine and that the appropriate steps have 
been taken to ensure that Canadians can have the confidence that 
all those items are safe and effective.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-OrlÃ©ans,

Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Last week, Canada refused to co-sponsor a resolution before the 
UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, condemning the 
appalling state of human rights in China. To protect its prized and 
much criticized contracts, the Liberal government was being less 
than forthright as it tried to save face by announcing a series of 
bilateral measures to discuss the human rights situation in China. 
This tactic, which was tried in Vietnam in the case of Canadian 
citizen Tran Trieu Quan, has achieved absolutely nothing in the 
past four years.
<P>
	Now that this government has made a clear choice between 
promoting trade relations and defending human rights, how does 
the minister intend to proceed to obtain from the Vietnamese 
government the immediate release of Canadian citizen Tran Trieu 
Quan?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member really mixed up two different issues. The 
first has to do with our position on China.
<P>
	As I have already explained to the House, the decision was not 
ours. It was taken by members of the European Union. They have 
already decided not to support the resolution. As a result, we were 
able to gain a number of very important bilateral agreements to 
pursue human rights. The hon. member would be well advised to 
look at the opportunities that provides.
<P>
	We are working very closely with the Government of Vietnam. 
We have met with the family many times. We will continue our 
representations. We can hope that there can be a resolution to this 
very soon. I hope this afternoon to meet with the Archbishop of 
Quebec, the family and a number of students in Quebec who have 
brought forward a petition which demonstrates widespread 
support.
<P>
	We want to continue working with the people who are deeply 
committed. I am sure if we work together in solidarity, we will find 
a very effective and very quick solution.

<P>
	Since Canada has turned its back on its traditional human rights 
policy, would the minister agree that the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Vietnam in 1982, authorizes 
us to impose sanctions and to lodge an international claim against 
Vietnam which is violating the rights of Mr. Tran?

the liberation of Mr. Quan, not just those in Quebec. This is a 
national issue. That is why the Government of Canada has taken the 
action required.
<P>
	Second, I would suggest to the hon. member that rather than 
coming to the House in an adversarial way, which his whole 
demeanour and behaviour suggests, we should be working in a 
co-operative way because this is a very important issue. It does not 
require the kind of negative approach the hon. member is taking. It 
requires a co-operative partnership approach. I am very confident 
that if we continue working together that we can achieve a very 
successful result within a matter of days.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, many 
Canadians practice preventive health care with health supplements, 
yet the health protection branch under the direction of the 
government is actively removing vitamins, minerals and herbal and 
natural extracts that have been on the shelves for decades.
<P>
	Some of these products have been in use for centuries with no 
history of harm. There is simply no scientific evidence to support 
the government's actions. Canadians are paying more for health 
supplements and their access to health products is being restricted. 
This is clearly not in the best interests of Canadians.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Health. Why is the minister 
banning herbs and vitamins that have been on store shelves and in 
use for years with no history of harm?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure whether the member 
opposite heard the first response. I stated that Health Canada is 
very interested and is determined to guarantee that the products on 
the market are of high quality, safe and effective.
<P>
	We agree that some products have been used over centuries, but 
no medicinal claims have been made for them.
<P>
	I point out to members opposite that there are some such as 
ephedra which in Texas has already proven to have negative effects 
in over 500 cases. There is comfrey, chaparral and germander that 
have caused liver toxicity and chou wu chih that has caused heart 
palpitations.
<P>
	I am sure the member opposite would not want Health Canada to 
put a stamp of approval on products that have already caused some 
serious negative considerations in the health community.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
issue has little to do with safety and acting in the public interest. 
This issue is about money and about power: money and power in 
the hands of the big pharmaceutical companies. That is what this 
issue is about.
<P>
	The government is forcing Canadians to pay more for health 
supplements and is driving small companies out of business.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Health. Will the minister act 
now to put a moratorium in place to stop the removal from store 
shelves of vitamins, minerals, and herbal and natural extracts?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member opposite may have a 
different perspective on what is the obligation of government. 
However, I can assure the House that what is of great concern is not 
the economic considerations to which he alludes. The government 
wants to make sure that any product that is on the market which has 
medicinal claims fulfils the requirement that it is a safe, effective, 
high quality product. There is no other consideration is far as 
Health Canada is concerned.

	I think the member should be ashamed for suggesting that there 
is any concern other than that.

five years since Rio.
<P>
	The international community, including Canada, has come to 
recognize that we have to redouble our efforts if we are to keep the 
promise that was made five years ago in Rio with respect to 
stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions by 2000.
<P>
	We have tried to redouble those efforts. Last December with my 
colleague, the Minister of Natural Resources, at a joint 
federal-provincial energy and environmental ministerial 
conference, 45 new

at the ministerial level. We continue to raise our concerns in this 
matter.

	In fact, the Brazilian government has indicated its choice is to 
move ahead with a treaty on exchange of offenders. It will be part 
of its general policy which includes a number of treaties in this area 
with several countries. It is working to put that kind of grouping 
together at the present time. We will continue to make our

several years has  been trying to reach an agreement with the

<P>
	Considering that traces of PCBs have been found as far as 15

state that is acceptable?

	My colleague, I address myself to you as the Speaker. As far as I 
am concerned your whole tenure here has been exemplary, a model

for this institution I unequivocally withdraw the remark.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT,1997">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1997</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy ChrÃ©tien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise this afternoon to speak on Bill C-93, 
the Budget Implementation Act, 1997, at third reading.
<P>
	You will probably recall how proud the Minister of Finance was 
when he tabled his fourth budget, boasting about the fact that the 
deficit, which was $42 billion when the Prime Minister entrusted 
him with this portfolio, should have shrunk to a mere $17 billion by 
the end of the current fiscal year.
<P>
	There is a difference between the current Liberal government, 
and the previous Conservative government. While the 
Conservative Party underestimated its deficits, the Liberal Party 
tends to overestimate its deficits, which means that, by March 30 
next year, the deficit may actually be closer to $12 billion.
<P>
	The minister is fiddling around with the numbers and using the 
communicating vessels principle, in other words interest rates, to 
his advantage. In Canada as in every other industrialized country in 
the world, interest rates are relatively low right now. On the more 
than $615 billion in cumulatve deficits or debt, one can understand 
that the Minister of Finance is saving a bundle each month by 
paying less interest than he would have to if we had interest rates of 
8 per cent or 9 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	However, and there is the rub, he is dipping deep into the 
employment insurance fund. This year, the EI fund will be 
generating a $5.6 billion surplus. Where does the money that 
generates this surplus in the EI fund come from? From the $2.95 
premium paid by workers on every $100 of insurable earnings and 
$3.20 premium  paid by employers, these premiums amounting to a 
payroll tax on employment.
<P>
	By charging way too much, they get a surplus at the expense of 
workers. Indeed, this same government has decided to shorten the 
benefit period while at the same time increasing the number of 
hours-they count hours now-required to qualify for employment 
insurance benefits. Naturally, the benefit rate will be reduced by 1 
per cent for every 20 weeks of benefits collected. After a few years, 
a worker who has collected employment insurance benefits for 
more than 20 weeks will see his benefits reduced by 1 per cent 
increments down to 50 per cent of his insurable earnings.
<P>
	So, on the one hand, the Minister of Finance is keeping the 
employees' and employers' contributions to the employment 
insurance fund way too high while, on the other hand, he is making 
it extremely difficult for potential recipients to qualify for benefits. 
At this rate, within a few years, the fund will be overflowing.
<P>
	However, this is another way this government can shift its deficit 
onto the provinces. The unemployment rate tends to go down 
because people are no longer on the list of those actively looking 
for work; however, meanwhile, the number of welfare recipients 
has been on the rise for some years in all of the provinces.
<P>
	This is the case in Quebec, where the unemployment rate has 
gone down, while the number of welfare recipients has gone up 
because, in many cases, people are no longer eligible for 
employment insurance benefits and are still without a job. The 
result is that these people end up on the welfare rolls.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance also reduced transfers to the provinces, 
including social transfers for post-secondary education and health. 
This triggered a chain reaction whereby all the provinces had to 
make other taxpayers, particularly municipalities, school boards 
and hospitals, shoulder part of the burden dumped on them by the 
finance minister.
<P>
	What is really serious is the inequity of the minister's approach 
to balancing his budget within three years. The most blatant 
examples are undoubtedly the abolition of the Western Grain 
Transportation Act, in the prairies, and the harmonization of the 
infamous GST, which the Prime Minister himself promised to 
abolish, to scrap, as he said so eloquently. To scrap means to tear 
up, to throw in the garbage.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister often said: ``I will scrap the GST''. Four 
years later, what has been the cost of scrapping the GST? It cost at 
least a byelection in Hamilton East, since the Deputy Prime 
Minister had pledged to resign in the first 12 months of a Liberal 
government if the GST was not abolished.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10075"> 10075 </A></B>
<P>
	It took a lot longer than 12 months for her to resign her seat 
in the House of Commons, and the official opposition had to 
remind her for several weeks of the promise she had made, with 
the help of the media, which ran almost daily clips of her saying: 
``I promise to resign if we have not abolished the GST in the first 
12 months''.
<P>
	Obviously, it took several weeks, several months, and in June of 
last year she handed in her resignation, because a promise had not 
been kept, a promise that can of course be found in the red book, 
which I note by the way has become as rare on Parliament Hill as 
Chairman Mao's little red book has in China; people made a point 
of learning Mao's book by heart. My colleagues in the Liberal 
Party also made a point of memorizing their little red book. What I 
would like is for my Liberal friends opposite to give me a few 
copies. I will need them for my next election campaign, and 
nobody wants to give me a copy.
<P>
	I throw out an appeal to everyone, as they do on the quiz show 
<I>Tous pour un</I>: if you have half a dozen red books, I need them in the 
riding of Frontenac-MÃ©gantic to give to my Liberal opponent, 
Manon Lecours, to read over again before she rushes headlong into 
the next election campaign that will be announced next Sunday.
<P>
	I am certain that nobody will provide me with these books 
because they are so ashamed of them. I urge Liberal candidates in 
the next election not to lapse into the Pinocchio syndrome 
described in the book of the same name written by my friend, 
AndrÃ© Pratte, a reporter with <I>La Presse</I>. You must have read it, Mr. 
Speaker. He mentioned a number of famous comments made by 
our friends across the way. He gave examples of frequently 
lengthening noses on the faces of some of you, my Liberal friends, 
as the result of past untruths.
<P>
	To get back to Bill C-93, I should point out that the Minister of 
Finance applies cuts sometimes unevenly, sometimes unfairly. I 
was talking about the GST, the harmonization with the three 
maritime provinces, three small Canadian provinces. To help them 
swallow the pill, he gave them $960 million. The GST has lost its 
name. Now it is the HST, the harmonized sales tax. The people in 
the maritimes will forget the GST in a few months or years. They 
will be calling it the HST.
<P>
	In Quebec, the late Robert Bourassa, a federalist premier, with 
his good friend the former Prime Minister of Canada, Brian 
Mulroney, another federalist, agreed to harmonize the GST and the 
Quebec sales tax. I recall very clearly, when I was a farmer, having 
to complete two forms for the GST and the QST.
<P>
	In 1991, I was very proud, I even telephoned my MNA to 
congratulate him on harmonizing with the federal government, 
since we would be completing only one form. Quebec collects the 
GST for the federal government, and, at the end of the month, 
makes a cheque out to the Minister of Finance of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The only advantage the Government of Quebec receives is a split 
of the costs involved in collecting, whereas the maritime provinces 
get $960 for this same harmonization. Worse yet, the provinces do 
not do the collecting, the federal government does. It looks after 
the forms and the investigations and charges the provinces nothing 
for doing so. A double standard.
<P>
	The Quebec department of finance fairly calculated the cost of 
having the same privileges in Quebec. The Minister of Finance's 
government would have to pay $2 billion if it were going to treat 
everyone fairly.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois will pester all Liberal candidates in 
Quebec to be fair and to make commitments to the voters. As I 
said, it was utterly unfair of this government to use the WGTA to 
reduce its deficit. The Western Grain Transportation Act will save 
the Canadian treasury $560 million per year.
<P>
	To sugarcoat it for western grain producers, the same finance 
minister paid $2.9 billion in compensation, including $1 billion 
paid directly to the producers, under the table. He sent them a 
cheque and told them: ``You are not required to claim this amount 
on your next income tax return, and no TP4 or T4 will be issued to 
include with your return''.
<P>
	It is the same thing with bribes: one is not required to tell the tax 
man about them. The government paid producers under the table to 
sugarcoat a bitter tasting pill. It is appalling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Our hon. speaker, for one, would not take it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. ChrÃ©tien (Frontenac):</B> I certainly hope not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> At least I do not think he would.
<P>
	<B>Mr. ChrÃ©tien (Frontenac):</B> It is appalling. There is a double 
standard here, because 48 per cent of dairy producers are in 
Quebec, and the Minister of Finance told them: ``We are cutting the 
milk subsidy to commercial milk producers''. In 1994-95, the 
subsidy was $5.42 per hectolitre, that is to say that dairy producers 
were paid $5.42 per 100 litres of commercial milk. As we know, 
commercial milk is under Quebec's control.
<P>
	The subsidy was cut by 80 cents in 1995-96 and by 82 cents the 
following year. In five years, it will be all gone. By the year 2000, it 
will be down to 76 cents, and by 2001, it will be all gone. By 
August 1, 2001, there will be nothing left.
<P>
	Quebec dairy producers are taking a $168 million loss. This cut 
is made in Quebec, which is a big milk producing province as 
compared to the western provinces, without a cent in compensation 
being paid. Quebec dairy producers are not getting anything to 
make the cut more palatable, when $2.9 billion, almost $3 billion, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10076"> 10076 </A></B>
<P>
was paid to western grain producers when the Western Grain 
Transportation Act, commonly known as  the Crow rate, was 
abolished. That is appalling and unjustified.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	What will be the impact on Quebec farmers? It will bring up the 
price of butter or cheese. According to a comprehensive study, 
whenever the price of butter goes up 10 per cent, consumer demand 
drops by 7 per cent. And 48 per cent of the milk used to make butter 
comes from Quebec's dairy producers.
<P>
	I see the hon. member for Pierrefonds-Dollard, who is a city 
dweller. He is not affected. However, his voters are consumers and 
they will pay 40 cents more for a pound of cheddar and 30 cents 
more for a pound of butter.
<P>
	In a wealthy neighbourhood such as Dollard, this is not a 
problem. However, it is a different story in poor areas. It does 
create problems. Indeed, the reason the demand drops by 7 per cent 
is that the poor buy less butter, or no butter at all. They may have to 
use margarine, fat or something else.
<P>
	The same is true in the case of cheese. When the price of cheese 
goes up 10 per cent, demand drops by 4 per cent. As the official 
opposition critic on agricultural issues, I look after the interests of 
dairy producers. However, I am well aware that, ultimately, 
consumers are the ones who will have to make up for this 
government's cuts.
<P>
	I want to go back to the Pinocchio syndrome. Some years ago, I 
was in my living room, listening to the news. Brian Mulroney was 
Prime Minister and Statistics Canada announced that, the previous 
week, there were one million Canadians unemployed. Back then, 
the rat pack sat on this side of the House. Things were bad: ``One 
million unemployed and the Prime Minister is not doing anything. 
We want jobs. We want our young people to find work. You are 
rotten. You do not work for Canadians''.
<P>
	Today, there are 1.5 million unemployed. There are three million 
children in Canada who live in poverty and who do not eat three 
meals a day. We are not talking about Zaire, but Canada. What is 
the Minister of Finance doing? What is the Prime Minister doing 
about these children living in poverty?
<P>
	Last week, I met a teacher in Montreal who told me that several 
children in her class arrive at school without having had breakfast 
and that they barely have anything to eat for lunch.
<P>
	It is sad to watch this government go about its business. After 
three years and seven months, Canadians will have the opportunity 
to elect a new government, and I hope they will. I hope that, on 
Sunday, April 27, the Prime Minister will hand in his government's 
resignation to the Governor General, so that voters can teach him a 
good lesson.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
having listened to the member over the last 20 minutes, he has 
mentioned a number of things, some of which I would like to 
comment on and which require some clarification.
<P>
	I am going to talk a little bit about the GST. I am sure it is a 
subject we are going to hear an awful lot about in the next election.
<P>
	In the last budget the Liberal government announced that there 
would be no tax cuts until we could afford them and we could 
sustain them. No tax cuts. In the next election there is no question 
that the Reform Party will be running on tax cuts. The 
Conservatives will be running on tax cuts. The Liberal government 
is going to say no tax cuts.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	It is not enough simply to look at the bottom of the end result. 
The Reform Party and the Conservative Party are a little bit 
different; one is when it is balanced and one is immediate. There 
are conditions. The situation is there are conditions and some other 
matters.
<P>
	The member must understand that we cannot use just one phrase 
or one word to say what represents the position. We have to look at 
all of the terms and conditions that are associated with tax cuts or 
no tax cuts.
<P>
	The Liberal Party has said that we are going to have tax cuts 
when we can afford them. We are not opposed to tax cuts; we are 
going to have them. Having established that, let us talk about the 
word ``scrap''. Canadians are going to want to know more of the 
facts about what happened.
<P>
	If we go back to the beginning of this Parliament, the finance 
committee was immediately asked to undertake a study of the 
alternatives to the consumption tax, the GST. I participated in this 
all-party committee. It held 35 meetings with hundreds of 
witnesses. It analysed and assessed for months and months at least 
25 alternatives to the GST, including a modified GST or other 
forms of consumption tax. All members know that because all 
parties were represented in the finance committee.
<P>
	Let us think about this. If in fact the government's position was 
to scrap the GST with no replacement, to just get rid of it the way 
those members have been trying to suggest, then why is it that the 
finance committee spent almost a year studying alternatives? Why 
did the public or the opposition parties not go ballistic about why 
we were breaking our promise of scrapping it with no alternatives? 
They did not do that. They did not complain when we were 
studying alternatives because they knew and Canadians knew that 
the undertaking of the government was to replace the GST with a 
revenue neutral-meaning not getting rid of the $18 
billion-harmonized system with the provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10077"> 10077 </A></B>
<P>
	Some Canadians will say that they did not see the red book. 
I understand that because there were not enough produced for each 
and every Canadian. However, each and every member who ran 
on that platform included the extract in their literature. I did and 
I know my constituents saw it.
<P>
	In addition, all of the media reported on the platforms of each 
and every party including in detail the proposal to replace the GST 
with a revenue neutral harmonized tax. It was reported in the press.
<P>
	Did some members of Parliament use a word or a phrase to 
describe the whole platform? Yes, that is true. Even in this House I 
know there is at least one member of the cabinet who stood up and 
said that we would scrap it. However, to suggest that to use a word 
or a simple description of a platform policy is not to be taken in 
isolation, one has to also impute that it involves the full conditions 
and terms under which it was said.
<P>
	I will conclude by asking the member a question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. ChrÃ©tien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. My distinguished colleague has already said enough that it 
will take up the rest of the time allotted me to reply. You will 
understand that, without wanting to get into a debate with my 
colleague-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I would like to 
remind the hon. members that the 10 minutes are for questions or 
comments.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Madam Speaker, the member wants to respond and I 
am going to let him. I would simply ask-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is 
entirely normal that he make a comment and then ask a question, 
but the comment must be about what the hon. member said and not 
about any old topic.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Madam Speaker, the member was talking about 
scrapping the GST but the other member was not here. I forgive 
him for not being in attendance to hear the speech.
<P>
	However, in courtesy to the member, he knows that the Quebec 
government did not wait until the legislation came forward to 
harmonize its provincial consumption tax with the federal tax. It 
went ahead and made arrangements to implement it. Quebec did 
not wait because it knew the advantages. It knew that through 
harmonization it would have an input tax credit available on the 
provincial component of the harmonized sales tax.
<P>
	Is the member aware that exports from Quebec to other 
provinces and outside Canada enjoy an input tax  credit on the 
provincial sales tax component of the combined tax which the other 
provinces did not enjoy before the HST?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. ChrÃ©tien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to remind my distinguished colleague, the member for Mississauga 
South, a good-hearted man, a man of courage and incredible 
loyalty, that we are not in politics to fool the voters. You can fool 
people once, but you cannot fool them all the time.
<P>
	When we look at the latest surveys on how much confidence 
people have in various professions, doctors top the list, used car 
salesmen are at the bottom and one up from them are politicians. 
Do you know why? Because certain politicians often suffer from 
the Pinocchio syndrome, as my colleague has just shown. He says 
for all to hear: ``We never promised to abolish the GST''. That is a 
lie. I do not say he is a liar, I say it is a lie.
<P>
	All the CBC and TVA footage showed the Prime Minister of this 
country saying: ``We will scrap the GST''. And the Deputy Prime 
Minister, who was one of the rat pack and who held a major post in 
the last election campaign in 1993 said: ``I will resign in the first 12 
months if we do not abolish the GST''. It took 28 months. We had 
to give her a shove. This resignation cost the public $500,000, so 
that she could turn around and get re-elected with a much smaller 
majority in Hamilton East.
<P>
	I ask my distinguished colleague, a good-hearted and loyal man 
as I was saying earlier, to find me six copies of his red book in 
French, because I need them badly in Frontenac-MÃ©gantic for the 
next election.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-93.
<P>
	First I would like to address some of the comments which were 
made a moment ago by the hon. member for Mississauga South. He 
was trying to defend the government's position on the GST. He 
suggested that it might be an election issue. I assure all members it 
will be a major issue in the coming election.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The promise that was made in the red book, without reading the 
weasel words or the fine print, to scrap, abolish or get rid of the 
GST was made by a government in full knowledge of the 
difficulties that would be put in place trying to do that.
<P>
	When he says we cannot take a few isolated comments out of 
context, I remind him and all members that the current finance 
minister apologized to the Canadian people for the government's 
lack of performance on the GST.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10078"> 10078 </A></B>
<P>
	Not only did the finance minister apologize, but the Deputy 
Prime Minister resigned. A member of cabinet resigned over their 
failure to do what they had promised the Canadian people.
<P>
	Talking about the resignation, I have to mention that it was done 
only after a poll was taken in the riding to make sure that the 
Deputy Prime Minister would be re-elected, hardly a move to 
address the cynicism that exists between the politicians and the 
voters. Her denial to do what she should have done for over a 
period of a week certainly hurt politicians, not just the government.
<P>
	We had the Prime Minister who, in a town hall meeting, took 
exception to people who understood what they were saying 
differently and challenged that they should have read the red book.
<P>
	Again on the GST, the government talks about harmonization. 
While in opposition the Liberals fought harmonization. As a matter 
of fact, the current finance minister was very strong in his 
opposition to harmonization. He said that once it is in there, we will 
never get rid of it. How he has changed his position now that he has 
moved from the opposition to the government.
<P>
	In order to save face, to try to put some kind of positive spin on 
the GST, we get the $1 billion incentive to the three Atlantic 
provinces to come on board with harmonization. That is $1 billion 
which will be paid by taxpayers right across this country.
<P>
	In the province of Ontario, the Ontario treasurer resisted 
harmonization on the basis that it would shift the tax burden on to 
Ontario taxpayers. It would increase it by $3 billion. He rightly 
resisted it.
<P>
	When we talk about the GST, it indeed will be an election issue. 
It is one that we have to be honest about. I do not think the 
government, in making the promise, was honest. Its members are 
still not replying to the reasons why they did not fulfil their 
promise in being truthful with the Canadian people.
<P>
	We are talking about the budget as it relates to the deficit and the 
debt this afternoon. It is one of the main reasons for my seeking 
office in 1993. I was very concerned about the insanity of the 
annual deficits that both the Liberals and the Conservatives had 
been running, $30 billion, $40 billion overspending resulting in 
now $600 billion of debt.
<P>
	My concern was not so much for me as it was for my children 
and my grandchildren. I realized that while I had been in business 
over the years, I had allowed the governments of the day to engage 
in this overspending. They had mortgaged the future of my children 
and my grandchildren.
<P>
	We were enjoying the benefits of being the number one country 
in the world and enjoying the very best in social programs but we 
were not paying our way. We  were mortgaging their future. They 
were going to be paying our tab for being the number one country 
in the world, which we are, but we have done it on the backs of our 
children and our grandchildren.
<P>
	That is something that we should be ashamed of. I am here to do 
all I can to reverse that, to bring some fiscal sanity to this place. I 
am hoping we will be able to do that.
<P>
	When I think of this fourth budget that we are dealing with 
today, I recall the first budget, the second budget and the third 
budget. I have to go back to the first budget and say what a shame it 
was that the government wasted that first budget. It did absolutely 
nothing to deal with the serious problem of the deficit we had been 
running which at that point was almost $500 billion.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	As a matter of fact, when the Liberals ran in that campaign they 
made light of the deficit and debt by telling Canadian taxpayers 
that while it is a problem, do not be worried. It is okay. Do not fret. 
It is something they would look after. In the first budget the 
Liberals failed to address it any meaningful way. As difficult as it is 
to believe, they actually worsened the situation because they 
lowered the cigarette tax. They caved in to the smugglers. They 
said they have to deal with the smugglers and they reduced the tax 
on cigarettes. They were more concerned abut the smugglers with 
no regard for the health and cost implications to health care for 
Canadians.
<P>
	I found it absolutely unbelievable to see the current health 
minister stand in the House and talk about the concern he has for 
the young people in our country who are smoking and that ``we 
have to do all we can to make sure it does not happen''. However, 
he is a member of the government that reduced the taxes on 
cigarettes and by doing so encouraged thousands of young people 
to take up smoking and put their future health at great risk. I found 
it extremely hard to believe when the health minister stood up 
today trying to show concern for the health of our young people, 
when by their actions they started many young people down that 
road.
<P>
	The price of cigarettes was a major deterrent. I saw it in my own 
riding after the tax was reduced. When I drove by a high school I 
could see a significant number of young people smoking. The 
numbers increased because they could afford to buy cigarettes 
again and they were delighted. I find his concern now about the 
health of our young people a little difficult to believe. Of course, 
there was no thought of the future cost implications to our health 
budgets.
<P>
	The second budget was a bit of an awakening. In the second 
budget the finance minister began to make a connection that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10079"> 10079 </A></B>
<P>
deficit was resulting in high unemployment, in high taxes and was 
perhaps more  serious than the government thought it was back in 
1993 during the campaign.
<P>
	Even at that point, the government still was not even serious 
enough to really tackle the deficit and come out with a program to 
eliminate it over a specific period of time. I recall very well that 
there was a warning issued by Moody's to the finance minister. 
Moody's told the finance minister, I believe before the second 
budget, that he had a very serious problem. ``You have been living 
beyond your means. You have a huge debt load and you are going 
to have to sell your bonds to maintain this lavish lifestyle you have 
enjoyed. We are concerned enough about your position that we are 
considering downgrading your bonds. We are telling you this 
because we want you to know how serious we think the situation is 
and how it is going to reflect in the advice that we give to people 
you borrow from, because you will have to borrow''.
<P>
	There was another piece of information given to our finance 
minister at that time. He ignored the first and he also ignored the 
advice that he had to set a target date to balance the books. This 
rolling two year target where somewhere down the road we may get 
to a balanced budget is not going to fly with the people buying 
bonds. Give us a commitment. Give us a date. Of course, we know 
what happened when the finance minister ignored that advice. 
There were many who shot the messenger. Moody's was giving us 
good advice but there were those in government who asked who 
these young finance people in the red suspenders were to tell them 
what they should be doing. As a result of that advice being ignored, 
our bonds were downgraded with the potential to cost us more in 
interest payments.
<P>
	In the third budget we did get some action. We heard again from 
the finance minister these deficits and debts were a serious 
problem. I am sure he was having a battle within his own party 
about whether to cut or spend more on social programs. Thank 
goodness his position prevailed and there were some limited cuts, 
but not nearly enough to eliminate the deficit and balance the 
books.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	Now we get to the fourth budget, the budget we are talking about 
today. As difficult as I find this to believe, I actually heard cheering 
from the other side when the finance minister stood up in the House 
and bragged about the fact that we will only be overspending by 
$19 billion. This is an accomplishment to be recognized with great 
applause that we are now only spending $19 billion more than we 
are taking in in taxes. This is an accomplishment.
<P>
	There was even the suggestion that the battle is won. It is over. 
Now we can start spending again. We do not need to worry about it. 
We have won the battle. I have not heard anybody in the private 
sector saying that the  battle is over. Is $19 billion of overspending 
something to applaud? I cannot believe it, but they did. I heard it.
<P>
	Then we look at the other side of this $19 billion of 
overspending. We are now approaching $600 billion of debt. I did 
not hear any applause when that was mentioned. As a matter of 
fact, that may not have been mentioned too strongly, as indeed it 
should not have been. This Liberal government has increased our 
federal debt from $500 billion to $600 billion.
<P>
	I heard government members saying in 1993 not to worry about 
the deficit and the debt, then during their term of office they 
realized that we were right and they were wrong and the deficit and 
the debt are a problem. I heard what they were saying about OAS 
and health care, the great defenders of health care and OAS. They 
are now doing far more, as we talked about.
<P>
	NAFTA and free trade they opposed when in opposition. Now 
they are the biggest free traders we have ever seen. The Prime 
Minister spends as much time out of the country as he does in the 
country. Free trade has been good for Canada and NAFTA has been 
good for Canada.
<P>
	The government does not know how to create jobs. The Liberals 
did not know how to create them when they were in opposition. 
They are now starting come around but it is a complete flip-flop 
from what they were saying when they campaigned in 1993 on all 
those issues.
<P>
	Credibility is going to be an issue in this coming election. I 
suggest there is not a whole lot of it on the government side. The 
Liberals are going to have great difficulty just on those two major 
promises that were made to the people to get their vote, job 
creation and getting rid of the GST. Those two promises, regardless 
of the 173 others in the famous red ink book, are the ones on which 
Canadians gave Liberals their trust. It was based on both of those. 
They have failed the Canadian people on both those major 
promises. They are going to answer for it in a few weeks.
<P>
	Promises made, promises broken. Canadians do not like to have 
promises broken, not when it involves jobs and not when it 
involves their pocketbooks. The voters are about to have their say. 
There will be some very surprised people. The polls indicating 
some popularity right now are paper thin.
<P>
	This was an election budget to try to calm the waters and plug 
the holes in the dam, and there are some pretty big holes in that 
dam. Going into this election the voters will be asking, and we will 
be encouraging them, are they better off today than in 1993.
<P>
	I do not think we are going to find very many voters from coast 
to coast who will answer in the affirmative to that question. They 
will take a look at that and say ``you are absolutely right, I am not 
and yet I was told I was going to be''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10080"> 10080 </A></B>
<P>
	They will look at jobs. They were promised jobs. The facts are 
there are 1.5 million unemployed today, 2 million to 3 million 
Canadians underemployed today, one in four of those who have 
a job worried about whether they will hold that job.
<P>
	There have been 77 straight months of unemployment in excess 
of 9 per cent. Am I better off today relative to jobs? I think not. 
That is about the same number as when the Liberals promised jobs, 
jobs, jobs to get elected in 1993. They have not produced them. 
They will have to answer for it.
<P>
	Let us go to taxes now. The GST is a tax. Canadians hate that tax. 
Canadians heard the words ``we're going to get rid of it'' and the 
weasel words, ``scrap, abolish, get rid of, read the red book if you 
can find one''. They were looking for tax relief. What the 
government has given the taxpayers is 37 tax increases and it has 
not scrapped the GST.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	That is why voters are so cynical about politicians. They do not 
have jobs. They do have the GST and their taxes have increased. 
All we hear is that there have not been direct personal tax increases, 
which is true, but there have been 37 indirect tax increases with the 
granddaddy of them all the CPP payroll tax increase. Some can call 
it an investment but it is a payroll tax and it is a tax increase.
<P>
	The Fraser Institute has just released a study which states that the 
average Canadian family has taken a $3,000 pay reduction since 
the Liberals have been in office. That has come about because most 
Canadians have seen their salaries frozen and in that same 
timeframe Canadians have had 37 tax increases. The reality is the 
average Canadian family is $3,000 poorer than it was in 1993. 
Again, am I better off today than I was in 1993? I think not.
<P>
	The record is there. We have record consumer bankruptcies. It 
was almost 80,000, just 79,000 and change which is up by 22 per 
cent since 1996. Am I better off today? There are 80,000 
consumers who will say no very loudly.
<P>
	Business bankruptcies are up by 7 per cent to 14,229. Canadian 
household debt as a percentage of disposable income was 54 per 
cent in 1985 and is 91 per cent in 1995. Am I better off today than I 
was in 1993? I do not think so. Canadians are asking themselves, 
``if this is a feel good budget, why don't I feel good?''
<P>
	In this atmosphere the government is saying that low interest 
rates will get the economy moving, that there will be no tax cuts 
because low interest rates will do it. We have record bankruptcies 
and record consumer debt. How in the world will low interest rates 
get the economy moving? Canadians have lost their borrowing 
power. They are in debt right up to here.
<P>
	However, we should remember that when the Liberals talk about 
low interest rates they are talking about going into debt which is 
one thing they know a great deal about. We have to give them credit 
for that. They know about going into debt. That is what they are 
encouraging the Canadian people to do: ``Borrow, borrow more. 
You can borrow your way to prosperity. Just go deeper in debt''. 
That is a terrible message to send to the Canadian people. We 
should be asking the Canadian people to be fiscally responsible, to 
not spend what they do not have because future generations will be 
paying for it. Of course, the government cannot do that because it 
cannot even do it.
<P>
	The low interest rates factor is a two-edged sword because not 
everybody benefits from low interest rates. There are those who do 
but there are many who do not. I am thinking of those who are 
living on fixed incomes. Across the board tax cuts help all 
Canadians. That is what will get our economy moving. That is what 
will create the jobs Canadians are so desperately looking for. The 
government has not made the connection between high taxes and 
high unemployment.
<P>
	We have been going down this road of government spending and 
high taxes for 25 years and it has not worked. Why in the world are 
we not looking for a better way, a different way? What we have 
been doing has not been working. The unemployment numbers 
support this claim and something has to be done about it.
<P>
	There is a lack of vision, a lack of ideas. It is the status quo. The 
Liberals have been saying: ``We have always done it this way so we 
have to keep going down this road. We can't do it any differently. 
We just don't have the vision or the plan to do it''. I am proud to say 
that we have a vision and we are going to be offering it to the 
Canadian voters in the coming election. I believe there will be the 
change in this place that is so desperately needed.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. member when he 
talked about jobs.
<P>
	In 1993 when we were elected the jobless rate was at 11.2 per 
cent and now it is down to 9.3 per cent. I think that is a very good 
record. Is it enough? No. As the Prime Minister constantly says: ``It 
is not enough but it is certainly going in the right direction''.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about low inflation and that is an 
important part. The average Canadian cares about that. Certainly 
home buyers care about it.
<P>
	With respect to interest rates I do not know what riding the hon. 
member represents but in Ontario my people do care about low 
interest rates when they are buying homes or any other item. In my 
humble opinion it is totally irresponsible to promise a tax cut when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10081"> 10081 </A></B>
<P>
the  deficit is not completely gone and when we have not tackled 
the debt yet.
<P>
	Does the hon. member really believe that buying votes with such 
a see through method is honest? Does he believe it is correct to do 
such a thing when fiscally we have not put our house in order?
<P>
	It is important that the Canadian people know that when we took 
power just 3.5 short years ago the deficit was $42 billion. It now 
stands officially at $19 billion. The rumour is that it is significantly 
less than that. Do the Canadian people think that is a good record? I 
believe so. I am proud to hold my head up.
<P>
	It is really wrong to promise a tax cut when we do not have our 
books and our house in order. We are going in the right direction. 
The deficit is at the lowest level it has been for 15 years. That is a 
really good record.
<P>
	Please do not let the hon. member promise a tax cut and put us 
further in debt. Please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot 
believe what I have just heard coming from the government in that 
intervention. She talked about buying votes. She is accusing us of 
buying votes? I cannot believe it. Jobs, jobs, jobs, the GST, scrap 
and abolish NAFTA. Talk about buying votes.
<P>
	We are not buying votes. We are saying we are going to offer tax 
relief after we get rid of the deficit. We make that very clear in our 
fresh start platform: after we get rid of the deficit we are going to 
act fiscally responsible and we are going to offer tax relief.
<P>
	We also have a guarantee in our platform. We are saying to the 
voters: ``Don't trust us, trust yourselves. If we don't do what we say 
we are going to do right now, we want you to have recall''. That is 
something that the government does not believe in because it 
promised things it knows it cannot deliver.
<P>
	Why do the Liberals oppose recall? Because they would be 
called to answer for the promises they have made and they do not 
like to be held accountable for their promises.
<P>
	The government says that when it took over there was a $42 
billion deficit. When the Conservatives took over from them the 
debt was about $200 billion thanks to annual Liberal deficits. Now 
the Liberals are extremely reluctant to slay the monster they 
created. We went down this path of insanity back in 1970 when the 
Liberal government started this deficit spending to the point that 
when they were booted out of office the debt stood at $200 million. 
Now it is approaching $600 billion. That is some kind of an 
accomplishment? I think not.
<P>
	When I hear members over there say that we are being dishonest, 
I want to point out that we understand that cynicism. That is the 
fault of the Liberal government. That is why we believe in recall. 
That is why we believe in  referendums. That is why we believe in 
freer votes in the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister tarnished every politician in this 
House and in this country when she did not do the honourable thing 
and resign-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> She did resign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Only after a week's haranguing 
and taking a poll in her riding. It lost its impact when she did not do 
it immediately, as indeed she should have.
<P>
	I also want to talk about interest rates. The member talks about 
how interest rates are a big factor in her riding.
<P>
	I have done a poll in my riding. The businesses are not looking 
for low interest rates to get the economy moving. That is way down 
on the chart. What they are looking for is tax relief. They want their 
consumers to have more dollars.
<P>
	I wonder if the member has talked to the seniors in her 
community who are living on fixed incomes and looking for decent 
interest rates. Have you heard from them or are you listening to 
them? Low interest rates do not benefit everybody.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I would urge the hon. 
member to address his remarks through the Chair.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I just saw another Reform Party member who wanted to rise after 
the previous speaker, so I thought I should rise as well to straighten 
out a few facts.
<P>
	You may have noticed that the hon. member who just spoke was 
not altogether objective in his comments and was not altogether 
fair in the way he described the facts as we know them. And I am 
being generous, always abiding by the rules of this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I do not know why, but I kept thinking when I listened to the hon. 
member who just spoke about the words of Sir Winston Churchill. 
They have been ruled parliamentary by countless Speakers, so I 
guess I can repeat them in this honourable House.
<P>
	He said about remarks which were similar to the ones we have 
just heard that the opposite to the truth had never been stated with 
greater accuracy. That is exactly what I thought when the hon. 
member spoke about the last budget of this government, this Prime 
Minister and this very excellent Minister of Finance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10082"> 10082 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us straighten out the facts before we go too much further. 
The member opposite talked about unemployment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My position is that as long as there is a single person in my 
riding who is unemployed, there is too much unemployment. It 
would be a mistake to be satisfied with the unemployment rate, 
whatever it happens to be.
<P>
	That being said, we still have to state the facts. Last month, 
61,000 jobs were created in this country. This is a total of 800,000 
jobs since the last election. A net gain of 800,000 jobs is quite an 
achievement.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as the soul of objectivity in this House, you will 
have to admit that. Those are the facts, and I am sure this 
information is correct, since it was authenticated by Statistics 
Canada and other agencies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The G7, the OECD and think tanks all over have acknowledged 
that the largest level of growth of any OECD nation this year will 
belong to Canada. It is not average growth. It is not a better than 
average growth. Only the best belongs to Canada. We are the best.
<P>
	Of course it is not good enough to be the best, but it is a darned 
sight better than it would be under a Reform government. Heaven 
forbid that we would ever have such a thing in this country. That is 
not likely to happen at any time, let alone soon.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member opposite just argued in favour of high interest 
rates. I found it hard to understand the logic of what the hon. 
member said, when he stated that people on low incomes would 
benefit from higher interest rates. I would like to know what school 
of economics launched that idea. Did you ever hear about people on 
low and fixed incomes who benefit from high interest rates, 
considering that high interest rates are usually accompanied by 
similar levels of inflation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	How many poor people end up better off with inflation? The 
member across the way says that poor people are better off with 
high interest rates. I wonder which one of his rich friends taught 
him that. Which one of his rich friends is trying to invest money on 
the backs of those same poor people?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> He never said poor people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is what he did say. He said that people on 
lower and fixed incomes are better off with high interest rates. All 
members of this House have heard it, except for perhaps the 
member across the way who is heckling.
<P>
	People on lower and fixed incomes are the first to be vulnerable 
with inflation, the first when something is gouging away at their 
purchasing power. Inflation in this country is at the lowest level it 
has been in years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> That is untrue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It is not untrue. It is the truth. We have very 
distinguished members in this House, such as the member for 
Mississauga South who is an accountant and the member for 
Guelph-Wellington who is well known and well versed on 
financial issues, who can attest to this. Surely then all of us would 
know that this is a fact.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Simcoe-North, I believe, talked about-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No, it was the hon. member for Simcoe 
Centre.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> You don't even know my riding.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> No, I am trying to forget in his case. I must say I 
am doing my best to forget, and I hope the day will come soon 
when I can forget entirely.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in the meantime, you have just reminded me of the 
name of the riding of the member opposite. He alleged that the 
government was wrong to put an end to the smuggling by lowering 
the Conservatives' tax on cigarettes. This scourge was affecting 
Quebec as well, because nearly 80 per cent of cigarettes were sold 
illegally. In my riding, I saw a native community torn asunder by 
the problem. I saw people in the same family opposing each other 
in this business of smuggling.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We had achieved an almost hobbesean state where it was every 
person for himself and life was brutish and short. People were 
going at each other with guns on the issue of contraband. Young 
people who broke the law were being rewarded by driving 
Corvettes and those who respected the laws were walking to 
school. That was the situation in this country.
<P>
	Yes, it did take intestinal fortitude for the Prime Minister to take 
the decision that he did. I congratulate him and always will because 
he did the right thing. And the right thing is not always the easy 
thing.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Simcoe Centre pontificates from 
afar-that is far right by the way-I say to him that he is wrong. 
The Reform candidate in his riding in the last election sure was 
singing from a different hymn book on that issue. However, that is 
not radically different for Reformers to disagree with each other.
<P>
	Need I remind all of us of statements made by one member from 
across the way who said that people who  were different from him 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10083"> 10083 </A></B>
<P>
should be in the back of the shop. I remember that and we all will 
very shortly. That is the kind of mindset of the people across the 
way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> You should be ashamed of 
yourself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I am not. I want to tell the hon. member across the 
way, who tried to pretend that somehow the issue of cigarette 
smuggling was anything different than what it was for his own 
partisan ends, he had better look at himself in the mirror and maybe 
at the same time have a close look at some of his own colleagues.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is the truth. We know what sort of leadership we had in this 
government. We recognize the honesty of the Prime Minister and 
his government. We know that we have renewed Canadians' trust 
in their parliamentary institutions, so much so that a poll revealed a 
few days ago that the level of confidence in Canada is the highest 
among the G7 countries, whereas it was the lowest before the last 
general election. Why? Because we have quality leadership.
<P>
	I have had the honour for a number of months now of being a 
member of his leadership team, because of the mandate the Prime 
Minister conferred on me in appointing me to cabinet on October 4. 
I, like my colleagues, have tried to provide the people with honest 
and respectable government, and we have succeeded in doing so.
<P>
	Whatever allegations the member opposite made earlier, the 
truth is the exact opposite. Soon, I hope, the Prime Minister will 
decide to return to the people and ask them to give us a new 
mandate. I know he can do so with his head held high. I do not 
know the date any more than the member opposite, who is having 
fun chatting. When he does decide, he can do so confident in the 
knowledge that he fulfilled his mandate and did what Canadians 
asked of him.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am equally sure that the Prime Minister will again enjoy the 
confidence of the Canadian people. He and this government 
deserve that kind of confidence for having told Canadians the truth 
about every issue, even the issue we brought to the attention of all 
Canadians, that of the high deficit.
<P>
	Today the European Economic Union is calling Canada the 
economic miracle of the western world. We are told that by people 
in Japan. We are told that by our other trading partners. Why? 
Because it is true. The whole world cannot be wrong, except the 
Reform Party. Not everyone is out of step except the member for 
Simcoe Centre. The reality is a little otherwise. The truth is 
otherwise.
<P>
	I am proud of the quality of leadership by our Prime Minister, by 
our Minister of Finance, by this cabinet and by the entire Liberal 
team which has supported this government. It has taken difficult 
decisions for the good of all Canadians and for generations to 
come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. RenÃ© Canuel (MatapÃ©dia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister used the word ``truth'' a dozen times with great 
conviction. It seems to me that the truth speaks for itself. One 
needs not make a big production of describing what it is. When one 
says: ``We are on the side of truth'', then the case for truth is made. 
I have my doubts about what he said because what do you call the 
Prime Minister saying he would kill the GST and not doing it? 
There is a long list of similar situations.
<P>
	Now, of course, everyone agrees that the deficit must go down 
and even disappear completely.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Everyone agrees also that we should be paying off our debts. We 
all agree with that. But how do we go about doing this? That is the 
problem. Unfortunately, the Reform Party, the Conservative Party 
and the Liberal Party have nothing better to offer in that, until this 
place passes an elections act like the one passed in Quebec under 
RenÃ© LÃ©vesque, under which large corporations are forbidden to 
buy, so to speak, governments, regardless of their affiliation, I 
assure you these governments will have their hands tied. There will 
be no end to family trusts, and families earning $100,000 and more 
per year will pay almost no tax because lobbyists will still have 
easy access to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the 
other ministers.
<P>
	Until a government passes this kind of legislation, every 
Quebecer and Canadian will be justified in doubting the 
authenticity of the government and doubting, when promises are 
made, the truthfulness of these promises. Not that I doubt the 
ministers and the Prime Minister as individuals, but it takes 
political courage to pass this kind of legislation. When the 
suggestion is made that it be passed, the major national parties 
balk. Why? Ask yourself why they do not want such legislation 
passed. It is either because they have their hands tied or because 
they lack courage.
<P>
	When companies contribute $10,000, $20,000 or $100,000 to a 
party's campaign fund, they are friends and the party is indebted to 
them. This is the truth.
<P>
	Earlier, the minister told you, Mr. Speaker, and I have a great 
deal of respect for you, that you are impartial. That is true, but I 
believe that, except for you, the only party which can be impartial 
in this House is our party, and I will tell you why.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Just let me explain. It is because we are not trying 
to form the government. I do not think we will  ever form the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10084"> 10084 </A></B>
<P>
federal government. Therefore, because we are not trying to form 
the government, we can be impartial.
<P>
	In fact, we are the only party that is not interested in holding 
such power. In any case, it is not the real power. The real power is 
held, as we know, by the financial world. Until we can dissociate 
ourselves from these companies and family trusts, everyone knows 
that our hands will be tied. The government may try, it may make 
an effort sometimes, but it cannot do a good job.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member: If his party is re-elected, will he have the 
courage to promote a bill that would correct this problem with 
campaign funds? The result could be similar to what was achieved 
in Quebec, thanks to RenÃ© LÃ©vesque. Mr. Bourassa himself 
congratulated RenÃ© LÃ©vesque a few years later, because it is a lot 
easier to be honest with voters and tell them the truth. I ask the 
minister if he will sponsor such a bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought I had heard everything. 
The member opposite has just said Bloc members are impartial. So 
we will ask the member for Rimouski-TÃ©miscouata, when the 
time comes, if she considers herself impartial.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Of course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Of course, right. We will ask Hull residents if they 
think she is impartial.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> But that is different.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> So we can all wonder about this proposal 
regarding the impartiality of a Bloc Quebecois member, including 
the member for Rimouski-TÃ©miscouata, and of all the others as 
well, of course.
<P>
	The member opposite has just said that we have attained the 
objective of lowering the deficit, but he is not in agreement with 
the way we went about it. You will immediately note the 
differences of opinion among opposition party members.
<P>
	This member says: ``They met the objective, but we did not like 
the way they did it''. The member for Simcoe Centre, who spoke 
earlier, said: ``They did not meet the objective at all''. You see how 
opinions differ, and how these two opposition parties, which are not 
far apart on some issues, have very differing opinions when it 
comes to the economy.
<P>
	I suspect that, depending on the opposition member you asked, 
opinions would perhaps differ even more widely, given that some 
members opposite have very little in common with each other, 
except for their views on sovereignty. That aside, some lean a little 
to the right, others-I am not saying the leader of the 
opposition-lean much further to the left, not to mention one who 
is really out in left field.
<P>
	The hon. member across the way says that political parties are to 
some extent answerable to those who make campaign 
contributions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Yes, yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>And has just repeated it.
<P>
	I am making no such accusation of the Canadians who 
contributed to my campaign-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel: </B>The companies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>-all those who contributed to my election 
campaign, the one of the hon. member for Pierrefonds-Dollard, 
and those of my other colleagues in this House. I am convinced that 
my electors are basically honest, and when they contribute to my 
campaign, whether that means coming to my $5 a plate spaghetti 
supper, or my $100 a plate annual fundraising dinner-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> $2,000.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>No, I have nothing that goes over $100, which 
means that the meal is around $35, or $36 or $40, if the hall rental 
and the rest of the expenses are included, so the other $60 or so is a 
contribution. People do not contribute $60 to my campaign 
expecting to get any financial gain back.
<P>
	I feel that such accusations concerning the people of Quebec and 
the people of Canada from sea to sea are totally inappropriate. 
Whether a person runs my local convenience store, has an 
engineering practice in my neighbourhood, or a company in my 
riding-most of them being very small, although there are one or 
two big ones-whether they have contributed the $5 or the $60 I 
referred to before, or even if they are one of the handful of people 
contributing maybe $200 in the last campaign, they are all honest 
people, in my opinion. Or at least I believe they are.
<P>
	Unless it is proven otherwise, I believe that the Canadians who 
contribute to my campaign, like yours, like the campaigns of 
everybody else, merely want to help the democratic process in 
order to have good government, and we will have another good 
Liberal government, as we have had this time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member 
for Chicoutimi-government contracts; the hon. member for 
Frontenac-tariffs on agricultural products; the hon. member for 
Davenport-Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Develop- ment-the hon. member for Mackenzie-transport.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as I listened to the hon. minister's response to  that question or 
comment I was reminded of the politician who had the ability to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10085"> 10085 </A></B>
<P>
speak until he thought of something to say. The difficulty was that I 
was not quite able to determine what the minister was saying.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise to speak on Bill C-93, the budget 
implementation act. It is an important act despite the dryness of the 
name because we are debating how the nation spends its money and 
the policies behind that spending.
<P>
	Today's debate is very important for Canada and the Canadian 
people from coast to coast who are struggling. Why is it an 
important debate? I cannot remember another time, except perhaps 
for the chaos of the world wars or the depression, when life was so 
uncertain for so many people in peacetime.
<P>
	For example, 1.5 million people are unemployed in Canada 
today, just as many as when the Liberals were elected in 1993. 
Another two million to three million Canadians are 
underemployed. One in four Canadians is worried about losing a 
job. We have had the worst string of unemployment numbers since 
the great depression, and perhaps the longest string as well.
<P>
	After four years of what the Liberals call cost cutting, Canada 
will be over $111 billion deeper in debt. In total, 25 years of Liberal 
and Tory mismanagement have put Canada over $600 billion in 
debt. We spend about $46 billion a year on interest charges alone. 
The largest claim on the national treasury each year is the interest 
we pay on the debt. All this time families are hurting. Since the 
Liberals came to power the after tax income of the average 
Canadian family has dropped by about $3,000.
<P>
	The Liberal government has increased taxes 37 times. The latest 
increase was the massive 70 per cent hike in Canada pension plan 
premiums. People are wondering how they can live with the 
creditor's hand in one pocket and the government's hand in the 
other. Many of them are not making it. Let us consider the number 
of bankruptcies that have occurred in the past year. Bankruptcies 
are at their highest level ever with almost 80,000 last year.
<P>
	Let us also consider health care, education and social programs, 
how they have been gutted by $7 billion in the last three and a half 
years and the consequences of that.
<P>
	Last year in my constituency in the city of Quesnel there was a 
tragic explosion. Five people lost their lives. Twenty people had to 
go to the hospital. The G. R. Baker Memorial Hospital has 50 beds. 
It actually has more beds, but if the administrator uses more than 
50 he will get fired because of the closures and the cutbacks. The 
hospital was entirely occupied by patients; there were 50 patients 
when the explosion occurred.
<P>
	That is the seriousness of the situation. There is no slack in the 
system. There is no room for exceptions. There is no room for 
people who are caught in unexpected emergencies.
<P>
	It is no wonder that today more than at any other time people are 
extremely concerned. They are frightened. They are concerned 
about their finances. They are concerned about their families, the 
opportunities available for their children and the opportunities that 
are not available. They are concerned about their health care. They 
are concerned about how they will pay their mortgages. They are 
concerned about their futures. That is why Canadians were looking 
to the 1997 budget and praying for some relief, some help along the 
way, an oasis in the desert. Did they get it? No, they did not.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Let me explain why. The 1997 budget raised tax revenues 
another $4 billion. Tax revenues next year will be $24 billion 
higher than they were when the Liberals took office.
<P>
	There was no real job creation strategy. People are still looking 
for jobs. People are still worrying about losing their jobs. There 
was no help for health care and no help for pensions.
<P>
	I am afraid Canadians looked at the budget and said to 
themselves: ``If this is supposed to be such a good budget, where 
are the benefits? Where can I look for some hope?''
<P>
	The finance minister argued that one of the benefits of the budget 
was that government finances were finally under control. Only in 
Ottawa will people celebrate when the government is in debt $600 
billion, when it borrows $19 billion a year and when it pays interest 
charges of $46 billion a year, acting as though it is all under 
control, everything is fine and the war has be won.
<P>
	We watched the Tory administration struggle with the deficit. If 
the Tories ever came close to achieving what they sought, they 
immediately reversed the trend and began spending more money. 
That is what I am afraid we are watching as the election 
approaches. We are watching any gain that may have been won 
being used up to buy election votes.
<P>
	The finance minister has argued that his government is reducing 
the deficit by controlling spending. Just a couple of weeks ago 
Canadians heard some very disturbing news about the government 
and the finance minister. We learned that the finance minister had 
not met his deficit targets as he had promised. He is $5.2 billion off 
his 1995 budget target for expenditure reductions in the federal 
government. To cover up his mistake, the finance minister 
redefined departmental spending under program review.
<P>
	When we are in a game we expect to get the ball into the goal. If 
someone moves the goal to catch the ball, there is a name for it. In 
addition, the true reality of what is happening on top of the 
government fudging its books is that the Canadian taxpayer has 
paid for 84 per cent of the deficit reduction through increased tax 
revenues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10086"> 10086 </A></B>
<P>
	It is no wonder Canadians are still asking the government: ``If 
this is supposed to be such a good budget, where are the benefits? 
Where is the hope for me?''
<P>
	The finance minister argues that he has not raised taxes in this 
budget or in any other budget. However that is not reality. He may 
be able to move the goal to make the score but that score does not 
count.
<P>
	Since the Liberals came to power GST revenues went up by $2 
billion. Corporate income taxes went up by $6.8 billion. Personal 
income taxes went up by $15 billion. Other taxes went up by $500 
million. That is a $24 billion increase in tax revenues over what 
they were when the Liberals took office. That does not include the 
$10 billion tax hike in the Canada pension plan. Again Canadians 
are asking the government: ``If this is supposed to be such a good 
budget, where are the benefits?''
<P>
	The finance minister has argued that he is the great defender of 
medicare and that this year's budget shows it. The reality, however, 
is something quite different. We see the reality when people are 
caught in extreme circumstances such as the explosion which 
occurred in Quesnel last week.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	The Liberals chose to hack, gut and gouge health care. These are 
the finance minister's own words. They are part of his vocabulary. 
The Liberals chose to hack, gut and gouge health care to the tune of 
$3.6 billion, a 40 per cent decrease. The effects of these cuts have 
been devastating.
<P>
	Over 170,000 Canadians are on medical and surgical waiting 
lists. Forty-five per cent of those people say they are waiting in 
pain. Fifty-five people have died while waiting for heart operations 
in Ontario alone in the last 10 months. Hospitals are closing and 
services are being cut in every part of the country. This year's 
budget gave no help to those hurting people.
<P>
	Canadians are still asking this government: If this is supposed to 
be such a good budget where are the benefits, where is what 
Canadians need? Most of all, Canadians were looking for jobs from 
this year's budget. As I mentioned earlier, Canada is experiencing 
the worst and longest lasting set of jobless numbers since the great 
depression. The finance minister's budget has not changed this 
reality. In both months following the 1997 budget, February and 
March, the unemployment rate was still over 9 per cent. Let us ask 
why.
<P>
	The government has failed to give Canadians job relief and has 
failed to give them tax relief. Reduced taxes mean more money in 
the pockets of families, consumers, small business people and 
investors. But the money is not there for them. Consumers who 
spend more money will create the permanent well paying jobs that 
Canadians throughout all of Canada need and are crying for.
<P>
	The finance minister's message to Canadians is that low interest 
rates are the best medicine for the economy. Despite the lowest 
interest rates in years, the unemployment rate is still 9 per cent and 
there are still 1.5 million people unemployed. For a person who has 
just gone bankrupt, for a person who does not have hope or does not 
have a means, the low interest rates are not doing any good.
<P>
	It is quite clear that the economy cannot be pushed uphill with 
interest rates. There has to be income growth. There has to be job 
growth. There has to be tax relief. What consumers need, what 
Canadians need is a tax cut. Government expenditures are breaking 
the financial backs of Canadians.
<P>
	Although Canadians got no help from the finance minister or the 
government in the 1997 budget, there is a hope on the horizon and 
that hope is called Reform's fresh start. As I close, let me describe 
this fresh start for Canadians. A Reform government will cut 
government waste and trim government departments to balance the 
budget by 1999, two years from now. A Reform government will 
then use these budgetary surpluses as follows.
<P>
	There will be a $5 billion down payment on debt reduction by the 
year 2001 with a fixed proportion of future surpluses being 
dedicated to debt reduction. We still have this enormous debt 
hanging over us. How are we going to deal with it unless we 
actually begin to start making payments on it?
<P>
	A Reform government will provide a $4 billion per year transfer 
to the provinces for health and education purposes.
<P>
	There will be $15 billion in much needed tax relief to the long 
suffering Canadian taxpayer. Tax relief of this magnitude will 
reduce the tax bill paid by the average Canadian family of four by 
$2,000 a year by the year 2000. That is what Canadians need and it 
is what the Canadian economy needs. This kind of tax reduction 
will spur job creation for parents and families who want and need 
jobs. It is a significant tax relief which will help them pay their 
bills.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	I repeat, more money in the pockets of consumers, small 
business people and investors will mean greater spending and 
prosperity for all Canadians. Consumers that spend more money 
will create the permanent, well paying jobs Canadians are looking 
for, which is what they need and have not had for years.
<P>
	What I have described is Reform's fresh start. What we are 
putting to the Canadian people is a plan that will give Canadians a 
hand up, not a hand out; a plan that will help them succeed in their 
goals in the 21st century.
<P>
	The Liberal government has done nothing for Canada's sick, 
elderly and disadvantaged. It has done  nothing for Canadian 
families and consumers except pick their pockets and impose 
hardship. It has raised taxes and has cut health and education 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10087"> 10087 </A></B>
<P>
benefits. Canadians are asking where the benefits are from this 
budget. Where are the benefits from the government? Is the 
government here to serve the Canadian people or are the Canadian 
people simply called on to bear the burdens of government without 
hope of relief?
<P>
	Reform's course is clear. We will balance the budget by 1999. 
We will begin paying down the debt. We will reinvest in social 
programs and create jobs by giving tax relief to every Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. member. He 
talked a lot about his concern for health care. I think we can come 
to an agreement that all of us are very concerned about health care, 
along with all of our constituents across Canada.
<P>
	I think the hon. member is quite misguided in believing that a tax 
cut somehow will help our health care system. We need only to 
look at places like Alberta where it offered a tax cut and where 
health care did suffer. We need only to look at places like Ontario 
where a tax cut has been offered and indeed health care has 
suffered. There is no question that a tax cut directly affects health 
care and hurts every Canadian across the country.
<P>
	The Reform Party says that in its fresh start it will put additional 
moneys into health care. Here is a news flash: the Liberals have 
done that and continue to do it. There are a number of measures in 
the budget, as my colleague knows. Also I hope he understands that 
for the years 1998 to 2001, there already has been a promise made 
to increase transfers and increase payments for health care.
<P>
	There is a large question around the fresh start proposal which 
has really been a quandary for me. Reform has also said that it is 
going to take $3.5 billion out of transfers. I guess I am really in 
great awe, wondering how it is going to do that and not affect 
health care. It must be going to affect education or perhaps other 
services people depend upon.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about bankruptcies and asked what we 
are doing to help them, what happens to these people. We have a 
number of initiatives. But if the Reform Party carries out its threat, 
and I say threat of a tax cut because that is not positive, then we 
will see a decrease in services such as health care, education and all 
of our social safety nets. I do not know how that will help 
Canadians in the long run. In my view, it will not help at all. It has 
been proven in Ontario and in Alberta that it has hurt health care 
directly.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The other thing the hon. member did not touch on is the fact that 
this government has vacated 32 per cent room in tax points for 
health care. We never hear hon.  members talk about that, that tax 
room has been given and has helped.
<P>
	I would really like to understand in all honesty, in all fairness, in 
the name of this wonderful fresh start how a tax cut can benefit 
Canadians when it hurts health care, when it hurts education, when 
it hurts us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her 
comments and questions. They certainly give me ample room to 
make my own comments in responding to them.
<P>
	The difficulty I have had in watching the government's layoff 
policy and put its plans into action is the difficulty it has had in 
priorizing. It seems that when a cut is made by the Liberal 
government it slashes through in such a way that destruction is 
done without a lot of benefit. For example, we see layoffs but 
where are the layoffs? On the front line, in the provinces and the 
communities where people live.
<P>
	Look what is happening in what used to be called the 
unemployment insurance office. The service is not there. People 
can no longer drop off their cards. They can no longer go to 
counsellors. They have to use the telephone and punch buttons. 
One of the biggest fights I have as a member of Parliament is 
getting telephones to outlying regions of my constituency. What do 
those people do? How did the government cuts help them?
<P>
	It is not only tax cuts we are talking about. I have noticed that 
while tax cuts are taking place on the front line, very little is cut at 
the top of the government hierarchy. In fact I have seen the front 
lines cut and at the same time the executive and the research 
departments expanded.
<P>
	I watched layoffs take place and a few months later with the 
shortages that have been left after the golden handshakes have been 
given, what happens? Many of the same people are hired back on 
contract so that we not only pay for the golden handshake, we pay 
for the new contract as well.
<P>
	The member says the Liberals are putting money into health 
care. It would be a pleasure to know that is happening, but the 
benefits have not reached our communities.
<P>
	I remember when I was campaigning in 1993 I promised that a 
Reform government would take no money out of health care. Today 
we are in a position where we will be putting money back into 
health care and education to restore them and repair the damage 
done by this Liberal government. Our cuts will be from the top. 
There is lots of room at the top.
<P>
	When the Liberal government came to power what was the first 
thing I heard? ``Your friends are back'', the Prime Minister said to 
the government departments, to the bureaucracy. They have been 
well looked after.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10088"> 10088 </A></B>
<P>
	The member talks about the threat of a tax cut. That is not a 
threat. That is a promise. It is a promise made to Canadians who 
have been calling for a tax cut for years. All they have had is the 
imposition of more and more tax increases to the point where we 
are now looking at almost 80,000 Canadians who have gone 
bankrupt in the past year.
<P>
	That is the serious situation we are in. We have to look at 
government. We have to priorize our spending. We have to make 
the cuts from the top and provide leadership.
<P>
	Talking about leadership, I am amazed that while Canadians are 
having their Canada pension plan premiums increased and the 
benefits over the years decreased, I have not heard this government 
say anything about the gold plated MP pension plan. Nothing has 
been said about that. There are no cuts there. Believe me, there are 
no cuts there. They should be ashamed of that. There should be 
leadership by example, not what we are seeing from the Liberals: 
``Do what we say, not what we do''.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy ChrÃ©tien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member of the Reform Party promise tax 
rebates and tax cuts. Well, good luck to him, considering the 
credibility politicians acquired with the last red book.
<P>
	They promised to scrap the GST, but more than three and a half 
years later, the GST is still there, and even worse, they paid three 
small maritime provinces $960 million to make the medicine go 
down in one part of Canada where the GST will miraculously 
change its name. Quite a feat, this name change. From now on, it 
will be known as the HST, the harmonized sales tax. This means 
that in New Brunswick, for instance, they blended the provincial 
sales tax with the GST. They pay 15 per cent, which is added on to 
the price, of course.
<P>
	My point is that the government is acting like Robin Hood, but in 
reverse. Instead of taking money from the rich to give to the poor, it 
is taking money from the poor to give to the rich. For instance, at 
Bombardier, where you have more than-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> My dear colleagues, I am 
sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but I have to give the hon. 
member for Cariboo-Chilcotin enough time to reply. We only 
have a few seconds left.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
conclude. I want to comment on the issue the member raised about 
integrity of politicians.
<P>
	It is an important issue and one of the reasons I got into politics. 
It is backed up in the Reform Party by a guarantee that if we do not 
do what we say, we will give  the electors the opportunity and the 
ability to fire the MP or those MPs. That is a guarantee the Liberals 
would not understand. However it is one Canadians must have if 
they are to hold their politicians accountable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when we start 
talking about budgets and finances a lot of people's eyes glaze over 
in this place. I do not think it is the sort of thing Liberals like to 
hear discussed. They have demonstrated in the last 3.5 years not a 
lot of vision or planning for the 21st century as many of our young 
people would like to see.
<P>
	We see a group of Canadians, particularly young Canadians, who 
have lost confidence in what government can deliver for them. I 
cannot help but remember the faces of many young people with 
whom I have spoken in universities across the country in just about 
every province. Many of them were graduates of courses of varying 
lengths and in various trades. They would ask: ``What about us? 
What has the government really done for us in terms of prospects 
going into the 21st century?''
<P>
	We can touch on some of those things and some of the things we 
hear as we travel the country. Just this past week we have been 
asked how we got rid of the debt that was such a problem to us. 
When we tell them the debt that was zero in 1969 went to $18 
billion in 1972 and climbed through from 1972 to 1984 to about 
$180 billion, they ask us how that was possible.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	We have to tell these young people that governments promised a 
lot of things and Canadians accepted a lot of things. The question 
we did not ask was what it would cost and from where they would 
get the money. Had we asked that question we would have found 
out that it was borrowed money and that we had many more 
services than we could afford. Taxes increased and we got cradle to 
grave services.
<P>
	In 1983 a guy came along who said that it was terrible and that 
we could not let it grow any more. In two consecutive elections we 
put that person in. By the time we got to 1993 it was at $489 billion. 
We went from $180 billion to $200 billion to $489 billion. Then we 
decided to get rid of that person because another government said it 
would rein in spending. Now we are at $600 billion.
<P>
	Young people ask why they should trust politicians. Even more 
sinister, the finance minister stood and said they had solved the 
problem, that there was no financial problem any more. To prove 
the point, in the past week close to $8 billion was spent on various 
types of pre-election programs. How can it be helped? The 
Canadian population, particularly young people, are asking what 
these people are doing.
<P>
	To go further, somewhere in the neighbourhood of $14 billion 
federal is spent on advanced education.  Depending on the figures 
used, somewhere around $16 billion is spent on health care, $20 
billion on pensions and close to $50 billion on interest payments. 
Out of a budget of $109 billion, Liberals have the nerve to tell 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10089"> 10089 </A></B>
<P>
people there is no problem when they spend close to $50 billion on 
interest payments in a year and get nothing for it.
<P>
	What is threatening our social programs? Certainly not our party. 
Not even the Liberals. Interest payments are threatening the 
country. It will take a concerted effort by a government to turn that 
around.
<P>
	When we see the spending of $8 billion on vote buying in 
elections or when we see the heritage minister having a two-hour 
caviar party with around 100 people at a cost according to access to 
information of $65,671, Canadians say the Liberals are out of 
control and do not know what they are doing.
<P>
	That is why people have lost confidence. That is why young 
people have lost confidence. To go further with the young people 
scenario, they ask about the Canada pension. Canada pension is in 
trouble. They will not get anything if we do not fix the problem.
<P>
	They will not do it all at once because they do not have the 
courage. They will do it over six years. They will sneak up on 
people. People will wonder why they do not have more money but 
that they will not really know why it all happened. The Liberals 
will be a little deceitful about it and make it happen over six years.
<P>
	What are they promising young people? They are telling them 
that if they earn $30,000 their premiums will be raised from a 
maximum $845 up to $1,600 and some dollars maximum and that 
their employers will match it. They will collect roughly $3,300 
every year from young people and put it into a fund that will be 
used for the people who are retiring now. When they are 65 years of 
age they will be given $8,800.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Is that a wonderful thing to do? If young people took the $3,300 
and put it into their own annuity fund, they would get about 
$26,000 and would have the principal, using a 6 per cent rate of 
return.
<P>
	Young people say the Liberals have blown it on the debt and on 
the insurance plan. Why should they pay that kind of money? There 
will be a generational rebellion down the road when young people 
wake up to a 73 per cent increase in premiums that will be 
dramatic. Some government will face it very soon. Certainly, if not 
now, six years from now when it all kicks in.
<P>
	What is even worse is that MPs have the nerve to collect a 
pension that is four to five times better than what people get in 
industry. That is not putting their money where their mouth is. It 
says to young people that they do not care about them, that they do 
not have a plan, that they do not raise taxes and rip them off, and  
that they do not mind taking advantage of them because they know 
best. They have a real problem with accountability. Politicians 
should be accountable.
<P>
	Let us examine taxes. We have heard from members on the other 
side that it would be sinister to lower taxes and that they have to 
keep raising them. The Liberals set a good example of raising 
taxes. They threw a penny and a half on to the price of a litre of 
gasoline and said that it was not a tax increase, that it would not 
affect anyone because after all only rich people use cars. The 
Liberals said that they would get rid of the GST before the election, 
but when they were in power they forgot that promise.
<P>
	They tax seniors. Recently I received hundreds of letters in 
response to a questionnaire I sent out. I was shocked at how many 
of them were from seniors with a gross income somewhere in the 
range of $17,000 to $18,000. They are living in their own homes. 
They are 75 years old. They are trying to make a living and stay in 
their homes as long as they can. This year they are paying $1,100 in 
federal income tax for the first time.
<P>
	When I say to them the government needs that money, they say 
they heard me talking about the caviar party, some of the other 
waste in Ottawa. They say the other place has to be the best 
example of waste, that everybody likes to talk about it, and they do 
not know anybody who likes that place.
<P>
	MP pensions is a hot issue. If our Liberal colleagues stand before 
their constituents and say they deserve a pension four to five times 
better than what any of they deserve, they have different 
constituents from the ones I have. My constituents are quite happy 
to pay me a pension equal to what I could get in industry, but they 
sure are not happy to pay the kind of pension that MPs get.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	I found it interesting that a member opposite said that lowering 
taxes would hurt the economy. I spent some time in New Zealand 
this past July. That country had an economic problem. In 1984 its 
political parties got together to try to solve the problem. They 
lowered taxes by close to 50 per cent. The economy in New 
Zealand is booming. The unemployment rate is under 5 per cent. 
New Zealanders are enthusiastic about their country. Its young 
people have the choice of two or three jobs. If that kind of tax relief 
does not send a message, then these people across the way have 
their heads in the sand. They have no vision.
<P>
	When young people hear figures like that they are shocked and 
ashamed of what has happened. This country should be at the top of 
the list instead of near the bottom in terms of the things offered to 
young people and the tax relief that is offered.
<P>
	The most meaningful thing that struck me in New Zealand was 
when I read about how stamps had  decreased in price three times 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10090"> 10090 </A></B>
<P>
in a year. Can you imagine that? If that is not an indication of what 
lowering taxes will do, I do not know what is.
<P>
	One of my colleagues mentioned privatization. New Zealand 
privatized its television network and it is now very profitable. It 
brings in a lot more money than it ever did before.
<P>
	Lowering taxes is not a bad thing. Lowering taxes will provide a 
vision. Taking money from a senior who earns $17,000 a year is not 
helping the rich. The government is penalizing the poor. It is going 
after the poor people. When it takes 1.5 cents off a litre of gasoline, 
that punishes everyone.
<P>
	What is the vision for the 21st century? Canadians know, 
particularly young Canadians, that there is no vision. Look at the 
justice system. How can people have confidence in the justice 
system?
<P>
	I come back again to the 300 or more young parents who I met in 
a gymnasium. They said to me: ``Our justice system is not fair''. 
Why is it not fair? A pedophile who had offended nine times had 
just been released into a neighbourhood in our city. The reports 
which were read to those young parents that night had a message. 
The psychiatrist said: ``This person will definitely reoffend''. The 
prison authorities said: ``We had to remove this person from the 
treatment program because he was too violent''. The head of the 
RCMP in our community said: ``We are really concerned about this 
individual reoffending''.
<P>
	I was very proud of those young parents. They were not 
vigilantes. They did not ask for blood. They asked why the system 
was failing them so badly.
<P>
	Young people have lost confidence in this country. The 
government is overspending. The increase in Canada pension plan 
premiums is a terrible attack on young people.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	The tax system continues to grind away and grab more and more. 
The justice system does not deliver hope to innocent citizens. I ask 
you, Mr. Speaker, when that 10th victim occurs how will I face that 
young family and say: ``We knew that was going to happen and 
now we can put that person away''. How will I answer that question 
for that young person?
<P>
	We can touch on the area of unity and of course again we see no 
plan. Obviously Canada has changed an awful lot in the last 130 
years. Where once we were two founding nations, French and 
English, we are now a great mix of many nationalities with 
one-third of us not being of either French English background. We 
must have something better to tell our young people than the 
solution to our unity problem is distinct society. We must have a 
better answer than that.
<P>
	Then other things come to mind, such as how women are treated 
in the electoral process. Reformers would love to have 53 per cent 
of our members female. That would represent the community but it 
is difficult to achieve. However, when a party starts appointing 
candidates that is just not acceptable.
<P>
	In the riding in Victoria, for instance, Reform had three 
candidates running for the nomination. There was a political 
scientist, a businessman and a woman teacher. They worked very 
hard and did what they had to do to try to win the nomination. 
When Arla Taylor won that nomination she can now stand up and 
say I won it because I was the very best. That is what our young 
people are looking at. That is the kind of thing they want to say is a 
vision for the future.
<P>
	That bothers the people on the other side because they just 
cannot accept equality. They cannot accept that everybody is equal. 
They like special status for different groups.
<P>
	Finally, we must have a vision for the 21st century. The Liberals 
certainly do not have one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make a comment and then ask my colleague a question.
<P>
	The biggest problem I have with the budget implementation act, 
Bill C-93, is with the budgetary habits of the Liberal government 
and the budget of the finance minister this last time around. I gave 
him an F on the budget, not necessarily for what is in it and for the 
numbers that are in it, but I gave him an F for what is not in the 
budget. I gave him an F for the perception that he is creating by 
distorting the strength of our economy.
<P>
	He brags and assures Canadians that the back of the deficit is 
broken with a projected $19 billion deficit which of course will be 
down around $14 billion range. How can the back of the deficit be 
broken when we are talking about $14 billion deficits? The finance 
minister becomes inept because he brags about how the Liberals 
have restored confidence to the Canadian economy and yet he takes 
all the credit. Let us look at the factors that created the turnaround 
in the Canadian economy in the last three and a half years.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	First was a worldwide drop in interest rates. Second, the drop in 
those interest rates was as a direct result of the Bank of Canada's 
monetary policy and the high interest rate policy during the 
Conservative regime that tried to curb inflation. The Liberals 
railed, ranted and ravaged the Conservative government and the 
then governor of the Bank of Canada for their high interest rate 
policy. It is because that governor was right and did the right thing 
that Canada kept in pace and in tune with other world economies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10091"> 10091 </A></B>
<P>
	Now the finance minister is bragging: ``We have brought 
interest rates down to their lowest level in the last 30 years. We 
have implemented such a wonderful budget that we now have the 
lowest interest rates in 30 years. We deserve all the credit. 
Canadians will put us back into power because of our sound fiscal 
policies and this wonderful budgetary objective and restoring 
confidence in the Canadian economy''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We are going to trounce them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> In school I was taught that is called plagiarism. When 
you copy someone else's written material and claim it as your own, 
it is plagiarism.
<P>
	The finance minister is the beneficiary of low interest rates. He 
has allowed our huge debt to grow. However, he will not give credit 
where credit is due. He is taking full credit.
<P>
	For example, I will give a quote that I could use as mine: ``In 
politics, perception is everything''. I could claim that is my quote 
but I would be lying, it would not be true because that quote 
belongs to none other than the Prime Minister of the country who is 
more interested in creating perceptions and smoke and mirrors than 
he is about the reality of life in Canada.
<P>
	I gave the finance minister an F for another reason. He failed to 
tell the Canadian public about the debt. It was mentioned once in 
his budget speech. He talked for 60 minutes and he mentioned the 
word debt once. He has added $111 billion to the debt. He says that 
he has broken the back of the deficit and improved the economy 
when the debt now is over $600 billion.
<P>
	Should he be so lucky to be in the government the next time 
around, I feel sorry for him when the debt grows to $650 million or 
$700 million. Even with the low interest rate policy he is going to 
have a hard time making ends meet and paying for the 
departmental programs in place now.
<P>
	What if interest rates go higher than 5 per cent, 6 per cent or7 per cent? What if they go back to 9 per cent? I am very afraid of 
that.
<P>
	I heard members opposite during my intervention asking what 
we would have added to the debt. We would have added $45 billion 
to the debt as opposed to $111 billion. We would have balanced the 
budget in three years from when we took office. We would have a 
surplus this year ending 1997.
<P>
	I am sorry, I talked right through my time. I do want to ask the 
member to make one more comment on the vision of the 
government. Why does he really think it has a vision when the 
Prime Minister and the justice minister say: ``We will handle the 
problems one at a time''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, in answer to the question of 
vision, we have had a lot of examples of why there is no vision. I 
tried to focus on young people. I enjoy working with young people. 
I probably enjoy that  more than anything else I do in this job. They 
are saying that there is no vision. In fact, they are saying worse. 
They are asking: ``Is democracy really working?'' They are asking 
a much more serious question than just about partisan politics. 
They are asking about democracy. I think that is critical. Some 
countries like the U.S. have sometimes as low as a 30 per cent turn 
out. That is saying a lot about what the people are seeing in 
government.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Fortunately in Canada we do not get down that low. Hopefully 
we can do things that will cause higher percentages. Australia has 
taken one approach to that by fining people who do not vote. I do 
not really think that is the answer.
<P>
	We have to involve people in this vision. The real concern is with 
that debt. As the hon. member said, they do not have a plan for it. It 
is gone. Just think of the opportunity that has been wasted. With 
low interest rates and with inflation so low, what a great 
opportunity it would have been if they had had a vision to deal with 
this problem, to cut some of these Kodak tours, some of the caviar 
parties and some of the on top benefits that are around this place.
<P>
	There are so many people who do not have the vision. To stand 
up in this House and say that this government controls interest rates 
and controls inflation, it does not.
<P>
	I am afraid there is good reason for people to be very sceptical 
and dubious about where this government is going. They do not see 
that there is a plan. They are asking what happens when interest 
rates rise, when inflation returns, when the normal economic cycles 
take their course. What will this government do?
<P>
	The government has been unable to deal with pensions, with 
unemployment, with health care, with education. If it has not been 
able to deal with those in the good times, what will it possibly be 
able to do in the tougher times when it is lacking vision?
<P>
	Raising taxes is the answer that the Liberals possibly will 
choose, but I think Canadians have had it with that. They will have 
the opportunity to speak soon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what would be the consequence in my colleague's opinion of 
interest rates rising 2 per cent on the present debt repayment 
program of the government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer to that would be 
a minimum of $10 billion in increased debt. As that goes up our 
ability to service it becomes less and less. Again, that is the big 
problem that will hang over us along with the other problems 
Canadians will face in the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the 
hon. member for Red Deer referred to earlier, he is absolutely right. 
This government has missed the problem. It has identified the 
wrong problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10092"> 10092 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has taken the low bar on the high jump and 
said deficit is the problem. ``We will solve that. What we will do 
is we will promise Canadians to spend less than the Conservatives 
did. We promise Canadians that we will bring in a lower deficit 
than the Conservatives did and that will solve our problem''. I 
submit that did not solve the problem. It only adds to the problem.
<P>
	I know this bill will be voted on at the end of the day. This is 
probably my last chance to speak on a monetary bill. I do not know 
if there is anything else on the agenda this week. The one thing I 
would like to leave with the Liberal Party and with Canadians 
across the country is I would like to remind them that it is a noble 
effort and it is worthwhile and it is a necessity to lower our deficit 
and we have to get to a surplus.
<P>
	To the degree that this government has lowered the deficit, I 
compliment it. It is the right direction to go.
<P>
	The degree to which it brags and overexaggerates the benefits 
that we have achieved to date is a disservice to the Canadian public.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	What I am really concerned about as a Canadian is that the 
finance minister, because the global economy and global markets 
have improved over the last four years, has missed the opportunity 
to make the cuts sooner in the other areas he has avoided. They 
dilly-dallied for a whole year before actually making cuts. The first 
budget was all talk. He then lobbied with his cabinet and colleagues 
and did a good job in getting them to agree to some cuts. They took 
some of our ideas from the zero in three, the ones they thought they 
could sell. That is smart. If you see a good idea just steal it, take it 
and take credit for it. That is fine as long as it is good for all of 
Canada.
<P>
	They went too far on the cuts in social transfer. They put it all 
together. In health, education and welfare they cut $7.5 billion, 
which is way too much. Provinces are having trouble. Hospitals are 
having trouble. Everybody is concerned about this issue. It has 
been an issue in Alberta where a lot of angry people have had to be 
addressed concerning the closures of certain hospitals, especially 
in downtown Calgary. I am very familiar with the issue there and 
which hospitals were closed. That is from a regime that did not 
promise any tax cuts or give any tax cuts. It just promised to 
balance the budget over <I>x</I> period of time. This issue is important.
<P>
	In our zero in three budget we would have only cut $3.5 billion 
from health care, education and welfare. This is clearly $4.5 billion 
less than the Liberal government did.
<P>
	The reason I accuse the Liberals of downloading on the 
provinces is they made their cuts in social transfers to provinces 
rather than cuts to to their own departments, notwithstanding the 
promise of the finance minister that  we will sacrifice as well in 
order to justify this. If Canadians would accept the government's 
$7.5 billion cut to the Canadian health and social transfer, it would 
cut 18.8 per cent from departmental spending amounting to $9.4 
billion. To date, it is only at 4.2 or 4.5 per cent. It assures us that it 
will get there but it has now changed the rules on how it will get 
there. It is not quoting $9 billion any more. It is not quoting a final 
number any more.
<P>
	What the government is saying is that it will reach its 18.8 per 
cent cuts in program spending but it will redefine what program 
spending is and then move a whole bunch of spending off balance 
sheet accounting. It is now going to say it has met its 18.8 per cent. 
Pretty soon we might find in a year that it is $5.6 billion or another 
billion dollars, because I know it is projected and I know what will 
happen, but $5.5 billion will now represent 18.8 per cent and once 
again it will brag about how it has met its targets and objectives.
<P>
	My biggest problem with what the Liberals have done is that 
they will go to the public after they call an election and ask and 
seek for a vote of confidence to stay the course and support a 
pan-Canadian view of this country where we have to give 
inducements to three provinces to buy into a harmonized sales tax 
at a cost of a billion dollars to the rest of the country. That is not 
even revenue neutral. It means that the finance minister had to dip 
into the current account to pay for that. The Liberals are going to 
ask for a vote of confidence without telling the Canadian public 
what they will do if they ever balance the budget.
<P>
	What will they do? We say we should balance the budget and the 
sooner the better. Our party makes a firm commitment date as to 
when we would do that. We say that we would cut. Where we 
would cut more than the Liberals of course is in direct subsidies to 
businesses because we feel that distorts the marketplace. There is 
another $2 billion to $3 billion there.
<P>
	In my opinion, if the minister had done that he could have really 
been looking at a balanced budget a lot sooner.
<P>
	We say a tax cut after we balance the budget and after we have 
created a surplus. We take that money, apply some of it to the debt 
and some to lower taxes for all Canadians, not just the rich 
Canadians they accuse us of. Everybody's personal and spousal 
exemptions would rise to $7,900. That helps everybody. That is 
what we would do with a surplus. We would then lower the cost of 
government and lower the overhead. We do not need 300 MPs in 
this House. I think the majority of MPs would agree with me on 
that on a non-partisan basis. Why are we increasing it by six?
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister has said in his broken English and broken 
French, the same way in both languages, that  maybe we spend, 
maybe we do not spend and maybe we will have more money. As 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10093"> 10093 </A></B>
<P>
soon as we hit a balanced budget are they going to go back to 
increasing spending on different programs? Are they going to 
continue to create that dependency on a big federal government so 
big government will look after everybody? Then we will just add to 
that debt.
<P>
	Somebody has to address the fact and the reality that sooner or 
later, I do not care how small it is, whether it is a $1 billion 
payment, this government or any government will have to make a 
repayment on that debt. In our personal lives we cannot go on 
forever and ever increasing our debt without making a payment on 
it. It is fine to reduce your interest cost, your deficit, but we cannot 
continually go on adding to our debt. Sooner or later the bank calls 
us on our loan. Sooner or later it takes away our car if we do not 
make a payment.
<P>
	Somehow or other government politicians and the 
bureaucracy-I do not think it helps sometimes-seem to think 
that the public purse is somehow different. The debt is $600 billion 
but they think the only problem to solve to get to a balanced budget 
is the deficit. They think that will solve the problems of everybody. 
That debt has to be addressed.
<P>
	A prudent government and a prudent finance minister would 
have pushed harder and talked about the debt as a percentage of the 
gross domestic product. They would have talked about how we are 
going to repay it over 30 years, or at least some of it. We do not 
have repay the whole $600 billion but we should be making a $1 
billion or $2 billion principal repayment at least every term of 
government. I agree that the repayment should be over the long 
term, that we should bind government to no more deficit spending 
except under extreme circumstances or emergencies.
<P>
	The difference between the United States and Canada is gross 
taxation levels. High taxes kill jobs. Lower taxes will create jobs. 
The proof is that in the United States total state and federal taxation 
amounts to 27 per cent of the gross domestic product. The total 
value of the goods and services the Americans generate is taxed at a 
level of 27 per cent for individuals and corporations. In Canada 
taxation at all levels represents 35 per cent of our gross domestic 
product. The U.S. unemployment rate is 5 per cent and our 
unemployment rate is close to double that. The United States has 
lower taxes, more people employed and a larger population than we 
have. It must be doing something right. I maintain it is in the field 
of taxation. Therein lies the problem.
<P>
	If we could ever give tax cuts we would go a long way to solve 
our economic problems and to improve our economic situation. We 
have to create less dependency on a big federal government. If we 
want to do that we have to give more disposable income back to the 
people so they can look after themselves. There will be less need 
for people to look to welfare programs and  unemployment 
programs. I do not want to talk about unemployment because I will 
get off topic with that slush fund he has cooking, taxing us to the 
tune of $7 billion which is in that EI fund already. That is a 
generous surplus. I agree the fund should theoretically contain that 
surplus, but it is not really a surplus. If he is so far ahead of his 
deficit target, that is one small selective tax cut he could make. He 
may do it.
<P>
	I know a lot of economists make representations to the finance 
minister, and he does listen, of course only if it is politically 
convenient to do so. He may do it at some point during the election 
campaign after the Liberals receive enough heat and they get 
enough criticism from the general public about their arrogance and 
how they brag about how well things are. The Liberals may receive 
heat about keeping half the truth from the Canadian public, the 
truth about the debt, the truth about the rising interest costs. Even 
though interest rates are low, the sum total of what this government 
is now paying in interest has gone from $30 billion to $50 billion. 
Is nobody worried about that? Is nobody worried about a $650 
billion debt, notwithstanding the interest rate? Is nobody worried 
about how much money we are going to have to pay? That will be 
the single biggest cost to any future federal government. That is 
scary and that is after spending is reduced.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	I submit there is room for another $10 billion worth of cuts the 
Liberals have not touched. Some government will or through 
attrition we will get down to that lower level of spending. After we 
get there the federal government will be able to provide the 
services Canadians want. It will take us two or three years to get 
there but it will be done.
<P>
	Interest costs will rise if the Liberals continue to add to the debt. 
They will brag. They will say: ``Vote for us. Give us a vote of 
confidence because we will have a balanced budget in two years''.
<P>
	I am worried about what they will do with the surplus. Will they 
ignore the debt and increase spending? Will they say they have 
taken enough flack from the Reform Party on health care and 
increase spending on health care by $1 billion? If they feel they 
have taken enough flack from the Reform Party in an area will they 
increase spending there? Will they say the foundation for 
innovation is so great that they will double its budget? Will they 
say regional development is doing good they will triple its budget? 
Will they ignore the debt?
<P>
	We cannot ignore the debt. It is the single biggest problem facing 
the country along with the interest cost that services it. It has to be 
addressed.
<P>
	I must be a voice in the wilderness. I am the only person who 
talks about the debt and high interest costs. No government 
member talks about them. The finance minister mentioned debt 
once in his 60-minute speech.  We do not talk about it. He brags 
about everything else in his economic statement. An economic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10094"> 10094 </A></B>
<P>
statement should fairly and accurately represent the economic 
status of the country at any given time.
<P>
	The minister dwells on the positives. That is misleading. He gets 
an <I>f</I> from me for not talking about the other side of the story, the 
debt. While the deficit has decreased how much have interest costs 
gone up? That is an important component.
<P>
	Yes, we are a rich country. Yes, we can sustain a high level of 
debt. Yes, people will continue to lend us money. However, we are 
40 per cent indebted to foreign countries.
<P>
	The finance minister and the Prime Minister can brag about not 
borrowing any more and about the decrease in borrowing 
requirements. The foreign borrowing or borrowing requirements of 
the government have decreased from $32 billion to $14 billion. 
That is tremendous. That is a plus. That is good. We all want that.
<P>
	It could have been twice as good as that. We could have got there 
twice as fast if the cuts I am talking about were made at the time I 
am talking about. They should not have wasted time. They should 
have lived up to their commitment to cut $9 billion from 
departmental spending.
<P>
	The Liberals wasted two years. They failed to act for two years. 
They did not make the cuts, even the cuts they said they would 
make. The President of the Treasury Board got all the other 
ministers to agree to doing it to justify the $7.5 billion. That has 
now been done. I would defend the $7.5 billion, but I would do so 
by ensuring that departments lived up to their commitment, which 
was to cut $9 billion. That has not happened.
<P>
	They will come in with a $14 billion to $15 billion deficit. We 
must consider the two years of inactivity. If they had made those 
cuts during those two years they could brag about a balanced 
budget. The election would be about what they do next. Do they 
address the debt or do they talk about spending on new programs or 
increase spending on programs?
<P>
	If the Prime Minister and the finance minister come up with a 
sequel to their red book they had better address those things. What 
will they do when there is a surplus? A surplus is coming. Spending 
has been frozen. Certain departments have been told to cut back. 
There will be a surplus. It will take them a year or a year and a half 
longer than it would take us.
<P>
	Nevertheless historians and economists will be able to go back 
and refit the numbers to see what would have happened if they 
acted here or there.

	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.)</B> moved the 
second reading of, and concurrence in, amendments made by the 
Senate to Bill C-216, an act to amend the Broadcast Act (broadcast 
policy).
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill has been debated in the 
House and studied by the heritage committee. It has been debated 
in the other place and studied by its committee. If members of the 
opposition really believe in democracy they are going to allow it to 
go to a vote. If they care to represent interests greater than Quebec, 
they will allow it to go to a vote. If they care about seniors,  
families and people who are struggling to get by they will let it go 
to a vote.
<P>
	I would like to suggest that the time has come to end this debate 
now and let us get it to a vote.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to remind the House that this bill, standing in the name 
of the hon. member for Sarnia, was basically well intentioned.
<P>
	As far as protecting the consumer is concerned, we have always 
said in this House that one of the objectives of this bill was to 
prevent negative option billing, in other words, the consumer 
should be able to decide whether he wants certain specialty 
channels provided by cable distributors.
<P>
	However, although the hon. member brings up the issue of 
democracy, and I will do so as well, although he argues that we 
want to protect the interests of consumers and our fellow citizens in 
Quebec and in Canada, I remind him of what I said in my 
comments on March 27, 1996, and September 16, 1996, which 
included arguments that have gained in strength since the bill was 
considered by the Senate. Many organizations and experts told the 
Senate that this bill went beyond its original purpose and that in 
fact it would have a negative impact on the public.
<P>
	I will outline the sequence of events. If I could speak to them 
directly, I would ask all members who wish to talk to do so outside 
so I can make myself clear-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. members who are 
having conversations in various parts of the room if they would 
please move them. It is much more comfortable in the lobby with 
coffee, juice and everything else.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for 
your co-operation, and I want to thank my colleagues for giving me 
a chance to explain why we should vote against this bill.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-216 is to prohibit cable distributors from 
providing an optional service without the consent of the subscriber. 
It is intended to prevent negative option billing. This is a marketing 
technique that puts the onus on the consumer to indicate that he 
does not want the service.
<P>
	For instance, when a consumer is offered specialty channels, he 
is offered them as a service by the cable company, which tells him 
that if a month from now he is no longer interested, he should give 
them a call and they will remove the service. So the onus is on the 
consumer to accept or refuse the offer, and if he does neither, the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10100"> 10100 </A></B>
<P>
cable distributor providing the service bills the consumer. This is 
called negative option billing.
<P>
	The bill provides for two exceptions. First, if the new service is 
substituted for an existing service with no increase in the amount 
billed, and second, if no distinct separate charge is levied for that 
service. The Senate, when it considered this bill, proposed an 
amendment.
<P>
	The purpose of this amendment is to give the CRTC the power it 
already had and did not wish to use, which is to allow negative 
option billing in the case of specialty channels. The CRTC already 
had that power, and an amendment was proposed to confirm that it 
had the power and should use it.
<P>
	I may recall that this bill came on the heels of a revolt among 
consumers in English Canada. It started in the Vancouver area 
where there was an outcry in 1995 when a new package of services 
was introduced by Rogers Communications. In January 1995, six 
new English specialty channels came on the air, as authorized by 
the CRTC. Rogers Communications took advantage of this 
opportunity to change the packages it offered to consumers and, in 
the process, subscribers lost some of the channels they liked.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	They were going to have to pay extra to have them again. The 
subscribers also had to tell the cable company they did not want to 
take the new channels. This is called negative option billing.
<P>
	Consumers in the west were penalized by the fact that Rogers 
insisted on adding new channels, as a marketing strategy, and the 
channels consumers enjoyed were withdrawn. Consumers had to 
pay extra to get them. This obviously drew a loud outcry from 
western consumers and from consumers in the Toronto area.
<P>
	What was happening in Quebec at the time? VidÃ©otron was not 
offering a tiered service. It simply added new specialty services to 
its basic service at no extra cost. COGECO and CF Cable reached 
an agreement with the office of consumer protection after 
demonstrating the importance of the billing. This is one way of 
achieving desired penetration, that is, selling the product to enough 
subscribers to make it cost effective. In Quebec, because the 
market is so small, 85 per cent penetration is necessary. In other 
words, 85 per cent of customers must subscribe to cable for it to be 
cost effective.
<P>
	Why did the office give its approval and allow the billing, as 
long as flexible arrangements were in place for consumers who did 
not understand their obligation to cancel their subscription and 
avoid being penalized? Simply because, in Quebec, legislation 
prohibits negative option billing. The same legislation may be 
found in two other provinces. Billing is a matter of provincial 
jurisdiction. Product availability and client invoicing are provincial 
matters. This is why cable companies in Quebec agreed with the 
consumer association-they  wanted to obey the law-and why 
COGECO did not ask its customers for a cent. This was not the case 
in the west.
<P>
	I should add there were no optional services in Quebec at the 
time, and they did not arrive on the market until 1995.
<P>
	So some of my colleagues and I are going to take this hour to 
explain in detail how this whole practice of negative option billing 
must be opposed and how there must also be respect for the fact 
that it comes under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Second, it must also be said that, if passed, the bill will have the 
effect of preventing any new French language specialty services 
from broadcasting in Quebec or in French Canada.
<P>
	My colleagues will back this up and show how this bill has an 
impact on all francophone communities in Canada, and especially 
in Quebec.
<P>
	Finally, they will also show how many organizations, how many 
specialists have demonstrated here in the House, before the 
committee and in the Senate that the scope of this bill is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you are indicating to me that I have only two 
minutes left, I would like to move an amendment to this bill. I 
move, seconded by the member for Drummond:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' and 
substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A message be sent to the Senate to inform their Honours that this House rejects the 
amendment made by the Senate to Bill C-216, An Act to amend the Broadcasting 
Act (broadcasting policy), because, in the opinion of this House, it does not bring the 
Bill into conformity with the objectives of the Broadcasting Act with regard to 
French-language services.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	That, Mr. Speaker, is the amendment I wished to move, and I 
will invite my colleagues to continue the debate by pointing out 
how many experts have opposed the bill, beginning obviously with 
Quebec's Minister of Cultural Affairs, Louise Beaudoin, who 
spoke out strongly against it, raising the important issues of 
distribution and dissemination of cable services for francophones, 
particularly in Quebec.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if you will approve this amendment, I will move it. 
My colleagues will continue, in this debate, to show, argument by 
argument, that this bill should be rejected, because it poses a threat 
to all francophones in Canada, including Acadian francophones 
and francophones in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> The amendment moved is in order. The 
debate is now on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise, perhaps for the last time in this 35th Parliament, to 
participate in this debate on Bill C-216. Perhaps this bill will show 
all that the Bloc Quebecois has  done to defend not only the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10101"> 10101 </A></B>
<P>
interests of Quebec and francophone minorities but also, 
throughout this 35th Parliament, our language and culture, in the 
interests of Quebecers and every francophone community across 
Canada as well.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to prohibit negative option billing by 
broadcasters, that is to say cable distributors, a practice that leaves 
it up to consumers to specify whether or not they want to keep the 
service for which they are billed by the company.
<P>
	This basic principle contained in the bill, which looks 
commendable at first glance, appears to be in the best interests of 
consumers, but it does not necessarily benefit everyone. I do not 
question the motives of the hon. member who presented the bill, 
but I think it does not succeed in giving full privileges to every 
francophone community in Quebec and across Canada.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	First, this bill tells us that the first problem is that the marketing 
operations of any federal agency come under provincial 
jurisdiction. The bill introduced in this House meddles in 
jurisdictions already assigned to the provinces.
<P>
	Throughout this Parliament, we have repeatedly condemned all 
these encroachments on provincial jurisdictions and overlapping 
jurisdictions. The Bloc Quebecois is of the opinion that this bill 
interferes directly with provincial jurisdictions. Let us bear in mind 
that any federal agency that has a commercial component falls 
under exclusive provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	Second, in its proposed form, the bill would have the effect of 
making it more difficult to provide French language services in 
those communities where such services are provided, including in 
the French speaking communities outside Quebec and in that 
province.
<P>
	Third, this bill is not at all in line with the structure of the cable 
industry. The Bloc Quebecois opposed this bill primarily because it 
is a blatant case of interfering in a provincial jurisdiction, but also 
because it will be very hard to offer new services in French 
anywhere, since the bill provides that, in order for a company to 
provide a new service, it must get the approval of all its customers. 
This is difficult to understand.
<P>
	I would like to quote the Hon. Francis Fox who, when he 
presented his submission to the Standing Senate Committee on 
Transport and Communications, on April 8, 1997, looked at the 
measures taken since the eighties to protect French culture in 
Canada. Mr. Fox stated that Bill C-216 goes against these 
measures, and that the person who drafted this legislation has no 
idea of the specificity of the French culture.
<P>
	Allow me to quote a few excerpts from the Mr. Fox's 
submission. He said: ``I deeply believe that this bill, in its present 
form, would have harmful and destructive  effects, not only for 
affected companies, but for the French component of our 
broadcasting system''.
<P>
	Mr. Fox also said this: ``In its present form, this bill will either 
not allow new French language services to get started, or will 
prevent them from doing so at a reasonable price, thus depriving 
francophones in this country from having access, in their 
language-something which is definitely feasible-to 
programming services offering a greater variety and a greater 
wealth of information''.
<P>
	Here is another excerpt: ``This bill totally overlooks the 
francophone issue, whether in Quebec, in New Brunswick, or in 
Manitoba. Extending new French language services becomes an 
utopia''.
<P>
	This is why we must take an in-depth look at the possible 
consequences of all the measures introduced in this House.
<P>
	Passing this bill would again create federal interference in an 
area under provincial jurisdiction. It is important to note that the 
billing of a cable service is a commercial transaction between a 
consumer and a vendor, and that such transactions clearly come 
under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	In other words, even if a body such as the CRTC has the 
authority to licence broadcasting companies, in Quebec it is the 
Government of Quebec which has the required jurisdiction to 
regulate relations between companies and their consumers.
<P>
	A second reason, as I have already stated, not to support Bill 
C-216 is that it would prevent any new French-language service 
from seeing the light of day, while at the same time seriously 
jeopardizing the ones already in existence. The explanation for this 
phenomenon is very simple. A specialty channel is aimed at a 
specific segment of the public: Canal D, RDS, RDI and the Family 
Channel, for example, are not all aimed at the same audience. Since 
all channels are not met with the same interest in the general 
public, the cable companies take advantage of certain channels' 
large audiences, and therefore their cost-effectiveness, to maintain 
others which generally are less profitable, since they have only a 
limited audience.
<P>
	If people, especially those in English Canada, select all the 
channels they want to receive, obviously the French language 
channels will no longer be in demand and will no longer have the 
necessary cost-effectiveness to ensure their survival. So, once 
again, here we are in a vicious circle: fewer francophones, fewer 
services; fewer services, fewer francophones.
<P>
	It is clear, particularly in Ontario and the West, that the absence 
of rules has led to certain distributors' going too far. This proved to 
be a disastrous experiment and the consumers were up in arms. Yet, 
with good faith and  a healthy helping of common sense, it is 
possible for the cable companies to do effective marketing, while 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10102"> 10102 </A></B>
<P>
complying with the law and respecting the fundamental rights of 
consumers.
<P>
	So, in order to avoid the negative and pointless impact on the 
development of French language television in Canada and in 
Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois is obliged to vote against Bill C-216.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Debate is on the amendment and the hon. 
member for Sarnia-Lambton is entitled to speak to the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is an interesting turn of events or an interesting development 
when we consider that we are hearing from members of the group 
who talk about democracy in Canada and their respect for 
democracy.
<P>
	They have now proposed an amendment that would send the bill 
back. They reject it. They purport, allege and suggest they are 
speaking for francophones both inside and outside the province of 
Quebec. They are failing to tell Canadians who are watching and 
Canadians in the gallery today that the federation of francophones 
outside Quebec endorse the bill. They are failing to tell Canadians 
that cable company distributors in Quebec endorse the bill. They 
are purporting to protect Canadians when in fact they are not.
<P>
	They are telling the people in Quebec that they must accept 
channels they do not want. They are telling the seniors in Quebec 
they must accept the cartoon channel and the MuchMusic channel, 
notwithstanding the amendment made by the Senate that was 
sensitive to the needs of Quebec and notwithstanding that the 
amendment was put forth by interest groups from Quebec. That is 
not enough for the members opposite. They want more. They have 
not had enough.
<P>
	In the end they are trying to frustrate the rules of this place by 
killing a bill. They do not want it to go to a vote. They would rather 
talk it out and allow it to die here.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the fact that we sometimes say in this place that 
the opposition speaks for all Canadians, they are taking a very 
narrow and might I suggest a very selfish view of the issue.
<P>
	On this topic they are saying they will only speak for people 
inside the province of Quebec and to heck with all those people 
outside the province of Quebec. In effect they are saying to heck 
with all other people inside the province of Quebec. The Bloc says 
it knows what is best for them. They are saying they will reject it 
and will send it back to the Senate. They have no interest in 
consumers. They have no interest in seniors. They have no interest 
in families. They have no interest in the people who are living on 
very limited incomes.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	Notwithstanding that the witnesses who appeared before the 
heritage committee and the witnesses who appeared before the 
committee of the other place do not agree with them, they are 
saying they know more than they do.
<P>
	Under the circumstances I suggest they do not know more. They 
are capitulating to a couple of very special interest groups. They 
will argue about technical capabilities. They will argue about the 
single tier in Quebec. They will make all sorts of weird, wondrous 
and spurious arguments.
<P>
	They are not willing to protect consumers, whether the 
consumers are in the province of Quebec or in British Columbia or 
Nova Scotia. They are willing to hang them out to dry. They have a 
very unique interpretation of the law which, by the way, does not 
coincide with what was said by any of the witnesses. It flies in the 
face of all the evidence. It flies in the face of everything said before 
both committees. Yet the Bloc happens to know more.
<P>
	On that basis, I urge members to reject the Bloc amendment. Let 
us get on with the vote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jag Bhaduria (Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville, 
Lib. Dem.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am extremely pleased to rise in support 
of a very important piece of legislation which is of concern to every 
hard working Canadian including those living in Quebec.
<P>
	I am speaking against the amendment because for too long 
Canadian pocketbooks have been gouged by big businesses 
whether they are major banks with exorbitant credit card rates, gas 
companies that have monopolized the market or, in the case of the 
legislation, cable companies that have been allowed to blatantly rip 
off honest, hard working Canadians.
<P>
	We must not allow it to continue. It is our duty to ensure that all 
Canadians have the right to decide whether or not they want a 
product at a fair price. It is imperative that the government and the 
House do everything in their power to ensure all Canadians are 
treated fairly.
<P>
	Bill C-216 is legislation aimed at eliminating negative option 
billing by cable companies. Some two years ago cable companies 
decided simply to add new specialty channels to all subscribers and 
then tried to charge the customers for this new service without even 
asking if they wanted it.
<P>
	We are aware of the consumer revolt that ensued in which I 
played a part. As a result of the tireless efforts of my colleague 
from Sarnia-Lambton we have the opportunity today to enact into 
law what Canadian consumers have overwhelmingly supported. As 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10103"> 10103 </A></B>
<P>
parliamentarians we have an opportunity to vote in  support of what 
Canadians want over what lobbies representing special interest 
groups want.
<P>
	It is time to put the issue to a vote. It is a victory of the consumer. 
Let the voice of the consumers be heard through the legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to have the opportunity to speak this evening to this bill and to 
correct the misinformation conveyed by the member for 
Sarnia-Lambton.
<P>
	In cable broadcasting, the francophone context is entirely 
different from the anglophone one. Despite what our colleague 
from Sarnia-Lambton said earlier, no doubt in the belief he was 
speaking accurately, it is wrong to claim that cable companies in 
Quebec agree with his bill. Quite the opposite.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	Paul-Ãmile Beaulne, a vice-president of Radiomutuel, told the 
press on September 25, 1996 that it threatened the survival of 
specialty francophone services. He knows what he is talking about. 
He is right, and, unfortunately, the member for Sarnia-Lambton 
seems to be unaware of these remarks by an important player in the 
cable industry.
<P>
	Earlier, our colleague from Sarnia-Lambton also intimated that 
francophone and Acadian communities supported his bill. I have in 
my hand a letter signed by Jacques Michaud on June 20, 1996 
stating the very opposite. I would therefore be pleased to show 
these documents to our hon. colleague to correct his view of things.
<P>
	I would also like to mention what the Association des 
consommateurs du QuÃ©bec had to say.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I would like 
you to consider Standing Order 11, specifically section (2).
<P>
	We are hearing debates being brought forward from when this 
was before the House at third reading, such as references to letters 
written on June 30, 1996. I would like to remind members that we 
are not debating jurisdictional items, which have already been 
debated, but are in fact debating the amendment as proposed by the 
Senate and the amendment as proposed by the opposition party.
<P>
	He is referring to-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I understand the point made by the hon. 
member on the question of relevance. In a technical sense we often 
have a great deal of debate in the House which does not, at least to 
this Speaker's eyes and ears, seem to be terribly relevant. However, 
I am sure the hon. member for Portneuf will make his comments 
relevant to the amendment for the duration of his speech.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your perspicacity. You 
realize I was repeating what the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton 
just said about the amendment.
<P>
	Since certain claims were made about the position of certain 
associations or cable distributors, I assume he realizes that we must 
get back to the position taken by these people. We will be very 
close to what happened a few days ago, because we know that the 
bill before us has come back with an amendment from the other 
place.
<P>
	So what happened in the other place on April 8, 1997? As you 
know, the amendment proposes to reject the amendment from the 
other place. So what happened? I could not be more relevant.
<P>
	Well, the Association des consommateurs du QuÃ©bec-and I was 
about to say this when I was interrupted by a point of order-the 
association submitted a brief on the bill. In its brief, it rejected 
claims that the bill will be beneficial to Quebec consumers and to 
the French speaking public in Canada as a whole.
<P>
	Always with reference to what we received from the other place, 
I would like to repeat certain comments that were made in one of 
their committees, the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and 
Communications. The comments were made by the Hon. Francis 
Fox. You will recall that not so long ago, Mr. Fox was the Liberal 
Minister of Communications, and so you could hardly call him a 
member of the Bloc or a sovereignist. We can assume that these 
comments are representative of the beliefs of a staunch Liberal.
<P>
	He said that what is at stake is a long list of concerted efforts by 
successive Canadian and Quebec governments to provide for the 
development of a French audiovisual resource offering a wide 
variety of quality programming. Supporters of Bill C-216, and he 
did not doubt they were well intentioned-and I have no doubt 
about that either-were in fact undermining all these efforts to 
which they seem to be oblivious.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	I might also add that, in this case again, I am in agreement with 
what Mr. Fox said. He goes on to say, and this is particularly 
interesting, that the bill should be amended and he lists a number of 
reasons for doing so. First, this enactment flies in the face of all 
that has been done in the past 15 years. It does not have its place in 
the main section of the Broadcasting Act, which reflects a positive 
view of what our system should be. It changes the rules set after 
careful consideration by the designated authority: the CRTC. It 
changes the rules ex post facto between licensing and connection, 
ignoring the most basic rules of natural justice.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10104"> 10104 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Fox adds that nowhere in the bill is the francophone issue, 
be it in Quebec, New Brunswick or Manitoba, taken into account, 
making any plans for new French language services an impossible 
dream.
<P>
	He then refers to production and creation, saying that all the 
commitments made to the CRTC will disappear, whene CRTC 
decisions were contributing to consolidate state of the art 
technology in Montreal, for instance, production companies, which 
are of source of pride to the industry and which owe at least part of 
their success to this control: Coscient, CINAR, Les Productions La 
FÃªte, Softimage, Prima Film, SDA, Malofilm, and so on.
<P>
	We are talking about a independent producers market worth 
$350 million. When Mr. Fox makes such comments and the Bloc 
Quebecois takes the position it has taken, it is to defend the 
interests of Quebec and those of the Canadian francophone 
community. For our hon. colleague to feel that we are acting 
against the wishes of consumers, this can only be explained by his 
taking an anglophone view to the issue. If I were an anglophone 
from another province, like our colleague from 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville, I would probably jump up 
and say: ``Come on, let us pass this legislation''. But I would do so 
because I do not know what the situation of our francophone 
population really is with respect to cable distribution.
<P>
	I want our colleagues in this House to understand that the Bloc's 
position is not intended to affect anglophone consumers in any 
way. At the time, at second reading, I urged the hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton to amend his bill, so that it would only apply to 
cable services provided in English. Had he done so, I would have 
been pleased to support his bill. In fact, I have here with me the 
transcript of the comments I made at the time, on September 16, 
1996, but I will not go back to them, because I could be ruled out of 
order for quoting such antiquated excerpts.
<P>
	I will say it again. Had the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton 
had the foresight to restrict the scope of his bill to 
English-language cable services, there would be unanimity in this 
House. But the member tried, like many others before him, to get 
involved in Quebec's affairs. Of course, if we had achieved 
sovereignty, neither we nor the hon. member would have to deal 
with this issue. But Quebec is not yet a sovereign nation. It is still 
part of the Canadian federation and, on behalf of my fellow 
Quebecers and francophones from across Canada, I must say no to 
this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. StÃ©phan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to speak to Bill C-216, an act to amend the Broadcasting Act. 
When we speak of broadcasting, we speak of culture and of 
heritage and that led my colleague, the member for 
Richmond-Wolfe, to comment on bills such as this.
<P>
	This is probably one of the last times I will speak in the House 
during this Parliament, and I want to say that one of the things that 
have hurt my feelings the most is the way heritage and culture are 
dealt with here.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	Only this afternoon, I asked the Minister of Canadian Heritage if 
it was normal to require individuals applying for a job with 
Heritage Canada to hand in a 250 word essay in support of 
Canadian federalism. We know that 75 per cent of the young people 
from Quebec who usually apply to Heritage Canada voted yes 
during the last referendum. So it almost boils down to telling 
Quebec ``pay taxes, but you are not entitled to the services we can 
provide''.
<P>
	This reminds me of the recent refusal by the NFB's cultural 
production fund to finance Mr. Falardeau's film on the Patriotes. 
Sometimes, one almost has to apologize for being a Quebecer. It 
seems to me it is a fund to which Quebecers contribute financially. 
The vast majority of Quebecers would like to see Falardeau's film. 
I would like to see it myself. It is a part of my history and it is 
perfectly natural. But Ottawa says: ``You do not have the right to 
see such films''.
<P>
	The third thing bothering me about heritage and culture is that 
members opposite and beside voted not to revoke the conviction of 
Louis Riel. It seems to me it would have been so easy to vote in 
favour, at least as a symbolic gesture. But they did not. Then they 
wonder why Quebecers want to leave Canada. It seems obvious to 
me. I can tell you that, this year, I have really seen it all.
<P>
	That having been said, about Bill C-216 on broadcasting, the 
September 25, 1996 issue of <I>La Presse</I> said: ``The subscription act 
would jeopardize the French cable industry''. Essentially, what this 
bill wants to do is to prevent cable distributors from connecting 
some subscribers and then charging them until they say they do not 
want that service any longer.
<P>
	I have no problem with what is called the negative option billing. 
If I put myself in the shoes of my colleague opposite, the member 
for Sarnia-Lambton, I think I could congratulate him. I do so 
through the Speaker. I think he is defending the interests of his 
riding, except that this shows a problem in the system, that is, in 
order to solve a local problem, the government must draft Canadian 
legislation at the expense of other regions, including Quebec.
<P>
	Why do I say the member for Sarnia-Lambton has good 
intentions? Subscribers that are offered cable products must pay for 
them until they call their cable distributor to tell him they do not 
want them any longer. When all is said and done, this is not a bad 
approach by the cable companies. They impose certain channels on 
their subscriber and, if he does not want it, he must say he does not 
want to pay for it. So, basically, I find this is very good.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10105"> 10105 </A></B>
<P>
	However, this must be examined on a larger scale. We will also 
recall that this bill is the result of a revolt in the Vancouver area. 
So, when Rogers decided to change the service packages offered 
to its subscribers, they lost some channels that they liked or they 
had to pay more to have them back. Furthermore, the onus was 
on the subscribers to notify the cable distributor of their intention 
not to renew their subscription. This is called negative option 
billing.
<P>
	Again, this bill is full of good intentions but it could hurt 
Quebec. We are against this bill because it encroaches on Quebec's 
jurisdiction. How many times has it been said in this Parliament 
that this or that area comes under provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	But the federal government cannot help showing off and 
encroaching on Quebec's jurisdiction. On the subject of relations 
between businesses and consumers, section 92(13) of the British 
North America Act has this to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>92. In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make Laws in relation to 
Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to 
say,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(13) Property and Civil Rights in the Province;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This section of the Constitution applies to all businesses, even 
those under federal jurisdiction, such as broadcasting and 
telecommunications corporations. If the CRTC has the power to 
license broadcasters, the Government of Quebec has the power to 
legislate commercial relations between those institutions and 
consumers.
<P>
	One of the main reasons-I think this is rather obvious-is that 
it is an encroachment on Quebec's jurisdiction. They do not ask for 
our opinion, they just go ahead. It is a little bit like putting a 
bandage on a wound, when we know very well that it will only 
make things worse.
<P>
	The second reason I oppose this bill is that it prevents the 
creation of any new French-language broadcasting service. Under 
this bill, before offering a new non mandatory service to the basic 
or optional service customers, the cable distributor should first 
obtain consent from each of his subscribers. I can give an example.
<P>
	In Hull, if one customer says he does not want the news service 
recently offered by TVA or whatever, all the customers will be 
penalized. It seems to me that we must preserve some freedom of 
expression. Even if 50 per cent of the customers rejected such 
service, the other 50 per cent would still want it. The negative 
impact is not that strong.
<P>
	These different proposals deserve to be examined in the context 
that is unique to Quebec. Since each specialty channel targets a 
specific segment of the public, it is  hard to reach the critical mass 
that will ensure its viability. This limit takes on even greater 
proportions because, in a small market like Quebec, we could be 
penalized.
<P>
	Several industry experts have argued that, in Quebec, if RDI or 
the Canal Famille had not been provided to consumers free of 
charge for three months, it would have been impossible to offer 
those services. People who do not know a product are not inclined 
to buy it.
<P>
	What we are proposing is the procedure in effect in Quebec, that 
is, the introduction of new channels. I am very open to the idea of 
new television channels, new products. Offer them free of charge, 
just like a sample you would send consumers, and then let the 
consumers decide if they want them or not. This is just common 
sense.
<P>
	Let me substantiate this with a few opinions. Those are the views 
of people who appeared as witnesses before the Senate committee. 
The chairman of the CRTC said that this measure, apparently in 
favour of consumers, was actually not in their best interests but 
rather bad for them. A high rate of penetration is essential for the 
French language specialty channels to survive in Quebec and in the 
rest of Canada. Legislation to protect consumers from abuse is 
useful in a monopoly context, but we are no longer in such a 
context.
<P>
	A number of companies are competing to provide signals to 
consumers who benefit from that competition. The former Liberal 
Minister of Communications, Francis Fox, has outlined the 
measures taken since 1980 to protect French culture in Canada.
<P>

but his time is up. The hon. member for

<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-RiviÃ¨re-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when he made his speech earlier, the hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton suggested that the Bloc has no definite reason to 
move an amendment asking the Senate to reject its own 
amendment.
<P>
	I totally disagree with him. The Bloc has excellent reasons to do 
so, as we will show. Negative option billing is a fundamental 
problem which concerns a large number of Canadians, but which 
does not exist in Quebec. Why? Because it is up to the provinces to 
legislate in this area, and Quebec did what it had to do a long time 
ago. Quebec has legislation which effectively prohibits-

a disposition in the House to carry forward with a vote on the

asking for unanimous consent.

remarks.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Anjou-RiviÃ¨re-des-Prairies has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, many Canadians have been 
affected by negative option billing, but not in Quebec.
<P>
	Do I have two minutes left, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The period allowed for this debate 
expires at 7.27 pm. The hon. member has five minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> The Bloc has excellent reasons to move this 
motion today. Our motion rejects the Senate amendment because:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-in the opinion of this House, it does not bring the bill into conformity with the 
objectives of the Broadcasting Act with regard to French-language services.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We know that services must be provided in French exactly as 
they are provided in English; there are two official languages in 
Canada and they are equal everywhere.
<P>
	To settle the problem of negative option billing in Canada, which 
should be settled through provincial legislation, my hon. colleague 
is proposing a federal bill that would reduce French language 
television programming.
<P>
	My colleague should have asked the provincial legislatures to 
pass the regulations now before this House. This is an area under 
provincial jurisdiction. Thus, first, this is not the place to solve this 
problem and the bill has the disadvantage, when the provinces do 
not do their job, of allowing the federal government to encroach on 
provincial jurisdictions, which Quebec has always been opposed 
to.
<P>
	So, not only do we not solve a problem correctly by raising it in a 
legislative assembly that does not have proper jurisdiction, but 
once again Quebec is being had, and forced to fight these motions 
when the Constitution provides quite clearly that this comes under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, again I must 
remind members opposite of Standing Order 11(2) and that we are 
debating the amendment as proposed by the opposition and the 
amendment as put forward by the Senate, neither of which has 
anything to do with jurisdiction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member and I ask if my 
colleague can speak to the amendment before us with some 
relevance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> My remarks are very relevant, Mr. Speaker. We 
reject the amendment proposed by the Senate because it does not 
bring the bill into conformity with the objectives of the 
Broadcasting Act with regard to French language services.
<P>
	If motions have to be moved at every turn, we will see to it.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	What we have shown here is that the bill is strictly a measure 
against francophones in Canada and Quebec. If our colleague wants 
to introduce a bill to solve the problem, he should do so in the 
provincial legislatures and not here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> That is not wrong. What you are saying is 
totally unreasonable. Why then would we be rejecting an 
amendment moved by the Senate? It is because the Association des 
consommateurs du QuÃ©bec went to the Senate and said in its brief 
that the bill did not meet the objectives it was supposed to meet 
and, furthermore, that it would create a lot more problems than it 
would solve. In the bill, there was no mention of jurisdictional 
encroachment, and that is a second factor.
<P>
	I will read a few quotes from the Association des 
consommateurs' brief: ``We recognize that the objectives which led 
to the introduction of this bill may have been worthy and beneficial 
to English Canada, but we are convinced that the authors of the bill 
never examined or understood the disastrous consequences of this 
bill for francophones in our country''.
<P>
	I will conclude with this remark. I think our colleagues should 
reread this report which describes exactly why francophones-

consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and

	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GOVERNMENTCONTRACTS">GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know what has gotten into our colleagues opposite, whether it is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10107"> 10107 </A></B>
<P>
upcoming election making them nervous, both in the House and in 
committee, but I  would like to come back to the issue of federal 
government procurement, which has naturally interested the 
official opposition for a long time now.
<P>
	Like most members of the Standing Committee on Government 
Operations, we have heard many criticisms of government 
contracts, which have been described as unfair and ineffective. 
Despite the fine talk of this government since it came to office, 
things are pretty much the same as they were in the dark 
Conservative past. Of the $8.6 billion spent by this government in 
1994-95, 37 per cent was on sole source or non-competitive 
contracts. This is very troubling. The Liberal majority, like us, was 
left staring at the same sad figures.
<P>
	Therefore, in the present tendering system, it is important to 
make some very minor changes. It would not even take very much 
time. These changes were proposed by SMBs that appeared before 
the committee. To name but a few, first of all small and medium 
size businesses are complaining about lack of information on 
tenders. They have no way of knowing what the government wants 
to buy.
<P>
	They also feel that the tendering process has its shortcomings. 
They experience great difficulty in contacting the user of the 
product or service, or the true purchaser of goods and services. 
Reaching these people, or not reaching them, can make the 
difference between having the winning bid, or not.
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	The tendering process is an extremely complex one, which 
discourages the small and medium size businesses from bidding. 
They have trouble filling out the necessary forms. There is too 
much unnecessary red tape. As well, the small and medium size 
businesses fear, and rightly so, that contracts are awarded on the 
basis of nepotism and political favouritism, and favour 
Ottawa-based companies.
<P>
	I have made a list of the comments made by certain small and 
medium size businesses in my riding. This is what I heard: ``We are 
registered suppliers but we are never asked to tender our services'', 
``we have to know the buyer to be able to sell a product or a 
service''. That is par for the course in my riding, at CFB Bagotville. 
I also heard this: ``We are not informed of requirements or 
products'', ``we are not asked to bid, although our names are on the 
lists, although we are qualified''. Others told me: ``I tried my luck 
recently, but I have serious doubts about the integrity of the 
system''.
<P>
	There is another aspect I would like to discuss, since you are 
signalling that my time is up: Quebec's share of the procurement of 
goods and services. In 1994-95, there was a shortfall of 22,000 jobs 
in Quebec because the federal government did not give Quebec its 
fair share of the procurement of federal goods and services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services followed 
closely the work of the Standing Committee on Government 
Operations and welcomes its final report and recommendations on 
government contracting.
<P>
	The minister was pleased to note that the report recognizes much 
progress has been made by the government to improve the 
contracting process. At the same time, this government is 
committed to taking further steps to enhance the openness and 
accessibility of the federal procurement process for all Canadian 
businesses.
<P>
	We rely heavily on views expressed at the committee and on the 
committee's interim report while developing the request for 
proposals for the new electronic tendering system. This new 
system will be launched June 1, 1997. It is a joint 
federal-provincial initiative that will give Canadian firms cheaper, 
more user friendly, single window access to information on 
government business opportunities.
<P>
	With regard to the matter of sole source contracting, the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services is sensitive 
to the concerns of the committee. However, there are cases when 
the government can turn to only one supplier. Reasons for this 
include: extreme urgency; exclusive rights, such as copyright and 
patent; the need for systems to be compatible; or the need to obtain 
replacement parts from the original manufacturer. The competitive 
approach is always preferred.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works and Government Services has 
dramatically reduced its reliance on sole source contracting from 
47 per cent of the value of contracts in 1992-93 to 26 per cent 
today. One of the ways we have achieved this is through the use of 
advanced contract award notices or ACANs. When the department 
publishes an ACAN on the open bidding service and in the 
``Government Business Opportunities'' publication, any supplier 
that feels qualified to meet the requirement can challenge the sole 
source award. When the supplier is successful in demonstrating its 
capability, the requirement is completed.
<P>
	To be clear, when the non-competitive approach is used, it must 
be for valid and compelling reasons. Otherwise the requirement is 
tendered competitively.
<P>
	I hope that helps the hon. member.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TARIFFSONAGRICULTURALPRODUCTS">TARIFFS ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy ChrÃ©tien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
again this evening in adjournment proceedings to  find out from the 
Secretary of State for Agriculture how quickly the government will 
come to the defence of farm producers and especially Ontario and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10108"> 10108 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec producers of quotaed products. That is what we call rightly 
or wrongly supply management in the case of eggs, poultry and 
milk.
<P>
	I will take a moment to remind the House of the issue. In 
response to market globalization, Canada signed an agreement with 
the United States known as the FTA. A few years later, we 
expanded the agreement, which became NAFTA. Mexico joined 
the two original partners.
<P>
	In the fall of 1993-it was signed in the fall of 1993-GATT 
became the WTO. Within the context of the WTO and NAFTA, we 
set tariffs on imports of these various products to protect our 
agriculture, administered by supply management.
<P>
	The tariff percentages are huge. But they protect our domestic 
markets very well. In general terms, they vary from 180 to 360 per 
cent. We must reduce these tariffs by 30 per cent over the next six 
years. It must, on average, be not less than 15 per cent.
<P>
	However, the United States, in their usual heavy handed fashion, 
are making our life very hard. We had to argue before a NAFTA 
tribunal and we won five out of five. The head of the tribunal and 
the four judges supported without exception our tariffs on eggs, 
poultry and milk.
<P>
	However, the trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, swore 
up and down to the American farming community that she would 
fight to the end and win. Having lost under NAFTA, the U.S. is now 
turning to the WTO, and the reports I have are quite alarming, 
because there is serious question about this government's efforts to 
defend producers since we have seen how pliant it has been in the 
past before American demands.
<P>
	I offer as an example the situation with durum wheat and lumber. 
We give them too much, when we should not. The point of my 
remarks is to make the government aware and remind it that the 
Bloc Quebecois will be there in the next elections to be on the 
lookout and ensure that the Liberal government defends the rules 
for our farmers who depend on supply management.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for his question.
<P>
	We understand that some groups in the United States are 
disappointed with the NAFTA panel ruling and are continuing to 
press the United States government for further action. The U.S. has 
indicated that it remains committed to improving U.S. access to 
Canadian markets by doing everything possible consistent with the 
U.S. trade laws and obligations to pursue the tariff-free access.
<P>
	However, the panel's final report released on December 3 fully 
upheld Canada's position that the application of Canadian WTO 
tariff equivalents to the U.S. origin goods is fully consistent with 
our international trade obligations both under the NAFTA and the 
WTO. Consistent with the panel's findings, we see no basis for 
negotiations. Both sides should now focus on respecting their 
negotiated agreements.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	A key factor to our success before the NAFTA panel was the 
wholehearted support and participation of all stakeholders in all 
provinces in a truly team Canada effort. We remain committed to 
continue to work closely with Canadian stakeholders to defend our 
interests against any future challenges that we may face.
<P>
	It is important to understand that oftentimes political statements 
are made by those who would represent individual groups in the 
United States. We here in Canada have stood very solidly behind 
our negotiations, behind what we have done and we have been 
upheld by the panel. I do not believe at this point in time we have 
anything to worry about in this regard.

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week I asked the Minister for International Trade to confirm that he 
would not sign the multilateral agreement on investment being 
negotiated at the OECD unless the Canadian government got 
exemptions for job creation and other key sectors of great 
significance to Canada, such as sovereignty over cultural 
institutions and our natural resources.
<P>
	My question arose from the fact that the multilateral agreement 
on investment builds on NAFTA and, like NAFTA, has as its goal 
the creation of a level playing field for investors from outside 
Canada.
<P>
	I am pleased to hear that the government plans to set conditions 
on foreign investment because, as I understand the agreement, only 
those sectors that are explicitly excluded by a country are exempt 
from the national treatment which would be accorded foreign 
investors under the proposed agreement. Consequently, Canada 
must negotiate exemptions for certain sectors, among them job 
creation, control over our natural resources, water, which is of 
particular interest to western Canada, energy, and possibly 
investments that would affect our food security.
<P>
	NAFTA already restricts Canada's ability to require U.S. firms 
to meet employment targets as a precondition of investing in the 
country. If this restriction were extended to all OECD nations, the 
government would have great difficulty directing the investment 
process so as to promote job creation according to national goals.
<P>
	Furthermore, there is the risk of signing a trade and investment 
agreement that will not pay adequate  attention to environment 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10109"> 10109 </A></B>
<P>
related concerns. I urge an approach which ensures that sustainable 
development be at the centre of the decision making process both 
of national governments and international trade institutions.
<P>
	To conclude, I hope the minister can give assurance that Canada 
will not sign the agreement unless it retains control over job 
creation and unless Canada retains sovereignty over water, energy, 
forests and fisheries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Davenport 
commands respect and it is a privilege for me to respond to his 
concerns on behalf of the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	Negotiation of a multilateral agreement on investment at the 
OECD is still at an early stage. Although the original goal was to 
complete these negotiations by May, an extension to 1998 appears 
necessary. Canada has committed to nothing at this stage.
<P>
	The principal objective underlying the MAI is to improve 
investment protection for foreign investors. A core principle is 
equal treatment for foreign and domestic investors with 
exemptions for sensitive sectors such as cultural industries. As 
exists under the NAFTA and WTO agreements, countries will be 
allowed to file exemptions for certain measures they wish to 
maintain.
<P>
	Canada will not sign an MAI that inhibits Canada's ability to 
link the granting of investment incentives to job creation or to 
impose or maintain foreign ownership limits for privatized crown 
corporations.
<P>
	Canada will retain the ability to review large scale mergers and 
acquisitions involving Canadian companies, protect its cultural 
industries, protect the integrity of Canada's health care system, 
require job creation as a condition for receipt of investment 
incentives, require companies to carry out R and D activities in 
Canada as a condition of receipt of federal funds, and regulate 
crown corporations and monopolies.
<P>
	Through the MAI, Canadian investors will have greater access 
and protection in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, as 
well as other countries willing to adhere to MAI rules.
<P>
<B>(1945 )</B>
<P>
	Signatories to the treaty will adopt investment rules similar to 
those accepted by the NAFTA partners. Equally important in a 
world where countries fiercely compete to attract foreign 
investment, Canada's adherence to an MAI that protects Canadian 
interests will raise our attractiveness as an investment location.
<P>
	Foreign direct investment contributes significantly to Canada's 
growth, prosperity and employment creation. In the MAI 
negotiations Canada will be seeking disciplines on U.S. 
extraterritorial measures such as Helms-Burton, again for the 
benefit of Canadian investors.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on March 
17, I rose to ask the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food if he 
would be changing the Canada Transportation Act to provide some 
rebalancing in the relationship between shippers and railways by 
including a shipper's right to performance guarantees with 
appropriate penalties for poor rail performance.
<P>
	The question arose because of the abysmal performance that the 
railways have shown over the past winter, leaving almost 50 ships 
waiting in the harbour in Vancouver for which farmers, through the 
Canadian Wheat Board, were paying demurrage costs.
<P>
	The problem with the Canada Transportation Act is that there is 
no way for the shipper, in this case the farmer or the Canadian 
Wheat Board, to extract penalties from the railways.
<P>
	The act was fairly silent on this. The justice system has ruled that 
farmers are not shippers. It has also ruled on other occasions that 
the wheat board is not a shipper. Therefore it is virtually impossible 
for the people who are damaged by non-performance to arrange 
contracts with the offending party to make certain that performance 
does take place.
<P>
	I did not ask the question in a vacuum. I had done considerable 
research and found that the elevators in western Canada were full 
of the grades of grain required for the ships. The terminals which 
load the grain after it is received at the port from the railways, from 
the prairies, were empty and unable to fill the ships. It does not take 
a genius to decide that something had gone wrong with the rail 
system.
<P>
	I found that the rail system had performed very badly. It had 
made some attempts to correct the bad performance. It had brought 
in locomotives from the United States but for some reason it did 
not bring them up to performance standards for northern 
conditions. Apparently they were filled with summer fuel and they 
froze. They would not work. They were usually left out in the 
middle of somewhere which clogged up the system at the same 
time. While 50 to 100 cars were sitting full, there was no 
transportation to pull them. When the railway did start pulling 
them the transportation conked out. Taxis would have to go to 
rescue the crew. Other crews would come in to try to get the 
engines drained and working.
<P>
	The management on the railway's part was absolutely abysmal. 
It is not that it was not being well paid with the new CTA changes. 
It no longer is bound by the 20 per cent limit on the amount of 
money it can claim back for investment costs. Those are now 
estimated to be somewhere between 30 per cent and 40 per cent.
<P>
	Under the old act the railway was required to provide certain 
performance guarantees which the government was able to manage 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10110"> 10110 </A></B>
<P>
by the payout of something in the  order of $700 million annually. 
With that club over its head there was a lot better performance.
<P>
	Now that the club is gone, now that there is no possibility of 
signing performance guarantee contracts with the wheat board or 
the farmer, there has been no compliance and there has been no 
performance.
<P>
	While the railway can complain that the weather was bad, it is 
bad every January and February. The farmers manage to get their 
grain through that weather to prairie elevators. Why could the 
railway not run similar equipment with diesel fuel like the farmers 
do through the mountains?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member has a 
working knowledge of the Canada Transportation Act. He knows 
that it is the intention of the CTA to modernize and streamline rail 
regulation, promote the formation of shortline railways, ensure that 
shippers continue to have access to competitive transportation 
services. Unfortunately, and the hon. member hit on it, the act 
cannot predict or prevent bad weather.
<P>
	On the subject of the movement of grain, the government is 
concerned about the current situation. However, we want to focus 
on solutions, not finger pointing, to improve the efficiency of the 
entire system from the farm gate to the ship clearing the port.
<P>
	There have been dramatic improvements in the shipment of 
grain to the west coast in recent weeks. Rail car unloads during 
March averaged 4,400 cars per week as compared to under 4,000 
for the last week of February.
<P>
	Grain terminals are now operating seven days a week and the 
number of ships waiting on the west coast has been reduced to 13 
from 43 in mid-February.
<P>
	The situation is improving on the prairies and on the west coast. 
The backlog is being dealt with. It is not our intention to forget the 
problems encountered this winter, nor should we look backward to 
start assigning blame, as the hon. member would like us to do.
<P>
	Instead I suggest to the hon. member that we need to take the 
opportunity to look ahead to find ways to make long term 
improvements to the system. Finding solutions will require the 
co-operation of all parties concerned. Ministers responsible for 
transport or agriculture from the four western provinces have 
called an inquiry which is just one of the several options now being 
considered. Whatever the option ultimately chosen by the 
government, our main objective must be to ensure that we have the 
most efficient, effective and reliable grain transportation and 
handling system possible for our producers, shippers and 
customers.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at two o'clock.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.52 p.m.)
