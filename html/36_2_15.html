<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SECOND READING 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 27 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-9, an act to give effect to the Nisga'a Final 
Agreement, be now read a second time and referred to a committee, 
of the amendment and of the amendment to the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is obvious from the noise on the 
Liberal members' side of the House that Bill C-9 is not an 
important bill to them. 
Therefore they are not really concerned, as they have 
demonstrated on a number of occasions, about hearing the voices 
of the people of British Columbia, the province that will see the 
impact of this ill planned and ill conceived bill that is wrought 
with peril, should it proceed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking about Bill C-9, the Nisga'a final agreement act. 
Before I go any further I want to point out to anyone who is 
watching and any of the Liberal members who would care to listen 
what the government has done to the people of British Columbia, 
and indeed to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Could we please have some order in 
the House, Madam Speaker.  This is very disrespectful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order, please.  I ask 
members to listen out of courtesy to the hon. member who is now 
speaking to Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  For those who care to listen, it 
is important to point out before we get into the real debate on 
the Nisga'a in my presentation the Liberal government has brought 
in what is commonly known as debate closure or time allocation on 
Bill C-9, a government bill which involves some $1.3 billion of 
taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It involves several thousands of square kilometres in the 
province of British Columbia.  It involves establishing, for lack 
of better words, a self-governing nation in the province of 
British Columbia.  By the way it was the NDP Government of 
British Columbia that pushed through its legislation, totally 
ignored the call for referendum and more debate or even some form 
of serious public inclusion in the negotiations of the Nisga'a 
agreement.  That call was disregarded by the provincial 
Government of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, the 96% or 97% of the people of British Columbia, 
the taxpayers, the people who have lived there for generations 
and have voiced opposition to the Nisga'a agreement, were ignored 
by the Government of British Columbia and now they are being 
ignored by the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These elected representatives have a mandate to look at what is 
in the best interest of the country, be it national or regional, 
and to make decisions which reflect a concern that the result of 
this decision will not result in more conflict for years to come. 
Certainly their handling of Bill C-9, the Nisga'a agreement, has 
no representation of those factors in any respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only have they cut off debate on Bill C-9.  Not only have 
they clearly demonstrated that they are not willing to listen to 
the voices of the people of British Columbia.  That voice is 
represented in a huge way by the members of parliament in the 
Reform Party, the official opposition, of whom well over 20 come 
from the province of British Columbia.  They are not willing to 
listen to the hon. member for Skeena, the Reform Party's chief 
critic for Indian affairs.  By the way, the Nisga'a land claim 
area is in his riding.  There is probably no one in the House who

There is probably no one who has talked to more people in that 
area of the country than the member for Skeena.  There is no one 
who knows the implications and the effect that will be caused by 
the Nisga'a agreement better than the member for Skeena.

he has clearly given us through the information he has provided 
but have drawn from the people in our ridings.

the Nisga'a land claims area.  In case members think that by 
being a few hundred miles away the effect loses something, I 
point out that in the spring of this year we had a meeting on 
this very subject in my riding in Prince George, B.C.  In the 
neighbourhood of 500 people came out to discuss the Nisga'a 
agreement, so the concern is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party recognize that what has been the status 
quo for treating native concerns in the country over decades and 
generations simply has not worked.  Surely anyone in the House 
who took the time to look even once a year at the auditor 
general's report could clearly see in the report that the auditor 
general year after year after year cast a huge amount of 
criticism on the operation of the department of Indian affairs 
operations, the way natives are treated, the total lack of 
accountability for the funding, the billions upon billions of 
dollars of funding that have gone into native programs, and the 
zero accountability.  The signing a few years ago of this 
alternative funding agreement has simply made matters worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members would only have to look at the last six years of auditor 
general's reports to see exactly what I am talking about. The 
auditor general brought in his report and talked about the 
disaster that has occurred in the department of Indian affairs; 
the different ministers', once they have had a crack at it, 
running of that ministry; and the inherent disaster because they 
continue to follow a path of total confusion, to a point where 
there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of Indian affairs stands in the House and thanks 
the auditor general for pointing out these things to the 
government and assures us that they have taken note and will take 
steps to address them.  The same criticism comes back the next 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Bill C-9, the Nisga'a agreement, this is the 
worst possible thing the Liberals could do.  They have no idea of 
the impact this will have on not only British Columbia but on 
Canada as a whole.  They have no idea because they have refused 
for decades to strike out in a new direction to try a different 
approach than just the same old thing that has not worked.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NISGA'A FINAL AGREEMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK15">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-9, an 
act to give effect to the Nisga'a final agreement, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee, of the amendment and of 
the amendment to the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to talk a bit about democracy in the House of 
Commons and what is going on with the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make very clear that once this bill went into 
committee we expected the government to travel to British 
Columbia at the very least, but more important across the nation, 
to get input into whether or not people agree with the 
ramifications of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took my colleagues in this place all day Friday, all day 
today and basically even prior to that last Thursday to try to 
convince government members that the proper thing to do was to 
travel to the areas where the agreement affects people most. They 
did not want to travel.  Basically every committee of the House 
travels when bills are before them.   At times I wonder why they 
travel on bills that do not have major ramifications.  However 
this bill does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally we asked and expected that the committee would travel 
to Prince George.  We originally said Kamloops.  The government 
said Prince George because there would be less of a hassle there. 
Then there was Terrace, Vancouver, Victoria and Smithers.  The 
fight was over Smithers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members did not want to go to Smithers to talk about 
this matter because they felt undue pressure would be put on them 
by the concerns expressed by the people about the Nisga'a 
agreement.  They did not want it.  It happens that the people who 
have concerns in Smithers, by and large, are the Gitksan, other 
aboriginals in dispute who say that this is an overlapping 
agreement.  Government members do not want to hear that.  They 
just want the agreement to come to Ottawa and they will sign it, 
and away we all go.  We won a little battle on that one, which 
should not have taken place in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found this morning when we came into the House of Commons 
that they called time allocation, which limits the amount of time 
we get to speak.  The Reform Party, the only party that is in 
opposition to this matter, has had only four hours and 12 minutes 
to speak to a bill which costs Canadian taxpayers approximately 
$1.3 billion and has flaws in it.  They called time allocation so 
we will actually get a total of six hours to speak to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tells the people of British Columbia to go to hell.  That 
is what government members are saying.  They do not care about 
their views.  They do not care about overlapping claims.  They do 
not care about the amount of money being spent.  They just want 
to sign the agreement.  The Government of British Columbia, a 
government with 38% of the popular vote, is the most unpopular 
government in the history of British Columbia, the most current 
unpopular government in North America.  It is hard to believe 
the Liberals refuse to look at it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>An NDP member from the socialists over here says that will 
change but it will not change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the agreement itself I have another point. 
What is the role of any opposition party?  Is is not just the 
official opposition party, there are other parties, the NDP such 
as it is, the separatists, and Joe what's his name and the other 
fellows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supposed to be critiquing bills in the House of Commons. 
Has anybody read this or even questioned the amount of money, 
$1.3 billion?  We say it is that and others say it is $500 
million.  Others say it is $1 billion.  Even that issue alone is 
worthy of opposition by all opposition parties.  That is what 
this House is about, yet time and again the other three parties 
in this place support the government. Why?  It is because they 
are not looking at the content of the agreement.  They are 
basically looking at whether or not they might be able to salvage 
a few votes out of the people who might agree with the bill. 
That is what this is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We just voted with you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Yes, both of you.  It is amazing. 
Members of the NDP are trying to justify their position.  They 
vote more often with the government than not.  It is the same 
with the other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a point about seven Liberal members of parliament 
from British Columbia.  Why is it that they voted for time 
allocation and why is that they are voting for this bill when 
after we polled their ridings we found that there is no support 
for it? They come to the House having been told by the government 
whip that they will vote for the Nisga'a agreement whether they 
like it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sent polls to 534,000 homes in British Columbia and 10,000 
returned.  That is an extensive poll.  It showed that in British 
Columbia 91.5% want their MP to vote against Nisga'a.  It is not 
60% or 70% which is high, it is 91.5%.  Does that viewpoint carry 
forward here through members of parliament at voting time?  No. 
We just saw the opposite from the Liberals and three NDP from 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the Liberal ridings targeted, opposition to Nisga'a among 
respondents ranges from 81.5% to 94% in those ridings alone. Yet 
those members stood and voted for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oftentimes we hear members say they do not know much about the 
agreement.  My colleague from Skeena knows more about aboriginal 
agreements than anybody else in the House. Our caucus makes a 
point of studying the agreements.  There is one point alone as to 
why the opposition parties should have been in opposition to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 217, paragraphs 3 and 4 of chapter 16 read:

these treaties will come into our homes and into other areas of

<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, we have repeatedly heard the arguments of our esteemed 
colleagues in the Reform Party.  They have repeatedly been shown 
that their allegations run totally contrary to fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a 
final agreement represents an important page in Canadian 
history.  That is why I want to take this opportunity to set out 
a number of these facts, once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, I must point out that the Nisga'a treaty was 
negotiated within the context of the Constitution of Canada. 
All of the provisions set out in the treaty may be realized 
within the scope of the Constitution as it stands. 
I hope members will allow me to elaborate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, recognizes and 
confirms the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the 
aboriginal peoples of Canada.  However, we do not know 
specifically the nature and scope of these rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unsettled claims involving ancestral rights, have, in many 
instances, slowed economic development.   Accordingly, in an 
effort to define ancestral rights, a number of issues have been 
put before Canadian courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned a lot about ancestral rights through the 
decisions of these courts, but this new knowledge was not enough 
to resolve once and for all the disputes arising from the claims 
that are still being made in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the most recent cases relating to the existence and nature of 
ancestral rights in British Columbia, the Supreme Court of 
Canada concluded that, if there were no treaties, provincial 
lands could be subject to ancestral rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand—and this is more important still—the courts 
declared that ancestral rights are group and region specific. 
In other words, when the courts examine questions relating to 
ancestral rights, they do so according to the specific facts 
presented to them, and in relation to the specific group 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, if certain general principles arise out of the 
current case law, we still cannot count on court decisions to 
reach conclusions on ancestral rights which could be applicable 
to all regions of Canada or of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can take up to ten years for a decision to be brought down in 
certain cases relating to ancestral rights.  What is more, a 
specific decision might not settle issues applicable to other 
regions.  Let us imagine then, how long it will take and how 
costly it will be to settle the issues that are still 
outstanding in British Columbia.  It is inconceivable.  We also 
need to keep in mind that, in certain cases, general acceptance 
of the outcome is not likely to be easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the courts, the present government agrees that the best way 
of settling outstanding issues relating to ancestral rights is 
to take the negotiation route rather than the legal one. 
Litigation involves conflict and can damage good relations, 
while negotiation involves reaching mutually acceptable 
solutions and establishing better relations.  This is the 
approach favoured by Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, treaties are the traditional method of negotiating 
solutions to outstanding ancestral rights issues.  As with 
existing ancestral rights, treaty rights are also recognized and 
confirmed under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaties covering most of Canada were signed prior to 1927. 
However, this process was never carried through to completion in 
British Columbia.  The Nisga'a treaty is the first modern treaty 
to be signed in British Columbia. 
It definitively resolves the outstanding ancestral claims of the 
Nisga'a.  These concern primarily rights to land and resources, 
and the right to self-government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the Hon. Ronald A. Irwin published a guide entitled 
“The Government of Canada's Approach to Implementation of the 
Inherent Right and the Negotiation of Aboriginal 
Self-Government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach signals an evolution in the long established 
thinking on this issue.  For decades, Canadians looked for ways 
of reconciling the prior presence of aboriginals in this country 
with the sovereignty of the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long before the arrival of the Europeans, aboriginals lived in 
this country and managed their own affairs.  In British 
Columbia, and in other regions, the First Nations had well 
established social systems and forms of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, existing 
ancestral rights are recognized and confirmed.  The federal 
policy on the inherent right of self-government adopted in 1995 
recognized that the rights provided for under section 35 
included the right to self-government.  This shows that Canada is 
prepared to negotiate concrete and attainable agreements in this 
regard and to include them in treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are differing opinions on the scope of inherent rights, as 
there are on other ancestral rights.  The present government, 
however, has chosen to resolve self-government issues by 
negotiating concrete agreements according to the Canadian 
constitutional and legal framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I would like to give a brief explanation of how a 
negotiated agreement works in the current constitutional context 
in relation to ancestral rights to self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution Act of 1867 determines the legislative 
jurisdictions of the federal and provincial governments.  These 
are defined primarily in sections 91 and 92 of that Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scope of ancestral right to self-government may vary 
according to the specific situation of the first nations 
community involved.  Consequently, under section 35, the 
ancestral right to self-government must be considered on a 
case-by-case basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happened with the Nisga'a.  The  Nisga'a final 
agreement does not merely define all rights relating to lands 
and resources to be enjoyed by the Nisga'a according to section 
35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, it also identifies the rights 
to self-government they will have under that same section.  The 
Nisga'a treaty makes no change to the federal and provincial 
areas of jurisdiction defined in sections 91 and 92 of the 
Constitution Act of 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to some, the Nisga'a final agreement created, de 
facto, a third level of government and this would require a 
constitutional amendment.  The significance of a third level of 
government is not clear; what is clear is that the Nisga'a final 
agreement works well within the present constitutional context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of rights under section 35 of our Constitution 
does not mean that these rights are inflexible, as some critics 
would have us believe.  Although protected under section 35, 
they are not absolute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of Supreme Court of Canada decisions have confirmed 
that governments still exercise a general power, but have to 
justify any interference into ancestral or treaty rights.  The 
Nisga'a government will evidently carry out its activities 
within the Canadian constitutional context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has consulted the final agreement knows that the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms will apply to the 
Nisga'a government.  This means that Nisga'a laws will be 
subject to the charter, like the entire decision making process 
of the Nisga'a government with respect to such things as 
licensing or the sale of lands.  The Nisga'a government will 
have to comply with the charter like any other government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of repeating what has been said over and over again, 
federal and provincial laws, including the Criminal Code, will 
apply on Nisga'a land once the treaty takes effect.  Although in 
certain isolated instances, Nisga'a law may prevail, the Nisga'a 
will have no exclusive legislative powers. Theirs will be a 
parallel legislative model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a laws will take precedence in issues of internal 
management exclusive to the Nisga'a only.  They may be, for 
example, laws concerning their culture, their language or the 
management of their land or their assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all other instances, federal and provincial legislation will 
take precedence, otherwise the Nisga'a laws will have to meet 
federal or provincial standards or exceed them to be 
enforceable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be clear to all those carefully examining the Nisga'a 
treaty that it falls perfectly within the scope of the Canadian 
Constitution.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps those who claim that the Nisga'a final agreement is 
unenforceable without an amendment to the Constitution of Canada 
simply do not understand the importance of negotiating the 
reconciliation of ancestral rights within the Canadian 
federation. Do these people perhaps want to be able to impose 
arbitrary solutions unilaterally?  For our part, we are in 
favour of negotiation and reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know where unilateral decisions might lead.  History is 
full of examples of solutions imposed by one group on another. 
Where feasible, lasting agreements are more easily reached when 
they have the support of all those to whom they apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, the Nisga'a final agreement is a solution that has 
been negotiated within the Canadian confederation.  It 
reconciles the rights of the Nisga'a with the sovereign rights 
of the government, as well as respecting the interests of other 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge all members to put behind them the erroneous and 
petty arguments advanced by Reform Party members and to support 
the implementation of the necessary legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In ratifying this treaty and giving it effect through this bill, 
we will be welcoming the Nisga'a into the Canadian family, while 
at the same time respecting their dignity and giving them the 
means to protect their culture and their language.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Since the government member speaks authoritatively on behalf of the 
government, I wonder whether we could have unanimous consent to 
pose some questions to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent to ask the member questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am most pleased to have the opportunity to speak today to the 
historic Nisga'a final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament from British Columbia, my constituents 
will certainly be impacted in a number of ways on the issue which 
we are now debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already seen emotional and antagonistic reactions to the 
Nisga'a final agreement.  I encourage all members in this place 
to please study the agreement in a calm and rational manner and 
to please spend the time and the effort to properly review the 
debate and the process of the legislation.  It really does us no 
good to become involved in heated exchanges and it certainly does 
our constituents no good if we do not properly review what is now 
before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation appears to be the start of what may become a 
series of agreements with a number of our aboriginal citizens of 
this country.  As a precedent we must ensure that what is being 
done is right for all Canadians, both the Nisga'a who will be 
most acutely affected by this agreement, and the non-Nisga'a who 
will also be influenced in a number of ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note the title of what we are currently being asked to study. 
It is called the Nisga'a final agreement.  That bothers me.  It 
does not have to be the final agreement.  With all due respect, 
changes can be made and have to be made.  This is an agreement 
between the Nisga'a people, the province of British Columbia and 
the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  The 
agreement is binding on the parties, but the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development only recommends agreement to 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to each and every member of parliament now to decide 
whether to accept this agreement, whether the agreement requires 
change or whether the agreement is unacceptable and must be 
rejected.  As it states within the agreement, the former minister 
only warranted her participation to the extent of her authority. 
She signed the agreement as the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development.  She had no more authority than that.  I 
realize that she may well have had cabinet support for her 
actions, but she definitely was not acting on behalf of this 
place.  That is why we are now tasked with review, comment and a 
vote.  We should not and cannot shirk this responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the title, Nisga'a final agreement, troubles me.  We 
are not being presented with a fait accompli.  This legislation 
is just like any legislation that comes before us.  We must do 
our job and ensure that it is correct and proper.  We must ensure 
that it accomplishes our aims in the fairest and most effective 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated above, the agreement is between the Nisga'a, the 
province of B.C. and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.  Those parties need only ratify any changes or 
amendments made by this place.  In fact, the agreement makes 
specific reference to amendments as decided by the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now express the concerns I have with specific parts of 
this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will hear a lot about paragraph 13 of chapter 2 
concerning the general provisions of this agreement.  It states: 
<UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I hesitate to interrupt my hon. colleague.  I know that 
he has many important points to make.  However, I would note that 
there is not one Liberal member in the House and on an important 
debate like this I think that is very improper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a provision recognizing the supremacy of the charter of 
rights and freedoms, but it is clear that paragraph 13 states 
that federal and provincial laws take second place to this 
agreement.  The agreement must prevail whenever there is an 
inconsistency or conflict between the agreement and our 
provincial or federal laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to illustrate some of my concern over this 
provision which retains primacy of the law to this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to chapter 12 of the agreement.  Chapter 
12 covers the administration of justice.  I note that in 
paragraph 1 the Nisga'a government has the power to provide a 
Nisga'a police service.  That is no problem as this provision has 
been permitted on a number of our aboriginal lands across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is with paragraph 4(a)(iii), which provides that the 
Nisga'a people will be permitted to create laws regarding the use 
of force by members of the Nisga'a police service as long as 
those laws are in substantial conformity with provincial 
legislation.  I am concerned that the agreement is limited to 
require the Nisga'a laws only to conform to provincial 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is substantial and effective law on the use of force by 
police officers within the Criminal Code of Canada.  There 
appears to be no requirement for the Nisga'a to conform to the 
federal law in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This surely cannot be the intent of the government.  Section 25 
of the criminal code provides our peace officers with statutory 
authority in the use of force while administering and enforcing 
the law.  This section protects peace officers across Canada, but 
there is a question as to whether it will protect the members of 
the Nisga'a police service should the Nisga'a government go that 
route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I wonder whether the Nisga'a people will be at risk 
if we do not have the same legislated rules for the utilization 
of force by Nisga'a law enforcement personnel.  Will members of 
the Nisga'a police service have broader or greater powers in 
regard to the use of force than is presently provided for within 
the criminal code? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole section on the administration of justice makes me 
wonder whether the federal position was asleep at the switch in 
the drafting of the agreement.  As I have just stated, there is 
no mention of ensuring that federal law with respect to the use 
of force is maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There also does not appear to be any provision to recognize 
federal police officers who in the course of their duties are 
required to operate within Nisga'a lands.  Paragraph 15 of this 
section recognizes the possibility of a “provincial or other 
police constable” performing duties within the Nisga'a lands, 
but there is no mention of federal police officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When reading the agreement in its totality it often refers to 
provincial and municipal police services, but it does not mention 
our federal law enforcement personnel.  The agreement recognizes 
and accepts the need for these provincial and municipal police 
services to, at times, effect duties and responsibilities on 
Nisga'a lands.  I can readily see the issuance of subpoenas, 
arrest warrants and investigative inquiry causing outside police 
officers to enter Nisga'a territory, but I can also see the 
necessity of federal officers, such as the RCMP, to do the same. 
I can immediately think of the RCMP Prime Minister's protection 
detail operating within the Nisga'a lands should the Prime 
Minister ever decide to visit that area of this country.  I can 
think of RCMP officers involved in drug investigations and 
customs and immigration work, perhaps organized crime and white 
collar crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the agreement seems to be silent in this 
regard.  Is the federal government abdicating its responsibility 
for federal policing under this agreement?  If not, why is the 
federal aspect of policing not specifically included within the 
agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation cries out for review, debate and amendment. 
Initial indications from the government lead us to conclude that 
changes are just not to be considered.  The Nisga'a people 
themselves will be disadvantaged by this Liberal government 
policy.  The people of British Columbia will be negatively 
affected.  The precedence of this legislation will in turn affect 
other native bands and citizens of other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the government to reflect on what they are 
doing.  Too often members on the opposite side of this place take 
their marching orders from the Prime Minister's office and 
cabinet and fail to stop inappropriate and ill-advised 
legislation from passing into law.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I conducted a poll in my constituency of Surrey North. 
Admittedly, it was not a scientific poll.  However, 83% of the 
respondents were opposed to the current form of the Nisga'a 
agreement.  A full 77% were completely opposed to the process 
which was employed to get the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the government, in its wisdom, which I question, will 
send the aboriginal affairs committee to British Columbia.  I 
think the government will have its eyes opened because the 
numbers which I have quoted are reflective of the feeling in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for providing me the opportunity to express 
these concerns over Bill C-9, the Nisga'a final agreement act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am glad to have the opportunity today to debate Bill C-9, the 
Nisga'a implementation treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am really disappointed about is the way the whole thing 
has developed.  We have seen again the government's misuse of 
government power.  Time allocation was imposed on the Nisga'a 
bill at second reading, which was something like the 58th time 
the Liberal government has used time allocation or cut off debate 
since 1993.  It took Brian Mulroney's administration nine years 
to get to that figure, but the Liberal government only took six. 
This is a terrible affront to Canadian citizens.  This is a very 
historic moment in our time.  I believe historians will look back 
at this time and ask “What were they thinking about?  Why was 
debate cut off?  Why did they not discuss the very wide 
implications of what they were doing?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the Nisga'a itself, there has been a considerable 
change in the attitude of the courts since the NDP government of 
B.C. was elected in 1991.  There are no treaties in effect in 
B.C. and there never were.  Therefore, there is some need to do 
that.  There has been a tremendous change in the B.C. NDP 
government.  It has essentially acquiesced.  It did not put up a 
fight in regard to these land claims.  It let the supreme court 
make decisions without any argument on the con side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I say that it will be an historic debate and an 
historic time for Canada is partly because of what the Indian 
affairs minister said a few days ago, which is on the minds of 
most Canadians.  It will be on the minds of more Canadians as 
they learn more about this treaty and where we are going.  What 
the Indian affairs minister said was that what we are doing with 
the Delgamuukw, the Nisga'a and the east coast lobster fishery is 
leading to a claim on all the resources of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see it in my riding of Peace River where the former minister 
of Indian affairs and northern development came up with a 
memorandum of understanding about opening up all of Treaty 8. 
One hundred years after Treaty 8 was signed, the minister has now 
reached an agreement, which says in essence that we are going to 
open it up, we are going to give them more money and more land. 
It would be a done deal were it not for the Alberta government 
saying “Just a minute.  There are a lot of claims on that land 
through resource companies, forestry, oil and gas interests. 
This is public land”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What effect has it had in my riding?  It has had the serious 
effect of really depressing investment.  Who would invest when 
they do not know who the owner will be and what the terms will be 
as a result of that ownership? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister let the cat out of the bag, but essentially most 
people need to be very clearly aware that this is just a first 
step in a very long journey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us deal with that for a moment.  When our ancestors came to 
this country I do not think there was anyone who did not 
recognize that the aboriginal people were the first people here. 
That is an absolute given.  Did they have the use of the land? 
Of course they did.  They had the use of the land before we got 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are now about 300,000 aboriginal people living on reserve. 
There are about 400,000 living off reserve.  Because things have 
gone off the rails so badly on the reserves they do not even 
participate. 
They are living in other areas off reserve, mostly in cities such 
as Winnipeg.  That leaves over 29 million other Canadians who 
have to be dealt with.  We have to come to some kind of 
accommodation here.  It does not mean that we will give away the 
entire country to 300,000 on reserve and 400,000 off reserve.  Is 
that the answer?  Of course not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of us came from other areas.  My ancestors came from 
Scotland, a land that was taken away by the English. Does that 
mean I should put in a land claim there?  Some of my ancestors 
came from France, from the religious wars, from the Protestant 
side that were driven out of France.  I am going to France for a 
vacation this year.  Do I look up to see where my ancestors came 
from and put in a land claim there?  Of course not.  We simply 
have to treat people on the basis of equality in the country; 
equal opportunity for everybody involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say from the outset what the Reform Party is saying 
about how we should be treating aboriginal people in Canada.  It 
is all on the basis of equality.  We want a fresh start for all 
aboriginal people.  I have several reserves in my riding.  I see 
the poverty there.  I also see rich people who hire expert 
advisers from the United States paying them $150,000 a year for 
advice on medical facilities and on all kinds of things to try to 
start businesses on reserves.  They are leeches living off the 
system.  Other people are living in abject poverty on those 
reserves.  Is that what we want to perpetuate?  I do not think 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want aboriginal people to be full and equal partners in 
Canadian society.  We want aboriginal women to be full and equal 
partners both on and off reserve.  We want aboriginal families to 
be protected by the same laws that govern non-aboriginal 
families.  We want aboriginal people to have the same rights and 
protections that every Canadian enjoys.  We want to eliminate the 
discriminatory barriers that widen the gulf between aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal people.  I see this every day in my riding. We 
want to ensure a bright future for all Canadians regardless of 
the colour of their skins.  What we are looking for is equality 
for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will the treaty accommodate that?  I would suggest that it 
fails miserably.  People will become aware, just as they did with 
the Charlottetown accord, the great debate on the constitution, 
and with the Meech Lake accord before that, of the contents of 
the Nisga'a treaty and the wider implications for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal member from southwestern Ontario found out firsthand 
what happens when there is a land claim in an area.  The Indian 
affairs department buys up farmland and pays exorbitant prices in 
order to accumulate enough land for a reserve.  The local farmers 
cannot compete for the land.  That is the kind of awareness I am 
talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest at some point there will be a land claim made for the 
Bay Street area of Toronto.  Members should try to put some 
numbers together on what that will cost because the aboriginal 
people were there first and had the use of that land.  Is that 
going to be the criteria by which we judge this?  The finance 
department should come up with an estimate of what the cost might 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to read a <I>Globe and Mail</I> article that was in 
the paper this weekend.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, the Finance Department produced a $200 billion 
figure—the worst-case scenario if Canada's native communities 
getting everything they are currently claiming in litigation and 
land claims.  It is a staggering amount, more than what Ottawa 
collects each year on taxes and revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even so, the figure is incomplete: 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incomplete because it does not include what the government 
has already spent on settlements.  It does not account for the 
several thousand lawsuits that have yet to be filed.  It does not 
account for the additional 57 major land claims, including the 
bulk of the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even while we are debating the Nisga'a treaty, other groups 
living in the area are saying “No, that is partly our land. You 
have taken some of our land in this Nisga'a agreement and we have 
a claim in on that land as well”.  We see there are overlapping 
claims.  If we read our history books we know that the earlier 
explorers who came out here knew that the land changed hands. 
There were wars from time time.  It was in one group's possession 
at a certain time and in another group's possession at another 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the cost?  It is $200 billion and counting.  We have a 
government that is completely out of control.  I want to talk 
about the local implications for my riding and for the national 
scene.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about a good friend of mine, Archie Calliou, who 
is now deceased.  He was an Indian who never took a treaty.  I 
met with him many times and he would say to me “Charlie, the 
sooner this system is beaten down and every aboriginal person on 
earth has equality of status the same as the rest us the 
better”.  He would tell me that his father told him to never 
take a treaty because he would be on welfare the rest of his 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He married a woman from the Sucker Creek Band at High Prairie 
who had been on treaty.  She got away from the treaty and began 
working in a hospital in the Beaverlodge area.  They owned a 
home, had a holiday trailer and took vacations.  He worked for 
years and years on substance abuse on reserves.  He said that if 
the system was allowed to continue, 100 years from now it would 
be exactly the same.  There would be a tremendous waste of the 
potential of aboriginal people.  He said that the reserve system 
had to be broken down.  There are no property rights on reserve 
and no incentive for somebody who really wants to get ahead 
because it is communal property.  He said that the sooner we did 
away with the system the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am voting against the bill.  I think every Canadian should be 
aware of the serious implications it poses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill C-9, an act to 
give effect to the Nisga'a final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to assure the Nisga'a people, other great native 
groups and all my constituents that my interest in the bill is to 
address the need for a better future for the Nisga'a people and 
all those under the Indian Act, in relationship with each other 
and other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that after years of negotiation within a framework 
dictated by the Indian Act but controlled by the federal 
government and Indian affairs, most Nisga'a leaders feel that 
they have no alternative but this agreement.  British Columbians 
have been wrongly told that it is this deal or nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Official opposition MPs are not similarly tainted.  We question 
and oppose because we do not believe the agreement is, in the 
long term perspective, in the best interests of the Nisga'a 
people, the long range interests of aboriginals throughout B.C., 
or in the interests of the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can do much better than this.  It is first the Nisga'a of 
future generations who will have to live with the practical 
consequences of the so-called final agreement.  All British 
Columbians are being experimented with by an Ottawa mentality on 
aboriginal affairs.  We should therefore pay particular attention 
in the House to what B.C. MPs say on the matter.  Members of the 
House should also recognize what all British Columbians already 
know; that the NDP government in B.C. has manipulated much of the 
agreement process.  It has never had a clear, specific political 
mandate from British Columbians to deliver such an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this day, much is before the courts as the deal drives a 
wedge between aboriginal groups, between British Columbians and 
will likely disturb much across the country.  Ontario is going to 
feel the effect of the agreement or arrangement in the future. 
It can only be hoped that by the time the debate is over 
Canadians from all parts of Canada will understand that the bill 
and the agreement to which it gives effect have ramifications for 
them.  It is my estimation that many of those impacts are 
negative.  In respect of bringing the country together, it is 
negative, from the aspect of the principle of equality and equity 
for all, where we need to strive to realize better than before, 
one people, one land, one land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, the agreement goes in the other direction.  The fiscal 
impacts will be negative.  The resource management impacts will 
be negative, like those of the Marshall case.  The impact on 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal relations will be negative.  This 
is not simply a bill or an agreement affecting a particular group 
of aboriginal people in British Columbia.  The nature and style 
of it will copied throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents seem to be telling me that the deal appears to 
divide people and perpetuate discord and likely will not 
significantly help local social life, to give a hand up out of 
subsistence levels.  My community has goodwill and deeply desires 
aboriginal success so that we all together fulfil talent and 
achieve more cultural respect, autonomy and self-reliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I clearly speak for my community when I say that the voters want 
native peoples to succeed, maintain identity and have all of what 
the aboriginal forefathers have desired for their people.  Sadly, 
the agreement has the potential to bring more sorrow and 
disappointment when the grand objectives and overstated 
government media displays are not realized by aboriginal young 
people who have had expectations raised.  When they are dashed 
they will seek someone to blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are major defects in the deal.  The first is that the 
current approach grants special legal, social and economic status 
to people based on membership in a minority group. 
That is what “Status Indian” means and is defined in law.  It 
arises out of a confusion between “rights” and “benefits” and 
how best to move forward.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second defect is that it provides for undemocratic and 
unaccountable governments.  The current approach to aboriginal 
political development fails to demand or to ensure genuine fiscal 
and democratic accountability from local aboriginal governments 
to their own people.  Therefore, aboriginal people do not have 
the most elementary grip on their own governmental institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a grassroots movement starting among ordinary 
aboriginals demanding fiscal and democratic accountability from 
their leaders and from Indian affairs.  In frustration, they come 
to our party when they are shut out by their local leadership and 
when their pleas are ignored by the federal government.  So far 
their voice has been largely unheeded.  I see no clear reflection 
of their concerns in the agreement we are being asked to quickly 
pass this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third big defect in the approach that is perpetuated in the 
bill is that it is based largely on socialist economics, 
collective ownership of land and resources, government ownership 
of land and resources and excessive regulation with little market 
discipline.  There is an absence on reserves of the most basic of 
property rights and contract rights.  There is a near absence of 
free markets in housing, labour and capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where has all this worn out traditional approach led?  Where has 
special status and socialist economics led?  It has not led to 
prosperity for aboriginal people.  It has yielded poverty, misery 
and despair for too many.  It has also led to a series of court 
cases that are further poisoning relations between aboriginals 
and non-aboriginals.  In addition, the billions of dollars that 
Canadians commit to Indian affairs every year is now leading to 
an additional contingent liability to all Canadians of up to a 
possible $200 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now specifically when one reads the terms of the agreement, too 
many times there appears words to the effect that details will be 
worked out in the future without guarantees of democratic process 
or accountability to an electorate.  Specifically, the Nisga'a 
alone will be able to determine who is on their list of being 
considered a Nisga'a person and who is not.  They will make their 
own laws about who can legally be a Nisga'a. 
Canada has very limited power about who is or is not a Canadian, 
and certainly the provinces and municipalities do not control 
entry and entitlement to vote or to receive benefits through 
control of citizenship membership status.  The specific term 
“Nisga'a citizenship” is used in the agreement, and they will 
be able to banish or de-list or refuse to admit anyone they 
desire according to the rules they have yet to pass within their 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a conflict in this area between federal and 
provincial law, it clearly states on page 167, sections 39 and 40 
that Nisga'a law is paramount.  This is a sweeping powerful tool 
for any government to control dissidents or political opposition 
from entitlements and participation.  It is a concern when the 
use of banishment and other disenfranchised tools is well known in 
current aboriginal practice in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just one example of the well-meaning but fatally flawed 
construction of this misguided agreement.  I do not believe in 
special legal status for anyone, and most British Columbians 
never have.  It is our view to Quebec or any group.  This is a 
formula for social disaster.  It is different from targeted 
social benefits that can help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world is changing rapidly and if Canadians are to be able to 
continue to provide food and shelter for themselves in the global 
village, they will have to adapt to changing ways to participate 
in the world economy.  The key is full participation in the 
world, not isolation from it.  However, in order to participate 
and thereby benefit, one needs to purchase an admittance ticket. 
Stamped on that ticket of admittance to obtain sustenance in the 
new economy are the words “skills” and “education”.  That 
ticket must be purchased through individual effort and merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement does little to anticipate the future of the world 
and how all of us need to be ready to participate and earn the 
basic necessities of life.  We all must “earn” our way by 
creating wealth that comes from being in a market.  Indeed, most 
of the employment on Nisga'a lands will either be with the 
Nisga'a government or with the Nisga'a government owned 
corporations. The isolated socialist collective of Nisga'a will 
likely remain dependent if their members do not move to 
participate in the global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the specific terms will help average individuals 
within the territory of the agreement.  It is hard to see how 
lasting goodwill will come when so many basic principles of 
democracy, economics and accountability have been violated. 
However, form often follows function and when wrong ideas and 
false assumptions narrow the range of choices, the shape of 
destiny will always be sadly lacking, if not bringing deep 
sorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate to negotiate and the manner in which it was done by 
B.C. politicians is discredited.  The arrangement will not bring 
about lasting reconciliation.  It certainly is not final in the 
ordinary sense of paying.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Much is to be worked out in the future and it is written in 
vague terms.  Fairness is very elusive in the package.  Its 
emphasis is to separate rather than bring together. Legal 
equality principles have been abandoned.  In such experiments we 
must support equality, democracy, accountability, the coupling of 
entitlement with responsibility, tolerance of diversity and 
mobility rights so they are intertwined in settlements with 
Canadian natives. It is of grave importance when we assess the 
proposal for embedding by treaty small closed societies in a 
large, complex and open society that itself is struggling to keep 
its place in a changing world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although my speaking time has run out, Canadians will be dealing 
with this agreement for generations to come and the social 
disturbance and shattered dreams will likely perpetuate for a 
long time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to address Bill C-9, the 
Nisga'a final agreement act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my colleagues have addressed the serious concerns shared 
by British Columbians regarding the Nisga'a bill, but the bottom 
line is that this is deeply flawed legislation.  The agreement 
was negotiated in secret. It was negotiated by a provincial 
government that has faced numerous scandals and which now has the 
lowest approval rating of any elected government in Canada.  The 
Liberals may want to look at the process in B.C. and see what it 
did to that government because it is going to do the same thing 
to the government here. Those who try to force legislation down 
the throats of people who do not want it will pay the political 
price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no active consultation in B.C.  The member for 
Vancouver Island North went into this in great detail. He was our 
party's aboriginal affairs critic in the last parliament.  In his 
speech last week, he went through in detail how the consultation 
process simply did not work.  He said that it was smoke and 
mirrors, that there was no listening, no involvement. Because of 
that, British Columbians want to have a referendum. They want 
their chance to have a say.  They do not feel the provincial 
government or the federal government are listening to the people 
of B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the answer from the government side?  That it is too 
complex of an issue, that a referendum simply is not going to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are not that stupid.  They understand the ramifications. 
They see the inequality.  They see the holes in this agreement. 
Quite frankly they do not trust many of their politicians.  They 
want to have a say. There is nothing wrong with that.  There have 
been referendums before that have worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A referendum that worked was the Charlottetown accord. Canadians 
voted down ethnic based legislation.  They said no. They voted it 
down no more strongly than in British Columbia. They simply said 
that equality was the way to go and this government is going in 
exactly the opposite direction. That is typical of this 
government.  It has bungled legislation over the last six years 
we have been in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public service pension bill was considered a few months ago. 
The government is raiding the pension fund for $30 billion. 
Remember it is the government that promised to scrap, abolish and 
kill the GST but we still have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways that is the Trudeau solution.   It goes back that 
far.  Trudeau's Canada did not include the west.  He had no 
understanding of the west.  He did not comprehend anything beyond 
upper and lower Canada, Ontario and Quebec.  That was his Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's vision is very much Trudeau's vision.  It is 
insisting on forcing controversial treaties on British 
Columbians.  Bear in mind that this is the first treaty of many 
that are going to spread right across the country. There is no 
support.  There is no support in British Columbia for this type 
of legislation. It is not surprising that the Trudeau legacy 
simply does not work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at Alberta, the province next door to B.C.  The national 
energy program throttled Alberta's booming oil economy.  What is 
different in this case?  Nothing, other than it is British 
Columbia's turn to get the Liberal boot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This heavy-handed government is not going to allow forthright 
debate in the House.  A few hours ago the government moved time 
allocation on the bill which means that the opposition parties 
and even the government cannot fully debate it. The government 
said no, that is enough.  At the end of today there will be a 
vote and it will be a done deal.  It will be over. Is that 
democracy?  Is that where we are going with the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to broaden the picture. The Nisga'a agreement is 
the tip of the iceberg. The government and the courts, 
particularly with the charter, are taking us in a direction I do 
not believe Canadians want to go.  They are taking us away from 
equality into areas where special groups have special rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a deal and the Marshall decision on the east coast 
have given us an inkling of where this country is going.  We are 
going to be in turmoil over the next number of years.  I can 
refer to the Musqueam reserve in Vancouver where the leases on 
land with $150,000 and $200,000 homes are being taken over.  A 
lease is now $25,000 a year and people are being thrown out of 
their houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Marshall decision simply said that Donald Marshall had the 
right to fish for eels.  It has expanded to lobster.  We now see 
it affecting snow crab.  The Sable Island oil deal is now on hold 
because the natives want to be heard.  Logging in British 
Columbia and New Brunswick is being undertaken against the will 
of the provincial governments.  That is where this treaty is 
taking us.  It points out the lack of vision on the part of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the vision?  Where did the government see this 
parliament and this country going?  Are we headed to become a 
group of separate societies?  That is where the government is 
taking us. Natives will have separate rights.  We have seen what 
is happening in Quebec.  Is that the vision?  Is that where we 
are going?  It is a shotgun approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we want to have equality?  Do we want to have a country where 
the laws are the same?  Despite one's ancestry, despite one's 
race, despite one's sex, whatever, the laws are the same.  I 
thought that was what Canada was all about but apparently not 
because the government and the courts are taking us in a 
completely different direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a deal is the tip of the iceberg.  The provincial NDP 
and the federal Liberals are ramming this agreement through 
against the will particularly of British Columbians. We can see 
where this is taking us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Marshall decision is another example of where we are going 
or perhaps where we do not want to go.  The newspapers have shown 
many cases where natives have decided that the natural resources 
are theirs.  It started with Donald Marshall and the ability to 
fish for eels and it has now gone to oil and gas.  My colleague 
from northern Alberta was talking about what is happening with 
the oil industry.  There are other natural resources, such as 
timber.  Where is it going to stop?  Where are we going? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court has brought down decisions which are against 
the will of this parliament.  Parliament has laid down what is 
supposed to be the rules for the laws of this land.  Yet the 
judges have decided that they know better and are circumventing 
the will of parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the bigger issue of what we are talking about with 
Nisga'a.   It is the bigger issue of where Canadians should be 
looking to the future, of where they want the government to go. 
What is the vision of the government?  Where do we want the 
country to end up? Do we want a group of separate fiefdoms or do 
we want equality and togetherness?  I believe we want to be 
united with one set of rules for all in one country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I suppose I should open by offering my eternal heartfelt 
thanks to the governing party for giving me the privilege of 
speaking in the House because it has the opinion that nobody is 
allowed to speak unless the Prime Minister and his minions 
believe it is okay. Here I am, one of the chosen few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people might want to know why I am speaking on behalf of 
British Columbia because clearly I am not a British Columbian. 
However, the ramifications of the Nisga'a treaty extend far 
beyond the boundaries of British Columbia.  This is not simply a 
provincial issue.  It is a national issue.  It is about the 
balkanization of Canada.  It is about legislated race based 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has often been said that insanity is doing the same thing 
over and over again, always with the expectation of a different 
and better result.  What we see here is the extension of more 
than 130 years of policies by successive Canadian governments 
toward the native people based on racial segregation, paternalism 
and legislated inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaties, the reserve system and the department of Indian 
affairs have conspired to keep Indians out of the social and 
economic mainstream, but only for their own good of course.  The 
Nisga'a treaty will not only perpetuate the evils of separate 
status, it will accentuate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One does not have to be terribly observant to see what has 
happened to Indian people under the system which the government 
likes so well and now wishes to extend to the Nisga'a, a group of 
people which up until now has not had a treaty and has been 
relatively independent.  Are they entitled to a land settlement? 
I would say yes, of course, but not in the shopworn treaty 
concept of collectivism.  Let each adult have a piece of land to 
manage, dwell upon, sell or whatever as he or she sees fit, just 
as European settlers could do with their homesteads or land 
grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, where, when and how did we introduce this concept of 
communal land ownership, which is socialism, into the Canadian 
mainstream? Give the people substantial seed money to establish 
themselves, but give it to individuals, not to some unaccountable 
collective, and let that be the end of it.  End this cycle of 
dependency. Throw away the bureaucratic urge to subordinate 
Indian people to bureaucrats or to an Indian elite.  Stop 
treating them like dependent children and financing the venture 
by stripping the hides off the backs of other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a long memory.  It is rather instructive that a former 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, the current 
Prime Minister, had some progressive ideas on the subject.  He 
introduced a white paper that recognized the evils of the old 
collectivism with these ringing words: “To be an Indian is to 
lack power, the power to act as owner of your own lands, the 
power to spend your own money and, too often, the power to change 
your own condition.  To be an Indian must be to be free, free to 
develop Indian cultures in an environment of legal, social and 
economic equality with other Canadians”. Note the word equality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The white paper proposed to repeal the Indian Act and wind down 
the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development within 
five years.  It went on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government believes that its policies must lead to the full 
free and non-discriminatory participation of Indian people in 
Canadian society. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paper recommended that dependency be replaced by equal 
status, opportunity and responsibility.  The paper stated “it is 
no longer acceptable that Indian people should be outside and 
apart”.  Those are fine words, but we all know what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Prime Minister continued for a year or so to speak 
eloquently in favour of an end to the determination of status by 
race.  Even that great collectivist, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 
jumped on to the equality bandwagon with these words: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the road of different status has led to a blind alley of 
deprivation and frustration.  This road...cannot lead 
to...equality.  The government will offer another road that would 
gradually lead away from different status to full social, 
economic and political participation in Canadian life.  This is 
the choice. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  The chiefs and the Indian affairs bureaucrats 
fought like tigers to retain their powers and privileges.  The 
dilatory Trudeau lost interest and the minister, now the Prime 
Minister, made a strategic retreat.  Had he followed through with 
his ideas, racial integration would be an established fact and 
many of the horrors of life on reserves and in urban Indian 
ghettos would be behind us.  It is useless to dwell on what might 
have been, but surely we can try to move forward instead of 
reinforcing the same old mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to put aside historical divisions and bind up the 
wounds of injustice from another century.  The fact that some of 
our European ancestors felt free to treat Indians as an 
inconvenient life form to be displaced in the name of progress 
does not make me guilty of anything.  I did not participate.  Nor 
is the fact that some Indians—not the Nisga'a by the way—killed 
some white people, who pressed them beyond endurance, a matter of 
consequence for the 21st century.  This is the new age.  We 
cannot continue to wear the scars of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My ancestors arrived in North America hundreds of years ago. 
Does that entitle me to more rights and privileges than first or 
second generation Canadians?  I think not.  The ancestors of the 
Nisga'a reached this continent thousands of years ago.  Does that 
mean they should be treated differently from the rest of us?  I 
submit that it does not.  We must remember that the Nisga'a do 
not have an existing treaty to set them apart from other 
Canadians, but the government is deliberately proposing to create 
a different status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislated entrenchment of social and political differences 
along racial lines in the United States was known as segregation. 
A handful of determined activists created a few ripples of 
dissent which ultimately grew to a great wave that washed away an 
evil system.  Even South Africa, which I have been told modelled 
its racially based homelands on Canada's Indian reserves, now 
recognizes that all people are equal before the law regardless of 
skin pigmentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may say that when our society becomes more mature we will 
be able to remove inequalities from the proposed arrangements 
with the Nisga'a.  Sadly the more noxious and discriminatory 
clauses of the treaty will be immune to correction by a future 
government because they will be constitutionally entrenched.  If 
we proceed with this folly, future generations including the 
Nisga'a will justly curse us and curse this parliament for the 
race based balkanization of our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate.  Like the previous speaker I 
am not from the province of British Columbia.  I do not represent 
that riding, but that is where any similarities end with regard 
to my support for this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty was signed in August 1998 and has been ratified by 
the Nisga'a people and by a free vote in the B.C. legislature. 
Ratification by parliament is the final step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement sets aside approximately 2,000 
square kilometres of the Nass River valley as the Nisga'a land 
and establishes a Nisga'a central government with jurisdiction 
similar to that of other local governments.  Two thousand square 
kilometres sounds like a significant piece of property and it is. 
I note that it is about 25% of the size of the constituency I 
have the privilege of representing in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the final agreement the Nisga'a will own surface and 
subsurface resources on Nisga'a lands and have a share of the 
salmon stocks in the Nass area wildlife harvest.  The final 
agreement also provides the Nisga'a financial transfer of some 
$190 million payable over 15 years as well as $21.5 million in 
other financial benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the payment will support economic growth in the 
region and help to break the cycle of dependency that has endured 
over the centuries.  In addition, the final agreement specifies 
that personal tax exemptions for Nisga'a citizens will be phased 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
and other provincial and federal laws of general application 
shall continue to apply.  These provisions and others are 
comprehensibly set out in the final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty provides for a total of $253 million in one time 
payments to the Nisga'a over 15 years from this government.  The 
B.C. government has contributed land valued at slightly in excess 
of $100 million, another $37.5 million in forgone forestry 
revenue and $40 million for paving highways in the area.  In 
addition, a fiscal financing agreement is in place to transfer 
money to the Nisga'a for social services.  Ninety per cent of 
that is already being transferred so we are talking about a 10% 
increase in that area.  Finally a known source revenue agreement 
details how the Nisga'a government revenue will phase in to 
reduce federal transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize, as I said a few moments ago, that over time 
the Nisga'a will become much more self-sufficient than is the 
case at the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to surface and subsurface resources such as logging, 
fishing and minerals, they will be managed by the Nisga'a in 
accordance with provincial laws and regulations.  Unlike other 
treaties the Nisga'a final agreement does not require the Nisga'a 
to surrender their rights under the constitution.  That is 
important because it was recommended by the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal People and this treaty has been agreed to without such 
a clause.  It is therefore seen as a way to coexist rather than a 
means to have aboriginals surrender their rights in exchange for 
a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the level of public and legislative debate on 
the final agreement has been unprecedented in the province of 
British Columbia.  It included hundreds of public meetings, 
province-wide public hearings by an all-party committee of the 
legislature, and media coverage across the province.  It is 
noteworthy that in the legislature there were more than 120 hours 
of debate, which I am told is more debate than on any other piece 
of legislation in B.C. history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Certainly not here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Not here.  I agree with the hon. 
member, and that is why we voted against the time allocation 
motion earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the treaty.  We are proud that our New Democratic 
Party provincial colleagues in British Columbia have taken this 
historic step.  The Nisga'a treaty was 20 years in the making and 
its signing is an important step toward stability and certainty 
for all British Columbians. 
We are hopeful that the post-treaty era will bring greater 
stability and more opportunity for economic development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will answer some of the questions I have been sitting here 
listening to for some time.  We hear repeatedly that it is a race 
based treaty.  We do not accept that.  We think it is based on 
justice, fairness and stability.  We think this treaty may make 
laws so that non-aboriginal people may indeed become Nisga'a 
citizens.  That is provided for in the agreement.  It also 
protects the rights of non-Nisga'a people living on Nisga'a 
lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also hear calls that a referendum should be held on this 
matter in the province of British Columbia.  There has been a 
great deal of consultation on the bill.  There is neither the 
requirement nor the need for such a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by noting that the treaty transfer of ownership of 
the land collectively to the Nisga'a people allows for the 
protection of property rights.  It allows for various ways for 
people to privately own the land they live on.  It specifically 
says that individuals cannot get less in terms of property rights 
than they already have.  They can only get more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we have heard that the treaty denies all rights to 
Nisga'a women.  There is absolutely no basis for this claim. 
Women's rights are protected by the charter of rights and 
freedoms which applies to Nisga'a law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the treaty.  We are proud that our NDP colleagues in 
B.C. have taken this historic step to rectify wrongs of the past. 
We note that it is 20 years in the making and that it is an 
important step toward stability and certainty.  We want to help 
aboriginal people not only in British Columbia but across the 
country build stronger, more self-reliant communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of

other and to other Canadians.  We understand that this agreement 
is all the Nisga'a people could hope to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After years and years of negotiation within a framework dictated 
by the Indian Act but controlled by the federal government and

them it is this or nothing.  We understand that.  I am sad they 
are forced to support it.

people and the long range interest of the people of Canada.  We 
are proud that we are the only party in the House opposing the 
passage of the bill through the House.  We want all Canadians, 
particularly our aboriginal brothers and sisters, to know and

Nisga'a final agreement does not meet these requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took years and this agreement was created behind closed 
doors.  The B.C. government denied the people of B.C. a 
referendum on whether to accept the treaty.  There was very 
little public input.  The B.C. government passed the agreement 
through the provincial legislature by invoking closure on the 
debate before it was completed.  The NDP government of B.C. which 
supported this agreement is on its way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that the federal Liberal government will pass the 
agreement through this House regardless of how much debate is 
allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be many injustices caused by this precedent setting 
treaty.  Our future generations will not forgive this Liberal 
government for passing this treaty.  It is the same Liberal 
government that refuses to listen to the critical reports of the 
auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we differ from the government?  Unlike the Liberals, we 
believe that many of the impacts of the Nisga'a agreement will be 
negative.  The fiscal impacts will be negative.  The resource 
management impacts will be negative, like those of the Marshall 
case, and the impact on aboriginal and non-aboriginal relations 
will be negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underlying approach to aboriginal government and economic 
development ratified by this bill is absolutely wrong.  The 
underlying principles are defective and will not lead to the 
desired ends.  An entirely different approach to aboriginal 
self-government and economic development based on better 
principles is desperately needed for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is proud of the system.  No one is proud of the approach 
or the track record of the government in terms of tackling 
poverty, illness, violence, family breakdown, shortened lifespans 
and the despair that has been caused for thousands of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment, mortality, illiteracy, suicide and 
incarceration rates on reserve among aboriginal people, 
particularly young people, are the consequences of the legacy of 
130 years of Liberal and Tory governments.  Of course there are 
some exceptions.  Some bands have a high standard of living. Some 
individuals have made progress.  However, these are the 
exceptions rather than the rule.  They have succeeded in spite of 
the system, not because of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three problems with the Liberal approach to aboriginal 
agreements.  The big problem is the special status granted to 
aboriginals based on race; not based on need, but based on race. 
That is what status Indian means and it is defined in statute. 
That status denies aboriginals many of the political and economic 
tools available to other Canadians, from responsible 
self-government to all the tools of the marketplace and private 
enterprise for economic development.  That status builds barriers 
rather than bridges between aboriginals and the rest of the 
Canadian community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second defect of the current approach is that it provides 
for undemocratic and unaccountable governments.  The current 
approach to aboriginal political development fails to demand or 
to provide genuine fiscal and democratic accountability from 
local aboriginal governments.  The federal government has failed 
to provide responsible government for aboriginals in either the 
fiscal or democratic sense at the local level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third problem is aboriginal economic development.  The 
Liberals and the Tories have based this on socialist economics, 
collective ownership of land and resources, government ownership 
of land and resources, and excessive regulation of every economic 
activity on Nisga'a land.

based on ethnicity.  It perpetuates access to resources based on 
race.  These elements will lead to nothing but conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mistakes the government is making today will produce effects 
in the years to come.  Future generations will not forgive.  The 
help our aboriginal people need should be based on their needs 
and wants, not race.  We have recognized those needs.  Based on 
those needs we have to help our aboriginal brothers and sisters. 
Many years down the road we will face dire consequences if we 
treat people based on race and not need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on behalf of the people of 
Selkirk—Interlake.  I intend to address this issue in a limited 
way due to the complexity of the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty has arrived in this parliament to be debated 
and passed, or not passed, as members of the House decide.  I 
would like to say from the outset that I am against the signing 
of this treaty for the simple reason that contained within this 
lengthy document is a large question as to whether the Parliament 
of Canada has supremacy over this land and over the laws we all 
live by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the supremacy of parliament has been supplanted to the 
degree that is possible within this agreement I think bodes 
poorly for the future of our country and our children; not only 
Canadian children of non-Nisga'a descent, but also Nisga'a 
children and future generations of Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Selkirk—Interlake and I support the signing of 
treaties and support negotiations with aboriginal people.  Within 
my riding we have firsthand experience with this process in that 
we have lands being added to our reserves through purchases and 
additions to the land holdings of aboriginal people.  We 
certainly see that there is nothing wrong with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem, which I will restate briefly, is the question of 
who is ultimately supreme with regard to the functioning of 
society within geographic boundaries.  I believe it is purported 
by the government that the boundaries of Canada are still from 
the Queen Charlotte Islands, past Victoria, right through to 
Newfoundland and past Prince Edward Island.  This contiguous land 
mass is meant to be governed by this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a problem with whether Canadians really understand and 
know what is going on, whether they understand and know what is 
happening to their country. 
They may well, on full information, be willing to say that it is 
a great treaty and it is just what they are looking for.  The 
problem is, that has not been done to this point in time.  The 
chance for Canadians to really understand was contained within 
this debate in the House.  What do I see in regard to 
parliamentary democracy, the give and take of debate, the 
understanding of the issue?  I see limited participation on the 
part of Liberal members.  I see limited opportunity for us to 
question ministers, parliamentary secretaries and other members 
of the government who speak on this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have to know absolutely, to understand and to buy into 
it in order to have the future that I perceive we should have in 
Canada, a future of peace and harmony.  If Canadians do not fully 
understand this treaty, all of a sudden they will wake up to see 
disputes between aboriginal tribes over borders.  We have already 
seen it in the case of Nunavut.  Islands off the shore of Quebec 
have been claimed by both the Quebec Cree and by Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we be setting up future problems in our country?  We 
see neighbouring aboriginal first nations to the Nisga'a already 
disputing portions of the land that will fall under Nisga'a 
control.  It does not seem sensible to proceed with this treaty, 
vote it into law and then proceed to negotiate and fight through 
the courts for many years.  Animosity will build among native 
people, as well as among native and white people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at background material which has been provided by 
the government.  It says that the Nisga'a government may make 
laws in respect of a number of areas, including citizenship, 
language and culture.  It also indicates that the criminal code 
will form part of the criminal law of the Nisga'a land.  The 
problem arises in the administration of justice.  I will deal 
with this from the concept of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime operates solely on accumulating wealth.  When it 
comes to combating organized crime, the only way it can be done 
effectively is by having an overriding supreme parliament and a 
national police force that is capable of and has the authority to 
conduct investigations on every square inch of Canadian land and 
into every corporation subject to Canadian law.  In this case 
there will be, in effect, Nisga'a crown corporations set up to do 
Nisga'a business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this administration of justice the Nisga'a will have their 
own police service.  What is in the Nisga'a document that will 
guarantee that the RCMP will be able to conduct investigations 
without having the Nisga'a government saying no, the RCMP will 
not investigate a given corporation, or it will not investigate a 
certain set of individuals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who says it is entirely unlikely that the Nisga'a people 
will be involved in organized crime does not know very much about 
organized crime.  Organized crime is prevalent throughout this 
country.  Every society, every race, every background has 
individuals who are involved.  It is paramount that the Canadian 
government, through parliament, have the authority and the 
ability to conduct investigations into organized crime on Nisga'a 
land and within Nisga'a corporations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporations and businesses are the very means by which money is 
laundered in this organized crime scheme. Those in organized 
crime find it very difficult to launder their money so they can 
account for it without its being recognized as having come from 
the sale of drugs or other illegitimate means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If parliament is not supreme, the Nisga'a government can stop or 
thwart investigations.  This has been done in the United States 
where there are all kinds of problems between jurisdictions. 
Organized crime could flourish through the corporations which are 
set up to administer the collective on the Nisga'a land. This is 
a great concern and relates back to the supremacy of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In South Dakota there was a similar set-up with regard to the 
supremacy of the state legislature as opposed to aboriginal land. 
There is a farm with 859,000 hogs on a piece of land in South 
Dakota.  It is and will continue to be an environmental disaster. 
Where is the supremacy of the federal government of the United 
States over that kind of environmental damage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am against this treaty because the material has not been put 
out to Canadians.  It is not 100% clear on jurisdiction.  It is 
not 100% clear on who is in charge.  As a result, I see nothing 
but problems for Canada and the Nisga'a people in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would 
like to speak about one of the most important features of the 
Nisga'a final agreement, one that goes to the very fabric of 
democracy and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot of talk in recent years and recent days 
about the need for governments to be accountable.  It is one of 
those things which distinguishes a democratic system from other 
political systems and it is one of the central features of the 
Nisga'a government as proposed in this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Political, legal and financial accountability is expected of 
governments in Canada.  Accordingly they must answer to the 
Canadian public with regard to the decisions they make, the funds 
they receive and the money they spend.  If governments are not 
perceived as being sufficiently accountable, they are replaced at 
election time.  That is the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ensure accountable governments by demanding transparent and 
fair mechanisms, for example, clear and open processes of 
lawmaking such as we practise in this House.  Decision making 
must be established, as well as procedures for appeal or review 
of those laws or decisions. The Nisga'a final agreement does 
exactly that.  Accountability is one of the central themes of the 
treaty chapters on Nisga'a government, fiscal relations, the 
Nisga'a constitution and the fiscal financing agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a government will be a democratic government that is 
accountable to its citizens.  The Nisga'a constitution will be 
one of the key elements ensuring accountability of the Nisga'a 
government.  This treaty requires that elections be held at least 
every five years. The Nisga'a constitution sets out a system of 
financial administration and conflict of interest rules that are 
comparable to standards generally accepted for governments in 
Canada.  All adult Nisga'a can vote and hold office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final agreement requires that the Nisga'a constitution set 
out procedures to enact laws and a means to challenge the 
validity of those laws.  In addition, the treaty provides for a 
strong majority in order to amend the Nisga'a constitution. 
Initially there is a requirement that an amendment be approved by 
at least 70% of Nisga'a citizens voting in a referendum.  This is 
a high threshold but fittingly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people themselves recognize the importance of 
accountability.  Indeed their constitution requires each office 
holder to take an oath of office to provide good effective and 
accountable government for the Nisga'a nation as a whole. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all.  The final agreement stipulates a requirement 
for appropriate procedures to appeal or review administrative 
decisions of Nisga'a public institutions, to ensure the coming 
into force and publication of Nisga'a laws, and for the 
establishment of a public registry of laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a citizens who are not residents of Nisga'a lands as 
outlined in the agreement, and there are some 200, can vote for 
the Nisga'a lisims government and can participate in the three 
urban locals:  Vancouver, Terrace and Prince Rupert.  Each of 
these locals is represented by a seat in the central Nisga'a 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a government also has an obligation to consult with 
residents of Nisga'a lands who are not Nisga'a citizens about 
decisions that directly affect them. The final agreement 
specifies that the Nisga'a government must give full and fair 
consideration to the views expressed during that consultation. 
The Supreme Court of British Columbia has authority for appeals 
and challenges to administrative decisions of Nisga'a government 
brought by anyone whether or not they are Nisga'a citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Residents of Nisga'a lands who are not Nisga'a citizens can also 
vote and run for election in public institutions that have 
elected members, such as school boards and health boards, and 
when the activities of those institutions significantly and 
directly affect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach taken in the Nisga'a final agreement also ensures 
that the Nisga'a government is financially accountable to its 
members and to the governments from whom some of their funding is 
derived. Under the fiscal financing agreement the Nisga'a 
government is required to prepare and provide audited accounts 
and financial statements for the Government of Canada and for the 
Government of British Columbia.  Those accounts and statements 
must meet generally accepted accounting standards in Canada. 
Where funding is provided by the federal government, the reports 
can be reviewed by the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the provisions contained in the final agreement, the 
accountability of the Nisga'a government at the local level will 
improve the current situation existing under the Indian Act.  The 
Nisga'a treaty will establish a direct relationship between the 
Nisga'a government and its citizens.  This is as it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Nisga'a treaty there is no lack of clarity.  The 
Nisga'a government is clearly responsible for the decisions it 
makes and the lines of accountability are set out in the treaty 
for all to see and know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is democracy at its best.  The Nisga'a government will be 
responsible for the well-being of all Nisga'a citizens and all 
those who reside on Nisga'a lands.  Accordingly it will be 
accountable to them and to the government that provides some of 
the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the charter of rights and freedoms will 
apply to Nisga'a government and to all laws on Nisga'a lands. 
That means that all laws and decisions the Nisga'a government 
makes will be subject to review to ensure they are consistent 
with the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 24 of the Nisga'a final agreement, anyone who 
feels his or her rights and freedoms as guaranteed by the charter 
have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of law to 
obtain a just remedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years the Nisga'a people have been coming together 
every year to scrutinize the actions and decisions of their 
leaders.  At these annual meetings the Nisga'a people have 
discussed matters that are important to them and have made 
resolutions to provide direction to their leaders.  They have 
held leadership elections regularly.  They have been negotiating 
with the Government of Canada for 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over those years the Nisga'a leaders have earned the respect of 
their people.  That is not to say that like other governments 
they did not have those within their membership who opposed them; 
however, the Nisga'a electors know that their leaders are 
accountable and that they have a regular opportunity to elect a 
new government if the current one does not live up to their 
expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the Nisga'a people are well accustomed to having 
accountable leaders.  The treaty confirms this fact and places 
the responsibility for governing the Nisga'a people in their own 
hands, a responsibility they are more than ready to take on. 
It is time that they did just that.

Nisga'a people.  It is time to move forward.  The Nisga'a people 
have clearly identified their wish to do so by virtue of their 
support for the treaty.  The Nisga'a people and their leaders 
have never lost sight of their goals.  They have always attempted 
to fulfil them for the benefit of future Nisga'a generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here they are today on the brink of achieving this longstanding 
vision.  Let us not stand in their way now.  Let us ratify the 
treaty which will return to the Nisga'a the responsibility and 
accountability for looking after their own affairs.  It is the 
right thing to do.

ongoing process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I got one this morning from a millwright working at a forestry 
plant in Saskatchewan.  His gross earnings for the pay period 
were $2,000.  He got a paycheque for $1,000 because payroll 
taxes, income taxes and other deductions ate up all the rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This worker does not want a bill from the finance minister for 
$47 billion.  He wants tax relief now.  Why will the finance 
minister not give it to him? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

billion in the 1999 budget, the three combined, over the next

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most interesting of all is that in Fresh Start, the

</I></B></P><P align=left>If this worker got this profound tax break from the finance 
minister, I ask him again how it is that when he looks at his 
bottom line he got gross earnings of $2,000, his paycheque was 
for $1,000, and the rest was eaten up by taxes.  How does the 
Prime Minister explain that situation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

maybe it is time the finance minister got off easy street and 
came down to main street to see how people are living under his

they find out his top priority is not tax relief at all but a $47 
billion spending spree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the finance minister not cancel his $47 billion

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have made it very clear.  There is no such plan.  All 
that has happened is that the public service from the three 
central agencies has costed a series of propositions, a number of 
which will never see the light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Costing proposals is a basic responsibility of the public

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET SURPLUSES 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
eve of the Minister of Finance's economic update, it is as well 
to remember that, in the last throne speech, the government 
clearly indicated its intention to create new programs in areas 
such as education, the family and childhood, health, home care 
and pharmacare, all of them provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than spending its time fuelling arguments over 
jurisdiction, should this government's priority not be to 
restore transfer payments to the provinces so that they can 
assume their responsibilities toward the public? 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
is largely what it did last year, when it not only increased 
health transfers to the provinces, to the tune of $11.5 billion 
over five years, but also worked very closely with the provinces 
in connection with the national child benefit, research and 
development, and a whole host of areas very important to 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
actual fact, the government did not invest $11.5 billion.  What 
it did was cut $32.5 billion instead of $44 billion.  We are 
talking cuts, not handouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the government's budgetary policies not be focusing on 
acting with the necessary fairness towards workers who pay EI 
premiums and allowing them to receive the benefits to which they 
are entitled rather than forcing them to help shoulder the cost 
of new programs that come under provincial jurisdiction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one 
of the things the government announced in the throne speech was 
a substantial increase in parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, as far as the provinces are concerned, it has 
not only increased health transfers, but it has also increased 
equalization payments substantially, including a $1.4 billion 
cheque to the Province of Quebec. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in allowing the employment insurance surplus 
to grow by $7 billion yearly and rolling that amount into the 
overall government surplus, the Minister of Finance is providing 
himself with some manoeuvering room at the expense of the middle 
class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Finance admit that, by using the surplus in 
the employment insurance fund to fund new government programs, 
he is making middle class Canadians and the unemployed foot the 
bill for the bulk of these new expenditures? 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
middle class Canadians are the ones who benefit when employment 
insurance contributions are reduced.  Middle class Canadians are 
the ones who benefit when parental leave is extended.  Middle 
class Canadians are the ones who benefit when transfer payments 
for health or the national child benefit are increased. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is also middle class Canadians who make up 
27% of the population but carry 50% of the tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of announcing new expenditures in areas that fall under 
the jurisdiction of others, ought the Minister of Finance not to 
announce some tax exemption measures that target the middle 
income taxpayer specifically?

totally in agreement.  That is why I was so surprised to see in 
the Bloc Quebecois tax reduction approach that the party did not 
want any tax reduction for those with incomes of under $30,000, 
only for those with incomes higher than that figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for us, we have decreased taxes for the least well-off

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, news that 
the federal Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food has 
downgraded the seriousness of the farm income crisis on the 
prairies undoubtedly had farm families dancing in the streets 
this past weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This analysis, albeit without any statistics to support it, must 
have been music to the ears of farm families that are at the end 
of their line of credit, unable to borrow more from their lending 
institutions or to pay their suppliers, and cannot afford new 
school supplies for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order that the unrelenting joy and affection from prairie 
farm families toward the government continue, I ask the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food when he will table these latest 
forecasts from his department. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, forecasts are done every year by 
Agriculture Canada and the provinces in the months of July and 
February.  They are forecasts.  In between those two periods of 
time officials from both the provinces and the federal government 
continue to do analyses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July we all understand and realize that wheat is just coming 
through the ground.  Come this time of year the harvest is 
completed.  We know how much is there.  We see how much 
individual producers have used the programs such as the net 
income stabilization account.  It is only responsible to take a 
look at this.  It does not diminish the fact that there are 
serious situations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what 
happened last week with the farm lobby here was a total travesty 
and a cruel joke, as Henry Dayday will be the butt of two weeks 
from today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the minister say to Darlene Doane from Saskatchewan 
who called this morning to say that with flaxen and canola off $3 
a bushel they are $90,000 in arrears this year over last year? 
What does he say to the grade six student from Manitoba who wrote 
to the Prime Minister in November and said “Because my parents 
don't get enough money from the crops and the cattle, we don't 
get as much food, clothes, school or recreation supplies?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these heartfelt questions how could the minister 
possibly justify his department's unavailable assertions? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who just asked the 
question and his party were one of a number of people and parties 
that asked us a year ago to do something to assist producers so 
that the precipitous drop in incomes in 1998 in comparison to 
previous years could be assisted.  We did that.  We put $900 
million in, along with the $600 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in comparison.  It was made very clear at the time, for 
1998 versus the average for the reference years before that, that 
is what the program does.  That is helping.  It is not helping 
everyone to the extent that we would like it to, but we are doing 
all we can possibly do.

sources within the Ministry of Veterans Affairs have told 
reporters that the total cost of a $20,000 package for merchant 
navy vets would be a $160 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, and the minister should know, that the total number of 
registered merchant seamen in question is 1,700.  Those that are 
not registered are around 600, for a total of 2,300 for which a 
$20,000 settlement would total at the most $46 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister explain why his department is so poor at 
basic math?  Is it just playing games with these veterans? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quoting from newspaper 
accounts and articles concerning the merchant navy and the 
various veterans organization that had agreement and apparently 
according to the press have now broken down in their agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not comment on that.  I just remind the hon. member that 
when members of the merchant navy were finally recognized as war 
veterans in 1993 it was because of the actions of Liberal members 
of the House of Commons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
everyone in the House knows, it was Minister of Veterans Affairs 
Gerry Merrithew who first brought the situation before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Veterans Affairs Canada has begun to employ scare tactics to 
sell the so-called half-baked plan.  First they told the 
reporters that a fair package would cost $160 million. 
Then they implied that if the merchant seamen did not play ball, 
they would not get any assistance.

these seamen?

of this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is right.  It was the Tory administration in 
1993.  But it was because of the pressure brought to bear by the 
Liberal members of parliament that it happened.  We might say it 
was one case of where the Tories did giveth and they will never 
have a chance to taketh away.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
not only is the government planning a $47 billion millennium 
blowout, but today it is celebrating $47 million in new spending 
to make the biggest bureaucracy in the government even bigger. 
That is how much it is spending to give the biggest facelift in 
history to the revenue department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government really wants to improve the image of Revenue 
Canada, instead of spending millions of dollars on a facelift, 
why does it not just cut taxes for Canadian families? 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and 
Secretary of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the 
Regions of Quebec), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the number referred 
to by the hon. member is exaggerated by far. We have spent money 
on the transition of the agency, but most of the money has been 
invested in our human resources. We have been working for three 
years in order to achieve what we have done today in the official 
launching of the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is proud of what it is doing in order to achieve

if it is not $47 million, how much is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government throwing a million dollar party today to 
celebrate new spending on human resources in what is already its 
biggest bureaucracy?  Does it not think a 44,000 person 
bureaucracy is big enough?  Why does the government not get its

its mega tax collection agency, why does it not give Canadian 
families a tax break?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and

referred to with regard to the celebration is exaggerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud of what we are doing.  It took three years to build 
this agency.  We have been working with all the employees, with

sitting on a $21 billion EI surplus that it built by gouging and

premiums. The government's chief actuary has said that it could 
lower those premiums to $2.05, sustain the fund and still provide 
for a rainy day disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the finance minister not listen to the government's own

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

more than enough to sustain the fund and provide for a rainy day

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want tax cuts, but not just any kind of tax cuts.  A 
recent poll by his friends at Earnscliffe confirms what the NDP 
has been saying all along, namely that 55% of the people back a 
rollback on the GST as a first step toward cutting taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Minister of Finance finally catch up with the

<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

taxes in every area and as quickly as possible, but clearly one 
has to establish priorities.  If we take a look, in fact our 
consumption taxes in Canada are substantially lower than in most 
other countries, whereas our personal income taxes are higher. 
That is essentially where the priority ought to lie. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr.

to cut personal income taxes for middle income and low income

the current Prime Minister was the finance minister back in 1976 
he said that 16% increases in spending reflected great restraint 
on new expenditures.  The Prime Minister must be absolutely 
thrilled to see $47 billion being planned by the Department of 
Finance and other departments in new Liberal spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the tax and cut Liberals of the 1990s going back to the tax

to be gentle today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that when we took office total spending was $120 
billion.  Under the Tories it was going to go to $128 billion. 
It is now down to $112 billion.  We have done that by focusing on 
the priorities of Canadians.  Three-quarters of all our new 
spending is in health care and education.  We will continue to 
focus on those priorities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberals have done it by swallowing themselves whole on the GST, 
as we learned here earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that Canadians have paid the price to balance the 
books, not this government.  Before the government takes a walk 
down memory lane to the high spending 1970s, before the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance fuddle duddle with the 
surplus, why do we not give Canadians the tax break they need 
right now, reward them for the sacrifices they have made and give 
them some money back to put into their pockets?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe 
I am personally involved, but not voluntarily, in a serious 
case of contempt of parliament, a case indeed so serious that it 
could weaken the democratic spirit of the House in our role as 
elected members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case of contempt involves both the Senate and the House of 
Commons and can be explained quickly by considering three 
issues: first, the implication of the Senate; second, the 
aggression on the House of Commons; and third, the undermining 
of my right to freedom of speech as an elected member.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I did not delay in raising this point of order, on 
the contrary.  Acting on information received in recent days, 
along with your letter of October 29, received just hours ago, I 
am anxious to address the matter today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you indicate yourself on page 11,121 of 
<I>Hansard</I> dated December 9, 1998,  “I cannot presume of the 
content of a question of privilege before having heard it”.  For 
this reason, I feel that you will allow me the time to explain 
this important question of privilege.  I am convinced that once 
you have heard the facts in this case, you will conclude with me 
that it is indeed a very serious contempt of parliament, the 
consequences of which could directly affect the integrity of the 
House and the freedom of speech of all members.  I hope you will 
take the time to justify your decision. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> by Joseph Maingot, chapter 
12, it states on page 229: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of 
Parliament in the performance of its function, or which 
obstructs or impedes any Member or officer in the discharge of 
his “parliamentary duty”, or which has a tendency, directly or 
indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as a contempt 
even though there is no precedent for the offence. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did indeed say “has a tendency to produce such results” and 
“even though there is no precedent for the offence”.  The reason 
for this is that, of course, contempt cannot be limited.  Its 
definition remains open-ended because no one is in a position to 
predict all possible cases of contempt of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to all references consulted, contempt of parliament is 
essentially an attack on the authority and dignity of the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am presenting today is a case of contempt of parliament 
or a case with a tendency to produce such a result, one that is 
new, possibly unique, although I believe there is a precedent, a 
similar case raised in this House on October 14 by the hon. 
member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  Colleagues, if you have 
meetings I would like you to take them outside of the House.  I 
would like to hear this question of privilege as I think it 
affects all of us. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand:</B> I was speaking therefore about a similar 
precedent, which was raised by the member for South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley in October and involved a federal agency, CSIS, and 
its direct and indirect activities in proceedings against her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair took this case under consideration, noting that it 
appeared at first glance to be a serious question of privilege 
and of contempt of parliament.  The matter I put to you today 
may be compared with the earlier case, but appears to me more 
serious still, because it concerns not a former employee of the 
Senate, but a sitting senator whose actions involve the Senate 
directly in an attack on the authority and dignity of the House 
of Commons, or tends to produce such results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter at issue arises from a civil suit brought against my 
by a senator who took offence at a bulk mailing of 16 pages on 
the Senate to my fellow citizens in April.  The mailing of 
48,000 copies, distributed by the House of Commons services, was 
intended solely to inform the public on the Senate.  The 
document upset the senator to the point that she took action 
against me for defaming the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strangest part of the matter is that the petition gives the 
impression that this is a simple suit by a senator against a 
member of parliament, which is not the case.  Much more is 
involved.  In fact, the suit involves the Senate directly, 
putting it in a position of hostility and aggression with 
respect to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the senator speaks on behalf of the Senate.  She defends 
the institution as if she had been given a very clear mandate to 
do so. 
She then makes provocative and disparaging remarks about the 
House of Commons and the elected members sitting there, 
something I consider entirely inappropriate and unacceptable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case arises from a civil suit brought against 
me by a senator.  Although the appearances may lead you to 
believe that it is simply a lawsuit concerning an MP and a 
senator, it is much more.  In fact, the lawsuit involves the 
Senate directly, placing it in a hostile position toward the 
House of Commons.  The senator speaks in the name of the Senate, 
for the institution as a whole, as though she had a clear mandate 
to do so.  In so doing, she makes a number of provocative and 
derogatory comments concerning the House of Commons and its 
elected members, which I consider to be totally inappropriate and 
unacceptable.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A personal libel suit must be limited to the factors that have a 
truly personal impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ms. Hervieux-Payette's suit, the personal is buried in a huge 
number of allegations that have nothing personally to do with 
the senator.  Ninety per cent of the allegations do not involve 
her personally, but rather the Senate as a whole and its 
relations with the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, she feels that the comment made in my document to 
the effect that “the Senate is an archaic and undemocratic 
institution” is defamatory. She accuses me of making false and 
erroneous claims concerning the costs of that institution and 
the particular services enjoyed by senators. She feels that my 
statement to the effect that the Senate sits few hours and few 
days per year is defamatory. Finally, she considers that my 
comments are contemptuous when I state that the Senate is an 
institution that lacks transparency, or that senators can find 
themselves in conflict of interest situations since they sit on 
boards of directors that can sometimes bring them in excess of 
$400,000 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these allegations are not of a personal nature. She is 
speaking on behalf of the Senate. In fact, she is not only 
speaking on behalf of the Senate in her application, but also in 
her examination, which took place on August 19 and where she 
said “I am speaking on behalf of the institution” 
It could not be any clearer. I will table a copy in French and 
an English translation of that examination and of the 
application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking on behalf of the Senate as she is doing—and this is 
my first point—is the senator not involving the Senate as an 
institution in her lawsuit against me? Is the Senate not 
directly or indirectly involved in a lawsuit against a member of 
this House? Is the Senate not prosecuting a member of parliament 
through a senator? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, I can assure you, based on the comments made by 
the senator during her examination that the Senate has played an 
active role in the preparation of that legal action. Is this not 
evidence that the Senate is behind the application made by Mrs. 
Hervieux-Payette? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important here is to recognize that in speaking for the 
Senate, the senator forces me to violate the spirit of 
parliament.  In order to defend myself, in order to be assured of 
having a just and equitable trial, I am compelled to contest the 
immunity of senators and to convene a number of them by subpoena 
duces tecum.  I have no other choice.  To prove my innocence, I 
must fight the Senate, somewhat like David against Goliath. 
Obviously, it is an unfair and excessive burden, a task requiring 
resources that far exceed those available to a single, solitary 
member of parliament.  Does that not in itself constitute an 
attack on my status and role as an elected MP? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, in order to defend myself, I will be forced to 
call senators, Senate staff, and even senior House officials by 
subpeona duces tecum for questioning about the Senate's budget, 
costs and operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will even be forced to call senators by <I>subpeona duces tecum</I> 
to testify about their travel, telephone and office expenses, 
and even about their lobbying activities and possible conflicts 
of interest, given their role as directors of several large 
Canadian and foreign corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senator is thus speaking on behalf of the Senate, 
implicating the Senate directly, and several other senators. 
But she does not stop there.  And this bring me to my second 
point. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to implicating the Senate, the senator also attacks 
the House of Commons by drawing a series of provocative parallels 
between the House of Commons and the Senate.  For instance, she 
compares respective costs and functions, leading us to believe 
that senators are less costly and therefore more efficient than 
we are as elected MPs.  The remarks are made with the same spirit 
that pushed Senator Nolin to accuse the House of Commons of 
becoming a circus since we have introduced televised debates.  If 
such provocative remarks are included in a senator's civil suit 
against an MP, does that not in itself constitute a serious case 
of contempt of the House of Commons and of its role as the voice 
of democracy in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, not only am I forced to tackle the entire Senate 
alone in order to defend myself, but I must also defend the 
integrity of the House of Commons alone as well.  Do I have a 
mandate from the House of Commons to speak in its name as the 
senator seems to have for the Senate? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I will be forced to call a certain number of members, and 
even certain ministers, to testify in defence of the House.  It 
would even be appropriate to have each political party send a 
delegate to defend its rights with respect to the matters 
raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, I am not implicated in a personal attack so 
much as I am a victim of an attack by the Senate against the 
House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find myself caught, as it were, between two different 
institutions, which are sometimes hostile towards one another, 
having to battle the first and defend the second, simultaneously 
and on my own, because I have so far received no assistance from 
the House of Commons, despite the magnitude of this affair, 
which I feel is completely immoral and unfair.  I am in an 
impossible situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my third and final point.  This civil suit is 
well beyond my means as a member.  When a senator, with the 
support of the Senate and/or the government in power, as is the 
case here, brings a suit against a member, the battle is an 
unequal one. 
A member of parliament, particularly an opposition member, does 
not have access to the resources a senator does who is appointed 
to the Senate for more than 20 years and who can have her legal 
costs met by a whole set of agreements with the Senate spread 
out over ten or fifteen years, to which can be added some 
attractive contracts from the government in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the exaggerated nature of this case and its clear 
attempt to muzzle MPs that dare criticize the Senate openly, my 
rights to freedom of speech is being jeopardized, and so is the 
freedom of speech of most other elected members of this 
House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the exaggerated nature of this case and its clear 
attempt to muzzle MPs that dare criticize openly the Senate, my 
right to freedom of speech is being jeopardized, and so is the 
freedom of speech of most other elected members of the House. 
Let me explain. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as this business began, when the senator sent me her 
formal notice, alleging that my 16-page document contained 
defamatory material, I contacted the House legal advisers who 
advised me to send out a mailing to all my constituents in 
Québec East making several minor corrections, in order to ward 
off any possibility of a lawsuit and to cool off any other 
senators.  The House legal advisers wrote up the correction 
notice, and although I feel it is extremely generous in certain 
points, it was sent out as drafted by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I co-operated fully, and to the letter, with the House legal 
advisers in order to avoid any lawsuit.  The Senator did sue me, 
however. 
Moreover, the House legal counsels told me clearly that, if 
there were a lawsuit, the House would very likely agree to meet 
the cost of representation by counsel, since I had acted readily 
and in good faith, particularly when the alleged errors had been 
committed in the performance of my parliamentary duties, in a 
householder mailing.  In other words, I had every reason to 
believe that the House of Commons would back me up if there were 
a court case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can therefore imagine my amazement to learn that the 
House of Commons is refusing to meet the costs of representing 
me in this lawsuit. 
I am all the more surprised since the House of Commons generally 
meets the legal costs of MPs when the actions for which they are 
sued were committed in the performance of their duties.  This is 
a justified practice because a member of parliament is a public 
figure subject to all manner of lawsuits, justified or 
unjustified.  That is, moreover, why this is a common practice 
for provincial and municipal administrations as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In your letter of October 29, you give no reason for the refusal 
by the Board of Internal Economy.  In an earlier letter, 
however, you had written that the board was “hesitant to 
intervene in a dispute between parliamentarians of both Houses”. 
If that explanation still holds, it strikes me as rather 
discriminatory, and seriously threatens my freedom of speech as 
a parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, why would the House of Commons be so hesitant to 
intervene in a dispute between a member and a senator?  Is the 
House of Commons not the House of the elected representatives? 
And is the House not obliged to defend elected representatives, 
before senators, who are not elected? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker of the House of Commons is first and foremost 
Speaker of the House of Commons, not of the Senate.  Does he not 
have a moral obligation toward the elected members of the House 
before those of the non-elected Senate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every credible organization in the western world comes to the 
defence of its own members first before those of any other 
organization.  It is a question of respect in the most primitive 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs in the House, therefore, cannot be placed on an equal 
footing with the senators over there.  We are the elected 
members.  We speak for taxpayers and must answer to them every 
four or five years.  We carry the flame of democracy.  Without us 
there is no democracy.  Without us the voice of the people is 
silent. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senators are not elected.  They are appointed to age 75 and, 
accordingly, are not accountable to the public every five years. 
Their role is not essential to the democratic process.  Our 
democracy does not depend on the senators.  Our system could do 
without them, but not without MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, how can we equate an elected MP with a non elected senator? 
This is serious discrimination against me as an MP and where my 
freedom of speech is compromised, like that of all the other 
members of this House.  Nothing is more serious, as Beauchesne 
writes in comment 75 in the 6th edition, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privilege of freedom of speech is both the least questioned 
and the most fundamental right of the member of parliament 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To compromise members' right to speak is to compromise the very 
foundation of democracy and its exercise in this House.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly an excessive, exaggerated lawsuit such as this one 
is a forceful attempt to muzzle MPs who wish to criticize the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In refusing to cover the legal costs in my defence, the Board of 
Internal Economy not only assures the pre-eminence of senators 
over MPs but gives senators the freedom to sue MPs even for the 
most ludicrous reasons, knowing full well that henceforth they 
are vulnerable.  I would remind the House that a lawsuit is not 
necessarily reasonable or justified because it comes from a 
senator.  Their intentions can also be mischievous and malicious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs will then be subject to forms of blackmail by senators who 
are non-elected and who represent particular or private 
interests.  When governments elsewhere are reducing the 
advantages granted to those who are non-elected in Canada, 
non-elected senators are taking precedence over the House of 
Commons in making elected MPs toe the line.  What a travesty of 
justice.  What a travesty of democracy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless, the board may try to weaken me by refusing to cover 
my legal costs, contrary to custom.  It may protect the 
interests of the Senate first and permit me to be sued to the 
limit of my human and financial capabilities.  I will, however, 
never give up my right to speak. So long as I am an elected 
member of this House, I will continue to speak of the waste and 
the abuse in the Senate.  Not only have I the right to do so, I 
have the duty.  Dead or alive, as the old Panamanian adage says, 
but never on my knees. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never give up my freedom of speech.  Never shall I cease 
to criticize the waste and abuse of the Senate.  As long as I am 
an elected member I will continue to criticize it because it is 
not only my role but my responsibility toward taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often elected members are criticized for not respecting the 
will of the people.  Here is the golden opportunity to put into 
application the views of the vast majority of Canadians and 
Quebecers who are opposed to the Senate as it exists today and 
who want it either abolished or reformed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, I would ask the Chair to exercise all its 
influence to reverse this decision by the Board of Internal 
Economy and give me the money I need to cover legal costs in 
this matter so that my defence and that of the House of Commons, 
currently under attack, may be properly assumed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have listened to something 
which I do not believe is a question of privilege.  I think it 
was a plea made to the Board of Internal Economy but expressed in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the speech of the hon. member was not concluded by a 
request for a referral to the proper parliamentary committee.  In 
fact it concluded with what I said earlier.  In other words, it 
was a plea that the Board of Internal Economy reverse a decision 
which he alleges the board has already taken.  I will not get 
into whether the board has or has not taken such a decision 
because that could become a question of privilege if I did 
precisely that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Your Honour has before you is a dispute between two members 
of parliament:  one a member of the House of Commons and one a 
member of the Senate, both being members of parliament under the 
constitution as we know it today.  Should that constitution 
change someday to state something otherwise then it could be 
judged otherwise.  Meanwhile, the fact remains that under our 
constitution parliament is the Sovereign, the House of Commons 
and the Senate in parliament assembled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He alleges that the senator, when exercising this lawsuit 
against him, was speaking on behalf of the Senate. I submit that 
is ridiculous.  That is about the same as our believing that when 
the hon. member who just spoke speaks in the House he speaks on 
behalf of all of us, let alone when he speaks outside the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On very few occasions would I ever admit that member speaks on 
behalf of me or my constituents, particularly when he speaks 
outside this place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT45"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT45"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1525

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the allegation is made in a civil suit and not in 
reference to what was said inside the House, or if it was at 
least the hon. member has not demonstrated that the civil suit 
pertains to something that was said in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that he referred on a number of occasions to a 16 page 
document which he circulated to several thousand constituents of 
his riding and was not about something that was said in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only one person is in the position to speak on behalf of this 
institution.  I would submit, Sir, that is yourself.  Only one 
person, similarly, can speak on behalf of the Senate.  I would 
submit that is your counterpart, the hon. Speaker of the other 
place.  Therefore to pretend that one member of the Senate is 
speaking for the institution is not factually correct. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech, the hon. member also made very strong allegations 
regarding the government and, therefore, many members in this 
House. He said that the senator was taking legal action with the 
support, according to the hon. member's claim, of the government 
in office, which means some 30 members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that the senator could get legal services and that 
her lawyers might then get contracts, lucrative ones as he put 
it, from MPs, more specifically from ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that a very close look be taken at these 
allegations, since they are in fact accusations which are, in my 
opinion, much more serious than the ones the hon. member 
referred to in his arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about freedom of speech in this House. Indeed, members 
of parliament do enjoy freedom of speech here, and the House can 
of course take action against one of its members if he or she 
says something that is not true or not acceptable under the 
standards of our institution. However, this freedom of speech 
does not extend beyond the precincts of this House, and I go 
back to my original point, which is that the member is referring 
to something that took place outside the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not taking sides regarding what happened outside the House. 
It is none of my business. However, I do believe that we are all 
concerned by the allegations made in this House about 
parliamentarians who sit here. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to non-elected senators having, as a result of all 
these allegations, precedence over elected MPs.  The reference he 
made earlier in which he alleges that some members of the House, 
ministers, could give legal contracts to lawyers in exchange for 
defending a member of the other place is a very serious 
allegation.  I would invite Your Honour to reread that portion of 
the statement very carefully to see whether anything warrants 
that kind of what I would call vicious attack against hon. 
members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe criticism of the Board of Internal Economy made in 
this way in the House is not acceptable.  Members of all parties 
serve on the board and attempt, under the guidance and leadership 
of our Speaker, to do a good job on behalf of all of us in the 
management of this place.  That is what I believe all of us do in 
good conscience.  This kind of accusation is unwarranted, not 
specifically against me, but against all of us who sit on the 
Board of Internal Economy on behalf of this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institution itself is more important than any one of us and 
certainly does not warrant the kind of criticism I have just 
heard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to make three points.  It always worries me when each and 
every time in the House an individual stands on a question of 
privilege that the government immediately stands and makes a 
defence as though it is the government that is being charged with 
a question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When individuals in the House stand on questions of privilege, 
it is not just the individual they are referring to but it is a 
question of privilege for all members of the House. 
The government should take note of that.  Each and every time a 
question of privilege arises, the government House leader seems 
to take it upon himself as if it was some kind of personal 
question against the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader of the government also indicated that this was 
an issue of two members.  It is not.  I understand this is an 
issue of a member of parliament and a member of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Mr. Speaker, if you are to consider this at all, I do 
believe you have to question whether the legal fees of the 
individual from the Senate are being paid by the Senate or in 
fact by the individual.  This, to me, makes a differentiation 
between whether this is a Senate-House of Commons issue or a 
person who happens to work in the Senate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for 
allowing me to speak briefly about what has just happened and 
about the speech of the member for Québec East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What needs to be understood is that this is the appeal of a 
member to the individual who has been designated the protector 
of all parliamentarians in the House, to you, Mr. Speaker. It is 
to you in this capacity that I am speaking as the House leader 
of this party, because I feel involved and affected by the suit 
that has been brought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to humbly submit for the Chair's consideration the 
following,  The member for Québec East, in his householder, was 
essentially acting as a parliamentarian. He made a few errors 
which, on the advice of the House's legal counsel—your employees, 
Mr. Speaker, people whose expertise the House makes available to 
members in situations such as this—he hastened to put right to 
the extent possible and as rapidly as possible.  As a result, in 
one suit in which he was involved, my colleague managed very 
easily, with respect to matters of a personal nature involving 
individuals, to reach agreement with one of the senators who had 
decided to bring a suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second case, as a result of this also, the very nature of 
the suit has to do not with the personal attacks that were made, 
but the institution. My colleague has no way of defending 
himself alone, given the magnitude of the facts at issue.  In 
order to defend himself, he would be in the completely 
ridiculous situation of having to call senators and members in 
order to testify about their expenses, obligations and 
responsibilities.  The very nature of the suit goes well beyond 
the mere responsibility of this member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now a ruling has been made.  I know that what is decided by the 
Board of Internal Economy normally has the consensus of the 
parties.  We always manage to work out something in the best 
interests of the House.  An element of co-operation is also 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, however, my colleague finds himself, having 
committed an error as a parliamentarian, and having made 
corrections on the advice of the lawyers and the legal counsel 
of the House of Commons, having accepted everything it was 
humanly possible to accept, in a situation of a dual lawsuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the one case, there are the personal elements, and in the 
other—for this is a much broader and more vindictive case—it 
affects the MP's very ability to write to his constituents in a 
householder leaflet that he does not feel the role of the other 
place is either very important or very essential.  It goes as 
far as that.  We know our colleague has excellent chances on 
legal grounds to win this suit and to be exonerated of all 
blame.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But here we have an MP who has to deal with a lawsuit launched 
by a senator who has considerable means and influence—nothing 
secret about that—being on the government side.  This is  a 
person who could easily take the whole thing a very long way. 
Our colleague for Québec East, a member of this House—and he 
could just as easily have been Reform, Liberal, Conservative or 
NDP—is left to fend for himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there is another means for obtaining justice.  I know an 
appeal can be made to the procedure and house affairs committee, 
if I am not mistaken. 
But I am asking you, like my colleague before me, as the 
protector of the parliamentarians in this House, is it a wise 
thing to do, to let a matter such as this rest on a decision one 
made very summarily, I hasten to add by the Bureau of Internal 
Economy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to question the arguments that have been brought 
up so far, but I do know perfectly well that the net result is 
likely to have an extremely serious impact in future for MPs who 
could find themselves in touchy situations for having expressed 
politically divergent opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has to be differentiated is what constitutes opposing 
political opinions and what constitutes personal attacks—and I 
know you are an expert in this, Mr. Speaker. 
My colleague, who is currently being sued seemingly for his 
political opinions with respect to remarks make regarding the 
other House, finds himself unable to defend himself or, in the 
end, limited to his own means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the intention of the Chair to have MPs' ability to argue 
determined by the size of their wallet?  If I can afford 
$100,000 or $150,000 in lawyer's fees because my finances permit 
me, I could attack the Senate and the people with diverging 
political opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, an MP, like my colleague from Québec East earns his 
living with his parliamentary salary and cannot express 
opinions, because anyone could decide to sue him for expressing 
political opinions, even if it were acknowledged initially that 
some matters were exaggerated and that the correction was made 
as requested by the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put it to you in all sincerity.  We appeal to you, Mr. 
Speaker, as the protector of parliamentarians.  We want you to 
find a way to sit the parties involved down, including those of 
the Senate, if necessary, because that was one of the elements 
put forward by the Board of Internal Economy.  The individuals 
must be sat down under your influence to reconsider the case of 
my colleague, who finds himself in this improbable situation. 
This situation will have an effect in time on all 
parliamentarians in this House and all those who sit there from 
now on. This is what I draw to your attention.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not want to add fuel to the debate, but I do 
feel there are a couple of points I would like to make to 
contribute to what has been put forward on the point of 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as a member and presiding officer of the Board of 
Internal Economy, you know that the issue and the facts of the 
case should not be tried in the House of Commons.  We have now 
heard extensively about what ultimately could become points of 
contention in a civil trial that is before the courts or pending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard discussions about what parliamentary privilege may 
be attached to certain comments that were made in a householder 
that was sent out to a constituency.  We can argue about the 
merits and the intent of that, but I find that you, Mr. Speaker, 
are being put in the unenviable position of being asked 
essentially to be a court of appeal before a court finding has 
been made on many of these important facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know that questions of privilege that are brought forward 
are often brought forward after certain circumstances have 
arisen.  Much of the discussion that we have had before the House 
today already took place at the Board of Internal Economy. Mr. 
Speaker, you are being asked in essence not only to be a court of 
appeal for a civil trial but also for a Board of Internal Economy 
decision that has been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am also a member of that board, I know that oftentimes we 
will revisit decisions if new factual information comes to light. 
However, this is the first time in my short tenure in this place 
that I have seen a Board of Internal Economy matter essentially 
appealed to the Chair.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to state that in the member's remarks—and I 
take some offence to this fact—he portrays himself as if 
speaking for the House in this matter.  That is perhaps taking a 
rather broad swipe at what has occurred here.  It was an 
individual member who decided, along political or philosophic 
lines, and he is entitled to say things.  We also know there is 
privilege that attaches us to this place.  However, this is a 
factually different situation where an individual member, for 
whatever reason, took it upon himself to make some very 
provocative and potentially personally offensive remarks about an 
individual in the other place.  This has played itself out in 
such a way that he now finds himself the target of a civil suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take great sympathy for what he is going through and the 
personal cost that this may entail.  However, there is a degree 
of fiscal and moral accountability that is playing itself out 
here.  It is one thing to say something in this Chamber and then 
rely on privilege, but to say things outside the House or to take 
it one step further and actually publish something about another 
individual or an institution, one has to be prepared to reap what 
one sows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to prolong this, but I feel it is pre-emptive for 
the Chair to rule on the appeal at this point, particularly given 
that this is still the subject of a lawsuit that is pending, and 
particularly given the fact that we have already dealt with this, 
I would suggest, in a fairly substantial way at the Board of 
Internal Economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I do not intend to prolong this debate, this discussion, this 
presentation on a matter of privilege raised by the member for 
Québec East, unduly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to react to the intervention by the House leader of 
the Progressive Conservative Party when he says that, to all 
intents and purposes, this is an appeal from a ruling by the 
Board of Internal Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With great respect, I would say that this is not the case, 
insofar as the facts presented by the member for Québec East are 
an attempt to show that, in the situation he is now facing, he 
finds himself a victim, as it were, of a suit brought because of 
his political opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, mention was made of personal accusations, or personal 
attacks of which the senator in question was allegedly the 
victim.  I submit to you and to the members of this House that 
one of the pieces of information in my colleague's householder 
concerning this senator in particular was taken directly from 
the Senate's Internet site.  This site was modified after my 
colleague mailed out his householder to his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague made this statement in all good faith on the 
strength of information taken from the Senate's Internet site. 
If this site was not up to date, I do not think the member for 
Québec East should be held responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the other accusations or other incorrect statements 
allegedly made about members of the Senate in general, the 
member for Roberval explained clearly that the member for Québec 
East made all the retractions it was humanly possible to make in 
the time allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, he was asked to mail out a retraction to all his 
constituents within five days.  As you are well aware, Mr. 
Speaker, for delivery alone, Canada Post requires eight days. 
This makes no allowance for the time needed to put together and 
print a mailing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, under the circumstances, the expectations of 
those who are bringing this suit against my colleague were 
completely out of line.  Given that they were completely out of 
line, he did what was humanly possible to set the record 
straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the senator, and the leader of the government, 
attempted to belittle this effort, the senator posing as an 
injuriously affected party or victim of defamatory libel as a 
member of that institution that is the Senate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no legal precedent by virtue of which a person is a 
victim of libel because that person's occupational group or the 
institution to which he or she belongs has been attacked 
publicly.  There is no such case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on here, and it is important to point this out, is 
an attack directed against a member of parliament in order to 
restrict his freedom of speech because of the political opinions 
expressed by him.  This colleague was elected so that he could 
express himself, express his ideas.  That is what he has done, 
and that is why he is now being sued.

Labour Code (severance pay). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the object of this bill is to remove an 
unfair discrepancy in the Canada Labour Code.  As the code stands 
now, if older people are laid off in a corporate shutdown, they 
often end up unable to collect any benefits because of the fact 
that they are deemed eligible for a pension.  In many cases if 
they are not 65 years of age, they are not eligible for a full 
pension. On the one hand the pension is less than it would 
normally be and on the other hand, they get absolutely nothing 
from the severance package.  This is an unequal treatment based 
on age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About five years ago the then minister informed me that his 
bureaucrats were working on this problem and that it would be 
dealt with in the next edition of the law. Unfortunately that

in democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at this issue.  All of us are concerned about 
the native people of this country.  The United Nations has 
condemned Canada for its treatment of native people.  We have 
thrown treaties at them.  We have thrown money at them.  We have 
thrown programs at them.  We have thrown Indian affairs concepts 
at them.  We still have the same problems today that we have had 
for so long.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have developed an Indian industry in the country, much of it 
run by white people.  We have put in over $7 billion, at least $5 
billion of which was used up by the industry itself, never 
reaching the grassroots people.  We have chiefs and councils 
working against the grassroots people who we in the House should 
be protecting and improving their way of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tried to amend our consciences.  I guess that is what we 
have been doing over the last 30 years.  Look what we have.  We 
have told native people that they can ignore the hunting, fishing 
and logging rules.  We have told them that they can avoid income 
tax and sales tax, as well as Bill C-68.  We have told them that 
they can be admitted to school with lower grades, have employment 
quotas for preferences, can invade parks and block roadways and 
we will just ignore it.  Are we doing them a favour? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we doing for these people?  I am sure the member for 
Wild Rose could tell us in great detail because he has been on 
the reserves, has seen the grassroots people and talked with them 
right across the country.  The reality is that they do not have 
sewer and water facilities.  They have a crime rate that is four 
and a half times greater than the rest of the population.  There 
is a high suicide rate, three times more AIDS, no initiative, and 
alcohol and drug abuse is at 62%.  That is the reality of what 
the Indian affairs policy of the country has given the native 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, Yolanda Redcalf, a Sunchild O'Chiese member on 
reserve, went on a 45 day hunger strike because of housing 
conditions.  The answer from Indian affairs was, finally we will 
give in to her, shut her up and we will not worry about the rest 
of the people.  That happens over and over again.  That is the 
policy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to deal with this huge problem, which is probably as 
great as the Quebec unity issue.  It is a problem that will face 
us for many, many years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about some other groups that have come to the 
country.  I often hear that we are the ones who caused the 
problem.  To a great extent I expect that we are.  As one person 
told me in Kitchener last week, we should think of the refugees 
who came to this country.  Let us go back to the Chinese 
population who built the railway across the country.  What about 
the Italians who came?  My wife's parents came to this country 
with six kids and less than $100. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Kitchener I talked with two Polish brothers.  I talked to 
members of the Serbian and Bosnian communities.  They said 
“Listen, when we came here we wanted to work.  We wanted to 
build something better for ourselves”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we done to the native people to destroy their 
initiative?  Why are they not starting businesses?  Why are they 
not building something for themselves and for their families?  It 
is because of a racist policy that the federal government, 
largely Liberal over the last 30 years, has put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a party we believe in equality for all people.  We believe 
that people should have the same status, no matter what their 
religion, colour or race.  Everyone is equal.  As soon as we 
start giving special status to people we start the decay and the 
decline which we see today.  It is the special status which some 
Liberal government long ago decided to give these people that is 
at the root of the problem.  We are not doing them any favours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what is happening in Atlantic Canada today.  Let 
us look at the salmon fishery on the Pacific coast.  The same 
thing has happened around the world.  The homelands were given to 
the people of South Africa.  There was once a guy in Germany who 
said that people with blue eyes and blonde hair were better. What 
is the difference when the Liberal government—

a dependency on welfare and act like an east bloc operation? 
Socialism might be a great idea but it just does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a agreement has a template for homelands.  This is 
something that will affect the country down the road in a 
dramatic way.  People will look at the debate, or lack of it, in 
the House and say that this has changed the country and it is not 
for the good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are creating a rivalry, a dispute.  We are creating something 
that will come back to haunt us for years to come in the country. 
The Indian industry, largely in many parts set up by whites, has 
not made a better place for our native grassroots people.  We 
will destroy the Indian people by this sort of legislation, by 
not giving them equality and by not helping them to enter the 
21st century as equals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see nothing in the Nisga'a agreement that will improve the 
situation.  We are setting up a third line of government. We are 
setting up a third order that will leave nothing but 
confrontation and rivalry between the native people and their 
neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should talk about that because many of the neighbours of 
native people have learned to understand them, to work with them 
and to help them.  I think that is where we want to be.  We do 
not want to set them aside as separate individuals.  Even the 
B.C. Liberals, these people's brothers and sisters from B.C., do 
not agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about the cost of these treaties.  We could talk 
about how this will be a template for what could happen and how 
treaties, like Treaty 8 in Alberta, can simply be reopened and 
the problems that can create.  How can the government, in all 
conscience, sit there and allow the balkanization of our country? 
How does it have the nerve to let that sort of thing happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am no expert, we could go through the agreement and 
find many others areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot close without reading a news release.  “The motion 
this morning by the federal government to invoke closure on the 
Nisga'a treaty debate is a reprehensible abuse of democracy”, 
said Liberal leader, Gordon Campbell, today at noon.  “This is 
an egregious abuse of the democratic process and shows flagrant 
contempt of all British Columbians”, said Campbell.  “It is an 
unacceptable slap in the face to our province and to all 
Canadians who deserve a full and open debate on this landmark 
treaty”.  That is from a Liberal.  That is how the Liberals feel 
in B.C.  I think that message should be listened to by all 
members in the House.

where the Hudson's Bay Company did business were where the small 
colonial treaties were signed:  at Fort Victoria, at the coal 
mines in Nanaimo and Fort Rupert, and the Fort Langley trading 
post. Fourteen small treaties in all, for a few blankets I might 
add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the old colonial documents show a disagreement of 
who should pay for the cost of making treaties, and by the 1860s 
treaty-making was halted.  If only Governor Douglas was to know 
how long the debate of who was to pay what would continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than speak to the Nisga'a final agreement in Canada's 
historical treaty-making and policy development context, I want 
to speak to the Nisga'a people's living memory of this 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When B.C. joined confederation in 1871, article 13 of the Terms 
of Union stated that the federal government would assume 
responsibility for Indians and lands reserved for Indians. 
British Columbia agreed to provide lands for reserves and the 
Government of B.C. considered the land question to be resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Nisga'a did not, nor did they know that their lands 
and rights had been dispersed by a third party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the first surveyor entered the Nass Valley in the 1870s to 
gazette today's Nisga'a reserves, he was met by the grandfather 
of Frank Calder.  The surveyor O'Reily was told to leave and that 
this was not his territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within a decade of that encounter, the first of many delegations 
of hereditary chiefs travelled to Victoria to demand of the 
premier settlement of this land question.  They demanded 
recognition of their title and affirmed the ownership of their 
territory since before the time of the flood.  They journeyed 
home unsuccessful; the government of the day considered the land 
question resolved.  The chiefs who had a direct link to each of 
their territories since time immemorial thought the land question 
had just begun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1890, the first land committee was formed with its first 
members:  the grandfather, great-grandfather and 
great-great-grandfathers of today's Nisga'a negotiating team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after the turn of the 19th century, the land committee 
of the Nisga'a petitioned the privy council in England seeking to 
resolve the land question.  Again their efforts were not 
successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the time the communities of the Nisga'a raised money, penny 
by penny, to send representatives to the various governments, 
to hire lawyers to argue their cause.  Over a century and a 
quarter of bake sales, raffles and donations have brought Bill 
C-9 to the Chamber today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 1884, the central organizing unit of aboriginal people in 
Canada was outlawed.  The potlatch ordered the governance, 
religion and economy of the peoples for thousands of years and 
with the stroke of a pen the covenant between the Nisga'a and the 
creator was made illegal.  As well as the loss of their land, the 
very social, governance and religious structures of the Nisga'a 
feast houses were legislated away by our government not to be 
repealed until 1951. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original land committee saw the death of many of its members 
over the next century only to be replaced by their chieftain 
heirs, their sons and their nephews.  The Nisga'a final agreement 
has been a cost to the Nisga'a people of generations of 
negotiators who dedicated their entire lives to their struggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No other time in Canada's history can we trace the lineage of 
active participants in a cause to direct lines for 130 years. 
This is not a modern treaty.  This is a modern solution to a very 
old outstanding debt. 
The Nisga'a continued to lead the young province's aboriginal 
leaders, and in the early part of the 20th century were part of 
the allied tribes.  The allied tribes united the diverse cultural 
tribes and nations of British Columbia into one goal, the land 
question.  Chiefs from more than 50 languages assembled in an 
unprecedented way to peacefully question the legality of the land 
and its ownership.  People of warring tribes, different cultures 
and customs joined peacefully in one overwhelming cause, the land 
question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How did we as Canadians respond?  We amended the Indian Act to 
make it illegal for Indians to raise money to advance land 
claims.  We also made it illegal for lawyers to be hired by 
Indians for that purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation stayed on the books until 1951. Did that stop 
the Nisga'a?  No, it did not.  The Nisga'a land committee went 
underground and worked through other organizations, including the 
Native Brotherhood to advance their cause.  Whenever a federal 
government official tried to attend any meetings that discussed 
land questions, most groups would launch into hymns in order to 
cover up their illegal activity.  To this day, Onward Christian 
Soldiers is the battle hymn of the Native Brotherhood of British 
Columbia, North America's oldest Indian organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislation was repealed, the Nisga'a land committee 
resumed in public.  In 1968, Chief Frank Calder led the Nisga'a 
tribal council on the land question to court.  The council's 
lawyer was young Thomas Berger.   Mr. Berger articled with Thomas 
Herley, underground legal counsel for the Native Brotherhood of 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The delegation of people who stood on the steps of the Supreme 
Court of Canada to represent their people in the final stage were 
the third and fourth generation of those who posed before 
legislatures and courts to have their photos taken to record 
momentous occasions. Many of those who stood on the steps of the 
Supreme Court of Canada and later in Prime Minister Trudeau's 
office have since passed over and have been replaced by younger 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a chief negotiator, Chief Joe Gosnell's late father, 
Elijah and late brother, Chief James Gosnell, were both on those 
steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a lengthy deliberation, the supreme court was evenly split 
on the decision for the Calder case, with one judge voting on a 
technicality of whether or not the Nisga'a could actually sue the 
government.  Even though the decision was not a clear victory, 
aboriginal title was recognized and Prime Minister Trudeau 
reversed his policy on the land question.  In 1973 he announced 
the comprehensive land claims policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years later, in 1976, Canada entered into a bilateral 
negotiation with the Nisga'a tribal council.  British Columbia 
continued to deny that any aboriginal title still existed there, 
insisting that colonial legislation had dealt with it.  However, 
on the heels of the Delgamuukw case and under the conditions of 
staying the Meares Island case, the provincial government 
re-examined its stand on the land question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July 1991, the task force to review aboriginal claims in 
British Columbia released its report.  It contained 19 
recommendations on how to negotiate the settlement of the land 
question in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 4, 1998, a canoe with Chief Frank Calder in it, 
grandson of Arthur Calder who met the first surveyor, was carried 
into the great feast hall.  This canoe symbolized the many 
journeys the Nisga'a people made from the 1870s to the 1990s to 
peacefully assert their title to a land they had held since time 
immemorial.  The journey was not just physical for the Nisga'a, 
it was spiritual and, at times when it buried the generations 
that had travelled in that symbolic canoe, it was transforming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 9, 1998, members of the Nisga'a Nation ratified the 
final agreement through a ratification vote and on April 22, 
1999, British Columbia passed the legislation it introduced to 
ratify the agreement.  The British Columbia legislation was given 
royal assent on April 16, 1999.  The final agreement was signed 
by the Nisga'a and the Government of British Columbia on April 
27, 1999 and by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development on May 4, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaty-making is a quintessential part of the relationship 
between Canada and the first nations in the country.  Negotiation 
and reconciliation are two pillars of the Canadian way.  With the 
Nisga'a treaty, we reconcile the past with the present.  We find 
a way to live together with mutual respect and understanding, a 
way to look forward with anticipation to the developments of the 
next century. The treaty is consistent with the federal policies 
on comprehensive land claims to self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully urge all members of the House to support Bill 
C-9, the bill to ratify the Nisga'a final agreement.  Justice 
must be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to take part in this debate on Bill C-9, after the 
member for Saint-Jean, the Bloc Quebecois Indian affairs critic, 
and to repeat in the House that the Bloc Quebecois is in favour 
of this bill, that it is in agreement not only with the 
implementing legislation, but also with the content of the 
Nisga'a final agreement, and that it supports this initiative 
because its purpose is to confer genuine self-government on the 
Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the member for Saint-Jean, I have not had the opportunity 
to meet on Nisga'a lands with representatives of the Nisga'a 
nation, people like Mr. Gosnell, Mr. Nice, or Mr. Calder, the 
individual at the origin of the dispute now coming to a close, 
the individual who took this case to the courts, with the result 
that the supreme court recognized the inherent rights of the 
Nisga'a nation.  But I recall my early days as a law student at 
the Université de Sherbrooke, where this important case, one of 
the first recognizing the inherent rights of first nations, was 
studied by my fellow students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did, however, have an opportunity to meet with representatives 
of the Nisga'a nation when they were here in Ottawa last week. I 
saw the degree to which their fight was a fight for freedom, a 
fight they were proud to wage, a fight they wanted to see out in 
the House, in parliament. We assured them that members of the 
Bloc Quebecois would rise and give their support for this bill, 
as I am doing today on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told the representatives of the Nisga'a nation that, as a 
professor of constitutional law interested in native issues, I 
found this treaty a fascinating document. 
It is document that shows it is possible to find a novel and 
original formula to bring together various people and to get 
them to share the same territory. The various chapters of the 
agreement ensure the form of self-government that all aboriginal 
nations, not only those of Canada, but those of other countries 
also, must enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me reiterate that the work done by the negotiators and 
especially the Nisga'a negotiators deserves to be recognized as 
a novel and original initiative that sets a very interesting 
precedent for the negotiations to be held elsewhere, by other 
aboriginal communities in Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fascinating document that includes provisions dealing 
with lands, land title, forest resources, roads and rights of 
way, wildlife and migratory birds. Environment issues are 
addressed. It also mentions the administration of justice, 
cultural artifacts and heritage, questions that are of concern 
to the Nisga'a and on which they will now be able to legislate. 
The agreement also provides for a Nisga'a government, village 
governments, as well as a Nisga'a Constitution and legislation 
that will implement the underlying principles the Nisga'a have 
chosen to enshrine in their Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The self-government system created by this agreement will ensure 
that the Nisga'a, the Nisga'a nation and its representatives 
will become masters of their own destiny and make their own 
decisions concerning their economic, social and cultural 
development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these provisions are a source of concern to certain 
members of this House. I must admit that I do not understand the 
Reform Party's attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do I not understand it, I am rather ashamed of their 
attitude in this House. Their interpretation of this agreement 
shows that they do not understand it. It shows that they did not 
examine it properly or, if they did, then they are real 
demagogues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when it comes to the issue of citizenship, the 
agreement clearly provides that it can only be granted to those 
who qualify as Nisga'as, but that the Nisga'as can adopt laws to 
extend the concept of citizenship and grant it to people who do 
not meet the criteria set in the agreement, as provided in 
clause 20 on the eligibility and registration of Nisga'as. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To claim that the agreement is racist, that the concept of 
citizenship is racist, is an argument that does not hold up. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  We are quick to discourage unparliamentary language in 
the House.  I remind the Speaker that the word demagogue is a 
word that is not allowed according to all rulings that we have 
had. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I listened to the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry when he made his remarks. I will look at 
the blues this afternoon and I will get back to the House 
regarding this issue, if necessary. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought I heard him refer to the actions of a party amounting 
to demagoguery, or words to that effect.  I do not believe he 
called any hon. member a demagogue.  However, I will check 
<I>Hansard</I>, as I have indicated, and come back to the House 
should that be necessary.  I did not hear him apply the epithet 
to a member which I agree would be unparliamentary. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you did in fact pay 
close attention to my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of citizenship, as set out in this agreement, 
indicates no racist intention, no intention of excluding anyone. 
It must be understood that the concept of citizenship and its 
possible extension are based on historical precedent and are 
intimately tied to the history of the Nisga'a nation, which was 
covered by the Indian Act, which was racist, of course, but 
which will be replaced by an agreement on self-government 
allowing native peoples to grant citizenship according to their 
own rules, which will not show them to be racist, in my view, 
any more than the other peoples of this country, such as the 
people of Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What interested me in this agreement is the willingness to allow 
the Nisga'a, the Nisga'a people and its government, to examine 
international issues, international agreements, international 
arrangements. Indeed, it is mentioned in chapter III, which 
concerns fisheries, particularly in section 115 where the Nisga'a 
are given the right to be consulted when the Canadian government 
negotiates fisheries agreements having an impact on existing 
rights they could have over these resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that there was no hesitation 
whatsoever about this, despite the fact that negotiations on 
these points were difficult, apparently. That is what the 
Nisga'a representatives told us. Provinces, particularly Quebec, 
seldom have a voice in the process and have nothing to say in 
the development of a negotiating position concerning 
international treaties and agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement constitutes an example of partnership that should 
inspire all those who want to conclude agreements with the 
native nations. 
It would certainly inspire a sovereign Quebec, since Quebec 
intends to maintain the existing ancestral treaty rights of 
native nations when it attains sovereignty. It also wants to 
negotiate partnership agreements with the 11 native nations in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to wish the Nisga'a people, its members and its 
representatives that the new freedom and the self-government the 
agreement gives them will allow for the full development of 
their nation. It is a process that will interest the Quebec 
people, which is searching in its own way and with its own 
timeframe for the same kind of development and freedom, and 
which will walk side by side with the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: The hon. member spoke Nisga'a</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise in the House again to debate the Nisga'a treaty, 
Bill C-9.  Hopefully I will dispel some of the rumours, innuendo 
and plain mistakes that have been cited in the House about the 
treaty and perhaps about the way we deal with first nations in 
the future of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with any piece of negotiation, as with any agreement where 
two parties sit down to try to formulate a long lasting and 
permanent treaty, one side will negotiate some issues more 
vociferously and adamantly than the other side and they 
compromise.  At the end of the process hopefully they come up 
with a treaty which reflects the interests of both parties.  In 
this case it actually reflects the interests of three parties: 
the Nisga'a nation, the province of British Columbia and the 
Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty was not something that was entered into in a 
frivolous manner.  It was negotiated over 110 years and now it is 
in the House.  I certainly condemn the government for forcing 
closure on this piece of legislation and not allowing free, open 
and continuous debate.  However we have reached the point where 
we are at closure in the House and I think there are a couple of 
basic points which need to be reiterated one more time in this 
place so everyone who is listening or watching or interested in 
the proceedings today understands the basic premises of the 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Nisga'a stand to gain a number of things in the 
treaty.  They stand to gain nearly 2,000 square kilometres of 
land in the Nass Valley which have always been their traditional 
lands.  They stand to gain 18% of the salmon catch in the Nass 
River.  With the salmon stocks where they are, obviously 18% of 
the salmon catch today is not significant.  Eighteen per cent of 
the salmon catch in the future with conservation applied could be 
extremely significant and a great opportunity for both commercial 
and industrial growth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, there is a settlement of $190 million which will go 
directly to the Nisga'a from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a will have a sustainable allowable cut in the valley 
from their numbers of 115,000 cubic metres of fibre per year. 
The point should be made that since timber has been cut in the 
Nass Valley starting in 1958, in the last number of years 250,000 
cubic metres have been harvested on an annual basis.  That is 
more than double the sustainable allowable cut of the Nass River 
Valley. To cut that back to 115,000 or 120,000 cubic metres of 
fibre is a sensible, responsible and conservation based way to 
harvest timber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a 10 year agreement on taxation.  That agreement is 
based on eight years for provincial tax and ten years for federal 
tax.  Surely, even the most rabid opponents to this bill can 
understand that this is the way we should deal with first nations 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the argument that this is possibly some sort of a template, 
our forefathers made a decision many years ago to deal with first 
nations in Canada on a nation to nation basis.  This is not a 
template.  This is a treaty between the Nisga'a nation, the 
Government of Canada and the province of British Columbia.  This 
treaty will be looked at when we negotiate other treaties, but it 
is not a template for another treaty.  We base each treaty on its 
own merit given the number of band members, the geographical area 
and the traditional territory that they once held sway over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be 300,000 decametres of water flow from the Nass 
River, or 1% of the total water flow in the Nass Valley, which 
will be set aside for Nisga'a use for possible future industrial 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the rights of the Nisga'a are protected, the right of 
language and the rights over culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members have stood in the House and argued that this is a 
race based government.  It is patently unfair to say that. 
People stood in the House and said that non-Nisga'a will not be 
allowed to vote in this government.  Quite honestly, non-Nisga'a 
are not allowed to vote for chief and council now. Non-natives 
have never been able to on any reserve in Canada.  This is a step 
beyond that, with full recognition of inherent rights of first 
nations in British Columbia and in the rest of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing we do not hear about in the House is the fact that 
non-natives living in Nisga'a territory will have rights.  Those 
rights are protected by the constitution of Canada, the charter 
of rights and by the Nisga'a government.  They will have their 
property ownership in fee simple.  They will even own the road 
beds and have rights of way to the road bed and highway leading 
to those pieces of property.  To say that non-Nisga'a have no 
rights in the Nass Valley after this treaty finally goes forth is 
patently false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that has been misrepresented about this treaty 
is that the charter of rights and freedoms will not apply.  The 
charter of rights and freedoms does apply.  The constitution of 
Canada applies.  There should be no mistaking those two issues 
because they are basic to the democratic rights of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read an excerpt from the treaty on the charter 
of rights and freedoms.  Section 32(1) states that the charter of 
rights and freedoms applies.  I heard a lot of members try to 
make the argument that the charter of rights and freedoms does 
not apply.  This charter applies to the Parliament and Government 
of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of 
parliament, and to the legislature and government of each 
province in respect to all matters within the authority of the 
legislature of each province.  As it relates to the Nisga'a final 
agreement, “the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies 
to the Nisga'a government in respect to all matters within its 
authority, bearing in mind the free and democratic nature of 
Nisga'a government as set out in this agreement”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the charter of rights applies within the 
parameters of section 1 of the charter of rights and freedoms 
which says that rights are guaranteed in a free and democratic 
society.  This is not rocket science.  This is pretty basic stuff 
that should not be misconstrued, or manipulated in a manner that 
was not meant to be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore if the charter of rights is breached, apparently it is 
okay as long as it would be accepted in a free and democratic 
society or in other words if government can justify the 
infringement. It is no different for the Nisga'a government than 
it is for the Canadian government or for any provincial 
government.  This is a basic right that gives a level playing 
field for all Canadians, whether those Canadians are aboriginal 
Canadians or non-aboriginal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly we have to decide how we are going to deal with 
first nations in this government.  A few rules and parameters 
have already been set down which we have to abide by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to when Canada became a nation in 1867. Our 
forefathers made a decision that we would recognize first nations 
in this country nation to nation. Surely we cannot turn our back 
on that concept now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am running out of time but one more point needs to be made. We 
should stop mixing up aboriginal rights as granted under the 
Sparrow decision and aboriginal title.  They are two distinct and 
separate things. To put them all into one grey area that they are 
exactly the same thing is patently wrong.  It is misleading to 
all Canadians who are interested in this important debate.  It 
should be an informed debate.  All of the issues need to be 
brought out and discussed in the light of day. I do not think 
there is anything to be ashamed of but there is a lot to be 
gained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there are three ways we could deal with first 
nations. We could have open warfare which is not acceptable nor 
wanted by either party.  We could try to negotiate or deal with 
first nations through the court system which is another mistake 
because no one gains at the end of it. Quite often the issues 
become more blurred.  Or we could sit down and negotiate modern 
day treaties which is obviously what the Nisga'a treaty 
represents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I congratulate the member who just spoke.  He made a lot of 
sense.  He is obviously well versed on the issues, not just those 
that surround this treaty but I think all issues as they affect 
aboriginal Canadians. I was particularly struck by the comments 
which had to do with the attempts to change direction or perhaps 
interpret things differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to attempt a difficult thing for me.  I am going to 
attempt to keep the debate at a reasonably low level because the 
facts are extremely important.  Although we heard it from the 
hon. member, we do not hear in debate from the opposition, from 
the Reform Party, the actual facts about what this is about and 
the consultation process that has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not hear anyone in the Reform Party say that it was 
somewhere around 1887 when the leaders of the Nisga'a nation made 
their first trip to the legislature in British Columbia to talk 
about this treaty.  Reform Party members talk about lack of 
consultation. This has been kicking around for over 100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the formal consultations from the government's 
perspective started approximately in 1990.  That is when a number 
of committees were established to deal with all the different 
issues, whether it was hunting, fishing, logging or access to 
minerals and resources below the ground and all of those issues 
which are extremely important to the future economy of this group 
of Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was here on Friday during the debate on authorizing the 
finance committee to travel.  The opposition was leading what I 
would describe as a filibuster.  Having been in opposition I 
respect the rights of opposition members to use whatever tactics 
they feel are appropriate, but their reason for attempting to 
stop the finance committee from travelling was that they felt it 
was important that the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs 
and Northern Development be authorized to travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect that attempt at leverage.  It is one of the few things 
an opposition party can do.  Even though I did not particularly 
like some of the debate, I understand in this place that the 
minority in dealing with a majority government has to use certain 
tactics in an attempt to bring about change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result I am astounded that no one from the Reform Party has 
risen here to thank the government for the motion that was passed 
earlier today.  The Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development is authorized to travel to Victoria, 
Vancouver, Terrace, Prince George and Smithers, British Columbia 
during the week of November 14 to 20 to hold hearings with regard 
to the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure it is an oversight.  I am sure in their eagerness to 
prepare for question period and this ongoing debate they probably 
just assumed that one of their other caucus colleagues would 
stand to thank the government for doing that. In effect that is 
what is happening. I would have thought they would be in a 
congratulatory mood because of that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be very interesting to see what happens at those 
hearings. I am sure they are already busy attempting to derail or 
create some kind of protest at the hearings.  I am sure they are 
already in touch with Gordon Campbell, the leader of the Liberal 
Party in British Columbia, whom they love to quote, in an attempt 
to put a certain viewpoint across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process is not what bothers me.  That is quite a legitimate 
process in the greatest democracy in the world. It is quite 
legitimate for an opposition party or someone opposed to 
something the government is doing for them to do that. The 
question is, are they going to put the facts on the table? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is the only party in this place opposed to the 
treaty.  Many members of the Reform Party represent ridings in 
British Columbia and other parts of western Canada.  I do not 
believe they have a member east of Manitoba but I stand to be 
corrected. And I do not think they have any in Quebec or the 
maritimes. The Reform members represent that part of Canada. They 
have a real vested interest.  What is it they object to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that they object that the Nisga'a, under a general 
provision in the treaty, will continue to be an aboriginal people 
under Canada's Constitution Act, 1982?  Do they object to that? 
Would they like to eliminate the Nisga'a people, the Nisga'a 
culture, heritage and language?  I cannot imagine political 
representatives saying they would want to eliminate a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my friends in the Bloc that I get a little nervous when 
they stand and speak in support of this bill.  I suspect they 
believe what the Reform Party has said, that this could somehow 
be interpreted as a template for separation.  I get a little 
nervous about the support of the Bloc Quebecois for the bill when 
they use that particular rationale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the issue is that the Reform Party does not 
like the fact that Nisga'a will continue to be a people under the 
constitution act or that the Nisga'a will continue to enjoy the 
same rights and benefits as other Canadian citizens.  Does the 
Reform Party object to that?  We heard the previous speaker quote 
right from the treaty wherein it says that the constitution of 
the country applies.  The Nisga'a will have the same rights as 
other Canadian citizens. 
Would someone from that party please rise in his or her place and 
say that they do not agree with that if in fact that is true?  Do 
they object?  I find this incredible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under general provisions lands owned by the Nisga'a will no 
longer be reserve lands under the Indian Act.  One of the 
fallouts of that is that it means the Nisga'a nation will become 
taxpayers just like everyone else.  Do Reform members object to 
that?  It would astound me to hear that is the case.  However it 
is there.  It is in the general provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms will apply.   I have 
heard instances in this place of members of that party standing 
and saying that if they do not like something the notwithstanding 
clause should be invoked and to heck with the charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard members opposite speak about scrapping the charter 
of rights.  The charter of rights is a difficult document to 
manage within a democratic country like ours, but we must think 
of the price we would pay without one.  We must think of the 
price we would pay when an individual government is able to do as 
it pleases, ignoring something like the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they object to the Nisga'a nation having full protection and 
access under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?  I 
would like one of those members to tell us if that is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As most of the agenda of that group tends to deal with crime, 
they have said there will be a problem in this area.  Yet federal 
and provincial laws such as the Criminal Code of Canada will 
continue to apply to Nisga'a citizens and others on Nisga'a 
lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police currently has a detachment in 
the Nisga'a community of New Aiyansh.  It will continue to have 
an RCMP detachment there once the treaty takes effect.  Nothing 
in the treaty prevents the Mounties or the provincial police from 
enforcing federal and provincial laws on Nisga'a land.  That is a 
fact.  That is the truth.  They should not attempt to 
misrepresent that.  The Nisga'a will have no authority over 
criminal law and the criminal code will continue to apply to 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my hon. friends to stand in their places to tell 
Canadians, British Columbians and the Nisga'a people what exactly 
it is that they object to with a landmark treaty such as this 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I believe I should be allowed to respond to the direct 
challenge by the member as to the precedence of Nisga'a law over 
Canadian and provincial laws.  If he would refer to page 113 of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid the hon. member is not on 
a point of order.  He seems to be getting into a debate.  I know 
the debate is a vigorous one on this issue and I know hon. 
members will want to participate.  To that end, I think we should 
resume debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like to be obliging to the member who has asked 
for us to rise to our feet to respond.  I would ask for unanimous 
consent, and I am sure they will not object because of his 
request, to have questions for five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there agreement to have a question 
and comment period for five minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member who just spoke suggested that perhaps the official 
opposition should thank the government for allowing the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development to 
travel to British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the hon. member that the result of that particular 
decision having been made this morning through a motion actually 
came about because there was a very strong representation on the 
part of the official opposition.  We asked why one committee like 
the Standing Committee on Finance could travel all around Canada, 
but another committee dealing with an equally significant issue 
involving not less than $1.3 billion is not allowed to travel. 
The hon. member should have said thanked the official opposition 
for making this possible because we have a balanced position in 
the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have set the perspective I think we should also 
recognize one of the fundamental issues grasping our young people 
and many of our constituents back home.  I hear it virtually 
every Saturday that I go out to the Orchard Park shopping mall. 
They tell me that I am their representative.  All those things 
are happening but last Saturday morning was most telling.  It had 
to do with the Nisga'a treaty.  They ask how they can trust the 
Parliament of Canada to do what they want done.  I asked them 
what they meant and they indicated that they needed to have the 
Nisga'a treaty defeated.  That is what they said; it was not one 
person who said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. leader of the Liberal Party in British Columbia said 
that the surest way to shatter public trust and confidence in the 
treaty process was to limit debate on what treaties actually say 
and do.  The federal government should be doing all it can to 
open up the treaty process.  This is a dangerous step on the part 
of the federal government that will only further undermine public 
trust.  That is serious stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. minister of Indian affairs asked members more than once 
in the House to read the treaty.  I have.  Many of us on this 
side of the House have read it.  We support a lot of things in 
it, but there are some things in it that we seriously question. 
Our issue is not so much to defeat the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to come to a settlement, but not with all the clauses 
that are in there now.  We need to make some changes.  The intent 
of bringing about closure and of settling the land claims once 
and for all was a wonderful move.  We should endorse that.  In 
fact we do endorse it, but when it is based on a false premise it 
will not lead to the kind of conclusiveness that we have been 
told it should develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would very carefully suggest that the government has 
demonstrated contempt for the people of Canada, particularly 
aboriginal people.  It has been spiteful to the people of Canada 
by giving them a sense that we will finally settle the issue and 
we will not.  That is dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people ask how we can say such a thing.  Let me refer to a 
couple of clauses in the Nisga'a treaty.  I am reading from 
chapter 16 on direct taxation and other taxation clauses.  I wish 
the hon. member was here to hear this because he just made some 
serious allegations about it, saying we did not understand. Let 
him listen.   On direct taxation it indicates: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a Lisims government may make laws in respect of direct 
taxation of Nisga'a citizens on Nisga'a lands in order to raise 
revenue for Nisga'a Nation or Nisga'a village purposes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The operative word is may, may make laws about that.  Then the 
hon. minister of Indian affairs said that was not now.  No, it is 
not now, but he did not apply it to that clause.  He applied it 
to the next clause.  Paragraph 3 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time Canada and British Columbia, together or 
separately, may negotiate with the Nisga'a Nation, and attempt to 
reach agreement on: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>a.  the extent, if any, to which Canada or British Columbia will 
provide to Nisga'a Lisims Government or a Nisga'a Village 
Government direct taxation authority over persons other than 
Nisga'a citizens, on Nisga'a Lands 
</UL></UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT66"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT66"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases the operative word is may.  This has to be read in 
the context of what has happened with regard to other aboriginal 
treaties, land claims settlements and agreements in principle on 
self-government where the word may is also included and where the 
action that was taken was to levy taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we should put that into the context of an earlier clause 
that existed in the Nisga'a treaty.  I refer here to chapter 2, 
paragraph 35, which reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada or British Columbia enters into a treaty or a land 
claims agreement, within the meaning of sections 25 and 35 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982, with another aboriginal people, and that 
treaty or land claims agreement adversely affects Nisga'a section 
35 rights as set out in this Agreement: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>a.  Canada or British Columbia, or both, as the case may be, will 
provide the Nisga'a Nation with additional or replacement rights 
or other appropriate remedies. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean?  It is very obvious what it means.  If 
there is another treaty with provisions that are more 
advantageous than those that exist in the Nisga'a treaty, the 
Nisga'a will get those very same advantages.  Here we have a 
formula for a ratcheting up but not for a ratcheting down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the conclusiveness in a treaty that has those kinds of 
provisions in it?  That is the difficulty.  It is not the 
difficulty that they have the right to tax.  It is the difficulty 
of doing this in an arbitrary kind of a way and suggesting that 
there will be the same kind of representation, the same kind of 
authority to non-Nisga'a as to Nisga'a when it comes to taxing 
authority and electing people to the group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to a band which is not a Nisga'a band but has the 
right to tax.  It also taxes people who are not members of that 
band.  They must pay taxes, but do they have the right to vote 
for the people who sit on council?  No.  Do they have the right 
to discuss or to work with them?  Yes, they can consult and 
negotiate, but since the council is independent it can make 
whatever decision it wants.  Is that what democracy is all about? 
Is that what we want to do with this treaty?  I submit no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are talking about when it comes to equality.  If 
we are to live under one government then let the law be equal for 
the people who are under that government.  That is what we are 
talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House are not the ones who will suffer the 
consequences of the treaty.  Things will go on reasonably 
smoothly.  Fourteen years from now is about the time the real 
impact of the treaty will come to be.  At that time the final 
payment will be made as it is outlined in the treaty at a cost of 
somewhere between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion.  After that our 
children and our grandchildren who will replace us will find the 
full impact of the provisions of the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the inequality that is built into the treaty, the spite 
and the contempt the government has shown to the people.  It said 
that it would give them permanence but it is the exact opposite. 
It will not give permanence.  It will create a situation where 
one group of people will be pitted against another.  Our children 
and grandchildren are the ones who will suffer from this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank you and I am very pleased to take part in this debate on 
the Nisga'a final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by the Bloc Quebecois critic, the hon. member for 
Saint-Jean, we are looking forward to having a treaty such as the 
one proposed by the government adopted by the House within a 
reasonable timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is of course totally different from that of the 
Reform Party, which certainly has the right to express its views 
in a democracy. However, we can only feel sorry for those who 
are looking for equity and equality and for those who have a 
sense of history when a position like the one put forward by the 
Reformers meets with a favourable response in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past number of years, several authorities have 
recognized that aboriginals do have rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking of course of the UN, which established a working 
group on native rights a few years ago. I am also thinking of 
the Erasmus-Dussault commission, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a nation obviously. A nation is a group of 
individuals who have control over a territory, and who share one 
vernacular language, the will to live together and a common 
history. Basically, these are the attributes of a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody can question the fact that the Nisga'a are a nation. 
Theirs is the nation which, under the proposed treaty, will be 
granted 1,992 square kilometres of land that they will manage on 
their own, in compliance with the Canadian charter, since we are 
dealing with the Canadian context, and in compliance with the 
criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I heard a member say "We should worry about the Bloc 
Quebecois making connections with their plans for 
sovereignty-association". We do, but we also make a point of 
adding that we realize that the Nisga'a reality will stand part 
of the Canadian experience, while the coming into being of 
sovereignty-association will bring about a relationship of 
equality within a context which will obviously be different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important thing with regard to the Nisga'a initiative, 
just as with the liberation of the Quebec people, is the respect 
of nations and the specificity of both partners. I would like to 
quote from one of the key passages of the Erasmus-Dussault 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that the Erasmus-Dussault commission was chaired 
by a Quebec appeal court judge and lasted nearly three years. 
Through this commission, we were invited to recognize the right 
of the native peoples to self-government; a model was even put 
forward, which was different depending on whether it dealt with 
an urban or rural reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House today, and especially our 
Reform colleagues, that the Erasmus-Dussault report said “Only 
nations have a right of self-determination. Only at the nation 
level will aboriginal people have the numbers necessary to 
exercise a broad governance mandate and to supply a large pool 
of expertise”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to lend any credence to the Erasmus-Dussault commission 
and if we want to make a connection with the treaty before us, 
we have to recognize that the Nisga'a are a nation and therefore 
have the right to be considered as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we also have to stress the fact that what we have here 
sets an interesting precedent, because if this treaty were to be 
implemented, the Nisga'a nation would no longer be subject to 
the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not always in the House when the Reform members addressed 
this issue, but whenever I was here, I was sorry to notice that 
they never talked about a very positive impact, which is the 
fact that we will be giving a nation the means to better control 
their development. The Erasmus-Dussault commission came to the 
same conclusion: “We have to put an end to the trusteeship 
system and ensure that the Nisga'a nations can truly develop by 
also putting an end to the rule of transfer payments”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what is going to happen to the Nisga'a nation during the 
next 15 years. They will forego part of the transfer payments 
they are now entitled to, but, in return, they will gain new 
financial responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to remind the House that the Nisga'a nation will 
continue to define itself and be regulated, under the treaty, by 
the provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 1982, and 
the Constitution Act, 1982, dealing with the prerogatives 
granted to native peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how to put it more strongly. This is an 
interesting treaty because it puts an end to a trusteeship 
system and paves the way for a model that we, on this side of 
the House, could be tempted to export.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are aware, all members of the Bloc Quebecois can 
stand up with pride and remember that we belong to a province, 
one that is to become a country one day, as members know. We 
belong to an order of political reality that was very quick to 
recognize the rights of its own first nations. It is interesting 
to look at the accomplishments of Quebec as far as the 
aboriginal reality is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share four elements of that reality, a reality 
that makes us all the more in favour of ratification of the 
Nisga'a treat, the object of very broad consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member: </B>Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> I have just now heard a rather inaudible, but 
certainly not very polite, exclamation from the Reform ranks, 
without any clarity to it whatsoever, as usual.  If our Reform 
colleagues have something to say, I believe they should take the 
floor and do so.  They could try to do it the way civilized 
people do, with a subject, a verb and an object. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I would remind hon. members that all Bloc Quebecois 
members of parliament are extremely proud to support this 
treaty, because it indicates a path to be followed in the 
relations we will have to establish with the first nations.  We 
take our inspiration from what the Government of Quebec, the 
René Lévesque government, did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the four elements of fact we are pleased to remember, we 
in the Bloc Quebecois, is the fact that in Quebec a lot more 
land belongs exclusively to the aboriginal people than in the 
other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also point out that eight native languages are still 
spoken in Quebec, proportionally more, given the ratio of native 
people to the population of Quebec as a whole, than is the case 
outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to say with pride that the French language charter 
accords the Amerindians and the Inuit the right to keep their 
language.  This is a specific provision of the French language 
charter, and no member of the Bloc Quebecois or of the National 
Assembly would not want this provision to be an effective part 
of Bill 101. 
Perhaps the most important is that, in Quebec as in British 
Columbia and the maritime provinces, the title “Indian” and the 
title “aboriginal” exist, creating the legal basis for 
enshrining self-government for the aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague, the member for Saint-Jean, put it so eloquently. 
He is one of few of us who can claim considerable stability in 
his functions as critic, since, apart from a brief period of a 
few months, he has always been the Bloc Quebecois critic in 
these matters, hence his enlightened expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listened to this expertise and will vote 
enthusiastically in favour of the bill the government has put 
before us, and we say in closing “Shame on the Reform Party”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to join the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very proud moment.  I could not be more proud than to 
be here to witness the imminent passing of the Nisga'a deal and 
to watch this first nation take its first courageous step toward 
true independence and cast off the shackles of what can only be 
described as 130 years of social tragedy, which is the Indian 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it ironic that the Reform Party, which I believe 
advocates more independence for aboriginal people, would like to 
see them stand alone, be proud and be masters of their own 
destiny, is speaking so vehemently against the Nisga'a deal which 
does in fact give the Nisga'a people just that leg up, just that 
very thing.  The Nisga'a deal will allow this particular first 
nation to take that first courageous step toward true 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am dumbfounded by some of the remarks I have heard from the 
Reform Party over the last couple of years about aboriginal 
people.  It disappoints me to say the least.  That is the most 
polite way I can say it.  It really disappoints me to hear 
Canadians push myths about the deal to further their own goals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I found galling was that Reform members 
compared the Nisga'a deal to apartheid in South Africa.  The only 
explanation for such a ridiculous thing to say is that they have 
no idea what the apartheid regime in South Africa really was. My 
belief is that they do not really understand apartheid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a little bit of research for their benefit.  I went to the 
Library of Parliament and dug up some of the acts and bills that 
actually constituted the apartheid regime in South Africa.  It 
contains 75 pages with probably 4 or 5 bills and a little outline 
of what each one was on each page.  It was a well orchestrated 
and deliberate attempt to oppress a people, the majority black 
people in South Africa.  There are things in the apartheid regime 
that are absolutely horrifying.  I will not waste any time going 
through them because I think most people here know what true 
apartheid is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely intellectually dishonest to even imply that the 
Nisga'a deal has anything to do with apartheid.  It trivializes 
the struggle of black South Africans as they liberated themselves 
from their white oppressors.  We are seeing a similar thing here 
as this particular group of people betters their own destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes me very happy about the Nisga'a deal is that we are 
seeing the death rattle of the Reform Party's two year campaign 
to try to discredit aboriginal people.  For the two years that I 
have been here all I have heard is sniping, complaining and 
allegations of gross corruption and abuse of funds, trying to 
string together a bunch of isolated events into one argument that 
all aboriginal people are somehow either incompetent, corrupt or 
both.  I am getting sick of hearing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am celebrating the fact that pretty soon we will be able to 
have the vote and it will, I hope, shut the Reform Party up in 
that regard.  It has been nothing but a campaign of abuse toward 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I lived in the Yukon for many years.  I lived in quite close 
quarters with many aboriginal people.  I lived for the better 
part of 10 years in the small community of Dawson city.  I got to 
know and respect aboriginal culture.  I was sensitized maybe to 
their issues because of that time spent.  I have always been very 
keen.  Even in high school, instead of taking French I took Cree. 
In retrospect, maybe I should have taken French because Cree does 
not help me too much in this place.  Maybe that is why I find it 
more galling than most to have to sit here and listen to the 
tirades and inaccuracies trying to misrepresent what the Nisga'a 
deal is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a series of myths that the Reform members have been 
hanging their hat on.  Some are worse than others.  The first 
thing they have been trying to say is that the Nisga'a treaty is 
race based. This is the same connection to the apartheid regime 
that they have been trying to sell.  It is in fact justice based. 
It is the pursuit of social justice.  It is the manifestation of 
the goodwill that most Canadians feel toward aboriginal people 
when we want to see them achieve true independence, which is what 
the Nisga'a deal will do for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A referendum in British Columbia is another thing the Reform 
Party has been calling for.  There has been a great deal of 
consultation in British Columbia.  Forty meetings have been held 
throughout British Columbia.  The NDP government has been very 
careful to do in depth, comprehensive consultations.  We have been 
all alone.  When I say we I mean the NDP government has been left 
hung out to dry by the Liberal government.  It could have moved 
on the Nisga'a deal months ago instead of letting this 
divisiveness boil in British Columbia as long as it has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also disappointed that we have somehow been, through 
political mischief, forced to have five more public hearings in 
the province of British Columbia as the aboriginal affairs 
committee tours that province.  It is pure political mischief. It 
will come to no good.   It is the death rattle of the Reform 
Party as it tries to desperately cling to colonialism.  What it 
really wants to do is entrench that model of Eurocentric 
colonialism that it is so comfortable with and from which it 
comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people do not know about an organization called B.C. FIRE. 
The Reform Party will probably also deny that it knows anything 
about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony is that a researcher for a Reform Party MP quit his 
job on the Hill two years ago and went to British Columbia.  He 
set up what is called B.C. FIRE, the foundation for individual 
rights and equality, or some such thing.  Really it is the 
anti-Indian movement of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is the political wing of the anti-Indian 
movement in British Columbia and it is atrocious.  This 
particular individual, and I will not mention the name of the 
member of parliament he worked for but the member is still here, 
left his job here.  Maybe he was dispatched.  Maybe he was even 
sent to British Columbia by the Reform Party to set up the hate 
movement in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. Surely there are some limits to the slurs that can be cast in 
debate in the House, and the imputing of motives.  I would invite 
the Chair to ask the hon. member to keep his remarks on the topic 
and not on slurs of other members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member has a 
point.  I will ask the hon. member to try and use more judicious 
language in addressing the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would be happy to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stick to the facts.  Maybe we should look at the actual 
record.  I know what happened with the B.C. FIRE movement.  I get 
its hate mail.  Somehow I am on its hate mail list so I know a 
lot about that organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stick to the facts.  If we really want to know what the 
true attitude of the Reform Party is toward aboriginal people, it 
is very instructive to look at some of the things that have been 
said in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. The member is continuing his tirade after being cautioned by the 
Chair.  This is absolutely indefensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sure that the 
member was just about to come back to the subject being 
discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was simply going to make 
a point.  Here is a quote from the member for Athabasca:  “Just 
because we did not kill the Indians and have Indian wars does not 
mean we did not conquer these people.  Is that not why they 
allowed themselves to be herded into little reserves in the most 
isolated, desolate, worthless parts of the country?” That is a 
revealing sentiment, is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the former member for Capilano—Howe Sound, Herb 
Grubel.  I think he is now on the board of directors at the 
Fraser Institute. What did he say about aboriginal people?  He 
likened Indians living on reserves to people living on South Seas 
islands courtesy of a rich uncle.  That gives some indication of 
what the Reform Party really thinks of aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. We are debating the Nisga'a agreement.  The member continues to 
take the debate in a different direction.  If he would like to 
offer his comments on the issue being debated today, great. 
However, I submit that he is on a whole different tangent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I will ask the hon. 
member to please speak only to Bill C-9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would be happy to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is always asking should parliament not be able 
to amend the treaty.  This treaty was arrived at by three 
parties:  the province of British Columbia, the Nisga'a 
themselves and parliament.  Why should one group be able to 
override the wishes of the other two?  That is no longer 
negotiations, that is dictating.  Frankly, it would be 
fundamentally wrong for parliament to arbitrarily alter any 
clause of the agreement that was agreed to by the other party.  I 
think that is an absolute non-starter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is also concerned that this particular bill 
might create some kind of a precedent, that there will be other 
groups wanting the same deal.  Nobody every meant the Nisga'a 
treaty to become— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order, please. The hon. 
member's time has expired.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I cannot say how sad I am that on a subject which is 
very important to Canadians, especially aboriginal Canadians, 
members in the House would lower themselves to the debate we just 
heard.  Canadians deserve better than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very unfortunate and I condemn the government for 
introducing closure on yet another key bill. This morning the 
government introduced a motion which will shut down the debate on 
the treaty at this stage by 6.30 p.m., in less than an hour.  At 
the time the motion was introduced there had been less than 10 
hours of debate on this enormous treaty, only four hours of which 
had been allotted to the official opposition, the only party 
bringing forward thoughtful arguments as to why there need to be 
changes to the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members and the government that there are 24 
official opposition members representing British Columbia where 
this treaty will mostly take effect.  Only 16 members of the 
official opposition have been permitted to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal leader in British Columbia says this about the 
government move today:  “The surest way to shatter public trust 
and confidence in the treaty process is to limit debate on what 
these treaties actually say and do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about a trivial matter.  We are talking about 
people's lives.  We are talking about an enormous application of 
the resources of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from the financial statements of the Government of 
Canada, 1998-99, section 15(3)(iii), where it talks about 
aboriginal and comprehensive land claims:  “Aboriginal claims 
with specific amounts totalling approximately $200,000 
million”—that is $200 billion—“and comprehensive aboriginal 
land claims amounting to $742 million are known to the 
government.  The government is aware of an additional 2,000 
potential claims currently being researched by first nations.  A 
reliable estimate of potential liability cannot be made at this 
time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not merely a matter of dollars and cents.  It is a 
matter of people, fairness and equity.  It is also a matter of 
being able to produce for this country the services, stability 
and economic prosperity that all of us, including aboriginal 
Canadians, need and want.  This is not a small matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the brief time that I have, I would like to address two 
issues that have been continually raised by members in the House 
with different conclusions.  It is the matter of whether the 
charter of rights and freedoms applies to Nisga'a people under 
this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian affairs minister was very categorical in his 
statement on the issue.  He said in his speech on this matter: 
“The charter of rights of freedoms will continue to apply to the 
Nisga'a people”.  I would like to think that that was the end of 
it.  However, I invite Canadians to read the terms of the charter 
of rights itself.  We need to judge rationally and logically, and 
not use wishful thinking and alarmist thinking.  We need to look 
at the plain meaning of the words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty says that the entire Nisga'a agreement, 
including the self-government powers, are to be defined as 
aboriginal and treaty rights within the meaning of section 35 of 
the constitution. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 25 of the constitution requires the courts to give 
higher weighting to the section 35 aboriginal rights over charter 
rights.  I will read section 25 and perhaps Canadians can try to 
make up their own minds as to whether or not there is a problem 
here: “The guarantee in this charter of certain rights and 
freedoms shall not be construed so as to abrogate”—that means 
cancel—“or derogate”—that means take away—from any 
aboriginal, treaty or other rights and freedoms that pertain to 
the aboriginal peoples of Canada, including any rights or 
freedoms that now exist by way of land claims, agreements or may 
be so acquired”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the charter itself states that the guarantees of 
rights and freedoms in the charter will not take precedence over 
rights or freedoms that may be acquired by treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What rights or freedoms have been acquired in this treaty which 
may not be subject to charter protection?  There are quite a 
number of areas where Nisga'a governments have been given the 
right to make laws which will supersede or be not subject to 
federal or provincial laws, including the constitution.  These 
areas include, in chapter 11, paragraph 34, page 166, Nisga'a 
government; Nisga'a village administration, paragraph 35, page 
166; Nisga'a land, paragraph 44, pages 167 to 168; Nisga'a land 
title, paragraph 50, pages 169 to 170; use, possession and 
management of assets other than real property, chapter 11, 
paragraphs 53 and 54, page 170; child and family service, 
chapter 11, paragraph 89, page 174. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each of these areas and many more which I did not read 
because of time, the treaty states that “in the event of an 
inconsistency or conflict between Nisga'a law under this 
paragraph in all of these areas and more, and a federal or 
provincial law, the Nisga'a law prevails to the extent of the 
inconsistency or conflict”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to make these laws which supersede federal and 
provincial laws would clearly be, under section 25 of the charter 
of rights and freedoms, a right or freedom acquired by way of an 
agreement.  Those rights cannot be taken away or cancelled by the 
rights and freedoms in the charter under section 35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a lot of reading for Canadians.  I would invite them 
to look at sections 25 and 35 of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms and also chapter 11 of the Nisga'a agreement and the 
list of 14 areas where Nisga'a law will supersede any federal or 
provincial law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, and I put it to the House and to Canadians, that the 
minister and the government are simply not correct when they say 
that the charter of rights and freedoms will continue to apply to 
the Nisga'a treaty people. In at least 14 areas and possibly 
more, Nisga'a law will supersede the charter rights that are 
given to every other Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is terribly important for Nisga'a women. Nothing in the 
Nisga'a treaty gives Nisga'a women the same protection as other 
Canadian women in the case of marriage breakdown.  This is an 
area which has been horribly missed and underdefended by members 
opposite.  Where is the minister responsible for the status of 
women?  Is she railing about the need for equality of Nisga'a 
women in this treaty?  She is nowhere to be found.

protecting women in society, but when it comes right down to it, 
it does very little to put its money where its mouth is.  Why is 
it that the rights, freedoms and equality of Nisga'a women and 
aboriginal women have been completely neglected and abrogated by 
the government?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
because of the time allocation brought forward by the government 
I would like to thank my colleagues from other provinces for 
giving me an opportunity to speak.  This is an issue that is very 
vital to the people of British Columbia.  Certainly the people in 
my constituency of Kootenay-Columbia have made their voices well 
known to me.  They have expressed very clearly to me that they 
are adamantly and fundamentally opposed to the treaty as written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with B.C. Liberal leader Gordon Campbell on the title of 
his news release today:  “Closure on the Nisga'a debate, a 
reprehensible abuse of democracy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things have to be brought into this dialogue. Unfortunately 
it is a monologue as far as the Liberals and the other parties in 
the House are concerned.  We are the only people who are bringing 
a dialogue portion to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in hand a very interesting document from the ministry of 
agriculture and food.  It is a briefing note prepared by a 
bureaucrat in the B.C. government for none other than the 
agriculture minister, Corky Evans.  Corky Evans is no ordinary 
minister.  Corky Evans is trying for the leadership of the B.C. 
NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This document was prepared for him by the ministry of 
agriculture when he was in debate with my colleague from 
Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan.  It is very interesting that the 
document puts a lie to the argument that the treaty will not be a 
template.  I heard earlier a Conservative, who perhaps was 
speaking out of ignorance, repeating the same line that the 
Liberals have been trying to say and that the NDP have been 
trying to say, that this is not a template.  This document puts a 
lie to that argument.  It states in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Impacts on current agriculture uses of Crown resources will 
result if the Nisga'a land selection model is repeated. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further in the document it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces believes it would be unfair and unjustifiable to 
negotiate future treaties that are significantly more or less 
beneficial to the First Nations than the Nisga'a treaty.  This 
suggests the Nisga'a final agreement will serve as a guide for 
land and cash values. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This document was prepared for the NDP minister of agriculture, 
an aspiring leader of the provincial NDP, in which it says that 
the province believes it would be unfair and unjustifiable to 
negotiate future treaties that are significantly more or less 
beneficial to first nations than the Nisga'a treaty.  This is a 
template.  Any comment to the contrary is simply not factually 
accurate.  This is a template in every way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further in terms of dislocation the document was very 
interesting in that it says in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are likely to be significant localized disruptions to 
individual ranchers within close proximity to existing First 
Nations communities.  In the Southern Okanagan there are over 
1,000 farms with Crown tenures within 10 kilometres of existing 
Indian reserves.  This buffer also contains 69% of the ALR. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ALR for my friends across the House who might not realize it 
is the agriculture land reserve.  This is the area where farmers 
and ranchers in British Columbia, the people who own that 
property, be whatever race or nation they belong to, are creating 
food for British Columbians, for Canadians and for export, 69%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The briefing note prepared for the B.C. minister of agriculture 
by his department goes on further to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Premier Harcourt stated that the total land quantum to be 
transferred to first nations would be in the range of 5% of the 
total land base, an area larger than the total ALR”.  This 
amount of land would likely consume the majority of crown ALR 
(approximately 2.5 million hectares).

the document for authenticity purposes, I would be happy to do 
so.  These are facts which are simply never put into the public 
domain by the Liberals, by the NDP, by the Bloc or by the 
Conservatives because it does not suit their interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an issue of accountability to this entire process. When 
I came to the Chamber some six years ago I came possibly under 
the myth that we could stand to talk about issues directly and 
forcefully.  That turned out to be a myth because of the labels 
other people in the House chose to throw in our direction, simply 
because we chose to put out the facts and to tell the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Kootenay—Columbia I am approached by people 
who are card carrying aboriginal people or people living off 
reserve or non-status individuals.  I take great pride that 
virtually to a person these people come up to me with a smile and 
shake my hand because my office and I have tried our level best 
to work with them against the Indian industry that is represented 
in my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously I do not make many friends with the leadership, but I 
do make friends with the rank and file, the ordinary citizen of 
aboriginal descent.  It is my responsibility to represent that 
person every bit as much as it is my responsibility to represent 
non-aboriginal people in my constituency.  I do not take favours 
from anyone.  I represent people and these people recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result we have been approached by a number of aboriginal 
people in my constituency who would like to get a number of their 
grievances out into the open.  These are aboriginal people 
approaching me.  With my colleague from Wild Rose we pulled 
together a forum conducted by me and the member for Wild Rose as 
chairpersons only.  Virtually every comment made in that forum 
was by rank and file aboriginal people from the five nations 
represented in my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a tale they told.  They were prepared to stand up in the 
face of their government hierarchy on their reserves and tell it 
like it actually was.  Where is the accountability?  The 
accountability is in my constituency, and I suggest in all of the 
constituencies represented by Reform Party members, because we 
permit ordinary aboriginal people to say their piece.  There must 
be accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One recent disappointment occurred in the aboriginal file.  I 
listened to the very thoughtful presentation of the Leader of the 
Opposition.  I must say I was exceptionally proud of his speech 
because it was so thoughtful and well researched.  He talked 
about breaking the old mould.  Unfortunately the bright light in 
the Bloc that followed him stood and said that it was some more 
rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe there was a problem between French and English and he 
could not understand it, or he was not listening to the 
interpreter.  However, the fact of the matter is that the Leader 
of the Opposition had the courage of conviction, intelligence and 
foresight to present a new idea, a new model.  The Nisga'a 
agreement does nothing except represent a rehashing of the cud, 
going over and over the same ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many flaws in the Nisga'a treaty.  Yet under the NDP 
government in Victoria members of parliament went through 
thoughtful clause by clause debate and looked at all the issues. 
They were shut off just over halfway through.   Now we have ended 
up with the government, led by the House leader who with great 
glee turns around and shuts off debate after only four hours in 
this Chamber.  It is absolutely shameful that the government 
would twist democracy in this way.  There is no democracy in this 
Chamber.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to come to a way of making sure, as my colleague from 
Calgary—Nose Hill said, that women are properly protected; if we 
are to make sure the people of the Nisga'a nation are properly 
protected; if we are to see that the rank and file people of that 
nation have all of the rights and privilege we enjoy, we must 
reject the treaty.  It is the direction of myself and my 
colleagues in the Reform Party that we will do everything to 
reveal the treaty for the sham it is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with great pleasure that I stand today to respond to the 
Reform Party's comments regarding the Nisga'a treaty.  Myths 
about the Nisga'a treaty are being foisted upon an unsuspecting 
Canadian public by some of our, shall I say, esteemed colleagues 
from the opposite side of the House.  I am talking about the 
document entitled “Top 10 concerns with the Nisga'a final 
agreement” which has been made public in the last months.  Today 
I will set the record straight once and for all.  I will address 
all 10 points one by one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first myth relates to private property rights for Nisga'a 
people.  Nisga'a lands will indeed be held in fee simple by the 
Nisga'a nation.  That is one of the ways in which the Nisga'a 
will have the opportunity to preserve their culture.  However, 
the Nisga'a also want to thrive economically.  That is why the 
final agreement creates opportunities that will allow the Nisga'a 
to convey, transfer or dispose of interest in land, including fee 
simple parcels which could be owned by anyone.  The Nisga'a 
treaty balances the desirability of protecting the unique Nisga'a 
culture while allowing the Nisga'a people an opportunity to 
realize the full economic potential of their assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second Reform myth concerns the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms.  Members of the House need to know that the charter 
of rights and freedoms applies to all government actions in 
Canada including the actions of the Nisga'a government.  The 
Nisga'a final agreement specifically states that the charter 
applies to the Nisga'a government.  Moreover, nothing in the 
treaty limits the application of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a citizens will continue to enjoy the same protections of 
individual rights and freedoms as other Canadians.  In fact, the 
current exemption of the Indian Act under the Canadian Human 
Rights Act will no longer apply to the Nisga'a since the Indian 
Act will no longer apply to the Nisga'a except for the purposes 
of determining who is an Indian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How then can anyone rationalize that any Nisga'a person will 
have diminished rights under the charter?  It is written plainly 
in the Nisga'a final agreement that this is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third myth is that the Nisga'a final agreement permanently 
entrenches the same essential elements as the reserve system in a 
modern treaty.  How much further from the truth can we get?  In 
the words of Nisga'a Chief Joseph Gosnell, with this agreement 
the Nisga'a are negotiating their way into Canada, not out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this treaty no longer will there be Nisga'a reserves.  No 
longer will the Minister for Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development control decision making in Nisga'a day to day 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a government must consult with all residents of 
Nisga'a lands who are significantly and directly affected by its 
decisions.  The treaty provides for solid, democratic and 
financial accountability mechanisms.  All Nisga'a people will 
have a strong voice in the way they are governed.  They will have 
opportunities to vote, to run for office and to participate in 
government institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth Reform misrepresentation is that the Nisga'a 
agreement creates inequality, disenfranchising non-Nisga'a people 
and providing for a system of taxation without representation. 
The taxation chapter of the agreement clearly shows otherwise. 
The first provision in that chapter clearly spells out the 
Nisga'a taxation authority: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a Government may make laws in respect of direct taxation— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think it would be in order if the hon. member would 
give credit where credit is due, to his speech writer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member like all hon. 
members knows that we do not read speeches in the House.  We only 
make use of notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will take the hon. 
member's comments as a compliment.  Let me quote again: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a Government may make laws in respect of direct taxation of 
Nisga'a citizens on Nisga'a Lands in order to raise revenue for 
Nisga'a Nation or Nisga'a Village purposes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are not Nisga'a but who live on Nisga'a lands may 
receive services from the Nisga'a government, but that government 
does not have any authority under the treaty to collect taxes 
from them. 
Those who live on Nisga'a lands but who are not Nisga'a citizens 
will not be disenfranchised.  They will continue to have the 
right to vote in federal, provincial and regional district 
elections and will also have the right to vote for and become 
elected members of those elected Nisga'a public institutions that 
may directly and significantly affect their interests.  These may 
include such public institutions as school boards and health 
boards. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT76"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT76"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800
<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all.  The treaty also guarantees them a strong voice 
in decisions of the Nisga'a government that could directly and 
significantly affect them.  They have the right to be consulted, 
which includes a full and fair consideration of their views. 
They will also have the same rights of appeal as Nisga'a citizens 
on these matters.  Let us remember that the charter of rights and 
freedoms will continue to apply.  Those are far stronger 
protections than those which currently exist under the Indian 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth Reform myth is that the Nisga'a final agreement amends 
Canada's constitution through the back door, creating a third 
order of government.  The Nisga'a final agreement does neither. 
Nisga'a rights will be well within the limits of our 
constitution.  What we are doing through this agreement is 
setting out what those rights are.  There is no need to amend the 
constitution in order to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our constitution was amended in 1982 to recognize and affirm the 
existing aboriginal rights of Canada's aboriginal people as well 
as their treaty rights.  What we are doing is very consistent 
with the current constitutional framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty does not make Nisga'a laws constitutionally 
paramount, as some Reform members have said.  All federal and 
provincial laws will apply on Nisga'a lands.  The Nisga'a 
government will have no exclusive law-making powers.  Nisga'a 
laws will only prevail for matters that are internal to the 
Nisga'a themselves, integral to their way of life, essential to 
the operation of their government or where they must meet or 
exceed existing federal or provincial standards.  Otherwise 
federal and provincial laws will prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a concurrent model of law-making which does not alter 
the federal and provincial powers as set out in sections 91 and 
92 of the Constitution Act, 1867.  The courts have been clear 
that existing aboriginal and treaty rights are not absolute and 
do not prevail over the rest of the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I find the negative connotations associated with 
labelling the Nisga'a government as being ethnic or race based 
offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the Nisga'a treaty has much to do with Nisga'a 
culture and heritage.  Both are central to the agreement. 
Aboriginal peoples have unique rights because they were here 
before contact with white society.  They have their own culture 
and their own customs.  They have their social values and their 
own governments and institutions.  These institutions are 
recognized and protected in Canadian as well as international 
law, including the Constitution Act, 1982 and our common law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the practical self-government arrangements set out in 
the Nisga'a treaty, these unique rights are reconciled with the 
rights of other Canadians and the sovereignty of Canada.  I do 
not know what kind of a country Reform members strive for, but in 
my Canada we do not have to stop being aboriginal to be Canadian. 
This agreement allows the Nisga'a to be Nisga'a and to remain as 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth myth is that the Nisga'a final agreement will deter 
future economic development in British Columbia.  This truly 
demonstrates the complete failure of the Reform Party to grasp 
the reality of the situation.  Studies conducted by experts in 
the field have concluded the exact opposite.  Fostering economic 
development is one of the principal achievements of this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 1996 study by KPMG concluded that treaties in British Columbia 
will lead to increased annual incomes to British Columbia of 
between $200 million and $400 million, and an increase in 
employment of between 7,000 and 17,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another study conducted by the respected Laurier Institution in 
1998 indicated that treaty settlements will increase investment 
and economic activity in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, a Grant Thornton study published in 1999 confirmed that 
all citizens of British Columbia stand to gain from the Nisga'a 
treaty and future treaties in that province.  The report 
concluded that for every dollar spent on treaty settlements 
approximately $3 will be gained in economic benefits.  The net 
financial benefit to British Columbia as a whole, the report 
said, is estimated to be between $3.8 billion and $4.7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seventh Reform myth is that the Nisga'a final agreement 
involves huge costs and sets a precedent for massive payouts in 
future land claim settlements, the cumulative effect of which may 
be simply unaffordable.  Here are the facts.  The Nisga'a treaty 
is affordable.  It is comparable to other treaties in Canada, as 
will be future treaties concluded in British Columbia.  The one 
time cost of the Nisga'a treaty is estimated at $487 million in 
1999 dollars.  This includes estimates of land and resource 
values contributed by British Columbia and estimates of third 
party compensation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of these amounts the Nisga'a will receive $253 million in 1999 
dollars paid over 15 years.  Annual transfers to the Nisga'a 
through the fiscal financing agreement will provide programs and 
services which are comparable to those received by other 
residents of northwestern British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funding will be approximately $32.7 million annually and 90% 
of that funding is currently provided through existing government 
programs.  Canada's share of the estimated cost will be $31.5 
million.  Through this agreement and the own source revenue 
agreement the Nisga'a have agreed to share in the costs of 
providing programs and services.  Those arrangements are 
unprecedented and represent a major step forward of which we can 
all be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately my time is running out here and it looks as though 
I will not be able to rebut all the points contained in some of 
Reform Party propaganda on the subject, but I would be more than 
pleased to respond to questions and perhaps deal with some of the 
other points in my speech. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have an opportunity to speak just before the time 
allocation is finished.  What a shame it is that they moved 
closure on this debate and we will not hear any more wise words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last year and a half I had the opportunity to go into 
many of the reserves with grassroots people.  I am speaking on 
behalf of a lot of seniors, elders who live on the reserves and 
who have spoken wisely and have given me a lot of insight.  I 
think of people such as Roy Littlechief, Floyd Minifingers and 
Johnny Chief Moon, to name just a few, who have said the entire 
problem boils down to one thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their view the problem is that for over 130 years the entire 
aboriginal community was operated out of this place by federal 
governments of the past.  At no time could it ever be worse than 
it is now.  There has been an absolute absence of accountability 
on the reserves.  Not all of them.  I want to make it absolutely 
clear that I have seen some very effective reserves, some good 
ones.  I only wish that those who are doing so well could get the 
message out to the hundreds I have seen not doing very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people were talking about the various types of problems 
that the member from the NDP refused to address because he is 
sick and tired of hearing about the grief they see in the 
provinces.  I wish hon. members from the NDP and Liberals would 
have come to Burnt Hill in Winnipeg when they had the final 
meeting and heard from the people who were talking from their 
hearts, the ones who are living in abject poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to have seen them visit with a mother and 
father who lost a three year old girl just weeks before.  I went 
into their home, into a soup hole.  They had no place else to 
discharge water.  They did not have a sewage system so they asked 
for one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member for Wild Rose, whom I respect greatly, 
indicated that my colleague from the NDP did not want to hear 
about the devastation and concerns on our reserves.  That is the 
furthest thing from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Well, he didn't go out to the meeting 
about it, did he? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry but I think we are getting 
into debate rather than a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  At any rate, Mr. Speaker, no one from 
any party went to any of the several meetings, and I know they 
were all invited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People like Leona Freed has travelled around the country. 
Literally hundreds of others have done their best to reach the 
grassroots people, those who do not have automobiles, those who 
cannot afford a plane or bus ticket, and those who are 
hitchhiking, trying to survive on the reserves.  That is the 
people they are addressing.  They are saying that when it comes 
to self-government and the Nisga'a agreement they want to be 
shown that all the people will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I certainly wish to allow the member to continue, but on 
a technical point with reference to his debate the member has 
raised with me on several occasions, both inside and outside the 
House, questions about people having difficulties.  I have asked 
for a letter in writing from the member on these matters and I 
have yet to receive it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  This does not sound like a point of 
order.  It sounds like a matter for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it sounds to me like it 
is another effort on the part of both parties to put people like 
me down. They do not want to hear what life is actually like on 
so many of the reserves.  I know that many of the people I have 
talked to are suffering to a great extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are asking that these types of agreements address three 
things. They want accountability.  These are the elders.  I am 
not talking about a bunch of young whipper-snappers.  I am 
talking about the elders, the people who have the wisdom.  They 
want democracy and they want equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has pointed that out six years in a row. 
Something has to be done about the accountability not only on the 
reserves, but in the House.  We are accountable to the taxpayers 
of Canada and the chiefs and councils on the reserves must be 
accountable to their people. With what I have seen with my own 
eyes on the reserves, these kind of agreements are not going to 
address the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today one fellow from Alberta commented to me, “What about the 
grassroots?  The money will be given to a few.  How do we know 
that we all will be able to share?”  This is the Nisga'a people. 
“How do we know that we will all be able to share on an 
equitable basis?”  No property rights, no nothing. They ask me 
“How do we know that we are going to be able to live a decent 
life?  Are we going to be at the hands of the council and their 
families?  Will it be nepotism?  Are we going to go through the 
whole problem again?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding the Stoney reserve has had a three year 
investigation going on.  Up to 43 possible charges are to be laid 
concerning mismanagement and not looking after the best interests 
of the people who are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members from every party in this place had the opportunity 
to go out there and hear the word.  However, they cannot pull 
themselves out of the chambers to go to these reserves.  They 
like to go to the council chambers.  Maybe they would go to the 
chief's house, but they would not get down in the dirt with the 
grassroots people.  They would rather go to the highfaluting 
elite people and say “We will look after you”. They are doing a 
poor job of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from wherever he is over there does not have any 
brains.  All he can do is laugh.  He has no comments.  It is a 
shame he is a representative. If those members are going to say 
something, I wait excitedly for something valuable to come out of 
their mouths.  I know it will never happen with that member, not 
in 100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all hon. members.  For six years the report from the 
auditor general has been looked at.  What is the matter?  Can 
they not read?  Do they not understand?  The auditor general is 
saying most passionately that there is no accountability in this 
whole area and it has to be addressed. If the government is going 
to enter into agreements like this, then for Pete's sake, build 
it in.  There it is. I have read it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to one clause in here on page 113, the 
fisheries.  I want to read the clause for my friends from the NDP 
in particular: “In the event of inconsistency or conflict 
between a Nisga'a law made under paragraph 69 or 70 and a federal 
or provincial law, the Nisga'a law will prevail”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says that several times in here.  I dare these people to 
indicate that does not mean it will override the laws of the 
federal government or the provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one final comment.  It is really too bad that the member 
across the way who likes to laugh so much does not go to the 
reserves and see the sick poverty, the third world conditions. 
Let us see if he would like to laugh then.
