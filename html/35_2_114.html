main points in this dissenting report are a recommendation to the 
Minister of Finance to stop dipping into the unemployment 
insurance fund surplus to reduce his deficit, to rebalance the 
monetary policy to ensure that job creation is made a  number one 
priority, and to immediately reform the corporate taxation system, 
which, in the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois, could make $3 billion 
available annually for job creation.

storage and timely destruction of federal PCB wastes-could (be) seriously 
impede(d)'', given that the ``federal PCB destruction program-ended on 31 March 
1995''?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> (a) 
The national contaminated sites remediation program (NCSRP) 
was a mandated program and, as such, ended as scheduled on 
March 31, 1995. Subsequent to its termination, Environment 
Canada reallocated $7.8M from its 1995/96 A-Base to assist the 
provinces in remediating selected outstanding high priority orphan 
sites.
<P>
	Significant progress was made in regard to one of the primary 
purposes of the program putting the necessary infrastructure, 
scientific tool and institutional frameworks in place. The federal 
government provided a strong catalytic role recognizing the 
program was not designed to continue forever.
<P>
	The infrastructure which was developed provides provinces with 
the required scientific tools to address their sites, as well as the 
recommended principles for implementing ``polluter pays'' 
legislation. Through the NCSRP, provinces have put, or are putting, 
in place new legislation with the authority to enforce clean-up or to 
recover costs.
<P>
	The government will continue to get its house in order. Federal 
departments are responsible for their sites and will continue to 
clean up their sites as per the code of environmental stewardship, 
greening of government policies and Treasury Board guidelines.
<P>
	Furthermore, as part of recent amendments to the Auditor 
General's Act, departments will be required to table their 
sustainable development strategies to Parliament by 1997. These 
strategies will outline each department's goals and action plans for 
integrating sustainable development into its operations. It is 
expected that the (new) Commissioner on the Environment will 
hold other government departments (OGDs) accountable for their 
actions with respect to further assessment and clean up.
<P>
	Until the end of FY 1996/97, Environment Canada will assist 
OGDs with contaminated sites through the contaminated sites 
management working group (CSMWG). This interdepartmental 
committee is chaired by EC and the Department of National 
Defence (DND) and is working toward ensuring a consistent 
approach to  the clean up of federal contaminated sites. The 
CSMWG is planning workshops (to be prepared by EC) which will 
inform custodial managers about the tools developed under the 
NCSRP, as well as focus on risk assessment, risk management and 
available technologies. The CSMWG also plans to explore legal 
liability issues and prepare a best practices and pollution 
prevention manual.
<P>
	Environment Canada will continue to provide technical 
assistance to federal departments, resources permitting.
<P>
	(b) No direct amendments to the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act (CEPA) are currently being proposed in this area 
although guidelines on the management of federal underground and 
aboveground fuel storage tanks, a common source of 
contamination, will be issued shortly.
<P>
	Progress on federal contaminated sites will continue to be 
ensured through existing government policies (code of 
environmental stewardship, greening of government, Treasury 
Board secretariat increased ministerial authority and accountability 
policy (1986), federal government guidelines (EC, TBS)) and 
through interdepartmental committees such as the contaminated 
sites management working group.
<P>
	(c) Although the department supported the development of an 
inventory in 1990, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment (CCME) members were unable to reach an agreement 
and it was decided that individual members would be responsible 
for reporting on the number of sites within their jurisdiction.
<P>
	As per the intent of the code of environmental stewardship and 
under greening of government initiatives, federal departments have 
a responsibility to properly manage land under their custody. It is 
the responsibility of individual custodial departments to ensure that 
accurate inventory information is recorded and maintained.
<P>
	Through the interdepartmental committee on contaminated sites, 
Environment Canada, in conjunction with other federal 
departments, is currently scoping the size and nature of the federal 
problem. Furthermore, to ensure consistency in reporting the 
CSMWG is currently developing a template for reporting 
information on contaminated sites.
<P>
	(d) It is important to understand that the NCSRP is a joint 
federal-provincial program. Progress has been reflected in both the 
main estimates and annual reports to CCME.
<P>
	Although the program did lapse funding in the initial years, this 
is a reflection of the time required by some provinces to gear up to 
full capacity and in terms of finding matching funding.
<P>
	Cabinet and the Treasury Board Secretariat were aware of 
reallocation of funds from the NCSRP to other high priority 
initiatives (such as the Great Lakes action plan and the North 
American waterfowl management plan).
<P>
	(e) Recognizing that funding for the federal PCB destruction 
program was to end on March 31, 1995, the interdepartmental 
committee on federal PCB destruction, under the leadership of 
Environment Canada, devised an alternate plan for the destruction 
of federal PCB wastes.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7112"> 7112 </A></B>
<P>
	Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) 
agreed to act as service agent for federal departments and agencies, 
and contracted nationally with the Alberta Special Waste 
Treatment Centre for the destruction of federal PCB wastes.
<P>
	More than 1,100 tonnes of federal PCB wastes have been 
destroyed to date, and negotiations continue between PWGSC and 
its federal clients to dispose of the remaining PCB wastes.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TOBACCOACT">TOBACCO ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-71, an act to regulate the manufacture, sale, labelling and 
promotion of tobacco products, to make consequential 
amendments to another act and to repeal certain acts, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased today to begin the second 
reading debate of Bill C-71, what is known as the tobacco act.
<P>
	This bill is a central element in our government's comprehensive 
tobacco control strategy. It complements the tobacco tax increase 
and the anti-smuggling initiatives announced last week, as well as 
the education programs designed to make Canadians more aware of 
the health consequences of tobacco use.
<P>
	The focus of the bill is simple: health. Let there be no doubt on 
this particular point. While there are many interests involved in this 
debate, health, especially the health of young Canadians, is of 
paramount concern.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	The government recognizes the complex and pervasive nature of 
tobacco use in our society. It designed a balanced and an integrated 
strategy that takes into account the various factors that influence 
the smoking decision process, particularly how these factors affect 
young Canadians.
<P>
	This bill addresses the environment, messages and opportunities 
that affect attitudes, beliefs and behaviours about tobacco use. It 
does so by restricting the access young people have to tobacco 
products. It places reasonable limits on the marketing and 
promotion of these products. It increases health information on 
tobacco packaging and it establishes powers needed to regulate 
tobacco products.
<P>
	Canadians want us to take these steps. They expect us as 
parliamentarians, regardless of our political ideologies, to do our 
job.
<P>
	According to a recent Angus Reid poll, 91 per cent of Canadians 
support efforts by governments to discourage young people from 
becoming addicted to tobacco. Seventy-three per cent of Canadians 
support efforts to discourage smoking among people who smoke 
already. In short, Canadians want us to do the right thing.
<P>
	This debate is about people and about the impact tobacco has on 
their lives. There are seven million smokers in Canada. Far too 
many of them and their families must deal with the tragic health 
consequences of tobacco use.
<P>
	Each and every day in this country more than 100 people die of 
tobacco related causes. How many of us have lost loved ones to 
heart disease brought on by years of tobacco use? How many of us 
have watched friends die of cancer that could have been prevented? 
Those deaths stand in stark contrast to the glamorous, exciting and 
often healthy images that tobacco promotions invariably portray. 
Yet those are the true faces of tobacco use.
<P>
	The human toll of tobacco use is immense, not only in Canada 
but throughout the world. In 1991 the most recent year for which 
we have had full data on tobacco related mortality, 41,408 
Canadians died of diseases attributed to smoking, one of every five 
deaths that year. That is more than three times the number of deaths 
caused by murder, automobile accidents, AIDS, suicides, and drug 
abuse combined. Those are startling figures.
<P>
	In one year tobacco use killed more than 14,000 people in 
Ontario, almost 12,000 people in the province of Quebec, some 
6,000 people in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and more 
than 5,000 people in British Columbia and close to 4,000 people in 
Atlantic Canada. This is a human toll that cannot be ignored and 
stands alone as the primary reason why we as parliamentarians 
must take action on tobacco.
<P>
	Tobacco use also generates a significant financial burden on the 
economy. To begin with, it is a drain on medicare. In 1991, 
smoking cost our health care system about $3.5 billion. I invite 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7113"> 7113 </A></B>
<P>
hon. members to think of the health priorities in their communities 
which could have been addressed with that money.
<P>
	But where did the money go? It paid for 3.1 million extra visits 
to doctors and the four million days that people were in hospitals 
for smoking related reasons. It also covered the cost of the 1.4 
million drug prescriptions that were required to treat smoking 
related illnesses.
<P>
	Smoking costs the economy in other ways as well. Canadian 
smokers are absent from work for 28 million days a year because of 
tobacco related causes. Lost productivity arising from smoking 
related deaths amount to $10.6 billion in 1991.
<P>
	The simple reality is that the harmful effects of tobacco use are 
not restricted to smokers alone, despite the rhetoric that we might 
hear about smoking being a matter of individual choice. Smoking 
costs Canadians approximately $15 billion a year, a staggering 
figure.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	As alarming as those numbers are, the data suggests that matters 
will probably get worse before they get better. Tobacco takes years 
to exact its toll. We are now only seeing the results of the smoking 
surge among women during the 1960s and the 1970s. Lung cancer 
has overtaken breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths 
among women. Researchers predict that deaths due to smoking 
among Canadian women may equal or even exceed the level among 
men by the year 2005.
<P>
	Of particular concern is the pattern of youth smoking. 
Approximately $250,000 Canadians each year take up smoking. 
Eighty-five per cent of these new smokers are under the age of 16. 
Right now-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Could we have 
some order so that the minister could complete his debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Madam Speaker, 29 per cent of young people 
between the ages of 15 and 19 smoke. Fourteen per cent of kids 
between the ages of 10 and 14 smoke. Half of these smokers will 
die prematurely of tobacco related illness. The need for action is 
clear.
<P>
	Over the last 25 years governments, committees and individual 
members in the House have proposed and acted on measures to 
reduce tobacco use. Through it all the focus has consistently been 
on protecting the health of Canadians and young people in 
particular.
<P>
	In 1971 the federal government introduced a bill to restrict 
tobacco advertising. That legislation was still on the Order Paper 
when the House prorogued. In 1986 the House debated a private 
member's bill sponsored by a new Democratic member, Ms. 
McDonald. Her bill, the  Non-Smokers' Health Act, mandated 
smoke free workplaces in areas under federal jurisdiction and 
banned smoking in common areas under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Let me quote from <I>Hansard</I> dated November 20, 1986, page 
1382.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Society has a stake in the health of its citizens. When a person is ill, absent from 
work or dies leaving young dependents, society must pay. Society pays for medicare, 
society pays for dependents, and society pays for pensions''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In 1989 the government of the day brought in the Tobacco 
Products Control Act. This act banned the advertising and 
restricted the promotion of tobacco products. It required by law 
health messages and information on toxic constituents to be 
displayed on tobacco product packaging.
<P>
	The health minister who was responsible for that bill, the Hon. 
Jake Epp, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is not a moral crusade. It is not a case of some over-zealous individuals 
attempting to force their lifestyle on others. It is responsible government action in 
reaction to overwhelming evidence-If tobacco were discovered tomorrow, no 
government would permit its sale, let alone its advertising''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I want to remind the House that the minister was a member of the 
Progressive Conservative Party. His initiative, as well as that of 
Ms. McDonald, a member of the New Democratic Party and 
minister John Munro, a member of my party in 1971 were 
supported by members of all political parties in the House.
<P>
	The government knows that the members from all sides of this 
House may choose to differ on many different issues, but we have 
common interest when it comes to protecting the health of 
Canadians, especially young Canadians, from a lethal product.
<P>
	Our challenge once again is to work together to reduce tobacco 
use. We accept this challenge with an increased knowledge and 
understanding about the physiology and psychology effects of 
tobacco use. We have learned more about the factors that influence 
the decision to start and continue to smoke, and about those who 
are most affected in encouraging people to quit.
<P>
	We are better equipped today to respond to the judicial standards 
and expectations that must be reflected in any law that we draft.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	The result is a bill that is balanced and reasonable and that 
responds to the factors that lead far too many Canadian children to 
smoke. About two-thirds of all young people try cigarettes. For 
about half of them, experimentation leads to a habit that becomes 
regular and addictive over a two or three year cycle.
<P>
	At the outset, they think addiction is something that happens to 
other people, not them, and that the prospect of heart disease or 
cancer is far removed from them. Most believe that they will be 
able to stop whenever they want, but the facts are something 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7114"> 7114 </A></B>
<P>
different. That is what hundreds of thousands of young people say 
each and every year. However, the fact is that half will never quit.
<P>
	Restricting youth access to tobacco products as much as possible 
is therefore critical. Restraining access and making it difficult for 
children ages 10 to 14 and teenagers to purchase cigarettes 
decreases the likelihood that those experimenting with tobacco will 
graduate to addiction. The tobacco act will introduce such 
restrictions.
<P>
	Photographic identification will be required when proof of 
minimum age is requested by retailers. As corner stores and gas 
stations become less viable as a source of supply for young 
smokers, they will turn to other avenues.
<P>
	In order to further reduce youth access to tobacco products 
through such sources, vending machine sales, and mail order 
distribution of tobacco products will not be permitted.
<P>
	Self-service displays of tobacco products will also be prohibited. 
These displays enable underage youth to quickly and easily help 
themselves to tobacco products, regardless of age restrictions, thus 
beginning a purchase transaction that retail staff are less likely to 
challenge. Duty free stores will be exempted from this provision. 
The exemption is reasonable and will not undermine the 
achievement of our health objectives, given that these outlets 
operate in a controlled environment which unaccompanied youth 
generally do not frequent.
<P>
	In order to enhance public awareness of the hazards of tobacco 
use, this legislation will increase the amount of health information 
to be displayed on tobacco product packaging.
<P>
	Studies confirm that cigarette packaging is second only to 
television as a key source of health information about tobacco. A 
1996 survey conducted for Health Canada revealed that 75 per cent 
of smokers want health warning messages to remain on cigarette 
packages as a reminder of some of the health consequences of 
tobacco use. Half of these smokers who tried to quit or cut back 
confirmed that labelling on the packages contributed to their 
decision.
<P>
	In another study that same year, the majority of Canadians 
favoured expanding the amount of information on tobacco 
packages about the presence and effects of some of the toxic 
constituents in tobacco and tobacco smoke, such as arsenic, lead 
and others.
<P>
	This bill will require that information. The tobacco act will also 
address the role that promotion plays in the decision to smoke. 
Promotion does much more than just convey factual information 
about a product. Through associations with people, objects, events 
and ideas, promotion creates a brand identity or image that 
influences and shapes the attitudes, beliefs and behaviours of 
consumers and potential consumers.
<P>
	Clearly it is not the exposure to one ad, one display in a 
convenience store or one tobacco sponsored event that triggers the 
decision to smoke. People do not get up in the morning and decide 
suddenly to take up smoking, as some people may have suggested. 
As I have said before, the decision to smoke, which includes the 
decision to start and the decision to continue, is a gradual one.
<P>
	Tobacco promotion contributes to that decision and hinders the 
quitting process by conveying as many positive and reassuring 
impressions as possible that smoking is desirable, socially 
acceptable and more prevalent in society than it actually is, that it 
is sexy and cool. One should do it to be part of the game.
<P>
	It is the cumulative effects of tobacco promotion that we as 
legislators, not members who are bound by political ideology, but 
those of us as legislators transforming the political ideologies that 
are in the House, that we must address.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	Tobacco promotion is pervasive all across this country. Our 
environment is literally papered with it from coast to coast to coast. 
Brand name promotions appear in magazines, on billboards, on the 
sides of buildings, buses, gas stations, airports and sports stadiums. 
Retail stores display tobacco brand names on clocks, countertop 
displays, life size cutouts of sports celebrities and even in ads 
laminated on the floors of different stores.
<P>
	The tobacco industry insists that its marketing campaigns do not 
target youth but that is not the issue here. Whatever the ostensible 
intent of the tobacco companies, their rich promotional campaigns 
reach youth. Kids cannot help but be exposed to the images of 
tobacco that appear on every possible medium in every conceivable 
location across this country. Being more aware of promotional 
activities than other age groups, they are susceptible to it. An 
Ontario study showed that they can name the tobacco sponsors of 
sports and cultural events. In a Canada-wide survey, 88 per cent 
could name the country's two most popular brands of cigarettes. 
That is alarming.
<P>
	It is not possible to promote a particular brand of a cigarette 
without at the same time promoting smoking. Our objective is to 
diminish the prominence and the exposure of tobacco promotion in 
order to diminish its reach and its influence.
<P>
	The bill will therefore prohibit tobacco product advertising such 
as broadcast advertising and billboard, bus panel and street 
advertising. It will permit tobacco companies to communicate 
product and brand preference information in print ads in 
publications that are primarily read by adults, in direct mailings to 
adults and in places where children are not permitted by law, for 
example premises that are licensed to sell various alcoholic 
beverages.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7115"> 7115 </A></B>
<P>
	Under the bill the use of tobacco brand names or logos on youth 
oriented products or those with lifestyle connotations will not be 
permitted. Young people should no longer serve as walking 
billboards for tobacco products by wearing ball caps or backpacks 
emblazoned with cigarette brand names or symbols.
<P>
	This bill will also regulate the use of tobacco brand names and 
other brand elements in the promotion of events sponsored by 
tobacco companies.
<P>
	Allow me to emphasize an important point. This legislation will 
not ban tobacco sponsorship nor will it prohibit sponsorship 
promotion. Tobacco companies remain free to sponsor events and 
activities of their choosing and will continue to have scope to 
associate their brands with those events and activities. What the 
bill will do is limit the extent to which tobacco brand names and 
other brand elements can be used in the promotion of sponsored 
events.
<P>
	Accordingly the display of tobacco brand names and brand 
elements will be restricted to the bottom 10 per cent of sponsorship 
promotional material. Such materials will only be permitted in 
publications that are read primarily by adults, in direct mailings 
and on the site of the sponsored event. The size of on site 
promotions and the length of time they can be displayed will in fact 
be regulated.
<P>
	What does this effectively mean? It means that tobacco brand 
names can continue to be used in the name of an event, such as the 
Craven ``A'' Just for Laughs Festival, or in the location of the 
event, such as stade du Maurier, but it also means that the display 
of the brand names would be confined to the bottom 10 per cent of 
the promotional material. This is reasonable and it is balanced and 
it is fair. It enables the tobacco companies to continue to 
communicate brand information while at the same time 
contributing to the government's overriding health objectives.
<P>
	Finally this legislation will give government the authority to 
regulate tobacco products. While we do not plan to exercise this 
authority right away, it is important that we have the flexibility to 
respond quickly to new products that may be introduced on to the 
market, as well as the developments in social and scientific 
knowledge as it evolves.
<P>
	If and when it becomes possible to make tobacco products less 
hazardous without inadvertently creating new health hazards or 
triggering negative economic effects, we will have the means to do 
so.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	The legislation will also ensure that we have the information we 
need to effectively monitor and enforce the production, promotion 
and sale of tobacco products. Tobacco manufacturers will be 
required to provide the government with product and sales 
information as well as  information about their manufacturing, 
distribution and promotion practices.
<P>
	Great care has been taken to ensure the measures contained in 
this legislation reflect the guidance provided by the Supreme Court 
of Canada and respect the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	In its September 1995 decision the Supreme Court of Canada 
confirmed that the federal government has the criminal law power 
to control the advertising of tobacco products. It recognized that 
the detrimental health effects of tobacco consumption are both 
dramatic and substantial, and that in fact tobacco kills. As Justice 
LaForest wrote: ``Parliament can validly employ the criminal law 
to prohibit tobacco manufacturers from inducing Canadians to 
consume these products, and to increase public awareness 
concerning the hazards of their use''.
<P>
	Moreover the court unanimously held that the purpose of the 
legislation, which is to reduce the health effects of tobacco 
consumption, is a valid and important legislative objective 
sufficient to warrant limiting freedom of expression. That is 
precisely what we have done. Justice McLachlin, who wrote the 
majority judgment, said: ``Even a small reduction in tobacco use 
may work a significant benefit to the health of Canadians and 
justify a properly proportioned limitation of the right of free 
expression''.
<P>
	Contrary to what the tobacco industry may suggest, the Supreme 
Court of Canada recognized a link between certain forms of 
tobacco advertising and consumption. In particular the court stated 
that lifestyle advertising may as a matter of common sense be seen 
as having a tendency to discourage those who would otherwise 
cease tobacco use from doing so.
<P>
	The court identifies options which would be a reasonable 
impairment of the right of free expression, namely: a partial ban on 
advertising which would allow product information and brand 
preference advertising; a ban on lifestyle advertising; measures to 
prohibit advertising aimed at children and adolescents; and 
attributed health messages on tobacco product packaging. These 
are precisely the measures that are incorporated in this bill. These 
clarifications are important because they set the context for the 
comprehensive and integrated set of measures that are contained in 
the legislation before us.
<P>
	This legislation is a product of a deliberate and thoughtful 
process. We have taken the guidance of the Supreme Court of 
Canada. We have studied the results of the research conducted by 
and on behalf of Health Canada as well as the extensive body of 
international data on tobacco promotion and tobacco use.
<P>
	We have consulted with the tobacco industry, with arts, cultural 
and sports groups, with health groups, with retailers and 
distributors, with tobacco growers and with  festival organizers. We 
have consulted but consultation does not mean that we have to 
agree with each and every thing that the party across the table is 
putting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7116"> 7116 </A></B>
<P>
forward. I resent to a certain extent those who are now saying that 
there has not been sufficient time for consultation.
<P>
	When the blueprint was tabled in November 1995 over 3,000 
interventions and representations were received from a variety of 
Canadians including those in the province of Quebec. These 
representations were in regard to a strategy for tobacco 
consumption. For them to come forward now and say to 
parliamentarians that they need more time, that they need to have 
additional consultations, I say that that is the recipe for the deferral 
and delay of the legislation which I do not believe is acceptable to 
any reasonable Canadian.
<P>
	There is no magic solution to the public health epidemic of 
tobacco use in our society. There is no law that can turn this 
problem around overnight, but we can take steps to make tobacco 
less acceptable and less accessible to youth. We can take measures 
to counter the positive aura that so often contributes to kids' 
decisions to smoke. We can ensure that people have the 
information they need to understand what smoking does to their 
body and to those exposed to tobacco smoke. We can strike a 
balance between the reality of tobacco use, the charter of rights and 
the health interests of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Our first priority is the health of Canadians and young Canadians 
in particular. We have proposed steps which should reduce their 
tobacco use and lessen the encouragement to smoke they encounter 
all around them. The bill will help to reduce the sense that tobacco 
use is just a right of passage for young people on the way to a 
glamorous adult life.
<P>
	I imagine that very few of us can think about tobacco use without 
being able to name someone who has lost their life to it. We must 
persuade young people not to get on the treadmill that will see 
some 40,000 of our fellow citizens die early, unnecessarily and 
often painfully.
<P>
	I close my intervention at second reading with a thank you. Since 
I have become Minister of Health, I have sustained opposition 
attacks from a variety of sources, but I want to congratulate the 
health critic for the Reform Party. He has put aside our partisan 
differences and has looked at the substance of what we are 
attempting to do. Because of that I have said to him privately, 
publicly and now on the floor of the House of Commons that that is 
the true test of those who take our oath in this House that we will do 
our utmost to try to improve the lives of ordinary Canadians. I am 
very appreciative of the hon. member's support. I look forward to 
hearing his speech and to meeting him at committee as we proceed 
with this legislation.
<P>
	I wish to say to the Bloc critic I understand that Bloc members 
have legitimate concerns and complaints. They should be given the 
opportunity to air them here today and also to express them at 
committee. However, I would hope that he could join not with me 
as a minister but with young Canadians from coast to coast to coast 
to try to move on this legislation so that it can be passed by 
Parliament as soon as is humanly possible.
<P>
	Perhaps that is the best gift that members of the Bloc, the 
Reform, the New Democratic Party, the Conservative Party and my 
party could give to young people in this country: a message of 
health, a message of hope, a message of caring, caring about their 
futures.
<P>
	I appeal not in an ideological sense, but I appeal to my 
colleagues in the Bloc man to man to take their responsibility 
seriously, which I know they will. Let us move expeditiously to put 
the legislation through the House as soon as possible.
<P>
	I wish to apologize to my colleagues in the Bloc and the Reform. 
I am requested to be in cabinet as I now speak. I must leave the 
Chamber but I will return as soon as is humanly possible. I hope 
they will not look at my departure in any way as suggesting that I 
am not concerned or do not want to be here to listen to their 
remarks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as a member 
of the Standing Committee on Health and the official opposition 
critic on tobacco, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-71, the Tobacco 
Act, at second reading.
<P>
	Before the minister leaves, since I know he must leave us, I 
would like to tell him that I noted the kindness and appreciation he 
expressed to the Reform Party critic. Unfortunately, I will 
disappoint him somewhat, remaining as objective and non-partisan 
as possible.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	I cannot go as far as the Reform Party critic, who, at a press 
conference, even before reading the bill clause by clause, spoke in 
favour saying that, for once, his party would support the bill to 
have it passed as quickly as possible, perhaps even before 
Christmas. He was satisfied with the information sheet provided by 
the minister some five minutes before the press conference.
<P>
	I will disappoint the minister, but this sort of intervention is not 
in the style of the official opposition. Before we agree to, support 
or oppose a bill, we take the time to read it. We have read it and 
have reservations, which we will make known to the minister as 
positively as possible.
<P>
	As all my colleagues are aware, at second reading, the practice in 
this Parliament is for the parties to vote primarily according to the 
principles and objectives of a given bill. It will perhaps surprise the 
minister, but the official opposition will vote in favour of this bill at  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7117"> 7117 </A></B>
<P>
second reading, because we agree with most of the minister's 
objectives. The first part of my speech will focus on this.
<P>
	I would point out right off that the opposition cannot support the 
part concerned with the request by the Minister of Health for 
unusual-and I stress unusual-powers to regulate tobacco 
products, sales and advertising.
<P>
	My colleague from Chambly is ready to rise on this matter and 
will give the minister a hard time. In our opinion, these powers are 
really unusual. Regardless of how noble the cause, the official 
opposition will never let the rights of parliamentarians be trampled 
by a minister who wants to give himself just about every power.
<P>
	Our strongest reservations relate to the sponsorship provisions of 
the bill. I am pointing this out now, but I will elaborate later on. 
The Bloc Quebecois will not support the bill at third reading if the 
federal government keeps refusing to compensate organizers of 
cultural and sporting events.
<P>
	It may be that, given his mandate, the Minister of Health cannot 
do so. However, the heritage minister was unequivocal about this. 
We will try to make her change her mind, but she did say that she 
would not compensate the organizers of cultural and sporting 
events that are sponsored in Canada. You will hear from us on this 
issue, in committee and in the House.
<P>
	Since we agree with most of the government's objectives 
regarding a reduction in health costs associated with tobacco use, 
we will support the bill at second reading because, as I said earlier, 
the vote at second reading usually relates to the objectives and 
principles of the legislation.
<P>
	It is appropriate to point out the minister's objectives. Clause 4 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4. The purpose of this act is to provide a legislative response to a national public 
health problem of substantial and pressing concern and, in particular,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) to protect the health of Canadians in light of conclusive evidence implicating 
tobacco use in the incidence of numerous debilitating and fatal diseases;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) to protect young persons and others from inducements to use tobacco products 
and the consequent dependence on them;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) to protect the health of young persons by restricting access to tobacco products; 
and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) to enhance public awareness of the health hazards of using tobacco products.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	With respect to the first subsection, concerning the seriousness 
of the problems in question, mention should be made of the 
publication, in the October 18 issue of the American weekly 
<I>Science</I>, of the results of the first study to determine conclusively 
that there is a direct genetic link between tobacco smoke and lung 
cancer.
<P>
	According to this study by researchers at the University of Texas 
and the Beckman Institute in California, one of the chemical 
components present in tobacco smoke, a carcinogen, causes 
damage to the cells of human lungs that is comparable to the 
damage observed in most malignant lung tumours. According to 
the study results, this carcinogen damages gene P53, a gene that is 
critical to health, because it blocks the growth of cells that cause 
tumours. According to the study's authors, damage to gene P53 is 
linked to half of all cancers in humans, and to almost 70 per cent of 
lung cancers.
<P>
	To date, no one has challenged this study. It provides conclusive 
evidence of a link between this carcinogen and lung cancer.
<P>
	The minister has a second objective that we support, that of 
protecting young persons from inducements to use tobacco 
products and the consequent dependence on them. I could 
immediately mention the third objective of protecting the health of 
young persons by restricting access to tobacco products.
<P>
	I was youth critic before I became health critic. For three years 
now, the official opposition has expressed its support for these 
goals and has even accused this government of not doing enough to 
attain them. More on that later.
<P>
	The following are a few statistics on smoking by young people. 
At the present time, 29 per cent of young persons between the ages 
of 15 and 19, and 14 per cent between the ages of 10 and 14, smoke. 
Smoking among adolescents 15 to 19 years of age has gone up 25 
per cent since 1991. It has gone up, and part of the reason is the 
present government's inaction. It is not the only reason, but is 
certainly one of the reasons.
<P>
	Approximately 85 per cent of smokers took up the habit before 
they were 16. This is where attention must be focused. Efforts must 
be made to try to convince adult smokers to stop, but, more 
importantly, these people must make up their own minds to do so. 
Without a decision on their part, it will not be possible. But we in 
the official opposition agree with the minister that everything must 
be done to discourage young people who have never smoked from 
starting.
<P>
	Thirteen- and fourteen-year-olds are particularly vulnerable, 
because the daily consumption of tobacco products increases 
steadily during that period and tends to stabilize by the age of 15. 
See how young they start smoking. It is estimated that 80 per cent 
of smokers have seriously considered quitting and that 80 per cent 
of them have tried to quit at least once.
<P>
	Cigarettes are bought mainly at convenience stores. In 1994, 
nearly half the young people in the 10 to 14 age group who tried to 
buy cigarettes in a store-I repeat, half of those in the 10 to 14 age 
group-were never asked how old they were or refused the 
cigarettes they were  asking for. That is what a study commissioned 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7118"> 7118 </A></B>
<P>
by Health Canada showed. According to 91 per cent of young 
people, and I think it is important to point this out, tobacco is habit 
forming. That is what we must work on.
<P>
	I emphasize the federal government's ineffectiveness in 
enforcing the existing legislation regarding the sale of tobacco 
products to young people. Elsewhere in that study, it was reported 
that, across the country, 50 per cent of retailers did not enforce the 
law in this respect.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	No wonder tobacco use among young people has increased by 25 
per cent since 1991. In fact, the percentage is even higher among 
young girls. With only 40 or so federal inspectors to monitor 
convenience stores throughout Canada, does this come as a 
surprise? No.
<P>
	The fourth objective pursued by the minister is to enhance public 
awareness of the health hazards associated with tobacco use. 
Again, we in the official opposition have taken every opportunity 
to press the current health minister and his predecessor to do more 
in terms of public education.
<P>
	Why? Because it has been demonstrated time and time again 
that, for every dollar invested in prevention and public education 
on health matters, between seven and ten dollars could be saved in 
the long term. I find that previous Health Canada initiatives have 
proven, as I said, extremely ineffective. The minister is urging us to 
spread information. He has distributed documentation and we 
agree with some of what it says. This is a good opportunity to go 
over the statistics.
<P>
	In Canada, in 1991, smoking caused an estimated 27,867 deaths 
among men and 13,541 among women, for a total of 41,408 deaths. 
Twenty one per cent of all deaths in Canada that year were caused 
by smoking. Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable 
death and disease in Canada. It is estimated that more Canadians 
die prematurely each year from smoking than from car accidents, 
suicide, drugs, murder and AIDS combined. In 1991, deaths related 
to tobacco use accounted for about 62 per cent of the total increase 
in the number of deaths since 1989. In that same year, there were 
11,841 deaths in Quebec.
<P>
	Lung cancer accounted for respectively 31 and 26 per cent of 
smoking related deaths among men and women. Ischemic heart 
disease, or heart attacks, accounted for 25 and 20 per cent of the 
deaths among men and women, respectively. The number of deaths 
relating to tobacco use increases more rapidly among women than 
men. The number of such deaths among women went from 9,009 in 
1985 to 13,541 in 1991.
<P>
	Given the considerable increase in the number of female 
smokers in the sixties, the number of smoking related deaths 
among women is expected to continue to rise until the end of the 
nineties, and could equal, if not  exceed, the number of such deaths 
among men by the year 2005.
<P>
	In 1991, the costs of tobacco use in Canada were estimated at 
some $15 billion. Smokers spend more time in hospitals than 
non-smokers do. In 1991, they spent 4 million days in hospitals. 
That same year, the treatment of tobacco related diseases resulted 
in a total of 1.4 million medical prescriptions being issued.
<P>
	Still in 1991, 38,000 people spent time in long term care 
facilities because of tobacco related diseases. Overall, the use of 
tobacco results in annual health care costs of some $3.5 billion in 
our country. On average, smokers missed four days more than 
non-smokers at work, for a total of 28 million days.
<P>
	We should also mention the 40,000 plus deaths that are related to 
the use of tobacco and that will result in a $10.6 billion loss in 
future revenues.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	That covers the main points of the health department's 
informative approach. Some may find it morbid.
<P>
	Although I think the harmful effects of tobacco have to be 
mentioned, a more positive approach could also be developed, 
something more all-encompassing than the approach the 
department is now taking, and has been taking for a number of 
years now.
<P>
	Before entering politics, I worked in recreation and sports. In 
fact, the reason I stopped smoking was because I was so interested 
in sports. I smoked next to nothing because I quickly realized that it 
was not possible to run a good marathon or 10 kilometre race as a 
smoker.
<P>
	Do you know any marathoners, any Olympic athletes who 
smoke? They know only too well that it is not good for their 
performance.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I know you like singing. I am sure you know 
that most singers, Céline Dion comes to mind, do not smoke, 
because it damages the vocal cords. I think we should make the 
public more aware of these examples, through advertising or some 
other means.
<P>
	The whip, who used to be a professional referee and came into 
contact with professional hockey players, could surely confirm that 
he has seen very few professional hockey players smoke. In any 
event, those who did cut short their career. I digress.
<P>
	In Quebec, Kino-Québec used an extremely positive approach 
focusing on sports and health. A ``play outdoors'' theme was used 
to encourage people to participate. The theme targeted everyone, 
not just Olympic athletes. The idea was to get out and about in the 
fresh air, go mountain climbing. When you have made it to the top 
of Mont Jacques-Cartier in the Gaspé and you see caribou, and the 
air is crisp in your lungs, do you crave a cigarette? No, you do not, 
Madam Speaker. That would be an all-encompassing positive 
approach. But no.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7119"> 7119 </A></B>
<P>
	Instead of that, what does the federal government do? It cuts 
funding for sports and recreation; it is even cutting back on 
funding for Olympic athletes.
<P>
	Once upon a time, this department went by the name of Fitness 
and Amateur Sport. Those days are long gone. Now they are happy 
to take a more regulatory approach. They ban this, they regulate 
that. This has become the trademark of the Liberal government. 
Despite its adopting strict legislation on young people three years 
ago, it is not even capable of applying it. Legislation is only good if 
it is enforceable.
<P>
	A law that is good but unenforced is not necessarily a bad law, 
but it is an rather ineffective one. This is what we are seeing with 
the federal government at the present time in the area of health, 
smoking in particular. This government has been humming and 
hawing for three years, and has not been enforcing its legislation.
<P>
	The minister even complemented the RCMP for its 
anti-smuggling efforts. I shall not go into that episode, for lack of 
time, but I believe that the outcome in 1994 was disastrous. It was 
disastrous. I am not prepared to congratulate them. I will wait until 
there is a real change, before I follow his example.
<P>
	We believe that the government, if it wishes to take a positive 
approach, and if it recognizes that smoking is the top-ranking cause 
of death, ought to be prepared to take action and to put its money 
where its mouth is. If it believes that advertising is contagious and 
strongly influences consumers' decisions, why would it not do 
more positive advertising, illustrating the benefits of being healthy, 
being fit, and in particular being a non-smoker? Why does it not do 
this?
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	We do, however, acknowledge that the government's efforts 
relating to advertising are praiseworthy, and correct, where radio 
and television and so on are concerned. We are going to vote in 
favour of the objectives and principles of this bill.
<P>
	Because we have so many reservations, however, and 
particularly because our major objection concerns 
sponsorships-we are opposed to the minister's interference in this 
area-we shall be proposing a great many amendments to him in 
committee. If he sticks with his policy, we are going to invite him, 
once again, to compensate the organizers of sporting and cultural 
events. We are going to insist he do so. We are going to criticize his 
approach.
<P>
	Clearly, the minister is applying the decision of the Supreme 
Court and the fact that the court rejected the government's position, 
and so he cannot completely prohibit sponsorship. He is therefore 
proposing something I would consider rather ridiculous. He is not 
prohibiting sponsorship entirely, but limiting it to 10 per cent. 
Sponsors are entitled to 10 per cent of the  advertising space at the 
event provided the advertising is at the lower level.
<P>
	The bill before us does not indicate how the minister will close 
certain loopholes, including one obvious one. Imagine a sign four 
feet by ten feet that was allowed on the site of an event in the past. 
Under the 10 per cent rule, how is the sponsor going to go about 
maintaining the space he had in the past? He has only to multiply 
the size of the sign by ten. It is not uncommon to see huge signs at 
such events. He has only to do that and will achieve the same result. 
As we can see, then, this rule is hard to apply.
<P>
	The minister says he will regulate this. He says the only thing he 
cannot prohibit apparently is the use of colour. This is his only 
reservation. As for the rest, he says we will see how tobacco 
companies react. There are fewer restrictions in this rule of 10 per 
cent than in the old bill, which was thrown out by the Supreme 
Court.
<P>
	If the bill is not amended, with this 10 per cent multiplied by 10 
arrangement, it would be possible to portray Céline Dion and 
Jacques Villeneuve or an Olympic athlete in the process of 
smoking, so that young people see that smoking would not be a bad 
thing for their career. I am not saying these two people smoke. It is 
unlikely such famous people smoke. Others, however, might be 
tempted to smoke by the lure of money. Nothing in the bill prevents 
this.
<P>
	The minister's approach is strange. He appears to be a severe 
man wanting to prohibit smoking, but, his bill has a hole in it. If the 
tobacco companies were to operate in bad faith, they could easily 
put it to use.
<P>
	More than 300 Canadian organizations count on tobacco 
companies to sponsor their events. These sponsorships represent 
more than $60 million, some estimate them to be as high as $65 
million for Canada as a whole, with $30 million for Quebec. 
Without compensation, many of these sporting and cultural 
organizations may well disappear.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	The reputable SECOR management consulting group, which 
specializes in the analysis of economic benefits, selected 20 of 
these events and compiled studies on their many ramifications to 
show the important impact these events have on the Canadian 
economy at a time when funding from the various levels of 
government is becoming scarcer and scarcer. The 20 events 
examined by the SECOR group produced $240 million in spin-offs 
and created approximately 5,000 jobs. We have a government that 
pays lip service to job creation but takes little action in this regard, 
while these events actually generated 5,000 jobs.
<P>
	According to the SECOR group, the events also produced at least 
$66 million in income for individuals, $34 million for businesses 
and $18 million for, guess who, the various levels of government. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7120"> 7120 </A></B>
<P>
This is $18  million in government revenue that will disappear 
along with the events that generated it.
<P>
	In addition to their cultural interest, events sponsored by tobacco 
manufacturers promote the economic development of various 
industries, thereby benefiting society as a whole. I am still talking 
about cultural and tourist events.
<P>
	We also disagree with the regulatory aspect. We have concerns 
and, unless changes are made, we will vote against the bill at third 
reading. If no changes are made in committee and the government 
closes all doors regarding regulations, we will have to oppose the 
bill.
<P>
	My colleague from Chambly will address this in greater detail 
later, but with this legislation, the minister gives himself the power 
to regulate just about anything in areas that usually fall under 
provincial jurisdiction. Health is clearly identified as such in the 
Constitution.
<P>
	Reference was made to advertising at the provincial level. That 
is an area of provincial jurisdiction as well. As for trade, it too 
normally falls under provincial jurisdiction. But here comes the 
minister saying that there is no problem, that he is prepared to 
regulate.
<P>
	Clauses 7 and 17 were mentioned, and there are many more, but 
what worries me the most is clause 53 in Part VI, which reads in 
part as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the burden of proving that an exception, exemption, excuse or qualification 
prescribed by law operates in favour of the accused is on the accused-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is reversing the burden of proof in a way that disadvantages 
the accused. This would mean that, after a preliminary case has 
been made by the crown, a retailer charged with any offence will 
have to prove that an exception, exemption or other excuse exists to 
justify his action.
<P>
	Reversing the burden of proof is a very exceptional measure in 
penal and criminal law, since it violates the presumption of 
innocence under the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	I also want to discuss the issue of seizure. The bill provides that 
inspectors may seize any tobacco product or other thing by means 
of which or in relation to which they believe on reasonable grounds 
that the act has been contravened. This gives the inspector a lot of 
discretionary power.
<P>
	A very broad discretionary power is given to the inspector, who 
has authority to seize just about anything. This could lead to some 
abuse. For example, imagine that cigarettes are seized from a 
retailer, who is later cleared of the charge against him. This person 
could end up with an outdated stock of cigarettes and suffer a major 
financial loss.
<P>
	I also want to say something about the Supreme Court. The hon. 
member for Chambly will discuss it in greater detail, but we 
Quebecers are somewhat leery of the  Supreme Court. My office is 
close to the Supreme Court. I look at it every day and it reminds me 
of certain things. It reminds me, among other things, that most 
Supreme Court judges are from Ontario. Not only is it located on 
the Ontario side, but Quebec is also under-represented. This 
situation has always been deplored by Quebec premiers, even those 
who were federalists, like Robert Bourassa.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Both the minister and his Justice colleague are leaving it up to 
the Supreme Court to determine the constitutional future of the 
country, to decide whether or not we will have the right, following 
a positive result in a referendum, to achieve sovereignty.
<P>
	Every day, I hear ministers rise in this House and say: ``We 
cannot compensate the 80-year-old retired Singer employees under 
POWA, because we need to get an opinion from the court''. The 
issue has to be heard by the Supreme Court, and people must wait 
years for a decision. Given that these people are now 80 years old, 
some of them may not be around long enough to get a settlement.
<P>
	The Supreme Court invalidated three sections of the Tobacco 
Products Control Act on September 21, 1995, seven years after the 
act was passed. The legislation had been ruled unconstitutional by 
Quebec's Superior Court, in 1991. However, that decision was 
overruled by the Quebec Court of Appeal.
<P>
	At every stage of the legal challenge, the courts ruled on whether 
or not the legislation violated the freedom of expression provided 
under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We all 
remember that famous document. We support the basic rights 
provided under the charter, which is now part of the Constitution, 
but now the issue is left in the hands of the Supreme Court. 
However, since we still fear the Supreme Court, which has always 
been partial to one side, we are understandably suspicious.
<P>
	The Supreme Court finally decided in favour of the tobacco 
companies in a very close judgment, five judges in favour and four 
against. The ultimate aim of this case was to determine if there was 
a causal link between a total ban on tobacco advertising and a 
decrease in the number of smokers. All judges agreed that, with 
this law, the government was infringing upon the freedom of 
expression guaranteed in the Charter. Four of the nine judges, 
however, believed that this violation of freedom of expression, 
under section 2(b), was justifiable under section 1 of that same 
Charter, which allows reasonable limits on certain freedoms. Five 
judges, however, found that the government was going too far.
<P>
	With its new legislation, the government claims to be prepared to 
win any future court challenge. Health Canada employees told us 
they had obtained an opinion from the Department of Justice to that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7121"> 7121 </A></B>
<P>
effect. If this legal  opinion exists, let it be made available to MPs 
so that their work is not in vain, should this opinion not be as 
obvious as the Minister of Justice would have us believe.
<P>
	At any rate, we can sense some uncertainty in the very structure 
of the bill. That is unusual. In each section of the bill we can clearly 
see that the minister is giving himself the power to regulate, as if he 
were, basically, expecting not only challenges, but a possible repeat 
of the loss in the Supreme Court. He could say: ``We cannot apply 
that part, but we are continuing to apply the rest''. We can see that 
the minister is unsure. It is all very well for him to put on a 
flamboyant act, but the structure of his act indicates some 
uncertainty and worry.
<P>
	There may be more than a few challenges. Perhaps the 
government will be caught unawares by many different challenges, 
which could result in so many sections being invalidated that it 
might be forced to bring in new legislation.
<P>
	At a press conference on December 3, Bob Parker, the president 
of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, stated that, if the 
federal government's bill were not substantially amended, dozens 
of challenges could be expected.
<P>
	Obviously, I could have a great deal to say on this. We will save 
our breath for the work in committee. I would, therefore, like to 
end here, allowing some time for other members to express their 
reservations and objections about sponsorships, the regulatory 
aspect and the non-respect of certain individual rights.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	I am sure that a number of my colleagues will, as I am doing, 
express their approval this morning for the objectives, particularly 
as concerns young people under 18. The official opposition 
supports these objectives. It does not agree, however, with the 
means to achieve them. In some respect, we wonder whether things 
have not got a little out of hand.
<P>
	We would certainly have liked the opinions of the provinces as 
well, of all the provinces, because this involves health. The 
minister makes no mention of working with his provincial 
counterparts.
<P>
	Another element concerns us as well. It is the minister's timing 
in introducing his bill. This is not unimportant, although we are 
somewhat used to it. I am a member of the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development. The government did the same 
thing last year with the Employment Insurance Act, in the same 
circumstances. It tabled its bill at the beginning of December.
<P>
	Why chose this point in time to introduce bills that may well be 
controversial or criticized? The answer is that the ministers of this 
government hope people have already started their Christmas 
festivities and that they will be more kindly disposed. They hope 
that people in  general will be more docile, I would say, or less 
attentive to the debate on a bill, because we know how distracted 
people can be during the holiday season.
<P>
	This is unacceptable. The bill has not been passed yet, but we are 
assuming that the government will want to move quickly. It is no 
assumption, as we have already been asked to co-operate. Even 
before the bill was tabled, all members of the Reform Party, who 
were probably in a hurry to leave on holidays, agreed that the bill 
should go through the various stages quickly-second reading, 
study in committee and then third reading-before Christmas as a 
Christmas present for Canadians. Some presents turn out to be 
nasty surprises, as you know, so we have to be careful.
<P>
	At Hallowe'en, little children are told to be careful with candies. 
They look good, but sometimes they contain needles. We have to 
take the time. We are asking the government to be careful. It must 
not succumb to the temptation of going too quickly, because a bill 
passed too quickly is often flawed and does not contain enough 
amendments to improve it, so that it ends up being criticized by 
people and businesses. It may suffer the same fate as the last bill, 
which was challenged in court and eventually invalidated, forcing 
the government to introduce another bill.
<P>
	In the meantime, years go by. The objectives of a minister or a 
government cannot be reached, because the government's action is 
ill- considered. We do not want the government to act 
thoughtlessly. We do want to help it achieve its objectives, as long 
as it respects the rights and freedoms of individuals and groups and 
avoid doing more harm than good, that is depriving organizations 
trying to improve the well-being of the public.
<P>
	I could go so far as to talk about the gross national well-being, 
because festivals are not simply festivals. Cultural and sporting 
events provide a positive setting for people in hard economic times. 
We need such events; they create jobs. We are talking of 5,000 jobs 
for only 20 events.
<P>
	The minister requested our co-operation earlier. He will have it, 
but he must not push to have his bill rushed through the House, 
because we will object. We will defend the rights of 
parliamentarians. We will not allow our powers to be taken away 
and given to a minister who wants to move too quickly.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
speaking today on Bill C-71, an act to regulate the manufacture, 
sale, labelling and promotion of tobacco products.
<P>
	I have quite a personal interest in this subject. In my 25 years in 
medical practice literally every day I faced people who were ill 
from smoking related diseases. I have  also faced over and over 
again people who wanted to quit. I have tried nicotine gum, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7122"> 7122 </A></B>
<P>
nicotine patches and I have had patients go for hypnosis, 
recognizing full well that there is a big problem with tobacco in our 
country.
<P>
	On a personal note, when I set up my practice I watched a 
number of my senior colleagues who smoked. In medical staff 
meetings when I started my practice, 50 per cent of my colleagues 
were smokers. By the time I resigned my position in the hospital to 
run for Parliament not one colleague smoked. I use that as an 
example. There has been a change in thinking in the medical 
community on tobacco as new evidence came to the fore. It became 
quite obvious that smoking was not just a benign activity.
<P>
	I would like to express today the expectation that people at home 
have of an opposition politician. Opposition politicians 
traditionally find fault and criticize everything. That is part of the 
job of an opposition politician. In some cases it can be destructive 
rather than constructive.
<P>
	I have had constituents say to me: ``Surely there is something 
that those government MPs bring to the floor that you can 
support''. And a specific quote: ``You all fight like children rather 
than improving legislation co-operatively''. I have taken that to 
heart and have tried to approach this bill with that idea. This should 
not be partisan. Partisan considerations should take a back seat 
when health issues are being considered.
<P>
	To that end I am not going to nitpick about this bill. I will make a 
couple of broad comments about some deficiencies in it, but I will 
save my concerns for the committee stage. However, I think there 
are significant shortcomings. I hope that I will get the same 
constructive spirit of co-operation from my colleagues.
<P>
	Reform asked to fast track this bill and I would like to explain to 
the House and to Canadians why. For over a year after the blueprint 
was presented which basically laid out where the tobacco measures 
would go I waited for action. The major press conference that was 
called over a year ago was followed by silence. Some promises 
were made but no action. During that period of time a new 
generation of smokers started smoking at an unprecedented rate.
<P>
	I had my staff do a graph for me because I do not always trust 
statistics that come from various groups. This graph showed the per 
capita cigarette consumption in Canada and the United States 
between 1970 and 1994 which were the last figures that were 
readily available to me.
<P>
	This graph was very interesting. It showed the U.S. and 
Canadian experience with per capita cigarette consumption 
following very closely. If the two lines were drawn it looked like 
the two were in lock step together. Because I cannot use this as a 
prop I have to describe what I have in the graph. It actually looked 
like a ski  jump with a real nice downward slope, both the U.S. and 
Canada following that downward slope with per capita cigarette 
consumption a little bit better in Canada than in the U.S.
<P>
	That lock step, that drop down, stopped in Canada quite abruptly 
in 1993. It actually then looked like a ski jump where it goes 
upward. The same thing does not happen in the U.S.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	Here we are back from 1970 to 1994 with the two countries 
moving together with excellent reduction in per capita cigarette 
consumption.
<P>
	Then boom, there was a change in 1993 which did not happen in 
the U.S. Two things happened in Canada to change our cigarette 
consumption, the tax rollback and the supreme court shut down of 
the legislative measures that Canada had in place.
<P>
	Second, I looked at a chart on Canadian tobacco consumption. 
Because tobacco consumption can be measured in many ways I 
chose one that looked to be the most accurate. It included domestic 
sales of tobacco and also the contraband market. It showed the 
number of Canadian cigarettes smuggled into Canada as best could 
be ascertained and all the contraband. It included other forms of 
consumption like consumption by returning residents bringing 
back their imports.
<P>
	The figures were really interesting. In 1991 compared to 1990 
there was a drop of 6.16 per cent in Canadian tobacco consumption. 
In 1992 there was a drop of 0.39 per cent, not as big a drop. In 1993 
there was a drop of 3.49 per cent. This is the same downward trend 
in total tobacco consumption in Canada. In 1994 there was a break 
in the trend with an increase of 9.2 per cent.
<P>
	With those independent studies in mind I determined that there 
was a vacuum in Canada that was being filled by the tobacco 
companies with glee. I looked at the tobacco companies' profit 
picture, which was very very good. There was a new group of 
youthful addicts and a new market for the tobacco companies.
<P>
	Because I believe in small government, the least intrusive 
legislation that is effective and enforceable and clearly specified 
regulations in legislation, I paused for a long time over legislative 
measures in this area. But the health of our youth is more important 
than restrictions on activities that are solely profit driven. That is 
why I have recommended to my colleagues that we push hard to see 
this legislation on the floor of the House of Commons.
<P>
	What do tobacco manufacturers do that every Canadian should 
know? I have spent a lot of time on this issue. I have listened very 
plainly to tobacco manufacturers say that they do not, want not and 
will not conscript youth to smoking.
<P>
	I have an internal tobacco company document that talks about 
the objectives of looking to sports as a mechanism of advancing the 
tobacco companies' interests. I will read part of it: ``To brand the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7123"> 7123 </A></B>
<P>
events''-sporting events-``we sponsor via media advertising so 
as to increase the level of awareness particularly among smokers 
and potential smokers''. The document goes on to say that these 
major world class sporting events and artistic productions will be 
the mechanisms.
<P>
	Off to the side there is a little note on the groups being targeted 
by these proposals. The first target group is composed of males age 
12 to 24. The second target group is composed of females age 12 to 
17. This is from a lobby group that says it will not, cannot and must 
not target youth for smoking. That document directly and 
completely makes that comment inaccurate. I could use much 
stronger words.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	On cancer, I have listened to the tobacco industry for years and 
years saying that there is no direct connection with cancer, that no 
direct connection has been proven. New genetic research has just 
surfaced which is conclusive: tobacco causes cancer. In fact, the 
member for the Bloc has actually mentioned the specific research.
<P>
	I have waited, watched and hoped for a retraction from the 
tobacco companies of this long held statement that tobacco does 
not have a direct link to cancer. I have waited and will continue to 
wait because that retraction has not and will not come.
<P>
	Another thing I pay attention to is the argument that sponsorship 
will cease and plunge the art groups into the wilderness if this 
legislation goes through. I went back to the record of the last round 
of tobacco legislation and found that this very argument was used. 
Without going into a long discussion on this, I extracted from 
hearings on Bill C-51 some information. The Royal Canadian Golf 
Association stated it would not be able to replace the tobacco 
sponsor of its Canadian open men's golf tournament if Bill C-51 
came in. Today those members who are interested golf would know 
that the event continues very successfully and the sponsor today is 
Bell Canada, which stepped in on the issue, very comfortably 
taking up the sponsorship vacuum.
<P>
	On the international experience, I am a real keen race car guy. 
Car races are sponsored by tobacco manufacturers. I have 
personally have competed in a big event where my car bore tobacco 
advertising. There is quite an international change away from 
allowing this type of advertising. Because I like racing, I watched 
the Formula I circuit. Jacques Villeneuve here in Canada has a very 
specific logo on his driving suit and on the wing of his car. I will 
not give the company extra advertising by saying what the 
company is. In France and Germany on the Formula I circuits there 
are no logos on the cars or on the suits.
<P>
	Can Canada do the same? Will the Formula I circuit, the Indy 
circuit and the rest of motor racing fall into an abyss because the 
sponsorship will be reduced? Not a chance.
<P>
	I have also watched the international moves by the U.S. It has 
taken some very dramatic steps on nicotine to recognize nicotine as
<P>
an addictive drug and to call the cigarette a drug delivery device. 
This is intellectually consistent and a very powerful way of 
changing the way tobacco is looked at in North America.
<P>
	So why fast track this bill? I would like to talk for a moment 
about the bill. We have pushed this legislation to the floor of the 
House of Commons by saying that we would fast track it. I believe 
there were some internal division in the government and I believe 
they were actually paralyzing the government. It took 18 months 
for Jake Epp to bring Bill C-51 through the process. If it had taken 
18 months to put this bill through the process, I could not face 
myself with a new generation of youthful smokers. I think Jake Epp 
went through a legislative process which was awful.
<P>
	I said I would not try and nit pick on the bill, but I have a couple 
of criticisms. The undefined, unspecified powers granted in the bill 
are too broad. This is in the regulatory component. I and my 
colleagues will work to define and specify those powers.
<P>
	We do not always have to be serious in the House of Commons. 
There are a couple of things in the bill that are a real chuckle. I am 
going to read this for the Canadian public. Clause 10(1) states: ``No 
person shall sell cigarettes, except in a package that contains fewer 
than 20 cigarettes'' and it goes on ``or fewer than a prescribed 
number of cigarettes, which number shall be more than 20''. I hope 
there is a wording mess-up in the bill because I have asked as many 
of my colleagues as I could what that clause means. I figured 
maybe I had gone senile. I hope it is a misprint.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	There is a regulation which appears on page 12 of the bill: ``The 
governor in council may make regulations''-and then we flip over 
to paragraph (i)-``prescribing anything that by this part is to be 
prescribed''. We are talking about big powers. The governor in 
council could turn aircraft into land machines with that sort of 
power.
<P>
	As I say, I believe those regulatory powers must be defined and 
specified. I would like to see and have continued to hope for the 
health committee, when regulatory powers come in, be the actual 
spot where these things are reviewed by elective representatives so 
the governor in council will not be able to just steamroller things 
along.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to say something to my smoking audience. I 
know they enjoy smoking. I know they accept the risks of smoking. 
This is to my colleagues as well. I do  not believe this bill is 
directed to them. It is directed mostly to the kids. However, I want 
to say to them that the most poignant quitters I have been involved 
with in my years of trying to get people to quit smoking are those 
who quit because of a comment made by little Johnnie, who comes 
home from school and says something like: ``Daddy, please don't 
smoke. I love you. I want you to quit smoking. I need you nearby''. 
Those smokers quit because a little one they love cares for them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7124"> 7124 </A></B>
<P>
and says``please quit smoking''. I have very little trouble with 
those smokers. When they wanted to quit, they quit quickly.
<P>
	This bill should now go to committee. Reformers will still work 
hard for specific improvements in committee. Consequently, I 
move:
<P>

the Reform Party of Canada decided to deny me my right to speak 
on the matter by putting forward a motion in this House to delay the 
voting on this.
<P>
	I am wondering if I could then get the consent of the House to 
allow me to put forward the views of my constituents. As you

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXCISETAXACT">EXCISE TAX ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from December 4 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-70, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, the Income Tax Act, 
the Debt Servicing and Reduction Account Act and related acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on this bill today. It includes 
changes to the Excise Tax Act which would remove the notional 
input tax credit of the GST from the used good sector.
<P>
	Prior to April 1993 registered dealers in used goods were eligible 
to apply for and receive the notional input tax credit. However, the 
government is choosing to remove that tax credit. That will kill 
jobs because it will embed the GST into used good services. It hurts 
those who are most under privileged in our society because it 
affects used goods and used goods more often than not are 
purchased by those in the middle class and the lowest 
socioeconomic classes.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Let us take a broader look at this picture because it has 
implications in terms of job losses and costs to the consumer. It is 
really just another tax charged by this government which has 
claimed repeatedly that it has not raised any new taxes.
<P>
	We are concerned because this is going to affect between 4 to 6 
per cent of our gross domestic product. It is going to affect tens of 
thousands of individuals who sell used goods. There are 20,000 
used car dealers in this country. By removing this notional input tax 
credit, the NITC, the people who are selling these used goods are 
having to embed the cost or pass it on to the consumer. That means 
either the seller is going to swallow it or more likely the consumer 
is going to pay. Many used car dealerships function on a very low 
profit margin.
<P>
	In effect, the government is increasing taxes. It will cause job 
losses and push up the cost of living for people, particularly those 
who are most disadvantaged in our society.
<P>
	The removal of the NITC is something called tax cascading, 
something that the government repeatedly said it would not do. Yet 
once again the government is embedding the GST, that tax that it 
said it was going to remove, and enshrining it into these goods that 
affect 6 per cent of our GDP, which is not a small number.
<P>
	It is illogical for the government to do this in view of its repeated 
assertions that it would not raise taxes to the consumer.
<P>
	The number of jobs that will be lost is unknown right now. We 
imagine that the number will be somewhere in the order of 6 to 8 
per cent in the groups which are dealing with used goods. It also 
encourages the underground economy. Any time taxes are 
increased the underground economy goes up. In fact, members of 
the government, including the Minister of Finance, said that the 
GST is going to increase the underground economy by increasing 
the cost to the consumer.
<P>
	All we have to do is go back to our ridings to see that the 
underground economy is alive and thriving, in large part because 
the consumer and the producer feel that they are being taxed to the 
hilt. People are not imagining that they are being taxed to the hilt. 
The reality is that our taxes are some of the highest in the 
industrialized world.
<P>
	As I said before, it is a tax grab. As it is going to affect the used 
goods market it is going to affect those people who rely on that 
market. Generally those people are in the lowest socioeconomic 
classes. We did a few studies in the maritimes. We found that in one 
business alone the removal of the NITC will cost them nearly 
$90,000 which is going to translate into job losses.
<P>
	This whole concept belies a much more insidious problem and 
that is the GST. The government came to power on the promise that 
the GST would be abolished. It staked its reputation on it. The 
Deputy Prime Minister had to resign over the issue and many other 
members said that they were going to scrap the GST.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance said that the goods and services tax is a 
stupid, inept and incompetent tax. The Prime Minister said that 
public and private libraries will have to reduce their purchases of 
books, periodicals and newspapers by about 10 per cent annually 
because of the GST. The Minister of Labour said the following: 
``We created a monster. Now we have an underground  economy so 
big that no one can even account for it. It affects people, human 
beings''. While government members were in opposition they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7128"> 7128 </A></B>
<P>
emphatically stated they were going to remove this tax. Have they? 
No.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	It really grates when the government repeatedly says that it has 
not increased taxes at all. The facts are that it has increased taxes 
22 times since it came to power by embedding taxes such as the 
removal of the NITC, and by harmonization which I will get to in a 
moment.
<P>
	It has also increased gasoline taxes, yet it says to the public: ``We 
have not increased taxes''. All one has to do is go to the pumps to 
find that taxes have increased. The way the government is doing 
this will hurt those on fixed incomes and those in the lowest 
socioeconomic groups. When taxes are embedding into goods that 
are consumed by everybody, everyone is not hurt equally. Those 
who hurt the most are on fixed incomes with the least flexibility.
<P>
	Another thing the government did to increase the taxes was the 
harmonization of taxes in the maritimes. This was a $1 billion deal 
subsidized by taxpayers outside of the maritimes. Even within the 
maritimes there was great rancour over this. It is going to increase 
the cost to the consumer. This blended sales tax will do the 
following to business.
<P>
	The three major retailers in Atlantic Canada do not find this 
acceptable at all. In fact, they figure that their net annual retail 
deficit will total $27 million when harmonization is implemented. 
That means jobs are lost.
<P>
	The Retail Council of Canada said that by forcing stores to bury 
the new tax prices, the harmonized taxes regime will cost retailers 
at least $100 million per year. That is absolutely staggering. That is 
not a benign figure. One hundred million dollars translates into job 
loss.
<P>
	Reform came to the House not to merely criticize the 
government but to put forward good solutions. My colleague for 
Medicine Hat has done a superb job on finance and has made a 
number of good suggestions, as has my colleague from 
Capilano-Howe Sound.
<P>
	Reform proposes that the GST be lowered and ultimately 
scrapped after the debt is under control. Reform has put forward a 
plan to get that debt under control in two years. We are also going 
to provide tax relief to Canadians. Why? Because money in 
people's pockets will enable them to take care of themselves. 
People do not have the money in their pockets today to even 
provide for their basic needs. That is why we see children going to 
school hungry. There are people who cannot buy the basic 
necessities for their families. Given the current tax burden on our 
society is why companies are unable to hire people.
<P>
	In 1992 when the Conservative government decreased taxes, 
income and revenue to the federal coffers actually  increased. What 
did the government do? The Conservative government of the day 
went on an orgy of taxation, introduced the GST and then 
government revenues fell off. That is a real life example that shows 
that making a tax cut will actually stimulate the economy and will 
increase moneys in the public coffers. I think that is an important 
thing to realize.
<P>
	We have a responsibility to Canadians to provide them with a 
fair taxation system. My colleagues in the Reform Party have made 
proposals for a flat tax system that provides for equal taxation to all 
people, and most importantly it greatly diminishes the taxation on 
the lowest socioeconomic groups. Those who are poorest in our 
society will be better off under Reform's financial proposal than 
they currently are with the government. I encourage the 
government, in fact implore it, to look at Reform's policies on 
finance because they are going to save our social programs. It is 
going to provide more money for the poor and the underprivileged. 
It is going to stimulate the economy, create jobs and provide a 
stronger and healthier Canada today and in the future for all 
Canadians.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
also want to speak on this motion. It is important for Canadians to 
know what this motion is about. This motion is essentially a-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
apologize to my hon. colleague. I understood that on resuming 
debate we were into normal debate followed by questions and 
comments. Is that what we are doing?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is a reasonable question that the 
parliamentary secretary is putting. The five hours have expired so 
we are now down to 10-minute speeches and no questions or 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is important for all Canadians to 
understand the motion. We refer to it has a hoist motion, meaning 
that the member who put this motion forward would like Bill C-70, 
an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, to be now read a second time 
this day six months hence. Essentially it would delay the whole 
issue.
<P>
	Taxation and excise taxes are things which are very well known 
in my riding of Haldimand-Norfolk. There are a number of 
farmers and other people in my riding who contribute to the tax 
system. Specifically, there are a number of tobacco farmers in my 
riding. Taxes like the GST and the Excise Tax Act the Minister of 
Finance has now put on tobacco products affect the people in my 
riding. I want to talk a little bit about how this happens.
<P>
	A study was done in my area, called the ``Economic 
Contribution of the Tobacco Industry in the Tobacco Growing 
Region of Ontario'' by Deloitte &amp; Touche. Essentially it was found 
that in terms of taxation the tobacco industry in the area studied 
provides $453 million in income and 70 per cent of that money 
stays within 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7129"> 7129 </A></B>
<P>
the area and of the 9,423 full time equivalent jobs, 76 per cent of 
those stay within the study area.
<P>
	The study comprised an area in my riding in southwestern 
Ontario. It dealt with the economic contributions of the tobacco 
industry in that area. It also dealt with the taxation question we are 
dealing with today. This is an important study. I want to ensure that 
all Canadians know the importance of this industry in a small 
concentrated area in rural southwestern Ontario.
<P>
	My area is also home to the largest native reserve in the country. 
The whole question of how natives are taxed is always on the lips 
of Canadians. It is important to know the impact of taxation on the 
smuggling industry and how smuggling has been cut back as a 
result of the fact that our government lowered the excise tax on 
tobacco products some two years ago.
<P>
	It was interesting to hear some of the comments in the earlier 
debate. Some comments of Reform Party members cut off debate 
on that very important issue. I know we are not talking about that 
debate now, but it is important to note that the Reform Party did cut 
off debate on that issue.
<P>
	The issue we are dealing with now is the six month hoist on Bill 
C-70 which is a GST matter. Those three letters concern a number 
of Canadians, as does the whole question of excise taxes and taxes 
specifically in my area on tobacco products. One hundred and 
fifty-seven million dollars in tax revenues, including GST, come 
into-
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order.
<P>
	For those people out in TV land, I would like to clarify what the 
hon. member is saying. We had a process which unfortunately 
came a bit unravelled a while ago on Bill C-71, the tobacco bill. In 
fact it was not the Reform Party that shut down debate. We put 
forward a motion to allow the question to be put and the Speaker 
was the one who shut down debate, not the Reform Party. I would 
like that clarification on the record.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That will not come out of the hon. 
member's time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to note from the hon. 
member's comments that the Reform Party which supposedly calls 
for total debate on these issues put forward a motion to essentially 
cut off the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Why do you not speak on the 
merits of an issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Reform put the motion forward and I think it is 
shameful.
<P>
	On Bill C-70 and the hoist motion, it is important to understand 
what it means for a rural area such as mine. In my area there are a 
significant number of tobacco  farmers. On this whole question of 
taxation and excise taxes their point of view should be heard, 
whether or not the Reform Party wants it heard.
<P>
	Getting back to what I was saying about the importance of 
taxation, of the GST and the legislation, in my area $14 million 
goes to local governments. The whole tax question is important to 
the local economy. An enormous amount of work has been done by 
a group in this area. It breaks down specifically some of the 
percentages of the total effect on employment in the area and the 
impact of taxes such as these on a farming community like mine.
<P>
	These farmers were encouraged by previous governments to 
come to my area of southwestern Ontario to grow tobacco and 
build communities such as Delhi, Tillsonburg and Aylmer. 
Throughout this area the tobacco farmers pay taxes. It is important 
to put their point of view forward here today.
<P>
	In terms of the legislation the hon. member referred to, I do not 
think most farmers in my area will have a problem with that bill. 
Even though it addresses some questions in terms of dealing with 
how young people get access to tobacco, I do not think it is 
specifically directed at the tobacco industry. However a taxation 
bill, an excise tax by the Minister of Finance and the tax he put on 
tobacco companies will have a direct impact and I will explain how 
this relates to the House.
<P>
	In 1994 when we put on the tax the major companies did not take 
that tax out of their profits. In fact, it came out of the pockets of the 
farmers in my area. The price the farmers got kept going down as a 
result of governments applying taxes. I am sure it will be similar in 
this case also.
<P>
	Most Canadians, especially the people in my area of 
Haldimand-Norfolk do not like the idea of more government 
taxes. It is important for us as a government to put forward 
programs which do not require more taxation. I congratulate the 
Minister of Finance for not raising taxes in that regard. It is 
important for the government to show that it can live within its own 
means. If we are going to provide services in the country, they 
should be provided in such a way that they do not add to the debt or 
the deficit and that the cost does not come out of the pockets of 
Canadians. The Minister of Finance has done that very well over 
the last number of years.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	We made a promise to Canadians to do something about the 
GST. Whether or not, as the opposition likes to say, we promised to 
scrap it or to reform it, one of the most important things we did in 
bringing in this tax was to ensure that Canadian small businesses 
were not hurt as they were when Mr. Mulroney and the 
Conservatives brought in the original tax. The Minister of Finance 
has made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7130"> 7130 </A></B>
<P>
over 100 changes which will help small businesses. Canadians 
especially in the eastern part of the country will be proud of that.
<P>
	Hopefully one day Ontario will have a system which requires us 
to pay only one tax so that when people go to the till the tax will not 
be staring them in the face. That more than anything else will help 
to turn people's opinions around in terms of what they purchase. 
Harmonization will help all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-70, which seeks to amend 
certain aspects of the GST. My initial reaction when I reviewed this 
legislation was: ``Poor Canadian federalists. The more things 
change, the more they stay the same''.
<P>
	Over the years, all kinds of programs were created to try to buy 
peace in some part of Canada, and this is the case once again. 
Before talking about the unfair benefits and the special status being 
granted to the Atlantic provinces, we must first pass moral 
judgment on this government.
<P>
	For three years now, the government has systematically done the 
opposite of what it promised. In the case of unemployment 
insurance, it implemented the reform that the Conservatives had in 
mind, but only after condemning it throughout the election 
campaign. As for the GST, it was supposed to disappear. Such was 
the position of the Liberals, and also one of their major 
commitments.
<P>
	Today, three years later, the government comes up with a 
proposed amendment which, instead of eliminating the GST, 
makes it even worse. We never promised to kill the GST, because 
the principle of a tax on goods and services is not necessarily bad, 
but the Liberals did so when they formed the opposition. During 
the election campaign, they said the GST was bad and that they 
would make fundamental changes to it. The Liberals did not fulfil 
their commitment. This is how governments lose their credibility.
<P>
	What really gets members from Quebec is this government's 
double standard. On the one hand, the Government of Quebec has 
harmonized its provincial sales tax with the GST for a number of 
years now, and it has done so without asking for compensation, 
because there was never any talk of any. Plans were made so that it 
would be done properly, it was and it works.
<P>
	Suddenly, in the last year, we learned, when all was said and 
done, that the maritimes were going to be paid $1 billion to 
harmonize with the GST. There is no reference to this in the bill, 
not a trace. But the facts are there. There is the fact that, in a 
shameless display of window dressing, harmonization with the 
GST will cost $1 billion. Is this how the Liberal government is 
going to try to make Atlantic Canadians forget their anger over  
employment insurance reform? I do not think this is the way to go 
about it.
<P>
	They had an opportunity to come up with a truly dynamic 
employment insurance reform that would allow a community to 
take responsibility for itself, to develop, but they preferred to base 
their reform on the following principle: ``If there are no jobs where 
you live, you must move somewhere else'', rather than the 
following principle: ``The government has a responsibility to 
ensure that an area's resources are used in the manner most 
conducive to its development''. This principle was ignored in the 
employment insurance reform and another substituted for it.
<P>
	But then, with an election looming, we are suddenly hit with the 
news of this wonderful $1 billion in compensation. Imagine what 
this does for competitiveness. It means that Quebecers will pay 
$250 million in taxes to help the maritime economy harmonize 
with the GST. It is completely unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	It is as though you suddenly decided to pay the heating costs for 
a third of the town by billing the rest of the inhabitants, but not 
supplying them with any heat, and using their wood in the bargain. 
This leads to major problems that are unacceptable.
<P>
	Perhaps it is a political gift, so that the maritimes will be more 
receptive to UI reform, but I have to say that $1 billion in 
compensation to the maritimes over the next four years is a large 
amount.
<P>
	Furthermore, in future, all Canadians will have to pay more in 
equalization payments to the maritimes. That is why I say that, the 
more Canadian federalism changes, the more it stays the same. 
Time and again, we see that it is an uncontrollable beast, which 
tries to balance things artificially rather than allowing the various 
components to evolve naturally.
<P>
	Canada-wide harmonization is not for tomorrow. The proof lies 
in the way in which each province guards its jurisdiction, the 
responses from the west. We are facing a situation that will go on 
for several years. This compensation sets up a double standard in 
Canada. It is completely unacceptable.
<P>
	The Liberal government, and particularly candidates in Quebec 
ridings, will have to answer about this in the next election. They 
will be asked why they gave $1 billion in compensation to the 
maritimes, but nothing to us, who did our work properly. How will 
they see that we are compensated? There will probably be a number 
of proposals on the table, but that will not deal with the fact that we 
have a double standard here.
<P>
	The procedure being implemented is somewhat insulting to the 
maritimes, even if they are getting compensation. Ways could be 
found to improve the economy other than by giving them special 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7131"> 7131 </A></B>
<P>
status in this respect, compared with other Canadians. This will 
make for unfair competition.
<P>
	Part of my riding is right next door to New Brunswick. Consider 
the following: we have two regions, Madawaska in New Brunswick 
and Témiscouata in Quebec, and a decision by the federal 
government has changed the rules of the game. The same side has 
all the advantages. The next thing you know, some Quebec 
federalists will say it is up to the Government of Quebec to deal 
with the problem. The lack of fairness in federalism is one of the 
major drawbacks of our system. It may be egalitarian, but it is not 
fair. The Liberal government will pay the price in the next election.
<P>
	During the few minutes I have left, I would like to emphasize the 
positive impact of the battle fought by members of the Bloc 
Quebecois in the last Parliament. I am referring to the members for 
Richelieu, Lac-Saint-Jean, Saint-Hubert, Longueuil, Hull-Aylmer, 
Rosemont, Shefford and Laurier-Sainte-Marie. They fought 
non-stop to remove the GST on books.
<P>
	Today we see the results, although is a partial, not a complete 
success. The Bloc Quebecois always wanted the tax on books 
removed altogether and to have the whole book industry exempt 
from the GST because this has a major cultural impact. We have 
won at least half the battle.
<P>
	We fought for this from the very beginning, and now all books 
purchased by institutions engaged in literacy training, schools and 
public libraries will be exempt from this tax. This is quite an 
achievement. Congratulations are in order for the members who 
worked unceasingly from the word go to obtain this exemption. 
The government could have gone further by accepting the Bloc's 
request that books not be taxed. Books are a jewel in the crown of 
our cultural industry.
<P>
	This is how Quebecers and Canadians often have a chance to 
make a name for themselves. It is what gave Quebec and Canadian 
culture a chance to take its place in the North American market, the 
world market and the francophonie and do so in a way that is 
financially profitable.
<P>
	The battle fought by Bloc members, and there were only eight at 
the time, has finally produced results. Since we formed the official 
opposition, we continued the struggle, and now we have won half 
the battle.
<P>
	You may rest assured that we will continue our fight to have the 
tax on books removed altogether, which will have a real impact on 
the cultural industry, so that our authors will get the recognition 
they deserve and be proud of what we are doing.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	This then, in short, is legislation that exempts certain books from 
taxation but that creates incredible inequity for Quebec and the 
regions bordering on Quebec,  especially as far as the maritimes are 
concerned. For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois can never 
vote in support of this bill as it now stands. It creates two types of 
citizens, of taxpayers: those who live in the maritimes, who pay 
less sales tax thanks to the federal government's contribution, and 
the others. It in fact encourages governments to adopt a certain 
laissez-faire approach to managing their affairs. It encourages them 
to say: ``We will be able to spend a little more; the federal 
government will compensate us for it''. It is as if the government 
was trying to use a tax measure to reduce differences in income and 
in quality of life in Canada. This is not how to go about it.
<P>
	The way to do it is to establish the principle that we will allow 
each region to develop its economy to the best of its ability, using 
its natural and human resources to the fullest, and that Canada's 
entire political and economic system will be based on that. No 
problem can be resolved by providing under the table 
compensation on sales tax. This creates an unnatural situation in 
the market, which goes against all current economic trends where 
the thrust is to emphasize the quality of our resources through 
ability and the possibility of competing on an equal footing.
<P>
	Now, with the new law, there is no equal footing. The Atlantic 
provinces are told: ``You will have a special advantage''. Why do 
the people in the Atlantic provinces enjoy this advantage, when 
eastern Quebec, the Gaspé, the Lower St. Lawrence, the North 
Shore and the other regions of Quebec face the same economic 
difficulties as the maritimes? Why give Madawaska an advantage 
and not compensate Quebec in order to give Témiscouata the same 
advantage? This is unacceptable. This could in fact encourage 
Quebec consumers to go and buy in the maritimes. I think the 
federal government is once again not playing fair, to the advantage 
of the maritime provinces. In the past, it was to Ontario's 
advantage, particularly in research and development.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will vote against this 
bill and will put the following question to all federal Liberal 
candidates in Quebec in the election campaign: ``Do you think it is 
fair to give the maritimes $1 billion in compensation for the GST?''
<P>

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to be speaking to this bill today on the harmonization of

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. Actually we are supposed to 
alternate across the floor. It should be the turn of the hon. member 
for Lambton-Middlesex. Would the member for Fraser Valley 
West wait 10 minutes to give his intervention?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I will do a penance of 10 
minutes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7132"> 7132 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> A point of order, Mr. Speaker. If the hon. members 
from the government side are not ready and prepared when they 
should be, why should we be allowing them to speak? They should 
wait for us for 10 minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is quite right. I did see 
the hon. member for Fraser Valley West, but in fairness it was also 
known to all of us that it should go by rotation an my zeal at seeing 
the hon. member for Fraser Valley West caused me to recognize 
him instead of remembering that very important principle of 
alternates. The hon. member for London-Middlesex.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know it is hard to have peripheral vision but I too was 
standing when my hon. colleague was standing, and I thank the 
hon. member for letting me speak.
<P>
	I do not want to take up valuable House time with further 
justification of restructured, harmonized federal-provincial sales 
tax. The facts have been clearly and convincingly addressed by my 
colleagues regarding Bill C-70.
<P>
	The HST will eliminate hidden taxes that inflate prices and hurt 
exports. It is a simpler, more transparent system for consumers and 
business. An integrated approach makes possible a lower overall 
sales tax rate.
<P>
	What I want to focus on today is an aspect of this legislation that 
has too often been attacked by those who place partisan politics and 
narrow regionalisms ahead of clear objective thought.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	This issue is a decision by the government to provide a formula 
for short term adjustment assistance to provinces when they face 
significant structural costs to participate in the new system. Under 
this system adjustment assistance becomes available to the 
provinces that experience a revenue shortfall in excess of 5 per cent 
of their current retail sales tax receipts because they moved to a 
single harmonized sales tax system.
<P>
	For qualifying provinces, in this case Newfoundland, New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia, the formula means that the federal 
government will provide full compensation for the revenue 
shortfall. That is the shortfall over 5 per cent of the current retail 
sales tax in one year, the same full compensation for the shortfalls 
in year two, half the amount of the shortfalls in year three, and 25 
per cent of the provincial revenue shortfalls in year four.
<P>
	This is a short term measure designed for the period of 
significant transition these provinces will be going through. It will 
end after four years, providing the provinces with sufficient time to 
adjust to the harmonized system.
<P>
	It is important to note this is truly a joint program, not a one way 
gift. Under this formula there is near equal sharing between the 
federal government and qualifying provinces of the adjustment 
costs harmonization will entail over the four years.
<P>
	Over the four year period the total adjustment assistance under 
the harmonization agreement with the three Atlantic provinces will 
be $960 million. I remind the House of what the finance minister 
has emphasized. This spending has been incorporated into our 
financial planning and will not jeopardize the federal deficit targets 
we have set out.
<P>
	Some Canadians have asked why provinces cannot phase in full 
harmonization over several years, thereby eliminating the need for 
assistance. This approach has been tried in Quebec over the last six 
years. Unfortunately the result runs counter to making the new 
simpler for business. While it allows the provinces greater fiscal 
flexibility, the business community, especially small business, has 
made it clear that it prefers a one step approach to harmonization 
rather than the approach taken by Quebec.
<P>
	The Quebec approach resulted in significant complexity and 
compliance costs for business. It meant adjusting to a new system 
and new rates in each of the transaction years. This greatly reduced 
the economic benefits of harmonization for the province as a 
whole. Because of Quebec's experience the three participating 
provinces have chosen to move to a single tax system all at once on 
April 1, 1997.
<P>
	I am disappointed that some Canadians have attacked the entire 
concept of this adjustment assistance for a harmonized sales tax. 
They have a mindset that ignores history, misreads the present and 
lacks vision for the future.
<P>
	Canadian history makes clear that government has played an 
essential role in our economic evolution and adjustments. Some 
examples of this role are tax and land grant support for the national 
railway system, negotiation of our Autopact, development of the 
St. Lawrence Seaway, megaprojects from Lloydminster to 
Hibernia, special tax conditions for oil and gas, research and 
development and small businesses. The list is long and honourable.
<P>
	Many of these government actions and investments respond to 
opportunities but there is also a long and proud list of federal 
assistance for sectors and regions that face economic difficulties 
and dislocations or that must confront core structural change.
<P>
	Equalization payments are an essential part of our constitutional 
framework. They recognize that all of Canada is stronger as a 
society and as a marketplace when we help less affluent provinces 
provide a basic level of public support and service.
<P>
	In 1972 when the federal government instituted the income tax 
reform, every single province received adjustment assistance 
which totalled more than $2.7 billion over a seven year period. 
More recently the  federal government has provided assistance to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7133"> 7133 </A></B>
<P>
farmers following the collapse of world grain prices. It is now 
providing compensation for the elimination of the Crow rate.
<P>
	We have provided bottom line support for the maritime fishers 
who were confronted with the tragedy of the decimation of fish 
stocks. We shared equally in the cost of solving the tobacco 
smuggling problem in Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	These actions were neither charity nor partisan politics. These 
were actions of fairness, equality and the principles this country 
was built on. They are an essential reflection of the contract 
Canadians have struck with themselves, a nation building contract 
that says a critical role for government is to help when help is truly 
needed and where it can be truly effective. That takes me to the 
present.
<P>
	Today we have to manage the commitment to assistance with 
more vigour, innovation and insight than ever before.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	The world of global competition for trade, for investment, 
business opportunities and jobs demands that government remain 
constant and conscientious of the bottom line. A government that 
squanders resources imposed on the nation, the cost of high deficit, 
high taxes and high interests, these are job killers, future killers, 
hope destroyers.
<P>
	It is this same challenging competitive environment that 
demands government continue to play a role in helping citizens, 
sectors and regions to meet their global challenge. It has to be a 
role in applying methods that work with today's resources in ways 
that will deliver effective, efficient advantage for future success 
and economic benefit. That is exactly what the government is doing 
with adjustment assistance for sales tax harmonization.
<P>
	As a member from the province of Ontario, I believe it is a 
shame that the Harris government at Queen's Park has missed this 
opportunity to get onboard with Canada's harmonized sales tax. Let 
us not forget that on June 7, 1995 during Ontario's election 
campaign, Premier Harris said he was prepared to work with the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance toward a simpler 
unified tax, that it seems ludicrous to have two different taxes, two 
bureaucracies to collect it and more paperwork.
<P>
	Regrettably the Ontario Tories are now arguing that 
harmonization would shift taxes from businesses to consumers. 
They have also claimed that adjustment assistance is a bribe to 
other provinces. As I have just shown, it is nothing of that sort, and 
indeed Ontario regularly benefits from adjustment assistance of 
various kinds paid to Ontario such as stabilization payments each 
year.
<P>
	The door is still open for Ontario to join this new harmonized 
federal-provincial sales tax. The advantages for business would be 
tremendous. Ontario is Canada's major manufacturer and exporter 
and since harmonization means improved competitiveness that 
means more jobs. I am convinced that no province would benefit 
more from harmonization than Ontario. The longer Ontario waits 
to harmonize, the more business and consumer loss will be.
<P>
	If we work together through the format in the approach our 
government has set, the result will be a tax system that makes it 
stronger, that helps deliver more jobs and is fairer to all of us. I 
support the compensation formula this legislation provides and that 
is why I urge all hon. members to put aside political grandstanding 
and join the government in supporting this legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Fraser Valley West, 
with apologies to him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
recall a couple of weeks ago when a similar thing happen to me. 
The Chair at the time did not afford me the opportunity to speak, 
but I thought I would not do the same to my Liberal colleague.
<P>
	Before we get farther down the road on the harmonization of the 
tax, several comments were made here earlier with regard to Bill 
C-71 and how that debate was cut off. The fact is my colleague 
from Macleod basically introduced a motion that the question be 
put. The intent was that we could be debating one motion and not 
have an introduction of numerous amendments. It was the 
Speaker's responsibility at that time to decide whether the debate 
was to be cut off and go to the question, not the responsibility of my 
hon. colleague.
<P>
	The member for Haldimand-Norfolk, who has been 
complaining about not having representation here in the House 
because the Reform Party did something, should look toward the 
Chair for the guidance in future occasions. Far be it from any 
Liberal here in this House to complain that they have not had the 
opportunity to speak when, after all, they invoke closure in this 
House so many times one can hardly recall if it is the race between 
the Conservatives or the Liberals for cutting off debate in the 
House of Commons. I think the hon. member should look at that 
and consider where his own party stands on cutting off debate in 
this House.
<P>
	With regard to the GST and the harmonization of the GST in the 
Atlantic provinces, having spent some time there this year the GST 
in many cases is really not a concern to many people because there 
is such an underground economy there, as there is in other places 
across this country. It is really a moot point at times.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	In reading through the papers from Halifax in particular and 
reading editorials, I found some very realistic comments. I would 
like to give a few. Nova  Scotia finance minister Bill Gillis had no 
business signing the deal of BST, the blended sales tax. The public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7134"> 7134 </A></B>
<P>
did not see the details and the MLAs did not debate it. Just like that, 
it was done overnight behind closed doors.
<P>
	This is kind of typical. I know the folks in Nova Scotia want the 
Liberals out and the Conservatives out but they do not know who to 
bring in because the Conservatives and Liberals in that province 
have not really served them well, much like the Conservatives and 
Liberals federally in this country have not served Canadians all that 
well. If they had we would not have situations like an enormous 
debt of $600 million and trying to service that debt with $47 billion 
a year, crime that is not being addressed, the situation in the House 
of Commons where we feel democratic principles are really amiss 
and even to a large extent not here.
<P>
	We have to look at the whole issue of taxation, why we are here, 
how we got here, who got us here and why all of a sudden we are 
talking about three provinces out of this whole federation which 
made a deal to blend or to harmonize the GST with the provincial 
sales taxes.
<P>
	One has to only look at the type of governments those three 
provinces have. Surprisingly, if anyone can believe this, they are all 
Liberal governments. For those at home listening, from British 
Columbia and other provinces, I truly wonder what my home 
province would have been sitting on today had that province been 
Liberal. We should think about that because if that is the kind of 
provincial representation we get in this country, that we make a 
deal with the senior party of the Liberals, regardless of the cost to 
the people in that province, then something is terribly wrong in this 
land.
<P>
	I would suggest that the harmonization of the GST is not the 
problem but a symptom of the problem. It is a deal made at the cost 
of the people in those provinces because there is an affiliation 
between the provincial Liberals and federal Liberals that is so 
strong that it overrides the good of the people. That is wrong.
<P>
	So they are going to take a combined rate of 18.77 per cent and 
apply it on a different basis; now the 15 per cent overall tax. They 
say it is good because it has gone down three percentage points. 
However, what they did not bother to tell people is that they will be 
paying it on things that they have never paid it on before.
<P>
	I know parts of my family in Nova Scotia and parts of my family 
in Newfoundland are waking up to the same realities. None have a 
lot of money but they have the same realities that many people in 
this land are waking up with. It is just another disgusting tax by a 
government that really does not care. It is cash starved and it is 
going to get it any way it can.
<P>
	BST, blended sales tax, HST, harmonized sales tax, GST, PST, 
ST, S, whatever we want to call these things, the taxpayer is sick 
and tired and fed up. If there is one thing I can forecast in this 
country it is that the Liberal  government will fall on its inability to 
understand that people are sick and tired of taxes for the sake of 
money going to the wrong places in this country.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	The real effects of blending the provincial tax and the GST will 
put people in Atlantic Canada through the blender. That is the 
problem. They do not seem to understand. That is all right. We will 
make a change.
<P>
	The Metropolitan Halifax Chamber of Commerce does not 
support this without changes.
<P>
	It is interesting when members opposite say ``it is supported, we 
talked to all kinds of people''. I do not recall anybody in my family 
ever being asked about it. I know for a fact that the provincial 
government in Nova Scotia did not even debate it. That is kind of 
sad.
<P>
	I think of issues like child poverty, which this government 
expounds on time after time without thinking that if we have child 
poverty, how did we get there. I will tell the House why we have 
child poverty in Canada today, poverty of any kind. We got there 
because of governments' inability to understand that the more they 
borrow, the more they owe. Over the last 25 years both the federal 
Conservatives and the federal Liberals have borrowed well beyond 
their means and ability to pay back. That is why we have poverty in 
this country.
<P>
	That is why, rather than looking at cutting back on the GST, they 
are looking at irresponsible and ridiculous ways to hide it. They are 
not getting rid of it. Out of sight, out of mind; that is their idea. 
There is no courage to cut it back.
<P>
	For all those listening, I sincerely hope they will remember that 
this is the government which started borrowing. This is the 
government which is trying to hide the GST. The other 
government, which is no longer a party, is the government that 
brought in the GST. Think about that when walking up to the ballot 
box.
<P>
	It is time for a big change in this land. The Achilles' heel is here 
in the GST and in the government's inability to understand that 
more taxes will mean further debt and less ability to pay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-70.
<P>
	The hon. member for Fraser Valley West conveniently forgot 
about the fact that the Atlantic premiers right now are going across 
Canada telling Canadians that because of the harmonized sales tax 
they have created a competitive advantage for companies which are 
located in Atlantic Canada. The harmonized sales tax will reduce or 
eliminate the embedded provincial sales tax which is already part 
of the cost structure of companies in provinces other than those 
which have harmonized their sales tax.
<P>
	It is curious that the hon. member for Fraser Valley West also 
ignored that Canadians are saying they want  the tax included when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7135"> 7135 </A></B>
<P>
they go to the cash register. They want it included because they are 
tired of going to the cash register, having the tax added and not 
knowing what price they are going to pay. Again the Reform Party 
is just not listening.
<P>
	Until now the GST has had a bewildering array of complicated 
and sometimes contradictory rules for complying with the federal 
sales tax system in this country. Bill C-70, with its 130 or more 
amendments to the federal GST, goes a long way toward sorting out 
the confusion and easing the compliance burden. This bill responds 
to the views of Canadians across the country. Their message is very 
simple: Keep it simple and make the rules clear. I am very pleased 
to support the bill in the House today.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	We have already heard why a value added tax is needed in 
Canada. Again the Atlantic provinces are taking full advantage of 
harmonizing their sales tax. It is creating a competitive 
disadvantage for companies in provinces like Ontario and other 
provinces which have higher costs. Over the medium and long run, 
companies in provinces that have not harmonized their sales tax 
will be competitively disadvantaged. I too have some concerns that 
the GST creates some anxiety for consumers, but in the medium 
and long run we will be more competitive if we harmonize our tax.
<P>
	Others have spoken about the efforts made to implement the 
value added tax to make its rules more fair and simple. I would like 
to take this a step further by emphasizing some of the specific steps 
we have taken to clarify the more confusing aspects of the federal 
sales tax system in Canada. In many respects clarity is the source of 
simplicity and fairness. Once the rules, procedures and rationale 
are clear, Canadians will have a better understanding of both how 
and when the value added tax system applies to them. In the short 
history of the GST this has not always been the case.
<P>
	We have heard how confusing the current tax legislation is 
regarding municipal services, with some services being exempt but 
similar services being taxable, depending on the circumstances. 
This situation has led to confusion and a perception of unfairness. 
By making most municipal services tax exempt, the government 
will clarify the situation and create a more level playing field. The 
compliance burden will be eased since municipalities and their 
appointed bodies will no longer be confused about when and if a 
service is taxable.
<P>
	Specifically the situation regarding recyclable products will be 
cleared up. Under existing legislation there is confusion about the 
appropriate tax treatment for collecting these products. Are they 
garbage and therefore tax exempt, or are they not? Bill C-70 
clarifies that the collection of recyclable materials and their 
delivery to a recycling facility is included in the exempting 
provision for garbage collection.
<P>
	The treatment of public utilities has also been a source of 
befuddlement. Under current rules, services provided by a utility to 
a municipal government are tax exempt if the utility is owned by 
the government but taxable if it is not. This no longer will be the 
case.
<P>
	Bill C-70 stipulates that the sale of gas, electricity, steam or 
telecommunications services by a public utility will always be 
taxable, even if the municipality receiving the service owns or 
controls the utility. This consistency across the board will make 
complying easier for municipalities. It may not please everybody, 
but on balance I think it is fair. Those municipalities that have their 
own utilities hopefully will be provided a transition period so they 
can provide for these costs in their budgeting procedures in 
advance.
<P>
	In telecommunications services, this sector will also benefit 
from the measures we have taken to clarify the sales tax legislation 
as it applies to this sector. We will remove the confusion by 
defining more clearly what a telecommunications service is and 
when this service is defined as being performed in Canada.
<P>
	This ease of compliance is reflected in other steps we have taken, 
steps that apply to the business community as a whole in Canada. 
We have heard about new rules that simplify the treatment of used 
goods and employee and shareholder benefits. These rules will 
benefit consumers and businesses alike.
<P>
	Businesses will also find it easier to comply due to changes in 
the way GST registrants report and pay GST on some purchases of 
real property. Starting in 1997, registrants who have to self assess 
GST on a taxable purchase of real property that is primarily for 
commercial use will not have to complete a separate return to 
report the GST on that transaction. Instead they will report the GST 
on their normal GST returns. Anything we can do to reduce the 
paper burden and reduce the complexity for businesses is a very 
positive step forward.
<P>
	Similarly this bill will clarify the rules for export services by 
Canadian services. As the current legislation is structured, 
Canadian businesses have a hard time determining if services they 
provide to non-residents qualify for zero rating. This is because the 
general zero rating provision includes a test that is often difficult to 
apply. That test asks the question: Where is the service primarily 
consumed, used or employed?
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	For example, what is the answer for a collection agency that 
provides services to a non-resident client? Where are the agent's 
services being used or consumed by the client? Or training services 
provided by Canadian businesses to employees in Canada of 
non-resident businesses. Where are these services consumed or 
used, inside Canada or outside when the employee returns to work 
at home? By clarifying when these services qualify for a zero 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7136"> 7136 </A></B>
<P>
rating, we will make it easier for Canadian businesses to comply 
with the rules for export services.
<P>
	The amendments we are proposing will also make business in 
Canada more competitive in both domestic and international 
markets. I touched on that earlier. While the current legislation 
does provide a favourable environment for domestic suppliers of 
goods and services, there is room for improvement.
<P>
	We propose to make improvements in a number of ways. First 
services provided by Canadian sales and purchasing 
representatives through non-resident or foreign businesses will be 
zero rated. Second, a rebate will be provided for GST charged on 
installation services supplied in some non-resident businesses. 
Third, a broader range of goods and services relating to 
international transportation will be zero rated. Fourth, a zero rating 
provision for goods delivered abroad will be expanded.
<P>
	These and other provisions will make Canadian business 
suppliers more competitive with non-resident suppliers who do not 
pay GST on their business inputs. These provisions are 
complemented by the steps we have taken to make Canada a better 
and more attractive place to do business. For example, we have 
extended the visitors' GST rebate beyond tourists to include 
non-resident businesses with employees who travel to Canada. 
These businesses will now be able to claim a rebate for GST they 
paid on short term accommodations. While these changes may not 
ease compliance for businesses directly, they will make the tax 
easier to bear.
<P>
	We have taken steps with charities that will simplify the 
situation for them and also ease the weight of compliance. This is 
especially true for the smaller registered charities that only have 
basic accounting systems. For those organizations the current 
requirement that they apportion inputs between taxable and exempt 
supplies has proven onerous. It forces them to review all the rules 
and determine whether each of their activities is taxable or exempt. 
In some cases the judgment is purely arbitrary. Bill C-70 introduces 
a new streamlined method for charities to collect and remit tax on 
their taxable supplies.
<P>
	We have heard from my hon. colleague about the amendments 
that apply to education. These changes too are designed to ensure 
that the GST is clear and less complicated in this area. The changes 
address inconsistencies in the eligibility criteria that apply to 
schools, universities and public colleges for claiming rebates. They 
make the definition of vocational schools more specific to exclude 
those institutions which do not primarily offer educational training.
<P>
	It is fair to say that the amendments we are proposing to the 
value added sales tax system in Canada will make it easier for 
everyone to comply with their GST obligations. This lack of clarity 
in the current legislation has been among the biggest complaints 
from those Canadian citizens who honestly are trying to meet their 
sales tax obligations. We have heard these complaints and we have 
responded by introducing the amendments I have mentioned along 
with scores of others.
<P>
	We have designed a sales tax system that is more user friendly, if 
I may use that term. It is a system that is easier to comply with and 
at the same time increases compliance and much needed revenues.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will speak 
to Bill C-70, as my colleagues have, but I would like to start by 
drawing the attention of the House to a number of little problems.
<P>
	For instance, we find it regrettable that the Minister of Finance 
tabled these documents less than 24 hours ago. We are talking of a 
300-page document. You will understand that, given the 
importance of the subject, such a document cannot be flipped 
through any old way.
<P>
	I would not raise this question, I can assure you, if this were an 
isolated case. A few weeks ago, however, during the firearms 
debate, I recall that the minister provided journalists, at noon on the 
dot, with documents I received only at a quarter to three, and the 
press conferences took place after question period.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	You will understand that, in the public interest, the opposition 
must be given enough time to read documents in advance so they 
can react in an informed manner, in order to enrich the debate and 
to lead to better decision making.
<P>
	I would also point out that, in connection with the tobacco 
legislation, the Minister of Health called a press conference last 
week in the press gallery, and it was only once I was there that I 
was able to examine the documents the minister was just about to 
discuss. We are not talking about 24 hours here, or even 2 hours, we 
are talking about 15 or 20 minutes notice.
<P>
	One might say that the government has acquired the bad habit of 
sidestepping debate. Again today, through procedural 
manoeuvring, a worthwhile discussion was cut short. There are 
times, mind you, when I wonder what is the use of having a debate 
in this House. Anyway, I am told this is the best system around. 
Perhaps, but when this system fails as it did today, it acts as a 
muzzle and no longer serves public interest, as if that was not 
already difficult enough.
<P>
	That is why I felt the need to start my remarks by submitting to 
you and to this House that acting this way is not in the public 
interest, and that the official opposition, with all the good will in 
the world, can only make as useful a contribution as the 
government will allow it to make by distributing documents in a 
timely manner. We have to rely on them for that.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7137"> 7137 </A></B>
<P>
	That said, Bill C-70 is about the GST, the sacrosanct GST, 
which, while it was supposed to be abolished, not only still exists, 
but will now be harmonized. Will it be harmonized harmoniously? 
That is the question.
<P>
	The most challenging problem facing us is the fact that the 
government agreed to pay approximately $1 billion in 
compensation to the maritimes if they harmonized their sales taxes. 
Naturally, this enables them to cut their taxes from 19 to 15 per 
cent. If I lived in the maritimes, I would probably think this is a 
great idea. The problem is that, for the time being, Canada includes 
not only the maritimes, but also Quebec.
<P>
	And Quebec's contribution to this effort amounts to about $250 
million. A few minutes ago, I heard the Liberal member say that 
this will give a competitive edge to businesses in the maritimes. It 
undoubtedly will. But when he said this, he was saying to 
Quebecers, not to mention Ontarians, that they are taking a loss so 
people in the maritimes can benefit.
<P>
	If it were possible to use Quebec and Ontario resources to help 
other provinces, it would be fine. But Quebec is having financial 
problems.
<P>
	Are you asking me to conclude now? Then I will have a few 
minutes to speak at three o'clock.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Certainly, dear colleague, you will have three or 
four additional minutes after Oral Question Period. The House will 
now proceed to Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
received a letter recently from two Manitobans who are concerned 
that Canadians no longer value the military. Like myself, they think 
that this must not be allowed to continue. As a result of this they 
have begun the invisible ribbon campaign.
<P>
	The ribbons, one of which members see me wear, are made out 
of plastic wrap. This is symbolic of the invisible uniform warn by 
the partners, spouses and children of military personnel. They are 
as committed to the military way of life as the personnel who wear 
the uniform. So too their morale is affected by negative media 
attention and public opinion.
<P>
	I urge all members to join me in wearing an invisible ribbon to 
demonstrate that Canadians do appreciate military personnel and 
their families.

the Liberals promised Canadians jobs, jobs, jobs, but what 
Canadians have received are pink slips, pink slips, pink slips.
<P>
	Nowhere has this been made more clear than in the chaos created 
by the Liberal government when it signed the softwood lumber 
agreement with the United States. This agreement is killing jobs 
and destroying job security across Canada.
<P>
	The softwood lumber agreement is problematic for another 
reason. It replaces an open lumber market with the problems of a 
marketing board. Already I am hearing stories of lumber quotas 
being for sale to the highest bidder, while mills are being shut down 
and employees are being laid off because of a lack of lumber quota.
<P>
	Will this Liberal government stop micro-managing the lumber 
industry and do something for the people of one of Canada's largest 
industries? I challenge the Liberal government to defend the jobs of 
Canadians against U.S. interests by referring the softwood lumber 
issue to the World Trade Organization.

is an unprecedented and shocking attack on workers' rights.
<P>
	At the same time we recognize the minister's attempts to use the

Canadian Airlines or has chosen to ignore it.

future of the industry. However, we are concerned that by focusing 
only on the concessions being demanded of working people that the 
job and industrial security we all desire will be lost in the long

<P>
	If the federal government wants to be involved in Canadian

	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week, a 
NAFTA panel ruled that the Canada's supply system for dairy 
products, eggs and poultry did not violate the rules of that treaty, 
nor those of the World Trade Organization. This decision is an 
important victory for Canada over American claims.
<P>
	However, we should have no illusion about the spirit that drives 
our neighbours to the south. Just last week, U.S. farmers asked 
their government to amend NAFTA if the panel did not rule in their 
favour.
<P>
	It is very likely that this lobby will continue to put pressure on 
the American administration to get the changes it wants. 
Consequently, the Minister for International Trade must remain 
firm on this issue.

this minister regarding the softwood lumber issue. We hope that,

	In fact we foresee such a growth in the industry that Holland

program to train call centre workers. The program will be the 
benchmark for high level training standards in the industry.
<P>
	The call centre industry will provide year round full time jobs for

weapons can penetrate flesh and thin bone at just 348 feet per 
second.
<P>
	More than 25 people have been killed by air guns in North 
America since 1980. Canadian hospitals report a growing number 
of non-fatal accidents involving such weapons. For example, 
Amanda Noseworthy of St. John's lost an eye when shot by a young 
boy who was playing with his rifle in a friend's home. Amanda is 
now losing the vision in her good eye and may become totally 
blind.
<P>

Amanda and her family and told him I support the inclusion of air 
guns as a real firearm under the Criminal Code of Canada, and 
therefore, should be subject to the same controls and safeguards.

<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister suggested that RDI did not provide 
adequate coverage of issues concerning francophones outside 
Quebec. However, the fact is that RDI gives them long periods of 
coverage every day. Could it be that the heritage minister does not 
watch RDI?
<P>
	The problem with RDI is not that it does not talk about 
francophones outside Quebec. The problem is that hundreds of 
French speaking households in English Canada do not get that 
channel, because the government agreed to make it an optional 
service for cable operators.
<P>

francophones outside Quebec, considering it did not deem

federal government is justified in spending $20 million a year on 
the Canada Information Office, a whopping 90 per cent said no and 
only 8 per cent said yes.

massacre of 14 women at the École Polytechnique in Montreal. On 
that occasion, Marc Lepine, a deranged young man without a 
criminal record, not a professional criminal, was able to obtain a 
semi-automatic rifle and kill these innocent women. He was able to 
do this because there were gaps, weaknesses in our gun laws.
<P>

<P>
	Parliament has now closed these gaps and tightened the law, but 
the provinces of Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan are 
contesting this law in court, supported by the Conservative and

<P>
	This law may not be perfect, but whenever access to guns is 
limited, the rate of crime with guns is reduced. The charge that 
guns do not kill, people kill, is ludicrous. It is much easier and 
effective to kill with a gun.

justify the government's status of women portfolio.
<P>
	The member for Halifax mentioned the department's 
commitment to women's health. But at the recent Canada-U.S. 
health forum, Canadian breast cancer advocates found themselves 
unaware of the conference's objectives and were shocked to 
discover their American counterparts had not even been invited.
<P>
	The member for Halifax also spoke of the role status of women 
played at the UN Conference on Women in Beijing. What she did 
not mention was Canada's support for the marginalization of many 
Canadian women in order to advance its narrow agenda.
<P>
	The official Canadian facilitating committee report classified the 
Vatican, pro-life groups and REAL Woman as fundamentalist 
groups and went on to say that: ``Constant criticism of 
fundamentalist discourses is a collective responsibility because 
they endanger the rights of women all over the world''.
<P>
	I would like to know if the Secretary of State for the Status of 
Women, while standing on Canadian soil in front of Canadian 
citizens, including her own constituents, will defend this statement.

next Saturday, December 7, an extraordinary event will take place 
in my constituency, when the highway between Havre-Saint-Pierre

Pointe-Parent and Natashquan will finally be linked to the rest of 
the North American road system.

December 6 always reminds us of the 14 young women who were 
robbed of their future and brutally killed at the Ecole Polytechnique 
on this day seven years ago.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This tragic incident will serve as a constant reminder of the 
violence that is inflicted on women. In order to ensure safe homes 
and safe streets for all Canadians, and in particular women, the 
government has passed important legislation on issues like gun 
control, high risk offenders and other amendments to the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	But we need to do more if we are to honour their memory and 
eradicate violence against women.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	May their deaths not have been in vain. Let us get to the roots of 
the problem of violence against women, first by increasing our 
social education efforts and by constantly promoting fundamental 
values, like respect and tolerance.
<P>
	I encourage all my colleagues in this House to light a candle 
tomorrow in memory of the young victims of the massacre at the 
Ecole Polytechnique.

<P>
	This day reminds us that we must continue to take action to 
eliminate violence against women in all its forms in all of society.
<P>
	Statistics show that 51 per cent of Canadian women have 
experienced at least one incident of physical or sexual violence 
since the age of 16. We must remember that all violence is an 
assault on the sanctity of human life. Violence against women not 
only violates the body, it robs women of their dignity and scars 
their souls.

<P>
	That is why the government has worked extremely hard in the

<P>
	Still, there is more work to do and we must all work together, in 
government, in communities and in homes across this country to 
ensure that women, men and children are truly free from the threat 
and fear of violence in Canadian society.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday we realized that the Minister of Human 
Resources Development excelled in French composition, seemed 
to revel in discussing the philosophy of social reforms but had 
trouble answering specific questions. He seemed to have a poor 
grasp of his subject. Today, since people are interested in 
philosophy but also in their immediate future, I want to ask him a 
very simple question.
<P>
	There are people who had weeks of insurable employment in 
1996. I would like to ask him how these weeks of insurable 
employment, which made them eligible for benefits, will be 
converted into hours so they can qualify for benefits as of January 
5? On what basis will these weeks be converted? This is a very 
simple question. I expect an answer, and easy on the philosophy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Canadian public is also 
interested in the quality of a reform, in the spirit behind it, in 
modernizing a system that has become obsolete. I am always very 
grateful to the Bloc for giving me a chance to talk about this 
excellent employment insurance system.
<P>
	To answer the hon. member's question, this was in the legislation 
from the very beginning. In the case of any person who worked a 
certain number of weeks during the last 26 weeks of 1996, each 
week will be deemed to have been a 35-hour week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> That took 
some doing. Mr. Speaker, I imagine the minister consulted one of 
his officials who has a good head on his shoulders, and there are 
always a few. However, I have a problem for him, since he is in an 
answering mood today.
<P>
	A person who, for instance, worked eighteen 40-hour weeks 
qualifies for benefits, not only under the former legislation, but 
also under the legislation that will come into effect. So if a week is 
supposed to be worth 35 hours, does this mean that under the new 
standards, this person will not be able to receive benefits? I would 
appreciate an answer.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the reform will encourage this 
person to go on working a little longer in order to have the number 
of hours required. In the case of a new entry, provided the number 
of hours totals 420, that person will be covered or, in the case of 
re-entry, eighteen 35-hour weeks will bring him to the 420-hour 
threshold.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Things are 
getting better all the time, Mr. Speaker. I think we have got the 
minister into the habit of consulting his officials. Obviously he had 
not done so yesterday. Maybe on our third try, we will get a third 
answer.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister referred to a father in East Montreal who 
had three jobs, in each of which he worked a 14-hour week, and 
who will now be covered under the new standards.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	However, I have the following question. Since according to one 
of the standards under the new system, someone who quits his job 
loses all his privileges, will this father from East Montreal, if he 
quits one of his jobs, meaning he would no longer work 42 hours 
but 28, qualify for unemployment insurance, and I will let the 
minister consult his parliamentary secretary who seems to have all 
the answers.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this employment insurance 
reform makes it far more attractive to go back to work, compared 
with the old system which the opposition is so keen on preserving, 
an opposition that voted against coverage for part time workers, an 
opposition that voted against modernizing a system to adjust it to 
the modern labour market. I think that is entirely unacceptable.
<P>
	Under the new system, the same presumptions will apply, that is, 
someone who quits his job for no valid reason is not insured, but if 
someone quits his job for a valid reason, a decision is made on a 
case by case basis. We can then determine whether he qualifies for 
benefits.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	I would start off by saying that our laughter is not because there 
is anything funny. For more than three weeks now we have been 
asking questions of the minister and he has been responding like 
someone who was not familiar with the issues-and, indeed, he is 
not. We are delighted to have played a part, on behalf of all 
Canadians and Quebecers, in getting him to consult others.
<P>
	Can we be sure, then, that the minister will be in agreement with 
the recommendations of the employment insurance commission, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7142"> 7142 </A></B>
<P>
which, contrary to what he says, have not been adopted, and are on 
the agenda of the employment insurance commission?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this opposition provides me 
with one surprise after another. These things are part of the reform 
as soon as they are in the act, so I cannot understand why suddenly, 
three weeks later, they wake up and notice a subject that has been 
very widely covered, as they well know.
<P>
	On this matter, I can assure you that the minister is totally in 
agreement with this interpretation, and we shall be on the workers' 
side. Each of the weeks worked in the last 26 weeks of the year 
1996 will be deemed to have been 35 hours in length. We are giving 
them the benefit of the doubt, taking the workers' side.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, here we 
are with one surprise after another for, in reality, everyone in the 
employment centres is waiting for the decision to be made. What 
was set out in the act was for there to be transitional arrangements, 
and we have been calling for these for weeks, so there is no reason 
to make fun of us.
<P>
	My question to the minister is this: In these transitional 
measures, will someone who has worked more than 35 hours, say 
40 hours, in 1996 be credited for 40 hours weekly, or for a 
maximum of 35?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the weeks worked in 1996 will 
be deemed to have been 35-hour weeks. Starting January 5, 1997, 
we start with the new system, which is in the workers' best 
interests. It will cover a potential 500,000 additional workers not 
covered at present. The hours-based system starts on January 5, 
1997, and this is a system the opposition voted against.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister claimed yesterday in question period that the laws 
of the land prevent him from releasing documents to Justice 
Krever. That is simply not the case. The office of the information 
commissioner says that the Canada Evidence Act does not stand in 
the Prime Minister's way.
<P>
	Michael Pitfield, a former clerk of the privy council, says that 
the cabinet can release whatever it wants to release.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	Perhaps I will ask the Minister of Health. Why is the Prime 
Minister choosing not to release these 30 documents that Justice 
Krever is asking for?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my understanding that there is a constitutional convention that 
a current government does not have access to nor does it release the 
cabinet confidences of a previous government. This is a well 
established practice and therefore a convention in the Canadian 
system of parliamentary government. It is also well established in 
other countries with similar systems of parliamentary government.
<P>
	In that sense what the Prime Minister is talking about is part of 
our law. This convention is specifically backed up by section 39 of 
the Canada Evidence Act. Therefore what the Prime Minister said 
is quite consistent with our system of parliamentary government.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
fine for the minister to hide behind that, but I think the evidence 
shows frankly that this is discretionary in that the Prime Minister 
can do that if he chooses to do.
<P>
	This looks weak. This looks like flimsy excuses. It looks like 
nothing more than a cover-up. There are people dying because of 
this and we need to get to the bottom of it. The only thing that 
stands in the way of Krever's quest for truth is the Prime Minister 
and the Prime Minister alone. He has the power to release the 
documents. He has the power to explain why legislation was 
shelved under the leadership of Mr. Turner and Mr. Mulroney in 
1984.
<P>
	Again, what is this Prime Minister trying to hide? Why will he 
not simply do the right thing and the honourable thing and let these 
documents be released to Justice Krever so he can do his work and 
get to the bottom of this?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I categorically reject the unwarranted assertion that the Prime 
Minister is hiding something that he should be releasing. I want to 
further say, and I can be corrected if I am wrong, that the Deputy 
Prime Minister said she had been informed that none of the 
documents sought by Mr. Justice Krever were produced during the 
government of the Right Hon. John Turner.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is in fact doing the right thing. He is 
following and acceding to the constitutional convention which is 
part of our parliamentary government that a current government 
does not have access to the confidences of a previous government 
nor does it release such confidences.
<P>
	The hon. member, as in so many other instances where she has 
been wrong, is wrong on this one.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
easy for the minister to say that he categorically rejects my 
argument here, but frankly there are thousands of people in this 
country who have been infected with hepatitis C or have died from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7143"> 7143 </A></B>
<P>
AIDS who categorically reject this kind of nonsense from this 
government.
<P>
	Justice Krever and the victims of tainted blood do not have time 
for the Prime Minister and this minister to keep waffling on this 
issue. Michael Pitfield, a former clerk of the privy council, said: 
``The government that wants to is the government that can''.
<P>
	For some unknown reason, the Prime Minister and his 
government are lacking the political will to help these 15,000 
victims discover why the blood supply and the federal government 
have failed them for years and years.
<P>
	I ask the minister once again, let us not play games here. This is 
far larger than a political or a partisan issue. Will the government 
release the documents to Justice Krever so that this full inquiry is 
something more than a sham? Let us get to the bottom of it. Release 
the documents.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am advised that the only exception to the convention I have 
mentioned is where specific criminal charges have actually been 
laid against a minister or a former minister.
<P>
	I want to further say that it is my understanding that Mr. Justice 
Krever has other means to get at the information by summoning 
before him previous ministers.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> They refuse to go.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. member says previous ministers refuse to 
go. I am advised that Mr. Justice Krever has the power of subpoena 
and if he wishes to use it then he is in a position to question former 
ministers. The only thing wrong here is my hon. friend's attempt to 
exploit this tragic issue in a way which is not founded on 
convention or the facts.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on Tuesday, in response to a question on the possibility of 
a family trust being transferred abroad without payment of capital 
gains tax and without interest on tax owing, the Minister of Finance 
declared in the House, and I quote: ``The Bloc Quebecois critic is 
wrong. As soon as taxes are due they have to be paid. If they are not 
paid, interest will be charged''.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Does the minister 
still hold to his Tuesday version of the facts, that a millionaire 
transferring a family trust abroad must pay taxes to Revenue 
Canada and interest owing on unpaid taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
repeat what I said last week. When taxes are due, they must be 
paid. If, for one reason or another, a tax due is not paid and the tax 
is duly levied, interest accumulates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have a problem. We have a Minister of Human 
Resources who does not know his business, a Deputy Prime 
Minister brandishing flags at all and sundry and a Minister of 
Finance who is uninformed about the tax system he claims to 
manage.
<P>
	In the technical document he tabled with his ways and means 
motion on October 2, he said that when a family trust is transferred 
abroad, and I quote: ``The person transferring must provide 
Revenue Canada with a guarantee of future payment without 
interest costs''.
<P>
	He says there are interest costs, and his document says there are 
none. We just do not understand this government any more.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately it is the member opposite who does not understand 
the tax system.
<P>
	The change we made to the system means that, when someone 
leaves the country, it is quite likely the tax is not due, since the item 
in question was never sold; so there is no capital gains tax. We want 
to be sure that, when the item or shares are sold, the tax will be paid 
by someone who is now a non-resident. So we insist on a 
debenture.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the situation is clear enough for the member to 
perhaps have some difficulty understanding it.

<P>
	It is interesting that the cabinet has called these documents draft 
regulations, every one of them. It is also interesting that the draft 
regulations were given to Krever. In fact, I happen to have those 
draft regulations with me today.
<P>
	I ask again, since these regulations are not draft regulations that 
they are hiding, exactly what documents are they? I ask again, did 
they come from the administration of Pierre Elliott Trudeau?

I see no way to answer my hon. friend's question unless he

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	We have learned that a record number of people in Canada and in 
Quebec are experiencing financial difficulties and are being forced 
to dip into their registered retirement savings plans. At the same 
time, banks and major department stores are charging exorbitant 
interest rates on their credit cards and the government is refusing to 
assume its responsibilities with respect to this issue of public 
concern.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Industry realize that the low interest rate 
cards being touted by the secretary of state the day before yesterday 
are available only to clients who are well off financially, and that it 
is those in the middle class who are paying for others through the 
elevated rates still in effect on regular cards?
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the whole matter of credit cards is one of the 
market dealing with matters. When there are lower interest rate 
cards which are available to some, others can be cut out who may 
want cards and who are eligible now for the higher rates.
<P>
	It is a matter of the marketplace taking care of the situation as it 
exists at the present time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, an Industry 
Canada report that came out last September stated that interest 
rates charged credit card holders are still too high, given the fall in 
the Bank of Canada rate. The Minister of Industry himself said at 
that time, and I quote: ``The president of the Bankers' Association 
does not perhaps understand that consumers are fed up''.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Industry take the completely 
unacceptable approach of doing nothing, while interest rates are 
dropping everywhere but on credit cards? Why does the minister 
not join the coalition of 150 MPs who are trying to improve the 
situation for the average member of the public?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

taken the position that he encourages banks to reduce credit card 
interest rates. In dealing with a group who had signed the requests, 
he was certainly supportive of the group in dealing with the high 
interest rates that are being referred to.
<P>
	Again, there must be encouragement by the public to the banks 
to reduce the rates. This can be done in many different ways. One 
way is by not utilizing the cards and another way is by applying for 
the lower interest rate cards.

Reform of CPP must come soon to prevent serious

there is no linkage between CPP premiums and EI premiums any 
more than there is between CPP premiums and other payroll taxes

cuts in social spending. I congratulate the Reform Party for at least 
having outlined those areas where it believes ongoing cuts in 
spending should be made. I encourage the Reform Party to speak to 
their other extreme right wing cousins, those in the Conservative 
Party, and ask them to outline where they would make the cuts.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the government House leader.
<P>
	Amendments to the Canada Elections Act proposed by the 
government allow the chief electoral officer to use only the Quebec 
civil register and Quebec driver's licence information to establish 
the list of electors for the next federal general election.
<P>
	In view of the representations made by the official opposition as 
well as by the Quebec government and Quebec's chief electoral 
officer, is the minister now ready to reconsider his position and to 
allow the use of the permanent list of electors established by the 
Quebec government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I would be happy to examine the representations made by Quebec's 
chief electoral officer, but the bill is now being considered in the 
Senate. Therefore, I cannot give a more detailed answer at this 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has a choice: since it controls at least half of the other 
place, it could act immediately by having Bill C-63 amended, or it 
could do so in this House.
<P>
	Since we know that taxpayers in Quebec and Canada would save 
at least $15 million if Elections Canada used Quebec's permanent 
list of electors, why are the government and Elections Canada still 
refusing to use that list?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I think this House passed an amendment regarding the use of 
Quebec's and other provinces' lists of electors.
<P>
	As I just said, the bill is in the other place. I do not think it would 
be wise for me to comment on what goes on in the other place.

	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my

<P>
	It was reported in 1994 that radioactive waste dumped nearly 50 
years ago at the Chalk River nuclear site is polluting local 
vegetation, swamps, lakes and wildlife. This waste is now seeping 
into the Ottawa River and is posing a possible health risk to area

<P>
	What is the minister doing to stop this leakage immediately and 
to ensure the future safety of our natural resources and human 
health?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first I want to reassure the hon. member and those 
who live in Chalk River and along the Ottawa River in relation to 
the story that appeared today in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, the leak in 
question was reported to the AECB some number of years ago. 
Since that time the AECB has been monitoring the situation and 
taking whatever steps that have been necessary.
<P>
	I want to reassure the member that the atomic energy board has 
stated that the leak in question presents no threat to the public or to 
the public health. The level of contamination is well below limits 
set by the AECB in relation to health and safety.
<P>
	I also want to reassure members of the House that this leak is not 
from radioactive waste streams. The leak comes from water from

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must 
say in response to the previous question to the finance minister that 
an extremist is anyone who happens to be winning an argument 
with the Liberals.
<P>
	The Certified General Accountants have produced a study that 
confirms what Reformers have been saying all along, that lower 
taxes create jobs, real permanent jobs, not the McJobs that the 
infrastructure program allegedly created. The CGA say a $4 billion 
personal income tax will create 108,000 new jobs by the year 2001.
<P>
	Given the overwhelming evidence that lower taxes create jobs, 
will the finance minister agree to start lowering taxes so that 
Canadians can have those jobs that they really do deserve?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
under those circumstances it is quite clear that I will have to change 
my definition of an extremist.
<P>
	Whether it be a $4 billion tax cut or whether it be as the Reform 
has suggested a $15 billion to $20 billion tax cut, the fact is that one 
has to pay for it. The issue is not whether one would like to see a 
tax cut. There is nobody in this House who would not like to see a 
tax cut. The question is: What programs would have to be cut, 
would have to be given up, in order to pay for that tax cut?
<P>
	The government is not prepared to see health care impaired. The 
government is not prepared to see old age pensions impaired. This 
government is going to stand behind the basic social fabric of the 
nation and under those circumstances, we will stay the course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact 
is that Reform would put more money into health care. We would 
fix the programs that the government has destroyed, the $7.2 
billion in cuts to transfers. Reformers believe by the way that real 
compassion is not putting money into welfare; it is getting more 
people off welfare.
<P>
	The CGA says the 20 per cent reduction in UI taxes would create 
68,000 jobs by the year 2001. As a matter of fact, the Reform plan 
calls for a 28 per cent cut in UI premiums. Imagine how many more 
jobs that would create. Today the Liberals on the finance 
committee are saying that UI taxes cannot be lowered. Will the 
finance minister ignore the recommendation of the finance 
committee and lower payroll taxes to create the jobs that Canadians 
so desperately want?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
dealing with the last part of the member's question, I would like to 
thank all members of the  finance committee for the report which

<P>
	First Mirabel, now Pearson. Mirabel cost taxpayers billions. 
Unbelievably we are heading in the same direction with Pearson. 
Taxpayers may have to pay $662 million in compensation to the 
former developers of Pearson. The government has been found at 
fault but has been stalling settlement since February.
<P>
	Will the government commit to settling with the Pearson 
Development Corporation before the next election so the voters 
will have a clear picture of this whole sorry mess?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the transfer of Pearson to the local authority, the Greater 
Toronto Airport Authority, took place on December 2 and was very 
successful. I am delighted that we now have Pearson in the hands of 
local people from the greater Toronto area who represent all facets 
of the municipalities and the people involved in operating the 
airport and using it. They will be able to exploit all the advantages 
for Pearson.
<P>
	We want Pearson to be the premier airport to the east of the 
Mississippi, the central point for connections from Europe and that 
entire region of North America. To achieve this, approximately $2 
billion of expenditures and upgrading at Pearson airport are needed 
over the next few years. I am confident that the new administration 
we have put in place at Pearson and the transfer of the airport to 
that new authority will result in Pearson taking its rightful place as 
the gateway to Europe for all that part of North America.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I never did 
find out about the $662 million.
<P>
	Since the new corporation was introduced, the new Pearson 
airport authority has indicated that it will cost $2.5 billion to redo 
Pearson. It has ruled out user fees to pay for that. It claims that the 
$2.5 billion can be raised solely from bonds, increased volume, 
and-wait for it-restaurant fees.
<P>
	Has the government studied the Pearson authority financial 
plan? Will it assure this House that the taxpayers will not pay one 
cent for the renovations at Pearson airport?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member started off by making references to 
drinking. When he talks about $662 million to be paid by the 
people of Canada to buy out mythical profits of a Tory corporation, 
perhaps he is in the area where something is affecting his judgment.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	Let me now go to the issue of fees at airports. Vancouver 
International Airport, our newest airport, is occupying the same 
relative position for Asia which I hope Pearson will be in for 
Europe. Forty-two per cent of the revenues of that airport come 
from the stores and restaurants which are operating on airport 
property. It is that which provides a great impetus and money so 
that it is not necessary to have large increases in landing fees.
<P>
	I admit to the hon. member that in Vancouver the local authority 
in its wisdom saw the need to put on a departure tax which ranges 
from $5 to $15. The local authority in Toronto in its wisdom is 
choosing a different financial formula. That is what I mean by 
using local people's knowledge and initiative and local people's 
entrepreneurship to make the local decisions which suit local 
conditions.

assistance even more tricky, what does the minister now intend to 
do to ensure that the humanitarian assistance can be delivered 
efficiently?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, we must distinguish between the two aspects of 
the problem: the humanitarian dimension and the presence of 
serious political turbulence in the area.

the hon. member has made reference to statements I made at a

statements: ``Saskatchewan has a stronger health system today than 
it did four years ago. The provincial health spending has stabilized 
and better health services are now being provided''. This was from 
the provincial minister of health in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	In the province of Quebec, Mr. Rochon said on May 28, 1996 in 
the <I>Medical Post</I>: ``Less money can be devoted to health care while 
maintaining the same level of population health''. Dr. Rochon set a 
target of 8.5 per cent of gross domestic product as the level that 
Quebec's health care expenditures should not exceed. ``We can 
devote less money to that sector while maintaining accessibility of 
care in the level of the health of the population''.
<P>
	These are provincial ministers of health who have the direct 
responsibility to deliver health care. It is not the Reform Party that 
should stand in this House and condemn provincial governments

the Royal Bank and other bankers and lenders have a social 
responsibility to ensure the viability of Canadian Airlines?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the difficulty of restructuring Canadian Airlines and 
turning it from a corporation which has had chronic losses year 
after year, totally $1.3 billion over the last decade, to a profitable 
corporation in the black requires corporate restructuring.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-70 
which deals with the GST  harmonization in Atlantic Canada. The 
word harmonization reminds me of the song ``I said it but I didn't 
really mean it'', a very famous song.
<P>
	It also gives me an opportunity to remind the Liberals in the 
House and, most important, their constituents, the Canadian 
taxpayers, of what was said on the campaign trail about the GST by 
the very Liberals who are sitting as the government today.
<P>
	This is a little game called recall. First, let us recall the words of 
the Prime Minister when he was a candidate for the Liberal Party. 
He said: ``We hate it and we will kill it''. He did not say: ``We hate 
it and we will harmonize it''.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance when he was campaigning as a Liberal 
candidate said: ``I would abolish the GST''. Pay careful attention to 
the word abolish. That means to get rid of, to lose sight of, to bury. 
That does not sound anything like: ``I would harmonize the GST''.
<P>
	Our very own minister of defence said when he was a candidate: 
``The GST is a regressive tax. It has to be scrapped and, by golly, if 
we are elected to government, we will scrap it''.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	All across this country as the campaign went on Liberal 
candidate after Liberal candidate knocked on doors, spoke at public 
meetings and said in unison: ``We will kill the GST. The Liberal 
Party will kill the GST if we become government in the next 
election''. That is what they said. Everyone heard it. I was on radio 
shows with Liberal candidates and they could not wait to say ``we 
will kill the GST''.
<P>
	It is sort of fun to go back in time and reminisce about what 
happened in the 1993 election. But there is a very serious part to all 
this. The bottom line is that the Liberal candidates in the 1993 
election, prior to it, deliberately misled the Canadian people about 
what they were going to do with the GST. They deliberately misled 
the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry, I was otherwise disposed. Did the hon. 
member actually say ``deliberately misled''? Did I misunderstand 
that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was referring to the Liberal 
candidates prior to the 1993 election when they went campaigning 
and they were saying they would kill the GST, they would scrap or 
abolish it. That is a deliberate misrepresentation.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wanted to make sure that I heard what I hoped I 
had not heard, but I would ask the hon. member to withdraw the 
words ``deliberately misled'', because that is just not 
parliamentary. Would the hon. member do that?

	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Certainly, Mr. Speaker. I have a great deal of 
respect for the Chair.
<P>
	During the 1993 election the Liberal candidates went coast to 
coast and they mis-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I listened to the 
recent comments made by the member from the Reform Party. I 
can tell you that he is not accurate and not factual with his 
statement and by so doing-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Let us get back to debate now. The hon. member 
for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, in venue after venue in the 1993 
election the Liberal candidates across the country told the Canadian 
voters that they would scrap, kill, abolish the GST. That is the fact.
<P>
	Taxpayers across this country are going to remember because we 
are going to keep reminding them that they are going to pay for this 
Liberal promise, this yet another Liberal broken promise. They are 
going to pay for this harmonization scam of the Liberals that will 
hurt every Canadian taxpayer because to get the Atlantic Canada 
provinces, the ones that agreed to harmonization, the Liberals will 
give the Atlantic Canada provinces a cash payment to induce them 
to come on to this scheme.
<P>
	This payment to Atlantic Canada provinces, the ones that have 
joined on, that have been duped into it by the Liberal Party, is going 
to amount to about $1 billion a year just to satisfy the whims of this 
Liberal government to make it look not quite so bad. They can once 
again try to fool the Canadian people but they will not get away 
with it.
<P>
	Taxpayers in every other region of Canada will be offering tax 
relief to Canadians in just a few provinces, the provinces that have 
been coerced into joining this GST harmonization plan.
<P>
	Canadians in certain regions of the country I do not think should 
be asked to subsidize a tax cut for maritime provinces that came in 
on this plan because of this Liberal harmonization scam. But the 
Liberals are using $1 billion from taxpayers to buy a buried GST in 
Atlantic Canada so that they can say they kept their election 
promise. That simply is not going to sell to the Canadian people. 
This is truly despicable and Canadians will not be hoodwinked by 
this Liberal trickery, this Liberal sleight of hand.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Atlantic Canadians will also suffer because while they may pay a 
lower tax rate in this harmonization scam, they will pay taxes on a 
larger range of goods and services. You do not get something for 
nothing, particularly when a Liberal government is running the 
country. If people think they are actually getting something from 
this government, they should keep their hands on their wallets and 
watch their back pockets. The government will not give you what it 
has not first taken away from you.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7151"> 7151 </A></B>
<P>
	The harmonized tax will apply to children 
clothing-wonderful-books, hair cuts, funeral services, heating 
oil, home renovations, gasoline and new homes. New home prices 
will rise by about 5.5 per cent and municipalities will be forced 
to raise their property taxes.
<P>
	It will cause an increase in gas taxes that will cost Atlantic 
Canadians as much as $100 million a year. It will cost them more to 
heat their homes and funerals will cost more. The Liberals have 
even managed to make dying more expensive. When will the 
Liberals begin taxing births? That way they could get you coming 
and going. We should talk to the Minister of Finance and the 
revenue minister about this.
<P>
	In all, this harmonization package is a bad deal for Atlantic 
Canadians and the maritime provinces generally. It is a bad deal for 
Canadians. Let us see what some of the other provinces said about 
this Liberal harmonization package which the Liberals are peddling 
as this huge great deal.
<P>
	Ontario said that the plan would cost its consumers between $2 
billion and $3 billion extra a year if the harmonized tax were 
implemented in Ontario. Ontario's premier said that giving the 
subsidization package to the maritimes represented nothing more 
than a bribe. That was his word, not mine.
<P>
	Alberta's premier, who also runs a good fiscally responsible 
province, said that the compensation component was a bribe put 
forward to get the Liberal premiers in Atlantic Canada to sign on to 
the deal.
<P>
	It will surprise the Liberals that Saskatchewan's minister of 
finance said that the plan would mean a massive tax shift on to the 
province's consumers. Who said NDP finance ministers do not 
know what is going on? Congratulations to Saskatchewan's finance 
minister.
<P>
	Manitoba also said that the cost to consumers would be too high 
and that it would not sign on to it.
<P>
	This deal will not only hurt consumers, it will hurt business in 
Atlantic Canada. Three major retailers have said that their net 
annual retail deficit will total $27 million once this plan is 
implemented. The Retail Council of Canada knows what it is 
talking about. It stated that the harmonized tax will cost retailers 
$100 million a year.
<P>
	We are talking about a massive extra consumer tax. We are 
talking about deception. I urge Liberal members who have integrity 
to stand up in this House, stand behind their campaign promises 
and say no to this deception.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The member is quite agile on that tightrope. 
Please do not push your Speaker too far.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will start where the previous speaker left off, with election 
promises. I remember very well what I said to my constituents 
during the election campaign.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	First, one cannot get rid of $16 billion of revenue without adding 
$16 billion to your annual deficit, and taking $16 billion away from 
what needs to be spent on other things that are important to 
Canadians.
<P>
	I made it clear to my constituents during the election that 
replacing the GST meant replacing the revenue in some other way. 
That is quite consistent with the promise the Liberal Party made 
that it would replace the GST with a system of taxation that 
generated equivalent revenues, that was fairer to consumers and 
small business, that minimized disruption to small business and 
that promotes federal and provincial co-operation and 
harmonization.
<P>
	There is no way that any of us on this side of the House will 
pretend that what we have in front of us today with the harmonized 
sales tax is a complete fulfilment of that. We know it is not. 
However, it is a first step to a national harmonized sales tax which 
would be significantly more efficient, fairer to consumers and a 
cost saving to businesses and taxpayers. It would significantly 
reduce costs of administration.
<P>
	I answered a lot of questions about the GST during the election 
campaign. First, was it not supposed to help bring down the debt 
and the deficit? No, it was intended to be revenue neutral but in fact 
it lost $3 billion a year in its first year of operation. In effect, it 
added $3 billion to the deficit in its first year and it has continued to 
be a grossly inefficient tax to administer and to collect both for 
government and for the businesses who do the collection.
<P>
	I explained to people during the last election campaign that the 
GST had replaced the manufacturers' sales tax which was 
collecting $20 billion and netting $18 billion. It was replaced by 
the GST which was collecting over $33 billion and netting only $15 
billion, a net loss of $3 billion in revenue but a 50 per cent increase 
in the amount we were actually collecting from consumers. There 
are clearly inefficiencies in the GST.
<P>
	The very first commitment made by the government as soon as 
Parliament resumed was to task the Standing Committee on 
Finance with reviewing all possible means of replacing the GST. 
The committee did that. It held months of hearings, it heard from 
close to 100 witnesses and received many more briefs from right 
across the country. It heard the views of Canadians. I believe it 
looked at over 24 options on how to generate similar revenue and 
try to meet the other criteria of being more fair, more efficient and 
promoting federal-provincial co-operation.
<P>
	Both the finance committee in an all-party report and the Reform 
Party endorsed the idea of a national harmonized sales tax as the 
best answer to the problems of the GST and that is what the bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7152"> 7152 </A></B>
<P>
before us today does.  It starts the process of implementing that for 
three of the provinces.
<P>
	The government did commit to try to bring in a tax that 
minimized disruption to small business. I want to take a few 
minutes to talk about some of the concerns that businesses in 
Atlantic Canada have about the implementation of the harmonized 
tax and how they have been addressed. I believe this is a pattern 
that if adopted across the country would help business, would help 
consumers and would reduce the costs of government.
<P>
	Let me remind people that we are talking about one tax 
administration instead of two, one set of books for businesses to 
keep instead of two, one point of paying the sales tax instead of, as 
they now have in the provinces, at many points throughout the 
production process.
<P>
	Let me focus on how it is being implemented at the cash register 
because Canadians, including businesses, have told us again and 
again that they want to know the price before they get to the cash 
register.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	How many of us have talked to small business people in our 
ridings who have said: ``My consumers come to the cash register, 
they see the total price and they leave the goods there and walk 
away''. Under the new system people will know the price of the 
good when they see it on the shelf. It will be the same price they 
will pay at the cash register.
<P>
	Potentially that could cause problems for businesses which may 
receive pre-priced goods or which may already have pre-priced 
goods in their shops. The legislation allows them to simply indicate 
on the shelf what the tax inclusive price will be. Their customers 
will know, but those stores will not have to absorb the cost of 
re-ticketing and re-costing every item on the shelf.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government is doing all it can to minimize the disruptive 
effects of these measures. Businesses will have to adapt their 
operations, but we have prepared rules that will minimize problems 
for businesses and meet the needs of consumers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me highlight some of the initiatives with respect to tax 
included pricing.
<P>
	Business will be able to include two prices on pre-priced goods, 
one showing the HST inclusive price in harmonized provinces and 
the other indicating the price elsewhere, which may have been put 
on by the manufacturer when the goods were shipped. They will be 
able to re-ticket items to show tax inclusive prices in harmonized 
provinces. Magazines are a good example of how rules are being 
developed to minimize business disruption. Magazines are 
different than other pre-priced  goods due to their time sensitive 
nature, high volume and rapid turnover.
<P>
	The new pricing requirements are consistent with the pricing 
practices that businesses need to continue to operate with minimum 
disruption and efficiency.
<P>
	The provincial governments have obtained a point of sale rebate 
for the provincial component of the HST on books. The price of 
books, used or new, will not rise as a result of the HST.
<P>
	Administrators will work closely with business to ensure that tax 
inclusive pricing is implemented smoothly, with minimal 
disruption to normal operation. We believe that businesses will 
conform to the flexible rules so consumers can know the full price 
of their purchase in advance. Where businesses are trying to 
conform, they can certainly expect full co-operation and assistance.
<P>
	Receipts and invoices will disclose either the amount of tax paid 
or the rate at which the tax has been charged. We will continue, as 
this is implemented, to work with retailers and businesses to ensure 
the new tax inclusive pricing system works effectively and 
efficiently.
<P>
	I have listened to the speeches of other members of the House. I 
would ask the members of the Reform Party to go back and review 
their comments at the time the finance committee recommended 
the harmonized tax. They endorsed it fully at that time. I would 
never question the motives of other members of this House, but one 
has to wonder whether their position now that reality is in front of 
them does not have more to do with politics than good taxation 
policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it funny the 
way things change over time. Today, the Liberals are being quite 
touchy. Reform members are telling them that during the 1993 
election campaign, they openly condemned the GST. Liberals are 
now raising questions of privilege and using every tactic in the 
book, suggesting it is unparliamentary to remind them that they 
condemned the GST during the election campaign.
<P>
	But we have seen a minister in this House, the Deputy Prime 
Minister at that, who was forced to resign or felt she had to resign 
because she had stated that if the GST was not abolished, she would 
resign.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	She did resign, and she was re-elected. It is as if I, a sovereignist 
member, said: ``If Quebec does not secede some day, I will get 
re-elected as a Liberal member''. God forbid. It would be 
unthinkable. If I did that, you would say I was dishonest. I do not 
mean to apply this word to my colleagues. I simply want to remind 
you that the Deputy Prime Minister said during the election 
campaign: ``If this tax is not abolished, I will resign''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7153"> 7153 </A></B>
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign, the Prime Minister said: 
``We will scrap the GST''. Then, on May 2, 1994, he said: ``We 
hate this tax, and we will get rid of it''.
<P>
	The bill before us today is even more underhanded than the 
scheming of those who claimed they would abolish it. Not only are 
they keeping it and pushing it in the western provinces, they are 
redeeming themselves for the next election by harmonizing it in the 
maritimes.
<P>
	The hon. member for Beauséjour is puffing up his chest, but he 
was not so proud, not so long ago, when the people in his riding 
were angry. I even saw on television someone roll up his sleeves 
and invite him to step outside the assembly hall. He was not puffing 
up his chest then as he is doing now. He let that guy speak, I am 
telling you, I saw it on television.
<P>
	But if we dig a little deeper, we see that this government is trying 
to buy back the maritimes after closing some military bases there. 
That decision was not very well received. Now, they are giving 
them a present valued at $920 million for a start. That is to buy the 
coming election, to try to buy relative peace, because the people 
there nonetheless understand to a large extent that the government 
is trying to pull the wool over their eyes. This gift is a sort of Trojan 
horse, but for many people, it is something that seems, for the 
moment, acceptable.
<P>
	I listened to the parliamentary secretary who just spoke. She 
presented the GST as something completely harmless; she said it 
was simply replacing the old manufacturers' sales tax. Yet they did 
call it the goods and services tax, since it not only replaced the old 
9 per cent federal manufacturers' tax but extended it to other 
economic sectors that had not been affected until then. The new tax 
now applied to legal services, for example, or to any other kind of 
service for that matter.
<P>
	That is probably why, acting in good faith that proved 
short-lived, the Prime Minister, then leader of the official 
opposition, rose up against this tax. He expressed outrage in public, 
as he did in his red book and during the 1993 election campaign.
<P>
	This famous tax shows that the government in place, just like its 
predecessors-and it is a Liberal government that was responsible 
for the first deficit in our history-claims that cutting the heart vein 
just before the blood gets to the heart is good for the taxpayer and 
for all aspects of our economy and allow the patient to live longer. 
In so doing, the government is revealing its inability to find other 
ways of collecting taxes and generating government revenue, 
which is disastrous. It is tragic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> I would invite the member for Beauséjour to breathe 
through the nose. I do not know who will take over his riding after 
the next election, but he may have to let it go given the 
performance of his party over the past three years.
<P>
	The member for Beauséjour should stop shouting at the official 
opposition, his peers who still live on Canadian soil after all, and 
are looking for ways to improve the taxation system, increase 
public revenues without choking people to death. I could very well 
make some suggestions.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	I will offer one suggestion, if he is considerate enough to listen 
to me; the idea just came to me.
<P>
	Take the example of a worker. First, 57 or 58 per cent of his 
paycheque is deducted at source. On his paycheque stub he can see 
the word ``net''. What it means is that his paycheque is trimmed 
down to the minimum, because there is not much left. He then goes 
home with the 42 or 43 per cent that is left, but he is not out of the 
woods yet. The government thinks, dreams, racks its brains and 
says: ``How could we grab most of the 43 cents on every dollar 
earned that actually he brings home?'' It thinks about all kinds of 
things and talks about harmonization, but it never thought that, 
because of the economic multiplier, the less money people have, 
the less they will contribute to making the economy work, the less 
they will invest in our society and the more this economic 
multiplier will tend to move toward zero, towards nil.
<P>
	Then, the government ponders and finds that it is not getting 
enough revenues. It must trap people again, somewhere else. That 
is the Liberal philosophy.
<P>
	I will give an example. If it were willing, one day, to see things 
differently. We are all taxpayers and, at some point, we have to 
paint the interior of our house. What do we do? On a nice Saturday, 
we go out and buy gallons of paint, two rollers and one pole. With 
our wife and children, we do the painting ourselves. It takes one 
weekend. This has cost us $300 or $400 in paint and we have saved 
money on a job that would have cost $800 in total.
<P>
	If the government had examined that sort of thing and had 
allowed the taxpayer, instead of wearing himself out on the roller 
one weekend, to officially give the contract to someone else, thus 
thwarting the underground economy, the taxpayer could say: 
``Instead of wearing myself out on the roller, I will give the work to 
my neighbour who does not have a job. He has a social insurance 
number and will declare his income. In reality, this will cost me 
$800, but I will get a tax refund of about $200 and the paint will 
have cost me $400. Fine. It is worth my while to spend a whole 
weekend painting my house to save $200? Perhaps I would have 
given the contract to someone else.'' To save $800, it is worth it, to 
save $400 also, but not to save $200. This is the kind of thinking 
they are incapable of doing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7154"> 7154 </A></B>
<P>
	This might mean at the outset some kind of tax break, which 
is unthinkable for those on the other side. They prefer to raid the 
piggy bank greedily, a bit more every day, and they will go almost 
as far as the highwaymen of the last century, who would lay in 
ambush for travellers and rob them. Whether the hon. member for 
Beauséjour likes it or not, this is the situation we are facing today. 
These people show no sign of compassion for taxpayers nor any 
willingness to provide some relief and get the economy rolling. 
We could get rid of the underground economy; it could yiled 
interesting results, but they refuse to do so.
<P>
	Even if I suggested such a thing, I would be afraid that they 
would turn around and tax capital gains from the sale of a 
residence. That shows are crooked they are.
<P>
	Personally, I expect nothing from this government but I hope it 
will be able to tell the truth to the people and tell them it paid out 
$920 million to the maritimes to buy the support of voters there and 
make them forget the terrible things it did there. But we cannot be 
sure of that, because we have just seen one province change 
governments unexpectedly.
<P>
	Their bill contains nothing which allows them to pat themselves 
on the back. We see how well they are holding promises made in 
1993. We should expect nothing from these people, not even the 
honesty to admit that they broke their promises and that their word 
is not worth more than the ink of the red book.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to follow up on my colleague's comments and start out 
by asking what is a promise. A promise is an assurance that one 
will or will not undertake a certain action. A promise is a statement 
of integrity, a statement made with integrity. It is a commitment 
that is not to be broken. When we talk about keeping promises we 
talk about building trust.
<P>
	On the campaign trail the Prime Minister said: ``There is not one 
promise that I have made that I will not keep''. That has now 
become a joke. This government has broken more promises in the 
past three years than it has kept.
<P>
	Regarding the GST, the Liberals promised to scrap, abolish, kill, 
eliminate, get rid of GST. This is a promise they took from door to 
door. This was a major cornerstone of the Liberals election 
campaign.
<P>
	On October 29, 1990 the current Prime Minister said: ``I am 
opposed to the GST. I have always been opposed to it and I will 
always be opposed to it''. The current Minister of Finance stood in 
the House of Commons on November 28, 1989 and said: ``The 
goods and services tax is a stupid, inept and incompetent tax''. On 
April 4, 1990 he said: ``I would abolish the GST''. On  November 
6, 1991 the current Deputy Prime Minister asked the Tory 
government why it was pursuing a GST policy that ``kills Canadian 
jobs and puts a heavy burden on our tourist industry''. On March 
24, 1994 the current revenue minister stated: ``As Liberals we were 
elected to change the tax, abolish the tax, scrap it''.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister campaigned that she would resign if 
the GST were not abolished under a Liberal government. Rather 
than resign, she stepped down and ran a second election in her 
riding which cost Canadian taxpayers $.5 million.
<P>
	Last March Reform put forward a motion to abolish the GST. 
One hundred and thirty Liberals, including the Prime Minister and 
Deputy Prime Minister, all voted to keep the GST. Their vote 
against the motion proves that they have absolutely no intention of 
keeping their election promise.
<P>
	Clearly, killing the GST promise is just another broken promise 
in a long string of broken promises. The Liberals claim to have 
fulfilled 75 per cent of their 1993 campaign promises. We checked. 
We found that they have fulfilled only 22 per cent of their 
promises. Some record. That is a record of shame.
<P>
	The red book says there is little room to raise taxes and that long 
term goals should be tax relief. The Liberals also claim they have 
not raised taxes. In fact, the Liberals have increased taxes 30 times 
in the past three budgets as well as instituting higher sales taxes for 
Atlantic Canadians.
<P>
	The government made many campaign promises to scrap the 
GST. During the campaign Canadians did not hear anything about 
harmonizing the tax with the provinces. Rather than scrap the GST, 
the Liberal government is in the process of harmonizing the GST 
with the provinces to create a new sales tax, a harmonized sales tax, 
HST. Instead of removing the GST, the Liberals are now trying to 
hide the GST by including new harmonized taxes in the price of 
goods.
<P>
	I cannot wait until the next election when Canadians will show 
the Liberals what they think of this broken promise, the same as the 
Canadians did with the Conservatives regarding the GST. Three 
Atlantic provinces have signed on to this deal, this harmonization 
deal. GST harmonization in Atlantic Canada merges provincial 
sales tax with the 7 per cent GST to create a single tax of 15 per 
cent to be implemented on April 1. It is odd that it should be 
coming on April Fool's Day.
<P>
	The provinces that have signed on are Newfoundland, Nova 
Scotia and New Brunswick. The harmonized tax, the HST, is 
nothing more than a super tax grab on consumer spending. It is 
simply another tax grab.
<P>
	From the last 13 years of Liberal and Tory rule, on average 
Canadian taxpayers now pay an extra $1,126 a year simply in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7155"> 7155 </A></B>
<P>
increased sales and excise taxes. The HST  if applied right across 
the country will raise these taxes even higher.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	In addition, the harmonized sales tax will apply to more goods 
than are currently taxed on retail sales. Consumers in the Atlantic 
provinces that signed on to the deal will pay higher taxes on 
children's clothing, gasoline, books, funerals, new homes, heating 
oil, haircuts, used goods and even postage stamps. This simply 
means higher taxes for Atlantic Canadians.
<P>
	For example the HST will push the price of a new house up by 
5.5 per cent. Some deal. Higher operating costs for landlords will 
mean that renters will pay higher rents.
<P>
	There are also concerns that the tax included pricing will cause 
chaos not only in the Atlantic provinces but in the rest of Canada. 
According to the Retail Council of Canada, national retailers will 
be forced to change computerized inventory systems and separately 
price goods bound for the Atlantic region. This alone will cost $100 
million.
<P>
	With harmonization, Canadians will have one tax included price 
in Atlantic Canada while the rest of the country will function with 
prices that do not include GST or sales tax on the label. There will 
be two separate systems.
<P>
	The harmonized sales tax is not only unfair to Atlantic 
Canadians who will pay higher taxes on many items, it is also 
unfair to the rest of Canada which will be paying $1 billion in 
compensation to the Atlantic provinces for lost tax revenue. Once 
again the west is financing the east with a $1 billion transfer of 
wealth to Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The combined sales taxes in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick 
are currently 18 per cent. In Newfoundland the combined rate is 20 
per cent. A 15 per cent combined rate is a deal for Atlantic Canada. 
The rate will be reduced. That is the reason for the $1 billion 
transfer.
<P>
	There are no advantages to provinces that pay a combined sales 
tax which is less. For example, Alberta has no provincial sales tax 
and only has the 7 per cent GST. Why would it want to enter into 
harmonization and go from the 7 per cent GST and no provincial 
tax to a 15 per cent tax? Try to sell that in Alberta. Tax systems 
across the country should be equitable, yet this deal is hardly 
equitable for Canadians outside the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	Furthermore there are concerns that revenue shortfalls as a result 
of lowering the tax rates may be made up by changes in 
equalization formulas. Canadians could see an increased 
redistribution of wealth from western Canadian taxpayers to the 
maritime provinces for nothing more than what are purely political 
reasons. Because the GST promise was not fulfilled, the 
government is now going to the HST. The result is that a  transfer of 
wealth is going right across the country to fix the deal. It is strictly 
political and it is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	Harmonization will not work in central and western Canada 
because as I stated earlier, at present the combined rates are less 
than 15 per cent.
<P>
	Furthermore it does not make any sense for Ottawa to adopt a 
policy that calls on all Canadians to pay the same taxation rates 
regardless of where they live. Provincial taxation rates are based on 
provincial needs. There is no reason for a national tax rate right 
across the country.
<P>
	All provinces simply will not come onside with this agreement. 
Some provinces have no sales tax, such as Alberta. Other provinces 
have a provincial rate that is less than 8 per cent, so the combined 
rate of 15 per cent simply does not make any economic sense for 
those provinces to buy on. Alberta, Ontario and B.C. are simply not 
willing to discuss the federal proposal. Support is very weak in 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and P.E.I. The HST simply does not work 
and it will not work.
<P>
	It is my understanding that in the beginning the government was 
going to call this the blended sales tax. Perhaps it should have done 
that. Now it is the harmonized sales tax, the HST. Of course a 
blended sales tax would be a BST. Many Canadians are seeing that 
a BST is very much what this bill is creating.
<P>
	When will the government understand that tax increases mean 
job losses? If the Liberals are serious about getting our economy 
back on track and creating jobs, then they must start by giving 
business incentives to create employment. That means lowering 
taxes, not raising them, as they are doing with the HST.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to speak on this GST bill, especially since I was a 
member of the ruling party at the time of the federal tax reform. I 
can clearly remember the whole process, and it is really funny 
today to see how the Liberals are going about it.
<P>
	Let us not forget that, in 1988-89, we had a federal tax that, from 
a consumer's point of view, was a hidden tax. It was known as the 
manufacturers sales tax and it was charged by manufacturers to 
retailers. When manufacturers shipped their products to retailers, 
13 per cent of the products' sale price went to the government to 
cover the federal tax.
<P>
	At the time, there were reportedly some 22,000 exemptions. 
Many products were neither taxed not taxable. It had been decided 
that food, drugs and educational material and health products 
should not be taxed. Many products became tax exempt; there were 
reportedly 22,000 exemptions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7156"> 7156 </A></B>
<P>
	A large number of manufacturers also argued before the courts 
that the federal tax should not apply to their products. They felt 
it was unfair for their products to be taxed when an equivalent 
product was not. Every manufacturer claimed that his product was 
similar to a product that was not taxed.
<P>
	This prompted the federal government, a member of which I was 
at the time, to reform the federal sales tax, not to create a new tax in 
addition to the old one, but to reform the old tax, because it was no 
longer manageable. There were so many court cases, it was just a 
nightmare. That tax was really not manageable any more.
<P>
	The federal tax has been in existence for a long time. It used to 
be a tax on products only, which the manufacturer himself would 
charge to retailers and then pay to the federal government. Because 
it was no longer manageable, the federal government, of which I 
was a member, decided to reform that tax, which generated about 
$18 billion in revenues.
<P>
	Today, it is said to bring in about the same amount, perhaps a 
little more. So, the idea was not to increase federal revenues, but to 
reform the tax to make it easier to manage and fairer to everyone.
<P>
	The federal tax was also difficult to administer in the case of 
exports. Now that it is directly charged to consumers, it is easier to 
manage in the case of exports, since these products are shipped 
before the tax applies. Indeed, most export products are not taxed, 
which promotes exports and creates jobs at home. This was quite a 
reform, as you will remember.
<P>
	However, the official opposition of the time led Canadians to 
believe that it was a new tax, and that the government wanted to tax 
them more. I remember that this issue generated heated debates in 
the House. The Liberals convinced Canadians that it was a new tax 
when in fact it was a tax reform. But they did convince people that 
it was indeed a new tax.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	They worked very hard. The issue was debated for months. They 
kept us in the ropes until Mr. Wilson, who was finance minister at 
the time, finally agreed to make several exceptions.
<P>
	Some products are exempt from the federal tax. Today, we are 
still stuck with a tax that does not apply to many exceptions. For 
example, if you buy an item at a convenience store you pay tax on 
it; however if you buy a six-pack of yogurt, it is tax free. Similarly, 
if you buy a cupcake you pay tax on it, but if you buy the same 
cupcake in a box of 12, there is no tax.
<P>
	All this is to say that, when the Liberals formed the official 
opposition, all they succeeded in doing was to further complicate 
this federal tax, when all we had wanted to do was simplify it.
<P>
	I sat on the committee responsible for the GST and I was in 
agreement up until the last minute. I remember very clearly that we 
met with the Minister of Finance almost every two weeks to 
discuss the issue and hear how things were progressing. I always 
supported it, because there was a GST refund for those earning less 
than $30,000. There was a refund for the neediest, the most 
disadvantaged, to offset the effects of this tax on goods and 
services. I always felt, and I still feel, that everything should have 
been taxed, without exception. All goods and services should have 
been taxed, whether they came under health, education or 
whatever, because we had simultaneously introduced a means of 
compensating poorer Canadians through a GST refund.
<P>
	You know that thousands of people receive GST refund cheques. 
So there was a system in place to compensate the poorest members 
of society. Why then was there a need for exemptions in this case? 
No, exemptions were not necessary, everything should have been 
taxed, without exception, because we had seen that the preceding 
federal tax with its 22,000 exemptions was no longer manageable. 
In the not too distant future, in a few years probably, we are going 
to find ourselves facing the same problems as those we had with the 
other tax.
<P>
	The difference is that the previous federal tax was 13 per cent on 
goods, and now we have a federal tax of 7 per cent, or 6.5 per cent, 
on goods and services, that is services received and goods sold. 
Before, it was just on goods. It was 13 per cent on goods, now it is 
6.5 per cent, but on both goods and services. You can see, then, it 
comes out just about the same.
<P>
	During the elections, we saw the Liberals attacking the 
Conservatives in a deceitful way, if you will, cheating a bit with the 
whole thing. They had already been very successful as the official 
opposition in convincing people that the Conservatives had created 
a new tax. It was, however, not a new tax, but a tax reform, which 
was completely legitimate and fair. However, when you are in 
politics and want to get into power, you can say just about 
anything; you lie to the public. I have always thought, since I 
started in politics, that the winners in an election campaign are the 
ones who are the biggest liars. Afterwards, they do exactly what 
they feel like, and this is obvious to everyone.
<P>
	I will give you a couple of examples of this. The Prime Minister 
said ``I will scrap this GST'', I will do away with the federal tax. 
This would have been no mean feat. In 1993, during the campaign, 
the Prime Minister said ``I will do away with the federal tax''. He 
tried to convince people once again that this was a new tax, not a 
reform of the tax created by the Conservatives, no, but a new tax in 
the mind of the Prime Minister, who said ``I will scrap it''. And did 
he? No, on the contrary, he is maintaining it and intends to dump 
others on us as well.
<P>
	He said: ``We hate this tax. We will get rid of it''. Those are the 
Prime Minister's words. The Deputy Prime Minister said: ``I will 
resign if the tax is not eliminated'', and she did.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7157"> 7157 </A></B>
<P>
	All of this to tell you that it is somewhat sad for democracy when 
all manner of things are said during a campaign, and then exactly 
the opposite is done afterwards.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased participate in the debate today and to register my 
opposition to this bill to harmonize the GST in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I am surprised that we have to register our opposition to this bill 
because while the bill has been introduced by the government, it 
had all kinds of opposition to this type of legislation back when it 
was on this side of the House. I refer to the Commons Debates, 
page 4554, November 5, 1991, when the member for Willowdale 
who is now the chairman of the finance committee said: ``How can 
Canadians have faith in this government's ability to lead us into 
prosperity when the GST, according to all these studies, is working 
against small business?''
<P>
	This is from the current chairman of the finance committee who 
has done a complete and absolute about turn on the legislation 
currently before us. He opposed it when he was on this side of the 
House and now be has bought into the entire Liberal agenda and is 
endorsing and supporting the Minister of Finance in the 
introduction of this divisive tax which is going to kill jobs.
<P>
	He was not the only one who did not like the GST. How about on 
May 10, 1993 Commons <I>Debates</I> page 19170, where the member 
for Winnipeg North stated: ``The Liberal party, in contrast, is 
committed to changing and abolishing the GST within 12 months''.
<P>
	The Liberals won the election in October 1993 and 12 months 
from that date was October 1994 and by that time we knew that the 
government had reneged on any promise it had made regarding the 
GST. Here we are today debating its enhancement rather than its 
elimination. The member for Winnipeg North said that within 12 
months be assured that this Liberal government will get rid of that 
hated tax which all Canadians would dearly love to see gone.
<P>
	Even the member for Edmonton Southeast-and it is not often 
that I go into quotes in <I>Hansard</I> from the member for Edmonton 
Southeast-on June 7, 1993, page 20483 said: ``It is one of the 
reasons why we are proud to say we will repeal that tax and ask 
Canadians how we can best replace the missing revenue''.
<P>
	We are not talking her about missing revenue. We are talking 
about adding to the revenue, and that is the ultimate insult.
<P>
	On it goes. How about the Prime Minister, June 13, 1991, page 
1632: ``With the GST this government has created an unfair and 
unacceptable tax''. He said that and he endorses the initiative of the 
Minister of Finance to introduce legislation to bring us the 
harmonized tax.
<P>
	The Prime Minister again, page 6046, December 10: ``On the 
GST we have a very clear position. We say that we want to kill the 
GST''. That is from the current Prime Minister, not the prime 
minister of that day. I quote his words from the Commons <I>Debates</I>.
<P>
	The member for Halifax, page 6406, Commons <I>Debates</I>, 
February 4, 1992: ``What I refer to is a general suffering from our 
goods and services tax''. And what did it do? The government 
harmonized, increased and took more money.
<P>
	One final quote from the member for Greenwood: ``My leader 
three weeks ago said that this GST will be scrapped. Make no 
mistake about it, the GST will be scrapped if we are given the trust 
to run the Government of Canada''. This was said in <I>Hansard</I> on 
March 12, 1993 page 16902.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Make no mistake about it, they were given the trust to run the 
Government of Canada and what did they do? They abused the 
trust. They let Canadians down. They have destroyed the 
confidence that the people gave to them in October 1993. That is 
why we have no faith in this country for politicians with those 
kinds of speeches when in opposition. They said ``give us the trust, 
put us in power, we will deliver''. What do we have? A harmonized 
sales tax for Atlantic Canada and a GST remaining for the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	The GST by the way has been increased for the rest of Canada 
because it now applies to used goods as well as new goods. Every 
time a car trades hands the government collects GST on that 
automobile even though there was a serious commitment by the 
government that goods would be taxed only once when they were 
brand new. This Liberal government has expanded the tax to cover 
everything every time it changes hands.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance tells us he is not increasing taxes. 
Hypocrisy from this government that it would say such things.
<P>
	There are quotes upon quotes. In the Toronto <I>Star</I> dated October 
29, 1990, the Liberal government said it will scrap the goods and 
services tax if it wins the next election. The current Prime Minister 
said: ``I am opposed to the GST. I have always been opposed to it 
and I will always be opposed to it''. I could go on forever slamming 
this government but let us talk about something positive for a 
change.
<P>
	We heard the hon. member for Medicine Hat today in question 
period when he was talking about the Certified General 
Accountants Association which came out yesterday calling for a 
tax reduction, which I wholeheartedly endorse and let it be noted 
for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7158"> 7158 </A></B>
<P>
the record. I happen to be a certified general accountant and 
therefore I fully endorse the report it issued yesterday.
<P>
	It said if we drop the UI premiums by 20 per cent that would 
create about 60,000 jobs. As the member for Medicine Hat said, 
Reform wants to drop it by 28 per cent which will create even more 
jobs. That is the commitment by the Reform Party. I assure 
members that after the next election when Reform trades places 
with the Liberals we will honour that commitment. Have no fear, 
we are not mincing our words, we are not saying beautiful things to 
win elections. We are talking about Reform policies where we say 
we will deliver.
<P>
	We have talked about reducing taxes to families. People today on 
small incomes are struggling to raise their families and before they 
get that small pay cheque that is made even smaller by this 
government they have to get by. And yet we find that this 
government would rather try to tell us about programs that pick up 
the pieces of broken families rather than focusing on keeping 
families together.
<P>
	I have an interesting story. I was going through the airport while 
heading back to my riding one day. One of the security personnel 
spotted my badge as a member of the House of Commons. He 
stopped me to tell me that he does not make a large salary as part of 
the security personnel at the airport. He has a wife and three 
children. Yet his family is so important to him that he makes sure 
that his wife stays home even though they have to do without many 
things. Yet on his small single salary he makes ends meet even 
though it is quite difficult.
<P>
	The current taxation policies by the Liberal government deny 
him a deduction because he wants to raise his own children by 
himself and have his wife at home. The parents are denied tax relief 
because they want to raise their own children. He could send the 
children next door and have the next door kids come to his house 
and have his wife look after them and they would each get a tax 
deduction. But this government's policy is to deny a tax deduction 
for anyone who wants to raise their own children. What is fair 
about that?
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	That is no more fair than the way Canadians have been misled by 
this government when they were told that the GST will be axed, 
scrapped and abolished; not harmonized, not increased, not 
expanded, not to collect more money. That is the deception this 
government has imposed on the people of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
absolutely must take advantage of the government's motion to 
point out how both the parliamentary process and Liberal promises 
have made a laughingstock of democracy. The official opposition 
received a 300-page bill, with 24 hours to look at the text and no 
explanatory notes.
<P>
	This is hardly a democratic or a parliamentary way of doing 
things and shows little respect for the role and the duties of the 
official opposition and the third party. Their role is to ensure that 
the government discharges its duties in accordance with its 
program, the commitments it has made and its legal obligations.
<P>
	We can hardly say that receiving a 300-page bill on which we are 
expected to make recommendations the next day is conducive to a 
serious process, a process that will reassure Canadians. That is the 
real issue. This government behaves as though it were the only 
party in this country. No wonder it has stopped showing any 
concern for human rights in its international relations.
<P>
	I also want to point out, and we cannot help but repeat this now 
that an election is in the offing, that the Liberal Party was elected 
last time thanks to at least two false representations: jobs, jobs, 
jobs, emplois, emplois, emplois, while the results, despite all the 
Prime Minister's bragging, are nowhere near meeting existing 
needs and nowhere near the level reached in 1990.
<P>
	Two thirds of the drop in the unemployment rate, which is still 
close to 10 per cent, or as the Prime Minister would say, is no 
longer 12 per cent, is due to the fact that unemployed workers have 
left the labour market and have given up looking for jobs.
<P>
	So the unemployment rate has gone down, but the number of 
unemployed workers has not. It is worse than that. According to a 
recent Statistics Canada publication, what happened between 
December 1994 and December 1995, a period the government likes 
to brag about in terms of its performance? The bulk of the jobs 
were created by independent workers, in other words, people who 
had to start their own business, and of course, we do not know how 
long that will last, and meanwhile, these people are cut off from all 
social insurance programs.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	``Jobs, jobs, jobs'' came with a promise by the government to get 
rid of the unpopular GST. What do we see? Not only does the 
government not get rid of the GST, but it busts its britches because 
the Deputy Prime Minister, who agreed to resign, was re-elected, 
and the government is now absolved. Well, that is far from the case. 
We remind the government, the Liberal Party, that it was elected on 
promises it knew it could not keep.
<P>
	The example came from way back in the history of the Liberal 
Party. Mr. Speaker, I do not know how old you are, but you must 
remember that Prime Minister Trudeau, in his time, ridiculed the 
Conservative government, which, in a period of high inflation, 
talked of imposing wage and price controls. Poor JoeClark suffered 
the slings and arrows of the opposition of the day.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7159"> 7159 </A></B>
<P>
	What did Prime Minister Trudeau do a few months later? He 
imposed wage and price controls. There is a lesson there. It should 
be repeated in the coming months. The Liberal Party gets elected 
on promises it does not keep and I dare to suggest that it knows 
it cannot keep them.
<P>
	A couple of words to say that this promise will cost Canadians 
and Quebecers dearly, because in order to appear to keep it more or 
less, the government reached an agreement with the Atlantic 
provinces to have them integrate the GST, make it disappear, 
something it has always opposed. But they will receive, in 
compensation, $961 million coming out of the pockets of the other 
provinces. Not only were the promises made deceptive, but it is 
costing a pretty penny to hide the fact that the government is unable 
to deliver the goods.
<P>
	I take some solace, however, in the thought that, in the upcoming 
election campaign, the Liberal government will probably promise 
to resolve the Canada-Quebec issue. That is what the government 
will say, but everyone will know that it will, in fact, be paving the 
road to Quebec sovereignty. It will promise what it cannot deliver 
and knows it cannot deliver, but will run on that platform anyway.
<P>
	We, on the other hand, will be able to remind voters of this fact 
over and over again and to count on the Liberal government 
helping us win the next referendum. We want to reassure you 
however that what we want is to negotiate a partnership with 
Canada. Our offer remains on the table because we count on your 
co-operation in the next election.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal Party is giving a really poor example of democracy, 
a poor example of the parliamentary system at work.
<P>
	If I have a moment, I would like to add that the measure adopted 
by this government that has promised to eliminate the GST on 
books is in fact mere window dressing so the government can say it 
eliminated the GST. The truth of the matter is that this government 
is not going as far as Quebec by extending the tax exemption to all 
books, not only those bought by organizations involved in literacy 
programs but also those bought by consumers, but it is once again 
trying to pull the wool over people's eyes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to address the House this afternoon 
on Bill C-70.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Inasmuch 
as we members are outnumbered by the pages, I would suggest we 
probably do not have a quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Call in the members.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I see a quorum. Resuming 
debate, the hon. member for Prince George-Peace River.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
good to have an audience at last. I am always torn between having 
absolutely no Liberals in the House and having so many Liberals in 
the House making so much noise that I cannot hear myself think. 
We are always betwixt and between whether we want to have one 
or two government members to hear our remarks or whether we 
would rather have a whole bunch and be unable to be heard.
<P>
	Before I begin my remarks on Bill C-70, the harmonized sales 
tax legislation, I have a few brief remarks on what transpired in this 
place this morning. There seems to be a misconception on the part 
of some government members as to exactly what happened. It is 
important for the viewing audience out there in TV land to 
understand the process and the procedure which took place this 
morning and why that got out of kilter. It is necessary to correct the 
record.
<P>
	This morning during debate on Bill C-71, the tobacco bill, my 
colleague from Macleod put forward a motion that the question be 
now put. What happened was that I believe there was a 
misunderstanding on the part of the Speaker who was in the Chair 
at the time. She elected to call the question immediately, but that 
was not the point at all.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. The hon. member 
knows it is improper to reflect on decisions of the House or on 
decisions of the Speaker once rendered. I would caution him in his 
remarks to avoid such references. I think he has other matters he 
will want to discuss in relation to the bill before the House and I 
invite him to approach the subject in that vein.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
endeavouring to clear up a misunderstanding, not cast negative 
aspersions on anyone, let alone on the Chair of the House. I think it 
is incumbent on all of us as members of Parliament who are trying 
to represent our constituents to clear up any potential for a 
misunderstanding.
<P>
	It certainly was not the intent of the Reform Party of Canada to 
limit debate. That was not the intent of the motion and the motion 
indeed did not do that. I want to make it very clear for the people 
out there who are watching that the motion in no way limited 
debate on Bill C-71, the tobacco bill.
<P>
	I make reference to that because of the chain of events which did 
take place which prevented some members from speaking. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7160"> 7160 </A></B>
<P>
member for Haldimand-Norfolk made an intervention in that 
regard. I can sympathize with that because a number of members 
had intended to speak to the legislation and had important points to 
bring forward on behalf of their constituents. Certainly the member 
for Haldimand-Norfolk was one of those individuals, as he 
indicated, who wanted to make some strong points and represent 
the people in his riding. The Reform Party certainly did not limit or 
prevent him or any other member in this place from doing that.
<P>
	I sympathize with the member. I believe that all of us in this 
place get tired of preparing presentations only to have some 
procedural thing prevent us from presenting our views to the 
House. Indeed from time to time the government elects to enact 
closure or time allocation and prevents members from all parties 
from speaking to important legislation. That too is tragic. It is very 
unfortunate that this morning we had a process which did not fall 
into place the way it was intended to allow people to speak to that 
legislation. That was unfortunate for all members concerned.
<P>
	I want to say that I have a personal point of view on that very 
important issue. I am a father of three young children and 
unfortunately my middle child has taken up smoking in this last 
year or so. I wanted to bring the personal perspective as a parent 
and that I have struggled for the last 12 or 15 years to try to quit 
smoking. I know how addictive nicotine is.
<P>
	I wanted to bring forward how tragic it is for all parents who 
have to deal with children who have taken up cigarette smoking. I 
know we are all concerned about that. It is certainly why the 
Reform Party endeavoured to assist the government in fast tracking 
the legislation and to do all we could to assist the government in 
helping the youth of our country who unfortunately are taking up 
cigarette smoking despite all the education about it.
<P>
	I will now move on to Bill C-70, the harmonized sales tax. Never 
before has a particular government initiative, the goods and 
services tax, caused such fury in our nation. Anyone in Canada can 
reflect on the debate which took place inside and outside the House 
of Commons during the days, weeks and months that the Mulroney 
government was bringing forth the GST. It tried to ram it through 
despite the polls which consistently showed time after time after 
time that roughly 85 per cent of Canadians were opposed to this 
tax.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	Why were they opposed to the tax? Obviously people are 
opposed to any tax, but the reality goes much deeper than that. I 
made the remark a couple of years ago when we were debating gun 
control in this place that I believed that Canadians had reached the 
same point with gun control as they had with taxes. They had 
reached the breaking point.
<P>
	They reached that point with the GST. That is why there was 
such an uproar all across the country against the Mulroney Tories, 
the Conservatives, and the much hated GST they were attempting 
to implement. It was so much so that as will be recalled when 
looking at the history of this tax, Mulroney had to actually go to the 
extraordinary step of appointing eight additional senators to the 
other place in order to ram through that legislation against the 
wishes of the vast majority of Canadians.
<P>
	What have we got now? I recently wrote an article for the 
newspapers back in my riding of Prince George-Peace River in 
which I briefly detailed the history of the GST. I find it more than a 
bit ironic that this tax caused a couple of Conservative MPs to be 
thrown out of their caucus because they dared to represent their 
constituents and that last spring this same issue caused the Liberal 
Party, which is now the government, to throw a member of 
Parliament out of its caucus.
<P>
	Despite the fact that this Liberal government would like to pull 
the wool over the eyes of Canadian voters that the Liberals are 
different from the Conservatives who came before them, what we 
see is that they are exactly the same. And they wonder why 
Reformers and Canadians from coast to coast are saying Liberal, 
Tory, same old story. Nothing changes.
<P>
	On the subject of the member of Parliament for York 
South-Weston, it is more than interesting that in a speech to the 
Rotary Club of Toronto he addressed the topic ``Honesty, Ethics 
and Accountability: Does it exist in Canada's political system''. In 
the little time I have left, I would like to quote one thing from his 
remarks that day:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Removing me from the Liberal caucus accomplished two things. Firstly, it 
accomplished the government's main objective. It sent a very clear message that the 
PMO is intent to maintaining control over members of the Liberal caucus. But in 
addition, separate and apart from the Liberal Party or the GST, it sent a second larger 
message to the Canadian public. The action taken by the government on this issue 
has reinforced Canadians' worst suspicions-that political parties will promise 
anything to be elected, and once in power will not fulfil that promise. That message 
is the reason people question whether there is honesty or ethics in our political 
system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a direct quote from the member for York South-Weston 
on how he was treated by the government on this very issue of the 
GST and his stand against it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
want to address Bill C-70, which is basically a series of 
amendments to the GST.
<P>
	Three years ago, the Liberal members opposite promised to 
abolish the GST. You will remember that, every day during the 
1993 election campaign, Liberal candidates would canvass their 
ridings, all over the country, telling people to vote for them, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7161"> 7161 </A></B>
<P>
because they would eliminate the GST. The Liberals were even 
more vocal outside Quebec. They said: ``We will scrap the GST''.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I will use polite words and define ``to scrap'' as the equivalent of 
to abolish or to eliminate. The Prime Minister even repeated that 
statement in the House on several occasions, in response to 
questions from Bloc members and members from other parties as 
well.
<P>
	Three years later, we have before us a few proposed changes here 
and there, and what amounts to some kind of political compromise 
to compensate those maritime provinces that have harmonized 
their tax structure.
<P>
	Over these three years, abolishing the GST gradually became 
synonymous with harmonizing the GST. To my knowledge, the 
dictionary does not mention ``to harmonize'' as a synonym for ``to 
eliminate'' or ``to abolish''. I may be wrong, but I doubt it. In any 
case, voters will not be fooled.
<P>
	As for the Deputy Prime Minister, she went even further than her 
colleagues and said she would resign if her government did not 
abolish the GST. She said that because she thought her party had 
made a commitment-after all she is now the Deputy Prime 
Minister-to abolish that tax. She did resign, but only to 
immediately run again in a byelection that cost Canadian taxpayers 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. Indeed, her constituents were not 
the only ones who had to pay. Everyone in this country had to pay 
for this political circus by the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	If she was so convinced that her government had not kept its 
promise, why did she not resign and go back to private life, period? 
Probably because she missed the limousine, her position as Deputy 
Prime Minister and all the advantages she enjoys every day.
<P>
	Having missed all that for a few weeks, she naturally came back, 
resumed her duties, and was taken back into the fold as though 
nothing had happened, and nothing more was said.
<P>
	It is a rather sorry saga, but there is more. The Deputy Prime 
Minister's political adventure was a costly one, but there was more 
to come, so that she could go to the voters and say: ``Look, we have 
kept our promise'', because they harmonized the tax in the 
maritimes and everyone knows perfectly well that right now the 
Liberals are strong in that area of the country. So they gave a 
political gift, because we must call a spade a spade, of $1 billion so 
that the maritimes would accept harmonization. Not just so that 
they would accept it, but also to sweeten the bitter pill of 
unprecedented unemployment insurance cuts in the Atlantic 
region.
<P>
	These cuts were condemned by the same members who today are 
on the other side of the House, let us remember. These people 
thought the Conservative agenda with respect to unemployment 
insurance was scandalous and shocking, and made no bones about 
it. When they came to power, they cut benefits, and later reformed 
the system twice, both times for the worse, further cutting benefits.
<P>
	As well, there are still a number of technical problems that have 
not yet been worked out in this reform, but we have been raising 
them in question period every day.
<P>
	Therefore, this political compensation of $1 billion for the 
maritimes is aimed at softening up voters so that Liberal members 
and the few ministers can go back to their ridings and say: ``Yes, it 
is true we did not keep that promise, but look at the $1 billion we 
got for the maritimes''.
<P>
	But who is paying this billion dollars? The taxpayers in Quebec 
and in Canada. They are all paying for this billion dollar political 
compensation package. And that is not all, because the way it has 
been set up, with respect to the compensation and reorganization of 
the tax in these provinces, there will be further compensation when 
it comes to equalization payments for the maritimes, given that the 
rate of taxation has gone down.
<P>
	This could be the result. There is a possibility that equalization 
payments to these provinces will increase. In addition, as if that 
were not enough, we could keep paying for this harmonization 
indefinitely, all so as to avoid keeping this ridiculous promise.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Everyone saw just how impossible it was for the government, 
when it came to power with a deficit of around $37 billion or $38 
billion-padded, of course so as to be able to say it had reduced it 
afterward-to deprive itself of $17 billion in revenue and yet 
eliminate the deficit just like that, overnight?
<P>
	That is what the Liberals were telling people. Some MPs were 
taken in. I remember, I was sitting on the finance committee. To 
continue the drawn-out GST circus, they had the Standing 
Committee on Finance tour the country to consult Canadians on 
their ideas for a replacement formula. When they came to office in 
1993, they started looking at the alternatives, as if they had just 
realized, after the election, that they could not deprive themselves 
of some $15 billion to $17 billion without finding an alternative.
<P>
	Consultations were held, and witnesses appeared one after the 
other, those who wanted to see the tax done away with, and those 
who said ``Listen here, that was a dumb promise, you cannot keep 
it''. All this just to produce a report, which was probably already 
written right from the start, which stated ``Yes, but it would be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7162"> 7162 </A></B>
<P>
preferable to harmonize the GST with the provincial taxes''. I will 
get back to that, as behind this tax  harmonization is a strong desire 
to centralize. It was already obvious in these recommendations that 
the tone had changed, that they were singing a different tune.
<P>
	What was going on in Quebec at the same time? In Quebec, the 
provincial sales tax was adjusted annually. Finally, Mr. Campeau, 
who was the minister of finance, harmonized his tax with the 
federal sales tax. Without any compensation whatsoever, Quebec 
harmonized its tax.
<P>
	The maritimes, which followed suit, got compensation. Now 
they have a problem on their hands. What will they do if Ontario 
harmonizes now? What will they do if the western provinces 
harmonize now? Are there likely to be other billion dollar gifts? 
This may be the promise that will have cost Canadian taxpayers the 
most in a very long time. How far will they go with this madness of 
very dubious promises that weigh heavily on Canadian taxpayers?
<P>
	Where are they going? They do not really know. Moreover, there 
is an injustice. If one province receives compensation, why not all 
of them. Those who acted first are penalized. The little measure to 
sweeten the pot is the removal of the tax on books. Just a minute. 
That is not the case. It is for institutional purchases. Individuals 
must not think that there will be no more tax on books. They will 
get a surprise. With Christmas coming, they will discover there is 
no change.
<P>
	What harmonization with the federal government means is that 
the federal government will collect taxes for everyone, including 
Quebec. The federal government likes to collect money, make the 
provinces dependent on transfer payments and then say: ``Yes, we 
will give you so much money''.
<P>
	If things are not going well with federal public funds, transfer 
payments are cut. The provinces have to make painful cuts, 
because they manage the daily fare of health, education and social 
programs, which affect the public. The federal government is 
above all that and continues to waste money left, right and centre 
and to spend it, as we have seen in the case of the Deputy Prime 
Minister, on endless political spectacles. I have no doubt that 
voters, and I will conclude here, will remember this come the next 
election campaign, and there will be talk of the famous Liberal 
promises.
<P>
	I will be keen to see how they go about trying to be credible the 
next time. Everyone will remember the GST and everyone will 
remember the other promise not kept, the one that is even more 
important, that of the jobs they never delivered. We can hardly wait 
to meet them along the next election campaign trail.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-International Court; the hon.  member for 
Frontenac-asbestos industry; the hon. member for the 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake-child poverty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, October 1993 was a significant time for all Canadians. It 
was when a majority of Canadians elected a Liberal government 
after nine years of the Tories.
<P>
	The Liberals promised this and they promised that. At every 
campaign meeting Liberal candidates would be waving their red 
book, saying a Liberal government would fulfil all its promises and 
put the country back on its feet.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Historically the Conservatives are known as the Tories and the 
Liberals are known as the Grits. With respect to the GST and all of 
the governance in fact that we have ever had from this country it is 
Grit or Tory, same old story.
<P>
	Canadians elected the Liberal government because it promised 
to scrap, kill and abolish the GST. Now we have Bill C-70 which is 
not about scrapping the GST but about harmonizing it.
<P>
	In the 1993 election campaign the Liberals were desperately 
searching for that one hot button item to woo the voters. They 
found it. It was the GST. When a Liberal candidate spoke about 
getting rid of the GST they always received a positive reaction 
from the audience. Unfortunately-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite sure that what my Reform 
colleague has to say is interesting, therefore I believe we should be 
as many as possible to listen to him, and I call for a quorum count.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I will ask the Clerk to 
count the members present.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Indeed we do not have a 
quorum. Call in the members.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I see a quorum. Resuming 
debate, the hon. member for New Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, before the last election the Liberals 
knew full well what they would do with the GST. They knew that 
scrapping the goods and services tax would not be an option. They 
knew they would not be able to come up with an equal amount of 
revenue, yet true to Liberal form they said that they would abolish it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7163"> 7163 </A></B>
<P>
	Now members of this government are trying to say they never 
said scrap, abolish or kill the GST, that they said harmonize or 
streamline. If this government never used the words scrap, abolish 
or kill then why did the Deputy Prime Minister resign her seat? 
Why did the member for York South-Weston leave the Liberal 
caucus? Why did the member for Broadview-Greenwood support 
the member for York South-Weston for sticking to his principles? 
Because they all knew they were wrong. They knew full well that 
their constituents did not elect them to harmonize the GST.
<P>
	The member for York South-Weston did the right thing by 
keeping his promises to his constituents. As is the true Reformer 
style, that member voted the wishes of those who elected him. Now 
it seems this independent member wants to walk back across the 
floor to join his Liberal colleagues.
<P>
	Today it was reported in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> that the same 
member said: ``That issue is over and done with. I've made my 
point and I don't intend to speak to that issue again''. I remind the 
member that the issue of the GST will not be over as long as the 
Liberals are in power. And they confirm it again today with Bill 
C-70.
<P>
	Liberal members and all Liberal candidates will have to go into 
the next election and explain to all Canadians why the GST is still 
there.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	In Ontario, Liberals are going to have to sell the electorate on 
harmonization when Ontario premier Mike Harris says he has no 
interest on harmonizing the GST with the provincial tax. Whenever 
Harris has been asked about the possibility of harmonizing the 
taxes, he firmly states that the federal harmonization plan would 
cost Ontario consumers between $2 billion and $3 billion a year. 
Ontarians are not going to buy the Liberal harmonization promises 
no matter how it is sugar coated.
<P>
	Manitoba premier Gary Filmon says that the harmonization is ``a 
bad deal for Manitobans''. He also says what the government 
``cannot do is help us with the transference that takes place off the 
backs of businesses and on to the backs of consumers. Consumers 
in Manitoba would have to pick up $300 million a year of the 
burden. It just doesn't work. It is a bad deal''.
<P>
	The same words are echoed by the Governments of 
Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. In fact, these 
provinces are not even willing to discuss the proposal with the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	Bill C-70 is a bill that deals specifically with the provinces on 
the east coast. This bill is not going to change the tax in my home 
province of British Columbia so when and if Bill C-70 is given 
royal consent, my constituents are still going to be paying the GST.
<P>
	This bill is not about harmonization or streamlining. It is about 
failing to follow through on a promise. With Bill C-70, the Liberals 
need the support of provincial governments. If they had proposed 
this plan in the last election, Canadians would have soon 
discovered that such a plan would not work. Had the Liberals 
followed through on their election promise, provincial support 
would not have been necessary. I guess that provincial 
governments would have loved seeing an abolished GST.
<P>
	Canadians were cheated in the last election concerning that kind 
of promise. There is no other way to say it. Putting everything into 
practical terms, the Liberals promised that they would give back 
money to Canadians to alleviate a personal tax. Now, over three 
years later, Canadians have not received their share.
<P>
	However, there is a solution and the solution is not too difficult 
to achieve. What Canadians need to do is get rid of the party of 
dead promises and elect a party that will follow through on what it 
says. The Reform Party is the only party that will make promises 
which can be kept. We are not about using hot button issues simply 
to attract a vote for the short term.
<P>
	I really wonder if the east coast residents know what they will be 
getting with a harmonized tax. Do they know that they will be 
paying more for children's clothing, funerals, books, auto repairs, 
electricity, gasoline, home heating fuel and even hair cuts? 
Probably not. Consumers are going to be hit hard by the passage of 
Bill C-70.
<P>
	I was told recently that the Investment Property Owner's 
Association tabled a report in the Nova Scotia legislature which 
states that renters can expect to shoulder some of the higher 
operating costs that will hit landlords with a harmonized GST. 
Again the government is going to go after those who have lesser 
incomes, all for the sake of some political expediency. My only 
hope is that the east coast media gives these people the facts about 
the implications of harmonization. However, my fear is that the 
Liberal media will say very little about it leaving the east coast 
residents in the dark.
<P>
	The Canadian Real Estate Association says that a harmonized 
sales tax will push up new housing prices on average by about 
$4,000 in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. In New Brunswick, new 
housing prices are expected to climb as much as $3,300. In fact, the 
Halifax Chamber of Commerce is predicting that municipalities are 
going to raise property taxes all because the eastern provinces were 
bribed into the harmonization deal.
<P>
	The Liberals have been speaking about how they never said this 
and never said that during the campaign. I am not going to stand 
here and accuse individual members of what they said because I 
was not present during each of their campaigns or following them 
door to door as they went knocking. However, I will tell constitu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7164"> 7164 </A></B>
<P>
ents in each federal riding to make their own accusations. They 
remember what was said.
<P>
	I want to offer the House some comments by members with 
regard to the GST. I think Canadians will get the idea of what the 
majority of Liberal members meant during the 1993 election.
<P>
	For example, the member for Mississauga West, referring to a 
reply from a Department of Finance letter which said that 
Canadians were getting used to the GST, said: ``If anyone believed 
that I do not think they are in touch with reality''.
<P>
	The member for York South-Weston commented that: ``I hope 
we do not try to hoodwink people into thinking our commitment 
was contingent on the provinces agreeing to harmonize their taxes 
with the GST. A good number of my colleagues feel the same way. 
The gun control protest will appear to be a nursery school tea party 
if we do not fulfil that commitment on the GST''.
<P>
	Bill C-70 will not be accepted by Canadians. The only bill that 
Canadians will accept is the one that completely gets rid of the 
GST. But the government does not have what it takes to follow 
through on its promises. The Prime Minister expelled the member 
for York-South Weston for voting no confidence. I hope that the 
Prime Minister and his party will be prepared to have the Canadian 
people vote no confidence in the next election and instead vote for 
a party that will bring integrity and honesty back into government.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has publicly admitted that the 
government made a mistake in promising to scrap the GST. Yet 
government members continue to say that no mistake was made. 
Government members are going in all different directions. The 
government is unstable and unfit to run this country. Bill C-70 is 
two inches thick of smoke and mirrors.
<P>
	The finance minister is only fooling himself if he thinks that this 
bill is going to solve the GST problem. As the member from 
Mississauga said, if the government thinks that people have got 
used to the GST, then the government is out of touch with reality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I get into 
my remarks, my colleague from Swift Current reminds me that the 
official opposition is going into a leadership race and that the 
member for Vegreville may be resurrecting his campaign for that 
position.
<P>
	In talking about the goods and services tax and the 
harmonization that Bill C-70 represents, it is obvious to anyone 
who has been paying attention to what has been going on for the 
last few years, particularly since the run up to the 1993 election and 
since, that this bill is a cruel hoax perpetrated on the people of 
Canada, particularly the people of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	It is a political ploy designed to provide the illusion that the 
government and the Liberals are doing something about the goods 
and services tax. It was an issue in the last campaign. My 
colleagues have gone on all afternoon highlighting the statements, 
promises and remarks that were made by government members 
when they were running in the 1993 election.
<P>
	The bill is designed to give Canadians the impression that the 
government is trying to make good on an irresponsible promise it 
should never have made and ought to have known better. I certainly 
believe that there are many members opposite, including the Prime 
Minister, as the evidence shows, and including the finance 
minister, who knew better than to make a promise they could not 
keep. They knew at the time they could not keep that promise but 
they went ahead and made it anyway in order to attract electoral 
support and to convince Canadians to vote Liberal in the last 
election.
<P>
	They knew full well the deep resentment that Canadians held for 
the Conservatives for bringing in the goods and services tax. They 
knew what a hot button issue it was. They said: ``Vote for us, folks, 
and we will get rid of it''. They had no intention of doing that. As a 
matter of fact, they knew it could not be done. Any responsible 
Liberal knew it could not be done, but they went ahead and 
promised it anyway.
<P>
	Now we have shifted away from kill, abolish and scrap, which 
was the election promise of so many current MPs who were 
running for the Liberal Party, and now it is replace.
<P>
	When I thought about what I might say today, I knew I would 
have to choose my words carefully. I do have respect for the Chair 
and for this institution. I do not have a lot of respect all the time for 
what the government does in the House and what certain members 
opposite try to say to Canadians.
<P>
	I have a friend in northern B.C. who has a rather laconic way of 
describing people who habitually cannot tell the truth, or who 
habitually lie. He says that somebody who does that would rather 
lie on credit when they could get cash for the truth. I think that is 
what we are faced with here. We are faced with a government and 
high profile cabinet ministers who would prefer to mislead 
Canadians in an election campaign in order to attract electoral 
support when they know full well that they cannot live up to the 
promises they have made. It also shows that the government, time 
and time again, will put political interests ahead of the best 
interests of the country. A case in point is this harmonization bill. It 
is designed to create the illusion that the government is actually 
doing something about the GST. In fact, it is a billion dollar rip-off 
for the rest of Canada, those people who live outside Atlantic 
Canada, and it will hurt the people who live in Atlantic Canada. 
Many of them have already come to that conclusion.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7165"> 7165 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	How many stories have we heard in recent weeks about small 
businesses having to close? They are telling the government not to 
proceed. They cannot possibly live with this additional tax. 
Consumers in Atlantic Canada know this means an additional tax 
burden on them. It is a hoax. It is not going to make anything better, 
it is going to make things worse.
<P>
	Why is the government proceeding with it at this time? Why 
does it not come clean with Canadians and say: ``We made a 
mistake. We should not have said that we were going to kill, scrap 
and abolish the GST because we cannot do it. Now, in the best 
interests of the country, let us balance the books. Let us get rid of 
the deficit and after that we will slowly start to reduce the GST 
until we can phase it out altogether''. That is the responsible thing 
to say to Canadians. It is certainly what my colleagues in the 
Reform Party are saying to Canadians. It is what we believe.
<P>
	If the justice minister will let us keep our guns, we will find a 
way to hunt that GST down a couple of years after we balance the 
books and we will kill it, but not before we balance the books and 
not before we eliminate the deficit.
<P>
	This relates to other taxation issues, in that the government 
collects taxes and fees for services for specific commodities and 
services with the unwritten promise that those moneys collected 
are going to be used for the purposes which the government has 
identified.
<P>
	For example, 60 cents out of every dollar that a Canadian spends 
at the gas pump goes to taxation of one form or another. A lot of it 
is road tax. A lot of that is collected on the basis that the moneys 
are going to be used to build new infrastructure or maintain 
existing roads and bridges. You do not have to be a rocket scientist 
or an engineer to see the state of Canada's infrastructure at the 
present time. You do not have to drive a great deal to notice the 
state of Canada's roads and bridges. Yet the government continues 
to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel taxes designed for 
roads and bridges. Where does the money go? It goes into the big 
black debt hole here in Ottawa.
<P>
	We cannot forget that the government of the day, that wonderful 
Progressive Conservative Party, which introduced the GST in the 
first place, said: ``We are making a solemn promise. When we 
introduce this tax we are going to use it to reduce the deficit.'' Does 
anybody remember that? By how much did that government reduce 
the deficit? I do not think there is a Canadian who believes that the 
Progressive Conservative Party ever intended to reduce the deficit. 
I do not think there is a Canadian who, at this stage of the game, 
believes that the Liberals intended to kill, scrap and abolish the 
GST, even though that is what they solemnly promised to do in the 
last election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> There is no question that you cannot read. Read 
the red book. Read what it says.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hear a bit of noise coming 
from across the way. I see a sea of agreeable faces, but there are 
two or three who do not agree with me over there.
<P>
	There are other issues. The fishing licence fees that were 
imposed on Atlantic Canadians was nothing more than a $50 
million cash grab on the part of the Liberal government. The 
Liberals say this is an access fee. It is in return for the services that 
are provided to fishermen. What services have they provided? It is 
nothing more than a tax grab to feed this black debt hole here in 
Ottawa. There is no intention to match the funds that are received 
for specific purposes and actually see that those funds are spent in 
those areas.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	In closing let me say one more time that it is time for this 
government to come clean. It is time for this government to tell 
Canadians ``we should not have made this promise, we are sorry 
that we have lied to you, we are going to abolish this idea of 
harmonization''.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ANACTTOREVOKETHECONVICTIONOFLOUISDAVIDRIEL">AN ACT TO REVOKE THE CONVICTION OF LOUIS 
DAVID RIEL</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 22, 1996, consideration of 
the motion that Bill C-297, an act to revoke the conviction of Louis 
David Riel, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured and humbled by this opportunity to speak to Bill C-297, 
the purpose of which is to revoke the conviction of Louis Riel for 
high treason.
<P>
	When I studied the history of Quebec and Canada, one of the 
saddest events was undoubtedly the conviction and subsequent 
execution of Louis Riel.
<P>
	Members will recall that this happened shortly after Canada 
became a confederation, the Canadian Confederation, at a time 
when it had decided to expand its borders.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	It was feared that the Americans, who had just bought Alaska, 
would take possession of western Canada and that Canada, as it 
existed at the time, would not be able to connect with British 
Columbia, a new province at the time, to form a country.
<P>
	As is often the case, the whole issue started with a deal between 
Canada and the Hudson's Bay Company. In order to extend its 
territory, Canada reached an agreement with that English company, 
for a certain amount of money. There were individuals living in 
western Canada in those days, but they were mostly Metis. They 
had formed a people. John A. Macdonald's central government 
wanted to retain control at any cost.
<P>
	Louis Riel is a great Canadian, a great patriot, a man who fought 
for his people and his language in that environment. Louis Riel 
heard the cry of his people and defended them. We all remember 
that Louis Riel was born in St. Boniface, on October 22, 1844. He 
was born in western Canada. His father, Louis Riel, was a Metis, 
and his mother, Julie de la Gimonière, was the first daughter to be 
born in a family of white settlers in western Canada. In 1858, he 
studied at the Montreal seminary, so he knew French very well. 
Then he went back home. They say he did not have the calling to be 
a priest, even though he came from a very religious family.
<P>
	In those days, the federalists, the Ottawa centralists, wanted 
western Canada to remain a territory, under the control of Ottawa, 
for as long as possible. People who lived in that region did not 
agree. Louis Riel founded Manitoba as we all know.
<P>
	The Ontario Anglo-Protestants wanted to see Louis Riel hang. 
Louis Riel surrendered in 1885. After several battles, he 
surrendered on May 15, 1885. His trial was riddled with 
irregularities, everybody agrees on that. The trial was held in 
Regina and the jury was made up of six English speaking jurors.
<P>
	Had the trial been held in Winnipeg, the outcome would have 
been different. In Winnipeg the jury would have consisted of six 
French speaking jurors and six English speaking jurors. At that 
time Manitoba was already a province.
<P>
	In Winnipeg, the presiding judge would have been a Supreme 
Court judge, whose independence is guaranteed by law. The Regina 
judge could be removed at any time by the federal government, and 
that government wanted Riel's head.
<P>
	On November 16, 1885, at the age of 41, Louis Riel,a hero of the 
Metis people, was hanged. In December, after much effort by his 
family, his body was moved to Saint-Vital, in Manitoba, and buried 
in the cemetery of St. Boniface cathedral. Less than a week after 
the hanging, on November 22, 1885, a crowd of some 50,000 
gathered on the Champs-de-Mars in Montreal and demonstrated. 
This was the start of the two solitudes in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	While people in Ontario were delighted because a common 
criminal had been executed, the Premier of Quebec, Honoré 
Mercier, was saying in Montreal: ``Our brother, Louis Riel, is 
dead''. There were riots in Montreal, despite the fact that people 
were very religious, strong believers. There were riots and 
speeches. The government had been asked to show mercy, but hed 
refused. Even the six jurors had said: ``Guilty, yes, but we request 
clemency''. They were ignored.
<P>
	This sad event was probably the beginning of the end of the good 
relations between the two founding peoples of Canada. In 1867, the 
Fathers of Confederation and the others who seemed to agree soon 
realized that Canada had misled them, because it was expected at 
that time that the new territories, the new future provinces would 
be bilingual. We know this is not what happened.
<P>
	Now, rights are given when it may be too late. But, at that time, 
Honoré Mercier of Quebec, and people believed that Canada would 
be bilingual.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to read you the last letter that Louis 
Riel wrote before he died. This is Louis Riel's will. Of course, I 
will read it to you, and we have to go back to that time to fully 
understand that Louis Riel held no grudges.
<P>
	This is Louis Riel speaking: ``May my burial be simple. May it 
be attended by the comforts of religion. Far from me, far from my 
mortal remains are the desires for revenge, the reprisals. I forgive 
those who have  committed so many injustices against me. I pray 
that my heart will be filled with the perfection of forgiveness and 
that all my trespasses will be forgiven, as I forgive all my enemies, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7167"> 7167 </A></B>
<P>
my adversaries, my opponents, my antagonists of all allegiances 
who trespassed against me. I therefore name Reverend Father Blais 
André as executor of my wishes as to my burial, so that my body 
may be carried through his care to the hospital to be laid in state, 
and from there to St. Boniface, to be buried beside the beloved 
remains of my dear beloved papa. May my body rest beside his''.
<P>
	And it is signed: Louis David Riel.
<P>
	This is an injustice done a very long ago. But I think that, when a 
society has the courage to admit the errors of the past, that society 
is progressing. Louis Riel was undoubtedly the founder of 
Manitoba. He was a man who left his mark on his time. He was a 
man who fought against the government in Ottawa, a centralizing 
government even in those days.
<P>
	I think that, today in this House, we, on all sides, must recognize 
the greatness of that man, the man who defended francophonie in 
America.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured to have the opportunity to speak on this 
private member's bill. While I very much support the idea of 
honouring Louis Riel and would be happy to participate in 
ceremonies and other ways of honouring this great man, I do not 
support the premise of this bill.
<P>
	Many Canadians do not appreciate that Louis Riel was an 
educated man. He was educated in theology and in law. He was 
fluent in English, French, Greek and Latin. He was an eloquent and 
polished orator and a statesman who directed the negotiations with 
the Government of Canada on the entry of Manitoba and the 
Northwest Territories into the Dominion of Canada. Louis Riel, in 
spite of what the Bloc seems to suggest to us, was a great believer 
in Canadian unity and in one country which would include, of 
course, the province of Quebec and the western provinces. I take 
great pleasure in addressing the House on this very important issue. 
I believe that all members of the House would agree that Louis Riel 
made an important contribution to the building of this great nation.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	The government has not ignored the importance Louis Riel has 
played in our nation's development. We have taken steps to 
advance the interests of Metis and off reserve aboriginal people and 
to honour Louis Riel's place in history.
<P>
	The Constitution Act of 1992 recognizes the existing aboriginal 
and treaty rights of the Metis. The government has issued 
commemorative stamps to honour Louis Riel, through the Social 
Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada it has funded 
the publication of the collective writings of Louis Riel which was 
published in 1985 by the University of Alberta Press to 
commemorate the anniversary of the North West Rebellion.
<P>
	On March 10, 1992, the House of Commons passed a special 
resolution honouring Louis Riel as a founder of Manitoba and 
recognizing his contribution to the development of western Canada 
and, therefore, to the development of the entire country. This 
resolution recognized the unique and historic importance of Louis 
Riel.
<P>
	The government has funded cultural performances over the 
years, including the very successful Batoche Days in Batoche, 
Saskatchewan. That festival has been held annually for over 25 
years in memory of Louis Riel.
<P>
	In May of this year a statue of Louis Riel was unveiled in 
Winnipeg on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Assembly. 
The statue was funded by the federal government. It is situated 
along the Assiniboia River, just west of the fork where the 
Assiniboia and Red Rivers meet. This is a perfect spot for a statue 
commemorating Riel, a statue that I visited recently when I was in 
Manitoba. He was a founding member of western Canada and these 
two rivers represent the major trading routes to the west.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs and member for Winnipeg South 
Centre, when unveiling the statue, proudly announced Louis Riel as 
a father of Confederation for all Canadians. The Metis people can 
be proud of Louis Riel's accomplishments. We cannot and will not 
forget the importance place of Louis Riel in Canadian history.
<P>
	This place is not diminished by his conviction. He is 
remembered as a builder of our nation. He had a vision of the 
proper place of Metis people and other people who settled in the 
west in Confederation. He represented all people of the west. He 
directed the negotiations with the Government of Canada of the 
entry of Manitoba and the Northwest Territories into the Dominion.
<P>
	Many things have already been done and there are many more 
positive things which can be done to carry on the work started by 
Louis Riel. Discussions will continue with the Metis through 
existing processes such as the bilateral process with the Metis 
National Council and the tripartite self-government negotiations 
with Metis organizations at the provincial level.
<P>
	I cannot accept the premise on which this bill was put forward by 
the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata, when she asserted 
the Louis Riel was hanged: ``because he was a Metis, because he 
was a francophone and because he stood up for a distinct society''. 
This statement and the sentiments behind the tabling of this bill do 
not do justice to the memory of Louis Riel. They are incompatible 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7168"> 7168 </A></B>
<P>
with this purpose and to use his memory as an excuse to stir the pot 
in terms of national unity is in my view, unacceptable.
<P>
	Louis Riel was not only an eloquent, articulate defender of Metis 
rights, but he was a defender of the rights of all members of the 
community, including aboriginal, non-aboriginal, anglophone and 
francophone. He defended the rights of all people. Louis Riel did 
not just defend the rights of his own group, of the Metis. He 
championed the rights of all minorities as well.
<P>
	Riel would not agree with the premise behind the tabling of this 
bill and we should find other methods to honour the memory of 
Louis Riel. We must look for solutions with the support of the 
Metis people of Canada.
<P>
	Louis Riel had a vision of a unified country in which all people 
would participate equally. Along with the Metis people, we will 
continue the work of Louis Riel in ensuring that all people are 
equal members have an equal say in our society. When we 
contemplate honouring Louis Riel we must keep in mind the 
society that he fought hard to protect, a society where all people 
would live in shared dignity and mutual respect.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	I urge the government to continue to work closely with Metis 
leaders and the family of Louis Riel to find appropriate and 
meaningful ways to celebrate his contribution to Confederation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise in this House today to speak to Bill C-297, an 
act to revoke the conviction of Louis David Riel.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is once again addressing this issue in the 
House because we believe it is crucial to resolve the historical 
injustice sullying to this day the memory of Louis David Riel. It is 
important to put an end to the paradox surrounding the status of 
Louis Riel.
<P>
	In fact, still today, in 1996, Riel legally remains a criminal who 
was sentenced for high treason in 1885. But at the same time, the 
House of Commons recognizes Riel as one of the Fathers of 
Confederation, since unanimously passing a motion on March 10, 
1992.
<P>
	I think we have to render to Riel what is Riel's. Quebecers and 
Canadians must be made aware of Riel's initiatives, since they 
reflect the courage and the will of this man to fight for the basic 
rights of his people.
<P>
	Of course, this bill will not bring Louis Riel back to life, but 
justice would have been done, because after being sentenced for 
high treason by a kangaroo court, Riel was hanged in November 
1885, at the age of 41.
<P>
	Hon. members will have to agree that we cannot in all decency 
acclaim Louis Riel as a national hero while ignoring his 
ignominious conviction for high treason that has yet to be revoked.
<P>
	If I could, I would like to give the hon. members some historical 
background so they can better understand the scope of the injustice 
done to Riel. By reviewing the 1885 events, we can see how 
important this conviction was for the relations between central and 
western Canada.
<P>
	First, it is, of course, important to realize that the majority of 
those who were called Metis at the time were a mix of aboriginal 
people, coureurs de bois, employees of the fur companies and 
European-born trappers who had as their main characteristics the 
fact that they were French speaking and Catholic.
<P>
	Representing more than 80 per cent of Manitoba's total 
population in the 1870s, the Métis had their way of life disturbed 
by the arrival of successive waves of settlers from the east. With 
the help of an unscrupulous Conservative government, these new 
settlers kept the best lands for themselves and took political control 
of the whole region.
<P>
	From that moment on, the Métis started to mobilize against the 
invader. They followed a man known for his commitment to the 
cause of the Métis people. That man was Louis David Riel. Riel, 
who had studied law and had been secretary of a national Métis 
committee in 1870, was known for having worked on the 
establishment of a list of rights that set out the terms for 
Manitoba's entry into the Canadian Confederation.
<P>
	Confrontations between Ottawa's envoys and the Métis people 
culminated with the death of a land surveyor killed by order of a 
national council then headed by Riel. The militant Anglo 
Protestants never forgave Riel for that.
<P>
	However, in Quebec, Riel became a mythical figure, a hero and a 
defender of the French culture and the Catholic faith.
<P>
	Despite being exiled, Riel was elected to this House for the first 
time in 1873 in a byelection and was re-elected in 1874. He was 
expelled from the House by means of a motion brought forward by 
an Orangeman. That was the start of many years of wandering, 
depression and confinement for Riel.
<P>
	I want to say this because our goal is not to change or correct 
history, but to show all the nuances that will help people better 
understand our history. Louis Riel did not lead an exemplary life. 
Like everybody else, he made mistakes. In March 1885, in a last 
attempt to defend the rights of the Métis people, he and his men 
rose up in arms to form an interim government in Batoche and 
demanded the surrender of Fort Carlton.
<P>
	After a battle that lasted a few months, he was forced to 
surrender. He was executed in November 1885, and his execution 
gave rise to the heated debate that is still going on today and 
created a very deep gap between francophones and anglophones.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7169"> 7169 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	The francophones who had strongly supported Riel 
demonstrated against the decision, which they considered 
revolting. Over 50,000 Montrealers, a third of the city's population 
at the time, took to the streets of centre town to express their 
outrage.
<P>
	But the harm was done: by putting the Metis leader to death, the 
central authorities of the day had managed to silence the claims of a 
whole nation. These details are important, especially in view of the 
4,000 page report just released by the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples.
<P>
	It contains recommendations relating to Metis claims. In the 
fourth volume, on page 244, the commissioners recommend 
actions aimed at preserving and developing the Metis culture which 
is becoming extinct. Considered today as being among the poorest 
of aboriginals in Canada, the Metis have no territory nor political 
representation. Seen in that perspective, the elimination of Louis 
Riel certainly allowed the Canadian authorities of the day to reach 
their despicable goal.
<P>
	This injustice to Louis Riel must be put right. Let us remind the 
Liberals who are now the government that the Liberal leader of the 
time, then the Leader of the Opposition, Sir Wilfrid Laurier 
himself, had supported Louis Riel and the cause he was standing 
for. He stated, and I quote: ``If I had been on the shores of the 
Saskatchewan river, I too would have raised my rifle.''
<P>
	The status of Louis Riel is so ambiguous today that even the 
Department of Canadian Heritage has recognized him as a person 
of national historic importance since 1956. He is described in the 
records of that department as ``Metis leader, the Father of 
Manitoba, and leader of the Northwest rebellion in 1885''. But in 
the eyes of the law, he is still a traitor.
<P>
	In 1985, the one hundredth anniversary of Riel's execution, 
several leading political figures in the House and in the Senate 
spoke, and I would like to quote some of their remarks. Liberal 
senator Joseph-Philippe Guay said: ``Riel has become a symbol, 
first of a linguistic and cultural minority whose rights to survive 
have long been ignored and are, to this day, still in jeopardy-''
<P>
	Senator Guay acknowledged: ``Riel was not beyond reproach'', 
but he added: ``If we remember him today, it is because the fight to 
which he devoted his whole life is largely still ours today''.
<P>
	In 1985 also, the present heritage minister and Deputy Prime 
Minister made a statement on this occasion. I quote from the 
November 28, 1985 of <I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
-I now ask that this Conservative Government exonerate the victim of the 
conspiracy of another Conservative Government-Letters and diaries of the 
participants and observers indicate unethical tactics to obtain political benefits from 
the rebellion-The reason for the Macdonald Government's promotion of a 
common riot to a full blown  rebellion was to win additional funding for the near 
bankrupt Canadian Pacific Railway. Louis Riel, who died unnecessarily, deserves to 
be exonerated by the Government and recognized as a victim of wrongdoing.
<P>
That is what the current Deputy Prime Minister of Canada said.
<P>
	Today, the Minister of Canadian Heritage and Deputy Prime 
Minister has to face up to the principles she was advocating then, 
since her party now forms the government. If the government is 
really serious in wanting to act to settle the Riel issue once and for 
all, as a great number of members tried to do throughout the history 
of this country, it must do so now.
<P>
	I want to reassure members of all sides that the only reason the 
Bloc Quebecois introduced this bill today is to put an end to this 
injustice, to give this House an opportunity to be consistent and to 
allow Louis David Riel to finally rest in peace, more than 110 years 
after his death.
<P>
	Since Riel was hanged, Liberals, Conservatives, New Democrats 
as well as Bloc members have spoken in this House to have Louis 
Riel's conviction revoked.
<P>
	Concerning this bill that we introduced today, we were very sad 
to read all the news reports, and the letters which were brought to 
our attention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am anxious to clarify for everyone that the Bloc 
Quebecois has not proposed this bill in order to make partisan 
political gains. Nor is this an attempt to rewrite history according 
to one bias, ignoring everything else. No, the objective of Bill 
C-297 is simple. It is to clear the name of Louis Riel and give him 
the recognition he deserves.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Consequently, I urge all members of this House to support Bill 
C-297. The ambiguity surrounding this Metis leader has existed for 
too long now. Now is the time to give him the recognition he 
deserves for being the hero he was and still is.
<P>
	Too many young people are still learning in school that Riel was 
nothing more than a rebel and an outlaw. This is tragic and 
appalling. This great man, who helped found Manitoba and 
defended the rights of his people, will get the recognition he truly 
deserves in the history of this country only if we revoke his 
conviction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak as a 
westerner for a few moments about Louis Riel.
<P>
	A lot of people do not realize that Louis Riel was born in the 
west and spent most of his life in the west and that he was a staunch 
federalist, which makes me wonder to some extent why members 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7170"> 7170 </A></B>
<P>
of the separatist party in the House are taking this opportunity to 
press their motion.
<P>
	He was not a violent man but was caught up in the whirlwind of 
events that were beyond his control. Actually he partially 
controlled them. Had it not been for Louis Riel's influence on 
Gabriel Dumont, there would have been a lot more deaths in the 
north-west rebellion. It was Riel who restrained Dumont from 
using guerrilla tactics against Middleton's troops. On that basis 
alone, the man should have been shown more mercy and 
compassion when he was tried.
<P>
	There is no question that the trial was unfair. However that was 
110 years ago. I do not believe that any good purpose is served by 
this attempt to fudge over one of the darker episodes of our history. 
It happened. It is over. I would take this same attitude to any 
historical event. It serves no purpose. It does not help Louis Riel in 
any way for us to stand in this House and say he was not guilty. The 
deed was done. History is history. I think there are other things that 
this House could attend to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Thalheimer (Timmins-Chapleau, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with pleasure that I respond today to Bill C-297.
<P>
	Bill C-297 would revoke the conviction of Louis Riel and that is 
why I support the bill. History has shown that the conviction of 
Louis Riel was wrong in law and it was wrong in fact.
<P>
	Let me say at the outset that I view Louis Riel as an important 
contributor to Confederation. His conviction for high treason in 
1885 has been the subject of controversy for many years. Louis 
Riel was an important figure in the development of our country and 
to the nation that it is today. He worked endlessly for the Metis 
people of the west. He also worked for all settlers of the territories 
that have now become the provinces of Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan in our fine country.
<P>
	During the late 1870s to the mid-1880s the west was going 
through significant changes. Aboriginal people, English speaking 
and French speaking Metis, and many other settlers from various 
parts of the world resided in the west. These people of diverse 
backgrounds banded together to advance their request to the 
government for the maintenance of their rights. These settlers felt 
that either there was no response to their needs or the response was 
too slow. Occasionally similar feelings are advanced by various 
organizations and groups even today.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	They were right to believe that the government of the day was 
slow in responding to the requests of the residents of the west who 
asked for reasonable matters to be addressed, such as appropriate 
surveys for their settlements, improved transportation so they 
could move products to and from markets, and other useful 
services normally provided by a government to its citizens.
<P>
	The French speaking and English speaking Metis, along with the 
settlers of many nationalities, sent numerous petitions and 
delegations to Ottawa to ask the government to carry out its 
responsibilities. After what the people of the west viewed as many 
years of neglect and without recourse against the encroachment of 
others, the people asked Louis Riel for his assistance in negotiating 
with the government.
<P>
	Eventually the Metis of the west led by Louis Riel took action to 
secure their interests. Several military expeditions were dispatched 
to the west by the government which led to an unfortunate turn of 
events and indeed loss of life. As we know, Louis Riel eventually 
was hanged.
<P>
	Riel was an eloquent and articulate defender of Metis rights as 
well as those of all members of the community, whether aboriginal, 
non-aboriginal, anglophone or francophone. Louis Riel was an 
educated man. He was fluent in English, French, Greek and Latin. 
He was once a polished statesman who directed the negotiation 
with the Government of Canada on the entry of Manitoba and the 
area then known as the North-West Territories into the Dominion of 
Canada.
<P>
	Under the leadership of Louis Riel the Metis of Red River 
adopted a list of rights in 1870. It is important to recall that this list 
of rights was the primary basis upon which Louis Riel guided the 
negotiations with the Canadian government for the entry of the 
territories into the Dominion of Canada.
<P>
	Louis Riel negotiated the terms for the admission of Rupert's 
Land and the North-Western Territory into the Dominion of 
Canada. A delegation of three was sent by the provincial 
government to Ottawa to present the terms to the Canadian 
government. This list was essentially the terms of union and 
formed part of the Manitoba Act.
<P>
	The list provided for guarantees for Metis people who were then 
in the majority, including schooling and religious rights as well as 
recognition of the French and English languages. The rights of 
other citizens were also clearly set out. This was Louis Riel's 
vision of a united country with each citizen participating on an 
equal basis.
<P>
	After the province of Manitoba entered into Confederation the 
citizens of the riding of Provencher in the province of Manitoba 
elected Louis Riel on three occasions by acclamation to the House 
of Commons. Because of the circumstances, Riel was unable to 
take his seat in this House.
<P>
	Louis Riel devoted his life to the interests of the Metis people. 
He understood their concerns. He had a vision of the proper place 
for the Metis people and other westerners within Confederation. 
These people blended together to advance their request to the 
government for the maintenance of their rights.
<P>
	In introducing the bill, the hon. member commented that Riel 
was hanged because he was Metis, because he was a francophone 
and because he stood up for a distinct society. That was not Louis 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7171"> 7171 </A></B>
<P>
Riel. If he were here today I do not believe he would agree with that 
statement.
<P>
	Louis Riel stood for equal rights for all Canadians. He believed 
that the Metis were entitled to equal rights and full participation 
within Confederation. The Metis at that time in history formed a 
substantial part of the population. Louis Riel championed for the 
rights of the minority groups. He would be saddened today by the 
divisive approach taken by members of the Bloc on this issue.
<P>
	Louis Riel's contribution to this country has been recognized by 
the government over the years in a number of ways. I support the 
efforts of the government in seeking ways to recognize his positive 
achievements.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recall that in 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, in a house that belonged to Sir 
John A. Macdonald, we can see the telegraph on which the 
telegram was sent to order the hanging of Louis Riel. The telegram 
said simply: ``Hang Louis Riel''.

amends for this blot on our history, and I hope we will make it 
unanimous.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERNATIONALCOURT">INTERNATIONAL COURT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on November 8 I asked the government when it would 
amend Canadian legislation to facilitate the establishment of an 
international criminal court which is under active consideration at 
the United Nations. Such an international criminal court would try 
individuals who commit serious violations of human rights and 
crimes against humanity, including genocide and ethnic cleansing.
<P>
	I acknowledge that the Canadian government is a strong 
supporter of the international criminal court, but as I said, the 
establishment of such a court requires amendments to our domestic 
law to permit the referral of accused Canadians who might be 
indicted by the new court.
<P>
	Ever since the Nuremberg trials following World War II, which 
tried and judged Nazi war criminals, there has been a movement to 
establish a permanent international criminal court. Such a court 
should not be confused with the International Court of Justice at the 
Hague, known as the World Court, which judges disputes between 
nations.
<P>
	The international criminal court would deal with individuals 
charged with massive violations of human rights, such as the 
accused at the Nuremberg trials and now those accused before the 
special tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda. A permanent 
international criminal court would give credibility and provide 
deterrence to the process.
<P>
	The Nuremberg court and the special tribunals in Yugoslavia and 
Rwanda were set up post facto. In the case of the Nazi war 
criminals, the court was set up by the victors of the conflict. It 
would be much better to have such courts and their rules set up 
permanently in advance as is now proposed at the United Nations.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	I await the government's answer. I know it supports the 
international criminal court but I would like to know when it will 
bring 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7172"> 7172 </A></B>
<P>
forward legislation which would give impetus and give some 
movement to the whole issue at the United Nations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has asked whether the government intends 
to amend Canadian law to permit the referral of an accused person 
to the new proposed international criminal court which is currently 
being debated by the general assembly in New York.
<P>
	Canada has been a leading advocate in support of the 
establishment of a permanent international criminal court that 
would try major international crimes, such as war crimes and 
crimes against humanity, and which would obviate the need to 
establish ad hoc tribunals as has been done for the situations in the 
former Yugoslavia as well as Rwanda.
<P>
	In order to answer the question posed I believe that it is first 
necessary to review the history of this issue before talking about 
the need or timetable to enact legislation in Canada.
<P>
	In December 1994 the general assembly established the ad hoc 
committee on the establishment of an international criminal court 
to review the major substantive administrative issues arising out of 
the International Law Commission's draft statute for an 
international criminal court. The report of the committee was 
considered by the 50th session of the general assembly in 1995 
which decided that a preparatory committee should be struck with a 
view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a 
convention for an international criminal court. This would be the 
next step toward holding a diplomatic conference of 
plenipotentiaries to finalize the convention.
<P>
	The preparatory committee on the establishment of an 
international criminal court found many major issues that remain 
to be resolved. The general assembly is currently considering the 
interim report of the preparatory committee. It is likely that the 
general assembly will reaffirm the mandate of the committee to 
continue its work in 1997 and 1998 with a view to having a 
diplomatic conference in 1998 to conclude the final negotiation.
<P>
	Canada has been a leading advocate of a permanent international 
criminal court but it is only after a final text of a convention is 
concluded, when we will know what is legally required of us, that 
Canada can enact legislation designed to implement the convention 
that will establish the court. At present the UN does not even have 
the complete comprehensive draft convention.
<P>
	When the time comes to enact legislation in order to implement 
the future international convention that would establish the court, 
let me assure this House that Canada intends to enact the necessary 
legislation quickly. However, at this time it is premature to be 
enacting legislation. We are still at least two years away from the 
final negotiations that would conclude the international convention 
on the creation of the court.
<P>
	There are many complicated questions to be resolved by the UN, 
not the least of which are defining what surrender process will be 
used and defining the role of national laws in relation to obligations 
to assist the court.
<P>
	On the domestic level Department of Justice officials are already 
considering what amendments would be necessary in future to 
provide the requisite assistance to the proposed international 
criminal court. Internationally we are playing an important role on 
the UN preparatory committee.
<P>
	At the preparatory committee Canada is attempting to ensure 
that the scheme that is eventually adopted will be flexible enough 
to accommodate and promote co-operation to the court from all 
legal systems.
<P>
	In summary, this government is working toward the creation of 
an international criminal court domestically and at the United 
Nations. I would like to thank the hon. member for his question on 
this important issue at this time.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ASBESTOSINDUSTRY">ASBESTOS INDUSTRY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Monday, I questioned the Minister for International Trade about 
the Liberal government's plans regarding the filing of an official 
complaint with the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	For months and months, this government has been boasting 
about everything being under control. It certainly looks like this 
attitude is taking away any hope the industry may have had to see 
France reconsider its decision to ban asbestos on its territory.
<P>
	This will have an tremendous impact on my riding, not only on 
the asbestos industry, but also on the development of the 
community as a whole. The government does not seem to realize 
how worried people are in my riding; all it does is send us ministers 
on a purely election-oriented mission. Could the minister tell us if 
cabinet issued some secret directions not to go to the WTO? We all 
know about this government's inclination to turn to the courts when 
in a tight spot.
<P>
	Beyond the rhetoric and lip service we have heard from the 
minister and the Prime Minister, does the government have any real 
plan of action?
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	I would like to know the profound convictions of cabinet on this 
unique mineral, not only because of its extraordinary properties, 
but also because it constitutes one of the jewels in the crown of the 
Canadian mining industry.
<P>
	It is high time the federal government made amends to the 
citizens of Thetford, Black Lake and the whole asbestos mining 
region. It made a commitment to intervene on the international 
level to rehabilitate asbestos, particularly chrysotile asbestos. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7173"> 7173 </A></B>
<P>
Perhaps the time is ripe for it to start promoting it on its own 
territory, even here on the Hill.
<P>
	How can it be assumed that the asbestos that is sealed inside the 
walls in the buildings on Parliament Hill is dangerous? Yet that is 
what is suggested in the numerous internal memos we receive in 
our offices concerning the major renovations that are scheduled, 
including decontamination of the buildings.
<P>
	Despite all the respect I have for this House and for cabinet, this 
whole scenario suggests to me that the Liberal government's 
famous action plan is nothing more than smoke and mirrors. The 
government, and its Minister for International Trade, are 
improvising daily in this matter, inventing things as they go along.
<P>
	In this connection, I could produce before this House numerous 
documents setting out the position of the current government and 
the previous one concerning the government's true psychosis about 
the harmful effects of asbestos. My predecessor, the hon. Marcel 
Masse, was one of the most vocal supporters of chrysotile fibre 
during his entire political carrier in Ottawa. His statements in 
favour of asbestos were decisive for our industry.
<P>
	Personally, I strongly condemn the lack of leadership shown by 
the Minister of Natural Resources, who proved unable to convince 
one French MP, Christian Daniel, of the safety of asbestos when 
used properly. Imagine, if she is unable to convince one lone MP, 
how could she hope to influence the position of a whole 
government?
<P>
	In conclusion, I would ask the minister to apprise us of the 
government's intentions regarding the promotion of chrysotile 
fibre, especially with regard to the use of asbestos ore in Canada. 
The minister should take note of my question, I intend to follow 
through with it. People in the asbestos producing area are tired of 
ministers coming to Thetford with empty promises. As far as I 
know the election campaign has not started yet. The government 
was elected to govern, and so it should.
<P>
	I hoped the international trade minister himself would answer 
my question. Does he not consider this issue important enough to 
be present in the House and respond to my comments?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the comments made by the member and I have to say 
that the comments are simply not factual.
<P>
	The member knows full well that the Canadian government, the 
Minister of International Trade, the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Natural Resources have taken the lead in trying to 
convince the French government, with respect to crystallite 
asbestos, that the ban it is seeking to impose is not one that is based 
on any  internationally accepted view of the health risks associated 
with the asbestos.
<P>
	The member should know, because it is of concern to his 
constituents, that the Minister of International Trade actually 
visited Thetford Mines to meet with municipal officials and hear 
firsthand from individuals who are working in the industry and 
from all the stakeholders what would be the best concerted 
approach that the Canadian government could take, working with 
the Government of Quebec, the industry and the communities to 
come up with a concerted game plan in order to convince the 
French that this particular ban should be reversed.
<P>
	The member also knows full well that the Canadian government 
is looking at its options under the World Trade Organization. We 
believe that the French ban may violate commitments of WTO 
members that ensure that technical regulations are no more trade 
restrictive than necessary in order to fulfil a legitimate objective.
<P>
	While France may have legitimate health and safety concerns 
about asbestos products, a ban on such products may be more 
restrictive than necessary, particularly if other-
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I regret to interrupt the 
hon. parliamentary secretary, but his time has expired.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CHILDPOVERTY">CHILD POVERTY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there was a major conference in Ottawa last week. It 
brought together people from all across Canada who are interested 
in finding ways to relieve child poverty. They left knowing that the 
problem was well documented, but frustrated because there is little 
being done to deal with it.
<P>
	However, there was one bright note and that was the award 
presented to the province of Saskatchewan and accepted at the 
conference by Premier Roy Romanow. The award acknowledged 
Saskatchewan's commitment to investing in children as a key 
priority and its co-ordinated approach to policy development and 
delivery.
<P>
	Premier Romanow was also a featured speaker at that 
conference. He reminded us that it is the responsibility of all of us 
to value, protect and support Canada's children, to guide them in 
becoming healthy, functioning adults because it is the health and 
the strength of our children that will determine the future health 
and strength of our country.
<P>
	He also reminded us of the most recent report of the Canadian 
Council of Catholic Bishops which said: ``To think that almost one 
Canadian child in five lives in poverty in one of the richest 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7174"> 7174 </A></B>
<P>
societies in world history is nothing less than a damning indictment 
of the present socioeconomic order''.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan, the province's action plan for children was 
designated in 1993 to provide a model for the development of 
programs and services for children and families. It not only brings 
together community groups, agencies, individuals and 
governments to collaborate and deliver services, but also links 
activities between Saskatchewan's human service departments. 
This interlinking of departmental initiatives enables the province to 
better target limited resources and to develop programs that more 
effectively meet the overall needs of children and families.
<P>
	It was this action plan that captured the attention of the child 
poverty community and was the impetus for the award presented to 
the premier last week.
<P>
	But more needs to be done and Premier Romanow and most of 
Canada knows that the federal government must play an important 
role in this regard.
<P>
	First, on the premier's national agenda to help reduce child 
poverty is a commitment to strong social programs. He emphasizes 
programs which address child and family poverty, but at the same 
time he stresses the necessity to preserve medicare and accessible 
quality education.
<P>
	I might add that a major problem today is the federal Liberal 
government's insistence that $7 billion be cut from its transfers to 
the provinces for health and education programs. To me this $7 
billion must be reinstated immediately.
<P>
	The premier also believes that Canada must undertake a 
comprehensive review of the taxation system which is seen as 
being unfair, ineffective and not representative of current Canadian 
priorities. Obviously this fits well with the federal NDP's call for a 
fair taxation system which would see the banks and large 
corporations paying their fair share of taxes.
<P>
	It goes without saying that our nation's children represent our 
nation's future. We have to take their needs into account as we plan 
for today's activities.
<P>
	In 1989 a resolution brought forward by the then NDP federal 
leader Ed Broadbent to eliminate poverty by the year 2000 was 
passed unanimously by the members of the House. Since then 46 
per cent more children are living below the poverty line. 
Obviously, the status quo is not working. Some aggressive action is 
required.
<P>
	My question for the federal Liberal government is simple: When 
the premier of Saskatchewan and all those who care about children 
call for a different approach to dealing with poverty, is the minister, 
on behalf of the government prepared to heed that call?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. Minister of Human Resources Development 
and the hon. Minister of  Health have indicated on many occasions, 
the Government of Canada is extremely concerned about the 
challenges facing low income families with children.
<P>
	Poverty exacts an unacceptable toll on children. It often means 
that their physical needs for food, shelter and clothing are not met. 
It can result in their cognitive development being delayed 
compared with children in families with adequate incomes and it 
has long term costs for our country.
<P>
	Poor children have poor health outcomes. They reach lower 
educational levels. They live in riskier environments and engage in 
riskier behaviours.
<P>
	The hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake is calling 
for immediate action for children, but this action is already under 
way. The Prime Minister, along with other first ministers, has 
agreed that child poverty is a priority. The government is working 
with the provinces, including Saskatchewan, to identify ways to 
prevent and reduce child poverty.
<P>
	To this end, a federal-provincial ministerial council on social 
policy renewal, co-chaired by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, recently met and agreed to closely examine options 
for a national child benefit. A federal-provincial working group is 
meeting on an ongoing basis.
<P>
	In addition, many provinces have demonstrated a commitment to 
fulfilling their responsibilities for children. British Columbia has 
just restructured its children's benefits and Quebec has announced 
its intention to refine its system. New Brunswick raised the issue in 
its recently delivered speech from the throne and Saskatchewan has 
announced its intention to introduce a provincial child benefit.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is already providing important help 
to low income families and it is working toward finding solutions 
to the complex problems poverty presents. For example, the 
government now spends over $5 billion on child tax benefits that 
are paid to over three million Canadian families and has also 
doubled the working income supplement provided to low income 
families.
<P>
	In addition, the government announced in its 1996 budget a child 
support strategy that will protect the interests of children and 
ensure parents live up to their responsibilities for child support in a 
manner that is fair and consistent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> A motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the 
House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow, pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.16 p.m.)
