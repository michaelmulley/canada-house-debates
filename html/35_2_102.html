government in the other place and on the Order Paper to be debated 
in this House today regarding Bill C-42, an act to amend the Judges 
Act and to make consequential amendments to another act.
<P>
	This is not a matter for a public bill but should instead be 
introduced as a private bill. Now that the other place has passed 
Bill C-42 as amended, the bill stands as some sort of hybrid 
public-private bill. Therefore the motion of the Minister of Justice 
to concur in the bill as amended cannot proceed because it would 
be a breach of our rules to do so.
<P>
	I refer to a ruling by the Speaker on October 23, 1975 regarding a 
bill entitled ``an act for the parole of Dr. Henry Morgentaler''. The 
Speaker ruled:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The fact of the matter is that the bill before us at the present time is a proposal to 
exempt or to except from the operation of the general law, one person, namely Dr. 
Henry Morgentaler. I cannot by any stretch of the imagination be persuaded that this 
is a subject matter of a public bill, or that it is in any way the alteration of the general 
law. It is the alteration or the exception for one person of the application of the law, 
which seems crystal clear to me to be the subject matter of a private bill and not a 
public bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Speaker continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-we are left with no other choice than to decide the matter is really a proper subject 
matter not of a public bill but of a private bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On October 2, 1996 the Speaker of the other House responded to 
a question by a senator to rule on whether or not Bill C-42, the bill 
we are currently discussing, prior to it being amended by this 
motion, was a public  bill or a private bill. The Speaker of the other 
House said on page 921 of the Senate <I>Debates</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A public bill relates to a matter of public policy while a private bill relates to a 
matter of particular interest or benefit to a person or persons. A bill containing 
provisions which are essentially a feature of a private bill cannot be introduced as a 
public bill. A bill designed to exempt one person from the application of the law is a 
private bill, not a public bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Remember he was giving his ruling prior to this particular 
amendment being tabled. He went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-while some of the changes may relate at the moment to identifiable individuals, 
they are designed to have lasting application; consequently, they are not in any 
way an exemption from the general law, but a change to it. Given this 
interpretation, it seems clear to me that Bill C-42 is a public bill, and not a private 
bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was before the amendment was introduced and the bill 
passed in the Senate as amended.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you are aware the amendments to Bill C-42 
delete any vestige of policy that is designed to have lasting 
application. All public policy in Bill C-42 regarding a judge's 
ability to accept assignments with international organizations has 
been removed and substituted by a special exemption to be written 
into the Judges Act to allow Madam Justice Louise Arbour to 
accept an assignment with an international organization. One 
person, one exemption and no lasting application.
<P>
	Obviously the amendment to Bill C-42 clearly meets the criteria 
laid out by the Speaker of the other House on what constitutes a 
private bill.
<P>
	In addition, citation 1055 of Beauchesne's sixth edition outlines 
principles for a private bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-private bills demand peculiar vigilance, lest public laws be likely set aside for the 
benefit of particular persons or places.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The amendment introduced by the government in the other place 
sets a public law aside for the benefit of one particular person. I 
emphasize that the manner in which it is being done fosters less 
vigilance rather than more. It sets aside section 55 of the Judges 
Act specifically for Madam Justice Louise Arbour to take a leave 
from her judicial duties to serve as prosecutor of the international 
tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious 
violations of international humanitarian law committed in the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia and of the international tribunal 
for Rwanda.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6410"> 6410 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	One could argue that we are dealing with only one section of the 
bill and that there are other aspects of public policy contained 
within the bill. The fact that some provisions of the bill are of a 
private nature is sufficient grounds to prevent Bill C-42 as 
amended by the government and the other place from proceeding 
any further.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I refer you to a ruling from March 12, 1875. The 
bill under consideration was a bill to rearrange the capital of the 
Northern Railway Company of Canada to enable the said company 
to change the gauge of its railway to amalgamate with the Northern 
Extension Railways Company and for other purposes. It is 
important to note that only some of the provisions of this bill were 
of a private nature. When this fact was brought to the attention of 
the Speaker in 1875, he ruled that the point of order was well taken 
and that the bill could not be introduced as a public bill.
<P>
	Bill C-42 as amended contains provisions only appropriate in a 
private bill. What we now have before us is a motion to 
retroactively create some sort of hybrid public-private bill. Erskine 
May's 21st edition, at page 793, gives two reasons for hybrid bills:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-although in part they may be of a private nature, their main object is a public one; 
and secondly, that there may be no parties able and willing to present a petition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Bill C-42 does not meet this definition because Madam Justice 
Louise Arbour is able to present a petition.
<P>
	However, in the Canadian practice, public matters and private 
matters must be dealt with separately.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I refer you to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 
623, which states: ``According to Canadian standing orders and 
practice, there are only two kinds of bills-public and private. The 
British hybrid bill'', as defined by Erskine May, ``is not recognized 
in Canadian practice''.
<P>
	There is a procedure in our rules for private bills and a procedure 
for public bills. The government cannot go down the middle on this 
one. It must go back to the drawing board and present a public bill 
to deal with the provisions of Bill C-42 which are of a public nature 
and if petitioned, a member can introduce a private bill to exempt 
Madam Justice Louise Arbour from the public policy.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I suggest that we do not proceed any further with 
the motion to concur in Bill C-42 as amended until you have made 
your ruling on this matter of procedure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened carefully to the point of order raised by my hon. 
colleague. Frankly and with the greatest of respect I have to say 
that this is clearly not a private matter. It is a matter of public 
policy to permit the hon. Madam Justice involved to make the 
comments which she has made.
<P>
	The point that is important to remember in the point of order 
which has been raised is that we do not have a bill before us. We 
merely have a message from the Senate concerning amendments. 
Therefore, the 1975 precedent which has been cited by my hon. 
colleague in my view respectfully is irrelevant. We are dealing with 
a message from the Senate in exactly the same manner as 
prescribed by the standing orders and the commentaries in those 
standing orders.
<P>
	If the House wishes to reject the amendments, then it is certainly 
free to vote against the motion. It is not for the Chair, respectfully, 
to interpose itself between the Houses. It is for the House to be 
permitted to declare its views on this matter.
<P>
	That is my respectful submission on the point of order raised by 
my hon. colleague.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is the hon. member for St. Albert rising on the 
same point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is on the same point of order. If I 
may be permitted a short rebuttal to the-
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It will have to be very short. I do not want to get 
into a debate. Everything should be presented to the Chair on your 
first pass.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did that. However, I would just 
draw one point to your attention. Bill C-42 as it was passed in the 
House was ruled by the Speaker of the other place to be a matter of 
public policy. The Speaker said the wording of the bill was specific 
in a public policy manner to allow Madam Justice Louise Arbour to 
be the prosecutor, the position she currently holds.
<P>
	The point is that the public policy ran into a problem in the other 
place. The government withdrew the public policy and introduced a 
specific exception to section 55 of the Judges Act for Madam 
Justice Louise Arbour.
<P>
	I would also draw attention to the note on the motion that would 
amend the Judges Act which is before the House. It starts off by 
saying: ``Notwithstanding section 55, Madam Justice Louise 
Arbour may apply for a leave of absence''. That is the point, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPEAKER'SRULING">SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for St. Albert for 
bringing this specific point of order to the House. I listened with 
interest to what the parliamentary secretary had to say, both being 
put in juxtaposition.
<P>
	We have here two amendments by the Senate for which 
concurrence of the House is sought. What the member is asking me 
to do is to rule on the procedural acceptability of changes made by 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6411"> 6411 </A></B>
<P>
Senate. My view is  that your Speaker cannot stand as a procedural 
judge on what is done by the Senate. What they do over there, they 
do over there.
<P>
	I would refer members to a ruling made April 26, 1990, at page 
10723 of the Commons <I>Debates</I>, where Mr. Speaker Fraser notes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Speaker of the House of Commons cannot unilaterally rule out of order 
amendments from the other place. I can comment, as I am doing, but the House as 
a whole must ultimately make the decision to accept or reject amendments from 
the Senate, whether they be in order according to our rules or not.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It comes down to a decision of the House.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	I am going to reach back just a little further to Erskine May, 20th 
edition, Parliamentary Practice. I am quoting from page 582. 
Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No objection can be taken to a Lords Amendment-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-which means a Senate amendment for our purposes-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-on the ground of order.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These amendments are sent to us from the Senate. Your Speaker 
cannot rule procedurally on what the Senate does. That is a matter 
for the House to decide. The House should rule on these 
amendments.
<P>
	I thank both hon. members for their interventions and for 
bringing this to my attention.

On the Order:

<BLOCKQUOTE>November 19-The Minister of Labour-Second reading and reference to the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development of Bill C-66, an act to 
amend the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the Corporations and Labour Unions 
Returns Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-66, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the 
Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be referred forthwith to the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are referring Bill C-66 to the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development so that it can review the bill and make 
recommendations.
<P>
	Bill C-66 amends part I of the Canada Labour Code and the 
Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act. The Canada Labour 
Code has not undergone-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There 
seems to be no English translation coming through.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. Minister of Labour if he 
could wait for a minute so that we can make sure the
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was saying that the Canada 
Labour Code has not undergone a major overhaul in more than 25 
years. It had to be updated with the future in mind. This is a 
commitment, my colleagues will recall, we made in the last speech 
from the throne.
<P>
	My primary objective is to ensure an orderly approach is taken to 
industrial relations. I sincerely believe that clear rules striking a 
balance between the rights and responsibilities of all concerned are 
essential to the effectiveness of our collective bargaining process.
<P>
	I also believe that the reform proposed by our government 
specifically meets this balance requirement. This has earned it 
substantial support from the parties covered by the Canada Labour 
Code.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The amendments to part I of the Canada Labour Code are 
important, timely and essential but not radical. They will not turn 
our system on its head but will encourage co-operative 
labour-management relationships as well as constructive collective 
bargaining.
<P>
	We want to develop a positive legislative framework. The bill 
creates a fair and equitable set of rules for a collective bargaining 
process. It will allow the parties to frame their own agreements and 
have the flexibility to find appropriate solutions to the competitive 
pressures of our changing environment.
<P>
	Our reform package reflects a broad consensus among 
stakeholders and the recommendation of the independent task 
group chaired by Andrew Sims. These recommendations have been 
published in the report ``Seeking Balance''.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We want to improve the administration of the code. This is why 
we are replacing the current board by the Canada Industrial 
Relations Board which, with its extended responsibilities, will be 
more effective and also more representative.
<P>
	We have tightened up the negotiation process to allow a faster 
and smoother resolution of disputes, thanks to the following: a four 
month notice to bargain before the expiry of a collective 
agreement; a single one stage conciliation procedure; a secret vote 
within 60 days of a work stoppage; and a 72 hour advance notice 
before a strike or a lockout.
<P>
	We want to promote better communication between employees, 
employers and the union. We also recognize the right of employers 
to express their views directly to the employees, provided they do 
not resort to unfair practices. As for the union, it will be allowed to 
get from the board the list of employees working off site and to 
contact them, as long as their privacy and their safety are 
maintained.
<P>
	Traditionally, union and management groups were never able to 
reach a consensus on the issue of replacement workers. The 
government had to make a decision. After an in-depth analysis, it 
opted for a moderate and reasonable approach which, once again,  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6413"> 6413 </A></B>
<P>
strikes a balance between the rights and the responsibilities of all 
those involved.
<P>
	The equation is based on the premise that those involved will act 
in good faith. Under normal circumstances, the employer will be 
allowed to use replacement workers during a legal work stoppage. 
However, if it is established that such a practice is designed to 
undermine the representational capacity of a union, rather than to 
meet the legitimate objectives of a negotiation process, it will be 
deemed unfair.
<P>
	We are giving unions the right to refer any contentious case 
directly to the Canadian Industrial Relations Board, which will 
have the authority to prohibit the use of replacement wokers during 
a conflict.
<P>
	Our reform also provides that replacement workers must not be 
members of the bargaining unit. Therefore, they cannot take part in 
any vote, including a vote to return to work. At the end of a work 
stoppage, unions members will have the right to go back to their 
old job, before any other employee. They will also be still entitled 
to some benefits during the work stoppage, provided they keep 
paying related premiums. Moreover, any dismissal or disciplinary 
action could be subject to an arbitration process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During any work stoppage we have to ensure that the measures 
necessary to protect public health and safety are maintained. No 
specific activities will be designated in the code. I believe that the 
parties should have the opportunity to negotiate an agreement. If 
they are unable to agree, the board will have the power to make that 
determination.
<P>
	An important amendment ensures that the bargaining rights and 
the collective agreement will be carried over when an undertaking 
moves from provincial to federal jurisdiction. This is particularly 
important in these times when changes in ownership can occur 
frequently. It will prevent unnecessary disruption in 
labour-management relations and deter those who would use 
jurisdiction hopping to avoid bargaining obligations.
<P>
	The next item deals with successive contracts for service in the 
airport industry. When a contract for services such as aircraft 
refuelling or security screening is transferred as a result of 
retendering, the new contractor will have to pay equivalent 
remuneration to employees. In the past the end of each contract has 
resulted in the loss of remuneration and employment for a group of 
workers mainly composed of women and immigrants. I feel it is 
our utmost responsibility to give them some protection against a 
competition process that would otherwise be based on who can pay 
the lowest wages.
<P>
	This amendment will create a level playing field for contractors 
whose employees are unionized and reduce turnover rates, an 
important element to help maintain our airports at the highest 
security level possible.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	In the new code grain handlers and their employers will retain 
the right to strike and lockout. In the event of a work stoppage 
involving other parties in port related activities, including 
longshoremen, service affecting grain shipment must be 
maintained.
<P>
	The shipment of grain is a multimillion dollar industry. We 
export to over 70 countries and the livelihood of over 130,000 
farmers depends on our reputation as a reliable supplier and 
exporter.
<P>
	When a work stoppage involving employees in longshoring or 
other port operations impact on grain exports, special labour 
legislation has become the normal reaction. This has effectively 
removed the incentive for the parties to resolve their own disputes.
<P>
	Taking grain shipping out of the equation will allow the parties 
to address their differences in a less destructive manner, accept the 
responsibility for their own actions and forego involving 
Parliament in the resolution of their disagreements. We are 
confident that this measure will address the vast majority of 
disruption to grain exports at Canadian ports.
<P>
	In 1999 we will review its effectiveness and if necessary we will 
look at the stronger measures like those recommended in the west 
coast ports industry inquiry in order to deal with this important 
problem for the whole country.
<P>
	Finally, let me make it crystal clear that the amendments to the 
Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act, as we call it 
CALURA, do not in any way diminish the accountability process 
of the unions. On the contrary, Statistics Canada has found a better, 
more efficient and cheaper way to collect the data. It will be 
included in the labour force survey Stats Canada receives every 
month from the union membership.
<P>
	This simple operation will save Statistics Canada $300,000 a 
year and give us regular, reliable data. This is, therefore, a 
noticeable improvement to the old procedure and I am very happy 
to present it in Bill C-66.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to share with my colleagues a very 
wise remark made in the Sims report. The report maintained that 
the Canada Labour Code must strike a balance between conflicting 
values and interests; between the interests of the employees and 
those of the employers; between social and economic priorities; 
between rights and responsibilities; between individual and 
majority rights; between the public interest and free collective 
bargaining.
<P>
	This is exactly what we tried to do with the review of the Canada 
Labour Code. Therefore, I would urge my colleagues to support 
this motion. Bill C-66 will then be immediately referred to the 
standing committee. All those interested will be able to express 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6414"> 6414 </A></B>
<P>
their viewpoints to committee members, who will then report on 
the suggestions that were made.
<P>
	This is how all my colleagues can help turn the Canada Labour 
Code into a modern and useful tool to help both management and 
unions to settle their labour disputes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the least we can say this morning, and the Minister will 
agree, is that a review of the Canada Labour Code is long overdue. 
Several times we stood in this House to ask questions on various 
provisions of the code and each time the Minister would refer to the 
review he tabled three weeks ago, parts of which, I must say, are 
certainly evidence of his good will.
<P>
	I am well aware that the Minister is a courteous man, but I have a 
feeling that he did not follow his reform ideas through to their 
logical conclusion and that he was a little bit inhibited in some of 
his actions. I certainly hope to have the opportunity in committee to 
urge the Minister to go further, to surpass himself, and to see to it 
that the bill be further improved upon, since, as you well know, this 
is the role of the opposition and a full time job.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	This being said, there are positive elements in there. Obviously, 
when the Minister suggests measures to accelerate the hearing of 
the parties, we cannot but agree. When the Minister proposes that a 
one person court may be convened so as to speed up the work of the 
Canada Labour Relations Board, we are all for it. When the 
Minister wants to change the name of the Canada Labour Relations 
Board, which lived last winter a crisis that almost destroyed it, we 
are in favour of that.
<P>
	What the minister will have to specify is this: in the bill that will 
be considered by the human resources development committee, to 
make the Canada Industrial Relations Board, a quasi-judicial 
tribunal that is extremely important for the balance he is seeking to 
strike, does he intend to make it a truly representational body as he 
was asked to do on many occasions? Will he accept that members 
of this board be appointed from lists that will be submitted, as is 
done for other governmental organizations? To ensure that the 
Canada Industrial Relations Board decisions are not never 
questioned, the board must become a representational body.
<P>
	Too often, in the past, appointments were made that did not 
reflect the kind of talent, expertise and knowledge that is to be 
expected from people who sit on this quasi-judicial tribunal.
<P>
	The minister knows perfectly well this bill contains a provision 
that is rather vague. It says that the minister will consult. Of course, 
the notion of consultation is not very precise. It is true that 
consultation is important when making this kind of appointments, 
but I think balance would be much better served if the minister  
could use lists that would be submitted by both management and 
union representatives to fill vacancies on the board.
<P>
	You will also understand that this reform, and the opposition's 
position, and the common understanding that will guide us over the 
coming weeks, because we on this side of the House are very aware 
that this is the beginning of a relatively lengthy process, since the 
Canada Labour Code is an extremely important tool in union 
democracy, that the whole issue of replacement workers will be the 
focus of our concerns.
<P>
	I must say that it is undoubtedly this aspect of the bill that is the 
most disappointing. It is undoubtedly this aspect of the bill that 
goes most against the grain for the minister, where he did not 
achieve what he would have liked. The reform the minister is 
proposing has no central component, only peripheral details.
<P>
	It is not clear where this came from. Recognizing the right to use 
replacement workers only in cases where the union's 
representational capacity is undermined is not something that flows 
from the Sims report. First of all, there is no case law to support it. 
There is no partner. I challenge the minister to rise in his place and 
tell us who asked for such a formula when the Sims task force was 
conducting its review. Who on the employer side or the union side 
is calling for such a convoluted formula, the concrete results and 
ramifications of which are unknown?
<P>
	The mere fact that negotiations are continuing and the parties 
sitting down at the same table is evidence that a union's 
representational capacity will not be undermined and that the 
employer is not entitled to use replacement workers.
<P>
	I cannot go along with the minister's statement that he cannot act 
without a consensus. I think this indicates a lack of knowledge of 
the context giving rise to the legislation passed by the National 
Assembly in 1977. If a consensus is required it is clear that, in such 
an instance, we are condemned to the status quo, and I think both 
the legislator and members of Parliament could be faulted for lack 
of courage in their failure to permit this very healthy exercise in 
democracy to take place in a well defined context. We agree that it 
must not take place in any old way, but, rather, that the context in 
which replacement workers are used must be well defined.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	I think we have to give in to what has been requested by the FTQ, 
the CSN and the Canadian Labour Congress and include it very 
plainly among the unfair labour practices. At the moment, seven 
unfair practices are set out and defined in the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	What is an unfair practice? It is the allegation that an employer, a 
union or an individual has taken part in an activity prohibited by 
the Canada Labour Code. Why was it not named clearly and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6415"> 6415 </A></B>
<P>
unambiguously? It would then have been a lot easier for the Canada 
Labour Relations Board to conduct the arbitrations required.
<P>
	Everyone agrees that a strike is the ultimate weapon. It is 
acknowledged that there must be intermediate stages. However, in 
cases where it is unavoidable-and it is acknowledged to be an 
element of union democracy-I think it should have been clearly 
included among unfair practices along with section 24; section 50, 
which is about bargaining in bad faith; section 94, which deals with 
interference in union business; section 37, which has to do with a 
union's duty of fair representation; and section 95, which concerns 
prohibitions relating to trade unions.
<P>
	I repeat, this is the thrust of the reform. You are well aware that 
the official opposition will not let this demand drop. We will 
encourage the minister to go right to the limit of his reformer 
tendencies, because I know for a fact that the minister is not a 
conservative.
<P>
	There was also a strong demand by the unions regarding 
technological change. On several occasions, the minister rose in 
this House and mentioned how much the labour market was 
changing, and how traditional practices were fast disappearing.
<P>
	One of the major demands was the right to strike, to reopen a 
collective agreement whenever significant technological changes 
occur between the signing of a collective agreement and its 
renegotiation. I believe we must keep this in mind. The committee 
will have to do some soul-searching regarding this particular 
demand.
<P>
	I believe the minister should have implemented the Sims report 
as a whole and taken note of a demand, a very important 
recommendation regarding his powers. This very studious minister 
could not have forgotten the existence of a very clear 
recommendation to abolish eight different powers, or eight sections 
of the act giving the minister powers that appear somewhat archaic 
in light of current practices and realities.
<P>
	Cases in point are section 57 regarding the authority to appoint 
arbitrators and an arbitration board; section 59 regarding the 
minister's right to receive copies of arbitration decisions; and 
section 71 regarding the right to receive notices of dispute. There 
are about eight sections like that. I believe that members of the 
Sims task force were all agreed that these powers were somewhat 
outdated.
<P>
	You will also understand how disappointed the opposition is with 
regard to the RCMP. We even tabled a motion-which I 
moved-inviting the minister to put an end to the discrimination 
against RCMP employees. The RCMP is the only police force in 
Canada which is not allowed to negotiate working conditions 
through collective bargaining.
<P>
	I believe the Sims report was very clear in this regard. The 
minister must be aware of it. It was recognized that it was not 
desirable to grant the right to strike. In fact, no one within the 
RCMP is asking for this right. What they  are asking for is the right 
to collective bargaining with compulsory arbitration, which many 
municipal police forces currently enjoy.
<P>
	Another serious omission, which we will have a chance to 
address in committee, concerns a very important demand made by 
PSAC, the Public Service Alliance of Canada, an organization the 
minister has held in high esteem so far. PSAC asked to be excluded 
from the application of the Public Service Staff Relations Act and 
be subject to the Canada Labour Code instead.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Why did the Public Service Alliance of Canada and its members 
democratically express such a demand? Because under the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act they cannot negotiate provisions as 
important as those governing job security in legislation other than 
the staff relations act. The same goes for protection against 
technological changes, job classification, appointments, 
promotions, and transfers.
<P>
	To conclude, while recognizing that the minister is acting in 
good faith, this proverbial good faith of his, we must take his 
reform proposal one step further and include a number of 
substantial changes requested by unions among others. I am 
convinced that, by the time we are through with our committee 
work, the minister will heed the official opposition's demands.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has 
been more than 20 years since the Canada Labour Code was 
amended. Over that period, the Canadian labour force changed 
dramatically thanks to the rapid growth of technology.
<P>
	For the most part, the code has served us well. Only a few 
changes are needed to improve the operations of the Canada 
Labour Relations Board and to ensure that strikes or lockouts do 
not negatively impact on the health, safety and economic 
well-being of Canadians.
<P>
	It has been evident from the legislation presented by this 
government that there is a tendency to go overboard, gun 
registration being a case in point.
<P>
	In the case of Bill C-66, the government is intruding on the rights 
of workers, employers and the Canadian public far more than is 
necessary. In its attempt to be all things to all people, this 
government has foisted a flawed bill on the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	Even though the Canada Labour Code governs the activities of 
only 700,000 workers, federally regulated industries are often the 
lifeline for Canadian manufacturers, producers and processors. 
They are primarily service oriented, involved in free movement of 
goods, services, capital and people across Canada. Because of the 
unique nature of the federal system, alternative sources are not 
often available.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6416"> 6416 </A></B>
<P>
	The goal of any legislation and regulation should be to create 
an environment which encourages economic growth.
<P>
	The government should seize the opportunity to fulfil one of its 
red book promises, that being the one called jobs, jobs, jobs, by 
making sure that the Canada Labour Code allows businesses and 
their employees to operate on a level playing field.
<P>
	We know that taxes kill jobs. The government infrastructure 
programs and other make work projects do not create permanent 
jobs. Vague labour legislation and regulations that are made on a 
case by case basis will not create jobs either.
<P>
	With the unemployment rate at 10 per cent, 1.4 million people 
unemployed and more than 1 in 4 Canadians worried about losing 
their jobs, one would think the government would do its utmost to 
ensure a stable environment for conducting business.
<P>
	Last week the Minister for International Trade released a study 
showing that after-tax costs of setting up a business in Canada 
average 6.7 per cent less than in the United States. This is good 
news for Canadians and could be a catalyst for job creation for 
businesses looking for a place to expand and invest.
<P>
	The government should be helping by offering a secure and 
dependable infrastructure that would allow them to get their 
products to market and receive their raw materials unimpeded. 
Instead, Bill C-66 would only muddy the waters and become more 
of a deterrent than a booster of economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	It is in the interest of all Canadians that we have reliable access 
to essential services, to keep the employment within our borders 
and to establish and maintain a reputation worldwide as reliable 
exporters of goods.
<P>
	Stable labour relations will promote investment and 
reinvestment. Bill C-66 does not clarify what constitutes an 
essential service, nor does it spell out what constitutes undermining 
a union when replacement workers are used in a strike or a lockout. 
This is not fair to workers, employers or third parties who often 
have the most to lose in labour disputes that occur in federally 
regulated industries.
<P>
	Scores of witnesses appearing before the industrial inquiry 
commission on industrial relations at west coast ports testified 
about the repercussions experienced by farmers and producers 
when strikes or lockouts prevent their crops and products from 
reaching markets.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	Those witnesses convinced the members of the commission who 
in turn proposed a number of workable recommendations to solve 
the problem. Unfortunately the drafters of this legislation did not 
follow the commission's advice and came up with what at best 
could only be called a watered down or partial solution.
<P>
	This half measure would ensure that grain, once it reaches port, 
would be loaded on ships. There is no provision, however, to ensure 
that grain reaches the port if there is a labour dispute elsewhere in 
the system. If that happens Parliament will be called upon to 
legislate everybody back to work.
<P>
	Over the last 20 years Parliament legislated an end to 19 strikes 
in the transportation and grain handling sector. It is in the interest 
of labour and management producers and processors to resolve 
disputes without parliamentary intervention.
<P>
	In the face of the growing importance of the global economy 
there is a need for continuous reliable shipping through Canada's 
ports and transportation sectors. The costly interruption of 
government business is not required. While there is a need for 
regulation by various levels of government it is not practical to put 
emergency measures in place each time labour and management 
are unable to reach a satisfactory agreement. Resolving the 
differences of these two groups can be achieved without 
interrupting the regular flow of government proceedings.
<P>
	A permanent and fair resolution process must be put in place, 
removed from the whims of government. We need permanent 
legislation that would provide both sides with predictable rules and 
a timetable by which to negotiate. Canada has a world class 
transportation system and communications infrastructure that 
should not be vulnerable to closure.
<P>
	A disruption in the day to day operation of vital transportation 
sectors inhibits the national economy from functioning. The 
potential impact of even a short work stoppage in many federal 
operations is catastrophic to Canadian business and to the Canadian 
economy as a whole. A strike in either the rail or truck sector 
cripples the automotive industry which must move finished 
products, raw materials and parts throughout North America on a 
daily basis.
<P>
	Westerners rely heavily on the railways. Each year 
approximately 80 million tonnes of products, most of which are 
bulk commodities such as grain, coal, sulphur and potash, leave the 
prairies by rail on their way to consumers in domestic and 
international markets. Prairie shippers provide CN and CP rail with 
50 per cent of their originating tonnage and contribute almost the 
same portion in revenues.
<P>
	While it is impossible to put a price on the damage done to our 
reputation as a reliable exporter, the direct costs from the 1994 west 
coast ports dispute are said to have amounted to over $125 million. 
The estimated indirect costs, loss to future business and so forth, 
were in excess of $250 million and threatened $500 million in grain 
sales.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6417"> 6417 </A></B>
<P>
	The risk to Canadian jobs must be minimized. Not only will 
a significant number of jobs be lost in the export sector if these 
disputes cannot be resolved, but jobs and the ports will be at severe 
risk when alternative means to ship goods are utilized. The use 
of U.S. ports could result in a loss of cargo and jobs in Canadian 
ports.
<P>
	I recommended final offer selection arbitration many times in 
this House and to the Sims task force and the west coast ports 
inquiry commission. Final offer arbitration is a tool to effectively 
and permanently resolve labour issues that fall under federal 
jurisdiction. It does not favour one side or another and here is how 
it works.
<P>
	If and only if the union and employers cannot make an 
agreement by the conclusion of the previous contract, the union and 
employers would provide the minister with the name of a person 
they jointly recommend as arbitrator. The union and employer 
would be required to submit to the arbitrator a list of the matters 
agreed upon and a list of the matters still under dispute. For 
disputed issues each party would be required to submit a final offer 
for selection. The arbitrator then selects either the final offer 
submitted by the union or the final offer submitted by the 
employer; all of one or all of the other. The arbitrator's decision 
would be binding on both parties.
<P>
	The measures contained in Bill C-66 will not, however, achieve 
the balance that the minister seeks. It will not promote harmonious 
relations between the two, nor will it ensure the uninterrupted flow 
of commodities to market.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	If Canada is to be a major player in the global marketplace, it is 
incumbent upon us as legislators not to interfere but to provide 
logical, sound legislation under which workers and management 
can operate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise before the House today to address Bill C-66 
which will amend part I of the Canada Labour Code, the 
Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act. I am pleased 
because this piece of legislation is a symbol of the possibilities 
which exist when government, labour and business work together 
in an atmosphere of trust and co-operation.
<P>
	The bill will modernize the industrial relations component of the 
Canada Labour Code, thereby improving the ability of labour and 
management to adjust and thrive in an increasingly global 
economy.
<P>
	This is especially true when we consider the fact that the 
proposed amendments will affect about 700,000 Canadians in very 
important pivotal industries, such as banking, telecommunications, 
broadcasting, rail and road transportation, airports and airlines, and 
others. These industries are part of the backbone of our national  
economy. In many cases they are also where we will find jobs for 
the future.
<P>
	It is so rare to see management and unions sharing the same 
opinion that I thought it important to mention the fact here.
<P>
	It is true that a tremendous amount of work has been invested in 
producing this piece of legislation. Bill C-66 is the product of an 
extensive consultation process. These consultations included a task 
force of labour relations experts, a working group of management 
and labour organizations, and a series of meetings held by the 
Minister of Labour with representatives of labour, management and 
other interested parties.
<P>
	The task force was chaired by Andrew Sims, an Edmonton 
labour lawyer specializing in arbitration and dispute resolution. He 
was admirably supported by two experienced colleagues, Toronto 
based labour arbitrator, mediator and fact finder Paula Knopf, and 
Quebec labour arbitrator and professor at Laval University, 
Rodrigue Blouin.
<P>
	The task force received numerous written submissions and met 
with labour and management delegations and with members of the 
academic and legal communities at various locations across the 
country. It also invited labour and management organizations 
whose members are subject to the Canada Labour Code to set up a 
working group to discuss and endeavour to reach a consensus on 
issues.
<P>
	When the task force submitted its report entitled: ``Seeking a 
Balance'', it reflected the consensus reached by the 
labour-management working group in a number of important areas. 
In addition to its own findings and those of the working group, the 
Sims task force also took into account the recommendations made 
by the West Coast Ports Industrial Inquiry Commission which had 
issued its report in December 1995.
<P>
	It is quite an accomplishment that both labour and management 
have expressed support for the overall balance of the 
recommendations of the task force. The consensus reached is an 
illustration of what can be accomplished when we work together in 
a spirit of good faith and mutual respect.
<P>
	On several key issues Bill C-66 reflects the consensus reached 
by labour and management. With these amendments the 
government is acting as a proactive catalyst for change. It is 
proposing strategies which will modernize the code, encouraging 
parties to settle their differences in a less adversarial fashion.
<P>
	The amendments include the establishment of a new 
representational Canada industrial relations board composed of a 
neutral chairperson and vice-chairpersons, and equal numbers of 
members representing employers and employees. This board will 
replace the current non-representational Canada Labour Relations 
Board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6418"> 6418 </A></B>
<P>
	The new board will be given greater flexibility to deal quickly 
with routine or urgent matters. The board's powers will be 
clarified or extended to ensure that complex industrial relations 
issues, such as those arising from the review of bargaining units 
or sales of businesses, can be fully addressed, and to provide 
appropriate remedies in the case of unfair labour practices, such 
as failure to bargain in good faith.
<P>
	There is the replacement of the current two-stage conciliation 
process by a single stage with a choice of procedures, to take no 
more than 60 days.
<P>
	The right to strike or lockout will be subject to the holding of a 
secret ballot vote within the previous 60 days and the giving of a 
72-hour advance notice.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Parties involved in a work stoppage will be required to maintain 
services necessary to protect public health and safety. Services 
affecting grain shipments will be continued in the event of legal 
work stoppages by any third parties in the ports.
<P>
	There will be no general prohibition on the use of replacement 
workers. However if they are used for the purposes of undermining 
a union's representative capacity, the board may declare their use 
as an unfair labour practice and order the employer to stop using 
them for the duration of the dispute.
<P>
	Employees will be entitled to maintain insurance and benefits 
programs during work stoppages.
<P>
	The amendments will also confirm the rights of employees in the 
bargaining unit who were on strike or locked out to resume 
employment following the end of a work stoppage in preference to 
any persons hired to replace them.
<P>
	As chair of the parliamentary Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development, I look forward to a very interesting debate 
and hearing further opinions from all sides of the House. We will 
find ways to perhaps improve this piece of legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased this morning to speak to Bill C-66, particularly since my 
colleagues, as members of the opposition, and I, as official critic 
during the rail strike, may be partially responsible for its existence.
<P>
	I remember that, while the strike spread throughout Canada, and 
we in the Bloc Quebecois spoke for the right to strike as set out in 
the Canada Labour Code, many Canadians told us that we were 
putting Canada at risk and I kept repeating: ``If the Canadian 
economy cannot afford the Canadian Labour Code, then change it. 
Until then, we defend those who use the Candadian Labour Code.''
<P>
	So I understand that the government wished to amend the 
Canada Labour Code so that it facilitates dispute resolution in 
industries which are vital for the Canadian economy.
<P>
	We cannot disagree with its intent. However, as my colleague, 
who now acts as critic and who spoke so eloquently, made clear, 
and as we will keep repeating and will no doubt hear very often 
during committee hearings, this intent cannot be reinforced by just 
any provision. As far as labour relations are concerned, nothing can 
be as insidious for the legislator as thinking that he does not have to 
strike a balance. The legislator must be aware that, in real life, if 
strong unions have developed, it is because there were strong, 
prosperous companies.
<P>
	But we can say that, in Quebec and in Canada, unions have 
become increasingly responsible, that they have decided to take 
part in the economic development of their industries, and that they 
understand that hostile and antagonistic labour relations can be 
harmful. But, at the same time, they know that there can be no 
peace if they are toothless. Historically, and not only in Canada, 
when labour relations do not guarantee this balance, there is no 
peace, which is our goal.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	The absence of conflict within a company does not mean that 
peace prevails. As a former labour relations teacher, I can tell you 
that there is nothing worse for a business than to have employees 
who are dissatisfied, who are frustrated, who feel the business is 
not well managed, and who do not have a say in its operations. 
Nothing is more harmful, because the productivity that everyone 
talks about will not exist.
<P>
	Productivity, that is the one coming from workers and not 
investments, is possible when workers feel that the business is well 
managed, that what is asked of them is feasible, and that they are 
given the means to do the job. However, in order to achieve that, 
workers must be allowed to speak up.
<P>
	Under these conditions, unions that are increasingly responsible, 
that take it upon themselves to hold sometimes vigourous debates 
with their members, that support the development of a business and 
of its management, that become key players in the process, and I 
could name of few, including in the port industry, these unions 
expect the other side to recognize them as a voice for the workers 
who fully take part in the development of a business. Unions expect 
to be recognized as such, including in the legal periods agreed upon 
for the renewal of collective agreements.
<P>
	Thus, when we want to introduce, as is being done, principles of 
essential services, with which nobody can really disagree, but when 
on the other hand we do not guarantee unions that workers who are 
not unit members, the replacement workers, or ``scabs'' as they are 
commonly called, will not be prohibited, unions do not feel they 
are fully recognized. If follows therefore that the trust placed in 
them during the operation of the collective agreement would no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6419"> 6419 </A></B>
<P>
longer apply when the renewal period is legally recognized, at a 
time when a  power struggle is actually going on. It is an economic 
power struggle, and this is the real factor that will bring about 
results on the workers' side, but also on the employer's side.
<P>
	On the thorny issue of rail transportation, we have often seen 
employers resort to lockouts, whereas workers were willing to 
work night and day to ensure essential unloadings. They know they 
cannot do otherwise. However, it is important to know, when such 
provisions exist, that employers would not be allowed to sabotage 
the good management tool a responsible union becomes once a 
collective agreement is signed.
<P>
	Let me tell you this: If employers think that, after having used 
replacement workers in time of strike, they can count on the 
co-operation of unions-not co-operation in the sense of their 
refusal to stand up for their members' interests, but in the sense of a 
refusal to get involved in the development of the business-they 
are mistaken.
<P>
	I think the minister should understand that, in this regard, he 
cannot expect that employers would agree with anti-scab 
legislation. That would be asking them to deprive themselves of a 
powerful tool. Therefore, the minister must have the courage to 
give people in the workplace this tool, which is essential if a 
balance is to be struck.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Let me to say that when the Parti Quebecois government passed 
its anti-scab bill in 1977, initially, there was a wave of protest. I can 
tell you that employers were praying for a change of government in 
1985, when the Liberal government came to power. They wanted 
Mr. Bourassa to cancel the anti-scab legislation.
<P>
	But what did Mr. Bourassa tell them? This quote comes from a 
publication called <I>Les Affaires</I>. Mr. Bourassa told them this: 
``Look, now that social peace has been achieved, why would you 
want to upset it, and disrupt it?'' And Mr. Bourassa kept the 
anti-scab bill because it provided rules that allowed and even, to 
some extent, compelled the unions to be the responsible 
instruments we need.
<P>
	We need workers who have authorized and democratic 
representatives to speak on their behalf and wield some power, and 
we need well managed businesses, where employers have the 
managing powers they need to expand and be profitable. There is 
no doubt about that.
<P>
	I know that our time is limited but I wanted to stress this point, 
which, in my opinion, is a major one. This point is not only precise 
or limited. No. In spite of real the improvements this bill will make 
to the code, if this clause on legal replacement workers is 
maintained, I think the spirit of the code will not be what the 
minister is seeking.
<P>
	As was so eloquently said by our critic, we will work very hard 
to help the minister make the changes that are desirable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to take this opportunity to speak in support of this bill. I begin by 
reinforcing what my colleagues have said about the fair and 
balanced nature of this legislation.
<P>
	I come to this discussion with a unionist background, someone 
who has sat at the other side of the table. It is very important when 
we are having this kind of discussion to keep in mind that in 
fairness and in order to make a system work, there not only must be 
a perception of fairness and balance but there must be fairness and 
balance in essence.
<P>
	As some in this House have already mentioned, the alternative is 
to be draconian, to not allow people the ability to pull their services 
and on the employer side to lock employees out. If we want to go to 
that extreme then it is not necessary to find a fine balance and to 
maintain the fairness which the Canada Labour Code has had for a 
number of years.
<P>
	Before I get too far into my presentation I will suggest that what 
we see here today is a consensus that was arrived at between 
employers and employee groups across the nation. As the minister 
has already said, it may not be some grand scheme to totally reform 
the Canada Labour Code, but there are a number of steps and 
changes to improve the code, which is what this is all about.
<P>
	This is good for Canadians and Canadian business. I will look at 
some of the ways the government's amendments will help the 
employers of Canada. From my perspective it would be very easy 
to spend my short time talking about the importance to labour but I 
will talk about the importance of these amendments for employers. 
If I can feel comfortable, I imagine a number of members would 
also feel comfortable. Before I do that, I would like to say a few 
words about the consultation process.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	This consultation process is one that a lot of members in this 
House, whether they are new or have been here for a number of 
terms, are always arguing; the Government of Canada or the 
provincial jurisdictions do not do enough.
<P>
	One of the things that is unique in the labour field is that very 
little takes place without extensive consultation. The consultation 
process was actually initiated some two years ago when the 
government was made aware of the need for momentous changes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6420"> 6420 </A></B>
<P>
and the fact that it wanted to, because of the way the work force 
was evolving, make changes to the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	I am sure those in this House will not argue that there has not 
been consultation. The Sims task force was going across the 
country. The task force went to Halifax, Vancouver, Toronto, 
Ottawa, Edmonton, Montreal and Winnipeg to meet with 
Canadians and to listen to their views. The task force also held 
academic round tables at the universities of Laval, Toronto and 
Calgary. Of course it met with numerous interested parties in 
informal meetings and received a great number of written 
submissions.
<P>
	As we have heard in earlier speeches in this House, the task force 
set up a labour management working group and considered the 
recommendations of the industrial inquiry commission. I will not 
go into that because suffice it to say this group did a remarkable job 
and did it with a lot of determination.
<P>
	It does not surprise me from my past background that the labour 
side of the discussions with employers and employees working 
together has always been through labour relations, its hallmark and 
the reason why the legislation that is now before us has been very 
effective over the years and of course will be more effective once 
the new amendments are in place.
<P>
	At the end of its consultations the group presented its report 
entitled ``Seeking a Balance''. The task force's recommendations 
were based on four solid principles and I think we should keep 
these principles in mind.
<P>
	First, that the existing Canada Labour Code basically continues 
to serve its constituents well. This obviously means that the 
economy will be moving along at a good clip and having some 
fairness and balance in the system for both employers and 
employees.
<P>
	Second, stability is highly desirable and pendulum like changes 
in the code do not serve the best interests of the concerned parties 
or of the general public. That is really one of the major issues that 
the minister and the different consultation groups focused on 
during these discussions. It is not acceptable either from the right 
or left wing's perspective in this country to think that you can make 
major pendulum swings in that balance I was talking about. The 
balance is so narrow in its parameters that if you move too far one 
way or the other it makes for very difficult negotiations and 
discussions between the two parties.
<P>
	If we were to do as some members have suggested across the 
way and remove the right to strike and have final offer arbitration, 
that of course is a form of getting where you want to go but it does 
necessitate making those dramatic pendulum swings that I was 
talking about which could cause some disruption to a very 
successful labour relations regime that we in Canada have grown 
accustomed to.
<P>
	Third, that consensus between the parties is the best basis for 
legislative change. That goes back to the official opposition's 
interest and making changes where there is no consensus. If you do 
that you could be accused in this case of trying to drive a round peg 
in a square hole. If it does not fit too well, so be it; we are trying as 
politicians should to be leaders in a field and ahead of the public 
and ahead of the consensus that may evolve over time.
<P>
	Do not get me wrong, I think quite frankly in Quebec there are 
certain parts of its labour code that are effective to that province 
and that particular society, and that is good. However, we are not 
dealing here with one province. We are dealing with a total nation, 
a very large piece of geography, and a number of other provinces.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	We cannot take one specific issue in one specific province and 
try, as much as we might like to, to make it fit. It just does not work 
that way.
<P>
	It is important to know that this piece of legislation and the 
amendments we are proposing are a consensus between the parties 
which, in labour relations, is a very smart thing to do indeed.
<P>
	The fourth recommendation should be enactable, long lasting 
and based on the concept of volunteerism. I believe all will agree 
that these principles are well founded. It is easy to see why the task 
force was able to come up with recommendations that were 
endorsed by both business and labour groups.
<P>
	Today we are talking about the support of these groups, business 
and labour, as though it were quite a common thing. We all know 
that is not true. Everyone knows that the aims of organized labour 
and management, job security on one side and the most effective 
use of human resources on the other, are difficult to reconcile. 
Anyone who has been involved, like I have, across a negotiating 
table will know that it is sometimes a miracle to see that we can get 
these kinds of agreements without all the difficulty that can occur.
<P>
	Without going through a number of examples of some of the 
groups, I would like to mention why the government has 
introduced certain amendments. We understand that measures 
which help resolve labour disputes faster and in a more positive 
environment are good for employers, workers and all Canadians. 
What these particular amendments will do is streamline some of 
these aspects of the legislation.
<P>
	On the amendments that address the bargaining cycle and how 
they benefit employers, a primary objective of this group of 
amendments is to reduce delays in the collective bargaining 
process. The benefit of accomplishing this should be clear to 
anyone. One amendment will allow a notice to bargain to be served 
within four months prior to the expiry of the collective agreement. 
At present it is three months.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6421"> 6421 </A></B>
<P>
	The task force thought that an earlier opening date would be 
established to encourage earlier attention to collective bargaining 
and to give the parties enough time to conclude an agreement 
before the expiry of the previous one.
<P>
	Another amendment will provide for a single stage conciliation 
process. Both labour and management question the effectiveness of 
the current system which can involve two stages and can take a 
long time to resolve disputes. Single stage conciliation is one of the 
points upon which labour-management working groups agreed.
<P>
	I hope I get a chance to speak on that particular issue at a 
different reading because it is important to get into how the 
conciliation process works and how important it is to the Canada 
Labour Code and labour relations in Canada.
<P>
	There is the need, under this section, for a secret ballot vote 
before workers are allowed to strike. This vote will have to be 
taken no more than 60 days before the right to strike is exercised. 
While most unions already hold such votes, the Canada Labour 
Code does not require it at present. The requirement to hold a strike 
vote no earlier than 60 days prior to strike action will ensure that 
the vote is less of a bargaining tactic to pressure employers with 
more of an authentic expression of the employees' wishes. I can 
say from experience that at times that could be a bargaining tool.
<P>
	Before people get too far into these amendments they should 
spend some time with their local labour groups and get a feel for 
them. They will find that there is a consensus in these amendments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to speak today to Bill C-66, an act to 
amend the Canada Labour Code and the Corporations and Labour 
Unions Returns Act and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts. As the minister was saying in his speech, the purpose of 
this bill is to amend the Canada Labour Code, which has not 
undergone an in-depth revision in more than 25 years. Therefore, it 
had to be modernized with a view to the future.
<P>
	What is unfortunate is that, in the end, the government has come 
up with an incomplete reform. Certain important issues, which 
have been around for several years and are still of considerable 
interest, are not covered by this reform.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Here, in this House, we studied two private members' bills to 
prohibit the use of replacement workers, and the number of 
members voting in favour of these bills went up each time. The last 
time, the number was almost sufficient for the bill to pass. 
However, in the government bill before us today, there are no 
concrete measures to prohibit the use of scabs.
<P>
	It is even somewhat offensive, because instead of saying nothing 
about that, the bill contains measures that are a bit ridiculous. It 
says that employers who negotiate will be allowed to use 
replacement workers, whereas employers who do not negotiate will 
not be allowed to do so. Everybody knows that, in the world of 
labour relations, it is very easy to appear to negotiate.
<P>
	Any employer can pretend that he is negotiating. He can show up 
every morning at the bargaining table without any progress ever 
being made. We must not forget that the Canada Labour Code 
applies to areas such as telecommunications, radio, broadcasting, 
international and interprovincial transportation, airports, air 
carriers, ports, long-shoring, grain transportation and banking. We 
all know the labour relations background of these industries, how 
they can treat people and the impact of technological change in 
these areas. It is very clear that, if the government does not change 
its position, it will be missing a crucial element of this reform, 
namely to have a bill that prohibits the use of scabs, like the one 
Quebec has had for 15 years.
<P>
	Quebec's experience shows that there has been a very obvious 
improvement in labour relations and that this legislation preventing 
the hiring of strike breakers is an important contributing factor. The 
minister, who represents a Quebec riding, should have been more 
sensitive to the representations made, all the more so as the last 
strike at Ogilvie Mills in Montreal, which lasted almost two years, 
was primarily about this issue. He represents a riding almost next 
door to that company's location. Representations were made to all 
the present federal ministers with ridings in Quebec, and there was 
lobbying somewhere, and this is all the government can come up 
with. It is not delivering the goods.
<P>
	Therefore, giving an employer the right to hire strike breakers if 
he negotiates is purely cosmetic and is not an acceptable solution. 
It is essential that this be re-worked in committee.
<P>
	Another current issue, the right of RCMP officers to form a 
union, has often been raised here.
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have not always been good 
friends of Quebec's sovereignists. However, it is a police force that 
has duties to perform and that is entitled to a certain level of 
independence with respect to its employer in order to be able to 
carry out its work effectively. This demand has also been on the 
table for a number of years. There are practices that exist in labour 
relations with police forces in a number of Canadian provinces. 
Unions have been formed and are doing well, and labour relations 
are good. Here also, the federal government is sidestepping its 
intended reform.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6422"> 6422 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister says there has been no reform for 25 years and that 
an overhaul is necessary. If we want an  in-depth reform, we need 
to have these two elements at the outset, namely a provision 
prohibiting the hiring of scabs and the possibility for RCMP staff to 
become unionised.
<P>
	There is another area where the minister has not listened to the 
recommendations made by the consultation committee. It is about 
appointments to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. 
Management as well as unions wanted board appointments based 
on lists proposed by management and union representatives.
<P>
	Yet, the minister has left the door open to appointing people who 
might not meet with the approval of one of the parties involved in 
industrial relations but who might nevertheless meet with the 
approval of the Liberal Party of Canada, for example. At any rate, 
the minister is leaving a door open, is leaving some room for 
political manoeuvering, in short, for political appointments.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I think the minister will have time to think about that. I hope the 
committee will, in its wisdom, add amendments to ensure that 
appointees are truly experts in the field, so that the Canada 
Industrial Relations Board will have a solid and enviable reputation 
for its competence and for the fact that its members truly represent 
the world of work meaning both employers and employees.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in the first supposedly major reform in 25 years, 
we see no reference to preventive withdrawal for pregnant women. 
In Quebec, those measures already exist and have been in effect for 
a number of years.
<P>
	Here, in Canada, there is no mention of this at all. However, 
there are sectors where the number of female workers is very 
significant and where working conditions may be difficult. More 
and more new technologies are being used, and often their impact 
is not sufficiently known. We cannot afford to put a pregnant 
woman or her child at risk. This is not an area where we can 
proceed by trial and error.
<P>
	I think that, considering the level of our modern technologies, 
society in Canada and Quebec should be just as innovative in the 
way it treats workers. As far as preventive withdrawal for pregnant 
women is concerned, I hope that in committee, the government will 
improve on its proposals to reform of the Canada Labour Code. I 
hope various groups will make representations and persuade the 
government to change some of its positions and be sensitive to 
certain arguments, including this one, and to understand the 
relevance of taking action.
<P>
	I think the women of Canada would be grateful to the 
government if they saw this provision added to the bill, and it is 
quite surprising that the present government has failed to 
understand the relevance of making changes of this kind for the 
entire sector regulated by the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	In concluding, I may say that the Canada Labour Code is another 
flagrant example of the fact that jurisdictions in Canada are 
unnecessarily fuzzy. Within the same province, some people come 
under the Quebec Labour Code and some people under the Canada 
Labour Code. There is no similarity between the two. In Quebec, 
under working conditions which should be the same, some workers 
will not be covered under the antiscab legislation while others will 
be because they come under the Quebec Labour Code. This 
situation makes no sense to me.
<P>
	This is the result of the implementation of the Canadian 
Constitution through the years without any amendment or 
improvement, and today we have two classes of citizens and double 
standards. This means that some workers come under a provincial 
code which is closer to the people-the government is more in 
touch with reality, more aware of certain issues such as the 
protective re-assignment of pregnant workers. The fact that it has 
been responsible for the implementation of social legislation might 
have heightened its sensitivity. It might also be due to the kind of 
governments we have had since it is indeed an area where Quebec 
has been ahead for a long time.
<P>
	Last week, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Parti 
Quebecois. Obviously it implemented a wide range of measures 
with positive results. To conclude, I will say that the opportunity is 
still there for the Government of Canada to get with it and bring 
about its reform.
<P>
	We do not proceed with a reform of the Canada Labour Code 
every year, in fact there had not been one in 25 years, therefore the 
Canadian government should do its job in committee. To conclude, 
I will repeat what I believe to be the four major points: make sure 
effective antiscab measures are in place; allow the appointment of 
members to the Canada Labour Relations Board from lists 
provided by those involved; take measures providing for the 
protective re-assignment of pregnant women; and, as a whole, see 
to it that measures which will be taken will ensure that we have a 
real Canada Labour Code in the years to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is also with great 
pleasure that I support the motion to refer Bill C-66 to the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	This committee stage will be the last step in a long series of 
consultations that were held across Canada on this bill which 
updates the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	I believe the labour minister clearly demonstrated how seriously 
he took this reform. He also showed some remarkable qualities as a 
conciliator and a unifier. His objective was a balanced, fair and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6423"> 6423 </A></B>
<P>
equitable reform. He  certainly reached this objective since all the 
parties involved largely approved the bill.
<P>
	Of course, all the parties would have liked the minister to totally 
support their own position, and many will go before the committee 
to seek amendments in their favour. It is normal, predictable and 
quite in line with the political and parliamentary tradition of this 
country.
<P>
	However, all those who participated in the numerous 
consultations on the reform said they were satisfied that the 
minister had respected the consensus reached by the parties. I am 
not surprised. I know the labour minister is a man of his word who 
says what he means and does what he says.
<P>
	I am happy that others have now discovered his great qualities. 
Under the circumstances, it is rare for labour and management to 
agree on something, particularly on the qualities of a labour 
minister.
<P>
	Naturally, the Bloc Quebecois members maintain that the 
minister did not go far enough, that he should have adopted the 
unions' position with his eyes closed. Once again, the Bloc 
Quebecois members are lapsing into excess and abuse. It is always 
all or nothing. They cannot find a middle ground or reach a 
consensus.
<P>
	Let us take for example the clause of the bill dealing with 
replacement workers. The Bloc is saying: ``We must do what is 
done in Quebec, ban them entirely''. Indeed, in the 1970s, the 
Quebec government passed legislation banning replacement 
workers. The economic and social context in 1996, on the eve of 
the next millennium, is quite different from what it was 20 years 
ago, and businesses are restructuring. They must face competition 
not only from other Canadian businesses, but also from 
competitors all over the world. In many cases, unfortunately, this 
results in hundreds of lay-offs.
<P>
	We are no longer in the era of all or nothing draconian solutions. 
The labour minister understood that well and wants to modernize 
the Labour Code to ensure that everyone has rights and that the 
parties seek to resolve their disputes before resorting to a strike or a 
lockout.
<P>
	If Bloc members look closely at Bill C-66, they will see that 
everything has been provided to rationalize procedures and to 
allow the parties to talk to each other, to resolve disputes among 
themselves or to call upon the Canada Industrial Relations Board to 
assist them. It is in this perspective that the minister has provided 
that, under normal circumstances, employers will have the right to 
use replacement workers during a legal work stoppage.
<P>
	However, the minister did not want to leave workers without any 
resources, which is why his formula is so brilliant in my opinion. 
Should an employer use replacement workers to undermine the 
union's capacity to ensure proper representation, this would be 
perceived as an unfair practice, thus warranting the referral of the 
matter to the board.
<P>
	If, after reviewing the case, the board determines that the 
employer's action does constitute an unfair labour practice, the 
board will now have the power to ban the use of replacement 
workers for the duration of the dispute. That is what I call an 
articulate and modern position suited to the working world of the 
year 2000. Employers have rights, and so do the workers.
<P>
	In addition, the minister proposed other amendments which 
complement this important measure and give it even more value. 
First, he restructured the board. In the future, the new Canada 
Industrial Relations Board will be composed of a chairperson and 
neutral vice-chairpersons appointed by the government. Each case 
heard by the new board will be presided over by one of its neutral 
vice-chairpersons.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Unlike its predecessor, this will be a representational board made 
up of an equal number of members representing employers and 
employees. This was not the case in the past. In the future, both 
employees and employers will have a say. They will be able to take 
an active part in the board's decision making process. For me this is 
a major step forward and the Bloc members should at least 
recognize it for what it is.
<P>
	Also, Bill C-66 sets out a new procedure to be followed before a 
work stoppage. The notice to bargain may be served four months 
ahead instead of three months, to give the parties more time to 
discuss and reach an agreement. A secret vote on any planned work 
stoppage must be held within 60 days of a strike or lockout. Again, 
the government wants the parties to fully realize the importance of 
such action and not make any rash decisions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Another major amendment proposes that workers who have been 
on strike or locked out will be first in line for their old jobs. It is 
important for employees to know that once a work stoppage has 
ended, no one else will be able to take their jobs. In a nutshell, I 
believe workers have made important gains with this reform, and 
they are well aware of this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I find it unfortunate that Bloc members act as the unconditional 
mouthpieces of unions. As the fine representatives of all the people 
who elected them, including employers, I believe they should make 
allowances and not see everything in black and white. Above all, 
they should support the fair and balanced bill the Minister of 
Labour has put before us. I urge them to think about all this.
<P>
	They could take advantage of the standing committee meetings 
to ask the minister any question they may have. I hope that, when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6424"> 6424 </A></B>
<P>
Bill C-66 comes back to us, they will agree to support this excellent 
reform of the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in the debate on Bill C-66, an act to amend the Canada 
Labour Code, which was tabled by the labour minister on 
November 4. This legislation implements reforms to the collective 
bargaining provisions of part I of the Canada Labour Code, which 
govern federally legislated private sector employers and unions.
<P>
	The key components of this reform are: the creation of the 
Canada industrial relations board, with extensive powers; changes 
to the conciliation process; the establishment of the rights and 
obligations of the parties during a work stoppage; the requirement 
to continue essential services during a conflict; making the 
undermining of a trade union's representational capacity during a 
strike or lockout an unfair labour practice; improving access to 
collective bargaining for off-site workers; and a requirement to 
maintain services affecting grain shipments, in the event of a work 
stoppage.
<P>
	I have many criticisms regarding this bill, but for now I will only 
deal with the issue of replacement workers. Clause 42 prohibits the 
use of replacement workers only when an employer uses them for 
the purpose of undermining a trade union's representational 
capacity. For example, if an employer refuses to negotiate while 
using replacement workers at the same time, the new Canada 
industrial relations board could prohibit such a practice.
<P>
	However, a company merely has to negotiate with the union, 
even if only for the sake of it, to avoid this prohibition and continue 
to use scabs. It is inadmissible. It will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to demonstrate that this unfair practice seeks to 
undermine a trade union's representational capacity. In most cases, 
the conflict will have been resolved without such a practice being 
confirmed.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	The basic principles of our collective labour relations system 
make it clearly illegitimate to hire replacement workers during a 
strike or a lock-out. This practice brings intruders into a dispute 
affecting exclusively two clearly identified parties, throws off the 
balance of power, and curtails the freedom of expression of 
strikers.
<P>
	The rationale of economic pressure is that the loss of salary will 
be an incitement for the workers to be cautious and accept a 
settlement as soon as possible. It should be the same for the 
employer. At any rate, there is no comparison between the day to 
day economic hardship of strikers and that of an employer who can 
keep the production going with the help of management workers.
<P>
	During a strike, employees can go into debt for a long time and 
jeopardize their professional career, not to  mention their financial 
problems. During my long experience in the labour movement, I 
witnessed some tragic situations in this regard.
<P>
	When an employer hires replacement workers, strikers have an 
immediate gut reaction of utter frustration. They feel personally 
targeted. They see this practice as unfair. The focus of the conflict 
shifts from working conditions to the hiring of scabs and job 
stealers. That frustration brings a degree of harshness into the 
conflict. That gut reaction of strikers is all the more serious since 
employment has become such a challenging problem in our 
society. Therefore, the use of replacement workers has a very 
negative impact on the strikers' behaviour.
<P>
	Organized labour is very disappointed by the fact that the 
government has not totally prohibited the use of scabs in its 
amendments to the Canada Labour Code. Nancy Riche, Executive 
Vice-President of the Canadian Labour Congress, has condemned 
the government for once again not taking this opportunity to put an 
end to confrontation in the event of a strike or a lockout.
<P>
	Clément Godbout, president of the FTQ, also complains that 
nothing in this bill prohibits the hiring of scabs. The FTQ 
represents almost 100,000 salaried employees under federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	On October 22, I introduced Bill C-338 to amend the Canada 
Labour Code and the Public Service Staff Relations Act. The 
purpose of this bill is to prohibit the use of replacement workers 
during a strike or a lockout, as is currently done in Quebec and in 
British Columbia.
<P>
	The bill also contains provisions to ensure that essential services 
are maintained during a labour dispute. It is also aimed at 
maintaining a balance between the negotiating parties in order to 
shorten labour disputes and avert violence. My bill will affect some 
700,000 Canadian workers under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	By introducing Bill C-338, I fulfilled a commitment I made to 
Canadian and Quebec workers. I think anti-scab measures are 
urgently needed.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	I urge the numerous Liberal members who, in the past, supported 
this kind of measure to exert pressure on the labour minister and 
their government. For once, the government should listen to the 
demands of the unions in this area. The Bloc Quebecois and I will 
pursue our efforts until legislation to prohibit the hiring of 
replacement workers is passed.
<P>
	Earlier, I was listening to the labour minister who said that the 
absence of a consensus between the unions and management led 
him to decide not to include real anti-scab provisions. Such an 
excuse is unacceptable. There will never be a consensus in this 
regard. The government should have the fortitude to made such 
important and crucial decisions, as the Quebec government did in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6425"> 6425 </A></B>
<P>
1977. The measures taken at the time  by the Quebec government 
are now instrumental in settling labour disputes as soon as possible.
<P>
	I must say that I am also disappointed to note that the bill does 
not include any provision concerning the precautionary cessation 
of work for pregnant women. In Quebec, for instance, pregnant 
women are protected by the Act Respecting Occupational Health 
and Safety. However, Quebec women working for the federal 
government are not covered by this important provision.
<P>
	I also regret that the bill introduced by the minister does not give 
RCMP employees the right to negotiate their working conditions 
through collective bargaining. I have a lot of reservations about this 
bill. We will have the time to express our concerns in committee 
and then to debate the issue in the House at third reading.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in support of Bill C-66. I would like 
to address my remarks to one aspect of the bill, that portion which 
deals with replacement workers.
<P>
	When looking back over the union movement, at the turn of the 
century we see it starting with the sense that workers should 
receive fair value for their labour. As time went on the union 
movement in Britain, Europe, the United States and Canada grew 
stronger and stronger, particularly in the post-war period, after the 
second world war.
<P>
	In the 1970s and 1980s the driving force of unionism transposed 
from this desire to have a value for labour-full value for the 
labour that the worker put in-to something that was a little bit 
more, the principle that the worker should share in the profits of the 
company.
<P>
	In my own view, consequently what happened with organized 
labour, certainly in the 1970s and 1980s, was a sense that if 
unionized workers were employed by a company that was doing 
very well in the market then they bargained for higher and higher 
wages and benefits. I do not think that any of us would quarrel very 
much with that in principle. It seems reasonable that if the work 
force is very much a part of a company, it should benefit just as 
shareholders do when a company does well.
<P>
	However, times change and sometimes they change very rapidly. 
In the late 1980s and coming into the 1990s we have seen the 
phenomenon of the global markets. First was North American free 
trade and now certainly a very strong trend to world free trade. This 
is a change in the situation with respect to countries like Canada in 
terms of their relationship with their work forces.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	It now becomes imperative, if a country's industries are going to 
compete on the world stage, that they be cost efficient, especially in 
the area of labour. Thus we find  the situation where, particularly in 
the United States, for example, the union movement is under 
assault simply because the average American worker, particularly 
the unskilled labourer, is in direct competition with the workers of 
Mexico, the Far East and other places.
<P>
	We have two trends running here. We came out of the eighties 
with the desire to give unionized workers a greater share in the 
earned benefits of a company and then the contrary pressure that 
companies have to be more and more competitive.
<P>
	In 1993 the Ontario government introduced legislation that 
banned the use of replacement workers. This legislation was a 
logical evolution in the union movement. It gave more power to the 
unions and better guarantees to workers that they would share in 
the profits of the company.
<P>
	This law was too late. It was behind its time. By 1993 it was very 
clear to anyone who was interested in business, finance and 
watching world markets that this law, which the New Democratic 
government in Ontario had passed, was not in the best interests of 
the Ontario economy being able to compete in other markets.
<P>
	There was quite a bit of resistance at the time the legislation was 
introduced and considerable resistance thereafter. There was a 
simple reason for this. I can cite from my own experience in the 
communications industry that technology had created a situation 
where replacement workers in the high tech industries could be 
recruited from home. They could actually operate from their homes 
rather than go to an office. The whole idea of banning replacement 
workers made it very difficult for high tech companies to create an 
environment where they could use workers who were no longer on 
the premises but were operating outside of the city where the 
company was located.
<P>
	In the high tech area the ban on replacement workers had a very 
negative consequence to the competitive position of high tech 
industries in Ontario. Because it gave such clout to organized 
labour, it was a threat to those companies which sought to 
renegotiate contracts to bring the level of remuneration to the 
workers down to a level that was more competitive in the world 
markets in which they had to compete.
<P>
	When the new Conservative government was elected in Ontario 
one of the first things it did was repeal that legislation. I am not 
entirely in agreement with what the Ontario government did. I 
believe that even though we have these pressures from world 
markets on organized labour, we as Canadians and as politicians 
have a basic responsibility to defend the traditions of organized 
labour.
<P>
	In the final analysis, organized labour fights for the rights of 
workers. We have every reason to want to see, when these terrible 
pressures come to bear on organized labour, that it does not 
ultimately collapse under the  pressures, as indeed is happening in 
the United States. The union movement in the United States is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6426"> 6426 </A></B>
<P>
undergoing severe changes. Its influence and size is reducing very 
rapidly.
<P>
	Bill C-66 addresses the problem of replacement workers. There 
was a very excellent report entitled ``Seeking a Balance''. It 
reviewed the Canada Labour Code. I commend this document to 
people who are interested in the economic situation vis-à-vis 
labour unions in Canada. It is an excellent review and an excellent 
analysis.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	It addresses the problem where corporations have the desire to 
break unions because of market forces. This tempts companies to 
confront labour unions and to even lock them out. Then there is the 
danger of very bitter and brutal strikes and ultimately the 
destruction of particular unions. Because there is so much labour in 
the marketplace, it is a real danger that companies can replace the 
unionized workforce with scab labour. That is not a good thing 
either.
<P>
	Instead of banning replacement workers entirely, as was done in 
1993 in Ontario, and as laws exist right now in British Columbia 
and Quebec, Bill C-66 provides that a company facing strike action 
can bring replacement workers on board for the duration of the 
strike as long as it is made very clear that it is not trying to do so as 
an attempt to break the union.
<P>
	After the labour dispute has been settled, Bill C-66 requires a 
company that has used replacement workers to hire back the 
unionized employees. That avoids a situation where a company 
may deliberately try to break a strike by using replacement workers 
and then hiring the replacement workers after the strike.
<P>
	The legislation takes a very positive step in addressing the 
conflicting pressures of the union movement that is faced with 
these overwhelming global market pressures which try to reduce 
the effectiveness of the unions.
<P>
	This is the kind of balance that the Liberal government in its 
wisdom is able to strike between the very conservative political 
right which would see the elimination of most labour unions and 
the very left of the left, the left wing of the spectrum which has 
over past years created a situation where unions have more power 
than is in the interests of Canada's competitive situation. I really 
endorse that aspect.
<P>
	I would like to add one other remark about a very positive aspect 
of the legislation. It addresses a past problem involving grain 
handling at our ports. Situations have arisen in the past where the 
country was literally held to ransom when our ports were shut 
down, not by the transportation unions alone, but by affiliated 
unions, some very small unions on occasion, that have set up picket 
lines. Of course other union organizations respect  these picket 
lines and on occasion it led to the paralysis of our ability move 
valuable commodities.
<P>
	The provision in the bill which limits the right to strike, to 
paralyze ports, to those unions directly engaged in that form of 
activity is a very positive one.
<P>
	I hope that members on all sides of the House will see fit to 
support the bill. It is a very good bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, labour ministers have been coming and going for three 
years, and they have all promised us a renewed Canada Labour 
Code. It was supposed to be a little marvel.
<P>
	Well, a few weeks ago, the minister finally delivered this little 
marvel. The bill is not all bad, but it certainly is no marvel. Some 
aspects of the bill are what we could call an improvement, but 
others are deficient. Let us look first at something that I have 
noticed as being a small improvement.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	I am talking here about the recognition of the family residence as 
a place of work. We have to live in 1996. We are approaching the 
21st century. Things have changed and it has become normal. It is a 
good thing that the government has thought of including this in the 
Canada Labour Code. Such a decision must have been inspired by 
certain speeches from members of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	It is important that the Canada Labour Code create a balance of 
power. I was listening to my colleagues opposite who were praising 
the newly tabled bill. They were saying that, finally, there was a 
balance of power, continually claiming that the balance that existed 
before had even been improved.
<P>
	A few moments ago, when talking about the antiscab legislation 
in Quebec, a member even said that it was out of date, that we had 
to live in 1996 and that the labour environment had changed. It is 
sad to hear these kinds of things. We know that the antiscab 
legislation has been in force in Quebec since 1977 and that this 
province keeps getting good results with regard to the length and 
the contents of negotiations.
<P>
	Everybody is happy, including unions and management, because 
strikes do not last as long. Everybody is happy. We must not forget 
that, when there is a strike, there is a picket line, of course, but 
these people on the picket line have families, spouses, children. 
Families are affected by a strike, and the impact then extends to 
businesses, services, etc.
<P>
	I will not enumerate all those affected by a strike, but the impact 
goes far beyond the striking workers. It is often said that they are 
spoiled children earning $12 an hour who want $13 and therefore 
go on strike for 6 months. It is much more than that. People who go 
on strike are seeking a better quality of life.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6427"> 6427 </A></B>
<P>
	A strike is a balance of power. If provisions are not added to 
the Canada Labour Code prohibiting replacement workers, it is 
a sign that the balance of power is being ignored, that it is 
acceptable for one of the parties to be stronger than the other.
<P>
	And then they wonder why there is violence on picket lines, why 
people are frustrated. When there is no balance of power, people 
are frustrated. It is only normal, people are like that. In a nutshell, 
the Liberal government's complete lack of will to ban replacement 
workers is the most important weakness in this reform. It is 
obvious that there is no will to do anything about the issue. I will 
come back to this later.
<P>
	Another aspect not often mentioned is the minister's powers. 
The Sims report recommended taking away some of the minister's 
powers, but this bill adds to them instead. In addition to some 
fifteen possible interventions by the minister in the bargaining 
process, another one is added: the power to order a union to hold a 
vote on the employer's latest offers. Nobody else, just the union. 
This is interference in the administration of the central labour body 
affected by the conflict. In my opinion, this is really biased. It 
comes close to being-I will not use the word-but I will say that it 
is biased, to be very nice.
<P>
	Where does it say in the Canada Labour Code that the minister 
can force a company to act on sincere offers from the union? The 
underlying theme is always that the union is dishonest. It may well 
happen that a union is dishonest. An employer could be as well, but 
there is still a marked imbalance here.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	I am afraid I am running out of time, so I will concentrate on my 
next point, which is that the minister denied a request by the Public 
Service Alliance of Canada to be regulated by the Canada Labour 
Code and not by the Public Service Staff Relations Act. We could 
also add the RCMP, the only police force in this country-and there 
are a lot of people in this country, 27 million-which does not have 
the right to unionize. Talk about image! Their horses might have a 
better chance of joining a union than they would. This does not 
make sense. After all, this is 1996.
<P>
	Earlier, I heard members say that in 1977, Quebec's legislation 
was rather obsolete. I just want to read to you a recommendation 
concerning Canada Post. As you know, negotiations are taking 
place at this time. Now this is what could happen without anti-scab 
provisions. ``Recommendation No. 15, that if the collective 
bargaining process does not produce the necessary adjustments 
without interruption of service-I am talking about postal 
services-the government be prepared to take appropriate steps to 
protect the immediate public interest and ensure the long term 
financial viability of a strategically repositioned Canada Post 
Corporation''.
<P>
	Adding this to the Canada Labour Code means that Canada Post 
could hire scabs at any time, and we know what the consequences 
have been in the past. It is a mystery to me why they still fail to 
understand the risks involved in hiring scabs. But 
Recommendation No. 15 is clear: if you do not accept, we have the 
right to hire scabs, and we will. This is highly unusual.
<P>
	One last point, because I know my time is running out. Right 
next door we have Bradson Mercantile which provides security 
services for the government in buildings scattered all over Hull and 
Ottawa. Its employees are now on strike. Scabs were hired to 
replace them. So what happened recently? It is just not done, but I 
feel I must tell you about it. Employees attended a meeting where 
they were told that a vote would be held to find out whether they 
were in favour of going back to work. And imagine, 30 scabs were 
there to vote as well. Seventeen people voted in favour of going 
back to work.
<P>
	This means that some scabs voted against these people going 
back to work. That is what can happen under the Canada Labour 
Code when there is no anti-scab bill. Of course these scabs voted 
against the employees' going back to work, as their livelihoods 
depend on the lack of an agreement between the parties. They came 
to influence the vote because if the other people went back to work 
and the dispute was resolved, they would lose their jobs. So they 
took part in the vote. This is serious.
<P>
	The government turns a blind eye to this kind of abuse, as far as 
the Canada Labour Code is concerned, to allow workers to 
establish what the hon. member for Mercier referred to earlier as 
``l'équilibre des forces''. It should not be a privilege but a right. 
Fairness and balance should be what the Canada Labour Code is all 
about. But it is not, and there are many cases of abuse like the 
examples I just gave you and those my colleagues gave you this 
morning.
<P>
	In concluding, I am disappointed because of certain 
shortcomings in the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, today 
I would like to discuss the proposed amendments to part I of the 
Canada Labour Code and how important they are to the workers 
they apply to. These amendments as outlined in Bill C-66 will have 
some enduring benefits to this important player, the employee, in 
the rapidly changing labour scenario.
<P>
	The amendments are based on recommendations made by the 
task force on the review of the Canada Labour Code. In its report, 
``Seeking a Balance'', the task force strove to find a balance 
between competing interests including those of labour and 
management.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6428"> 6428 </A></B>
<P>
	The amendments we are discussing today serve to update the 
existing federal labour law and in no way radically alter the 
existing Canada Labour Code. Yet they will, I believe, serve the 
interests of working Canadians.
<P>
	Part I of the Canada Labour Code applies to the approximately 
700,000 workers and their employers in the federal private sector. 
These include the men and women who serve in our banks, keep 
our airlines safe and punctual, and physically move our volumes of 
grain exports on to the ships that come in for example to Halifax 
harbour. They are part of the group of workers who keep this 
country moving.
<P>
	What are the concerns of this important group of workers? Apart 
from some issues specific to the particular industries they work for, 
their requirements as employees are no different from those of 
other industries and other employees. For instance, they want 
stability. They want to be able to exercise some of their democratic 
rights, such as the right to organize. They want to be able to have 
their voices heard in the workplace to ensure their viewpoints are 
heard and understood. These are factors central to the amendments.
<P>
	One thing that will not change with these amendments is the 
continuing ability to engage in collective bargaining. It is an 
essential that has to remain. This right of workers and employers to 
organize and bargain collectively is central to any democratic 
society with a market based economy.
<P>
	I am reminded of the book <I>The Company Store</I> which is well 
known in my area of the country. It talks about how in the 1920s the 
workers in the coal mines of Cape Breton were treated terribly by 
the coal mining companies, like Dominion Coal Company. It gives 
a very strong case for why we do need to have collective bargaining 
in our country and why workers' rights are so important to defend.
<P>
	There may be those who feel at times that the unions today have 
become very strong, but if we look at the history we can see why 
we have to have the collective bargaining process. It is important 
that workers' rights be protected.
<P>
	Collective bargaining is fundamental to the Canada Labour 
Code. For employees it ensures they get a fair and adequate reward 
for their labour and that they are able to participate as equals in 
determining policies that affect them in direct and significant ways.
<P>
	Our existing collective bargaining system has served Canada 
well. Both employees and employers said that to the task force. It is 
our expectation that these amendments will allow it to continue to 
enhance co-operation between and among the respective parties.
<P>
	Some of the key amendments that will be important to the 
employee include the following:
<P>
	There is the establishment of a representational Canada 
industrial relations board. The chairperson and vice-chairpersons 
of this new board will be neutral and it will include equal 
representation of employees and employers. This will make the 
board more responsive to the community it is intended to serve. 
Formerly the Canada Labour Relations Board was 
non-representational. This new development will reflect more 
accurately the changing face of the Canadian workforce.
<P>
	The board's remedial powers will be expanded to ensure good 
faith bargaining. The board will be given the power and the 
flexibility to deal quickly with routine or urgent matters.
<P>
	Proposed amendments are also aimed at speeding up 
certification and decertification processes. They will protect 
employee rights where there is a change from provincial to federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Currently the code does not provide for continued recognition of 
bargaining agents and collective agreements in cases where a 
contract for services is transferred to a new employer as a result of 
contract re-tendering. This has resulted in the loss of remuneration 
and employment at the end of each contract period for workers 
employed by contractors in the air transport sector, which is 
important for instance at Halifax international airport in my riding 
of Halifax West. Many of the workers in the air transport sector are 
women and immigrants. Such successive contractors would now be 
required to pay employees equivalent remuneration. This is a very 
important amendment.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	This proposal intends to deter competition based on who can pay 
the lowest wages. This will create a level playing field for 
contractors whose employees are unionized with those who are not, 
and it will help to reduce turnover rates, an important consideration 
for all of us in these challenging times. I know even here we are 
concerned about turnover rates.
<P>
	With the growth of non-standard employment in Canada, 
particularly home based employment, attention has to be paid to 
ensuring that these workers are also a party to the benefits of 
collective bargaining. Most home based workers are women. It is 
estimated that two-thirds of home based workers are employed by 
an organization located elsewhere.
<P>
	While the home based work arrangement has advantages for 
many people, others find themselves in a vulnerable situation 
unable to acquire the traditional employment benefits. For this 
reason we have included amendments proposing that the board 
have the discretion to grant an authorized representative of a labour 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6429"> 6429 </A></B>
<P>
union a list of the names and addresses of employees who normally 
work in locations other than the employer's premises.
<P>
	The union will therefore have access to off site employees on the 
condition that the privacy and security of off site workers are 
protected. The industrial relations board can indicate conditions 
and in a particular case for instance can say: ``We are going to give 
you this kind of information so you can access the people using a 
way that is suitable in the circumstances so that the privacy and 
security of the people in their homes are protected''.
<P>
	As the minister said in his speech, one of his main goals was to 
bring an orderly process to industrial relations in Canada. 
Therefore some amendments clarify the rights and obligations of 
the parties during a legal work stoppage. The use of replacement 
workers during a legal strike has always been a very contentious 
issue. For as long as I can recall, labour and management have held 
opposite positions on this issue.
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the consultation process did not succeed in 
reaching a consensus on replacement workers. This split appeared 
also in the Sims task force where a member tabled a minority 
report. In the end the minister and the government had to decide, 
and they did. They chose a moderate, fair and equitable formula 
based on the good faith of the parties.
<P>
	There is no general edict forbidding the use of replacement 
workers during a legal strike. However their use for the purpose of 
undermining a union's representative capacity would be considered 
as an unfair labour practice. The union can refer the case to the 
Canada industrial relations board. If the board determines a 
violation has occurred, it can order the employer to stop using 
replacements for the duration of the dispute.
<P>
	The amendments also confirm the right of employees in the 
bargaining unit who are on strike or locked out to resume 
employment following a work stoppage in preference to any 
persons hired to replace them. Another critical feature for 
employees is that they will be entitled to maintain insurance and 
benefits programs during work stoppages.
<P>
	These then are some of the key amendments that will affect 
workers under part I of the labour code. The legislation also 
addresses management's interest and is indeed fair and balanced in 
its approach and aims. Its aim of enhanced co-operation should 
lead to improved productivity, better job security and increased 
worker participation in workplace decisions. This is good for 
Canadian workers and it is good for Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-66 which amends 
the Canada Labour Code. This is a fair, balanced and extremely 
credible piece of legislation and I am proud to support it.
<P>
	Bill C-66 is the culmination of extensive consultations with 
interested parties across Canada. Public consultations began about 
two years ago with preliminary  discussions with the labour 
movement and business groups. These discussions identified major 
areas of agreement and disagreement concerning possible 
amendments to part I of the Canada Labour Code. Following these 
preliminary discussions, a task force of exceptionally able and 
credible labour relations experts was established to examine part I 
of the code and to make recommendations to the minister.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	The task force was led by Andrew Sims, QC, and its other 
members were Paula Knopf and Rodrigue Blouin. The task force 
held public consultations in Halifax, Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, 
Edmonton, Montreal and Winnipeg. More than 90 written 
submissions were received from close to 50 groups and 
individuals, including the Canadian Labour Congress, the 
Canadian Federation of Labour, the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce and the Federally Regulated Employers group.
<P>
	In most of the cities it visited, the task force also met informally 
with labour lawyers and labour law administrators. The task force 
held full day meetings at the universities of Laval, Toronto and 
Calgary which provided academic experts in labour law and 
administration an opportunity to express their opinions.
<P>
	The task force also benefited from the work of the 
labour-management consensus group made up of representatives 
from the Canadian Labour Congress, the Confederation of National 
Trade Unions, the Canadian Federation of Labour, the Federally 
Regulated Employers-Transportation and Communication, the 
Western Grain Elevator Association and the Canadian Bankers' 
Association. The work of this group was important in identifying 
issues and areas in which consensus was possible.
<P>
	The task force produced its report, including extensive 
recommendations, early this year. A final round of consultations 
involved meetings the minister held in April with representatives 
of labour, management and other groups in Vancouver, Regina, St. 
John's, Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa. These meetings gave the 
minister a chance to hear in person reactions to the 
recommendations of the task force.
<P>
	An important conclusion of the Sims task force was that the 
Canada Labour Code is generally accepted by the labour and 
management groups as a viable framework which has facilitated 
collective bargaining in the federally regulated private sector. The 
workplace to which the code applies has been subject to a number 
of significant changes in recent years, however.
<P>
	Privatization of government services has meant the transfer of 
some jobs to the private sector regulated by the code. Deregulation 
policies such as open skies and the elimination of the Crow rate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6430"> 6430 </A></B>
<P>
have changed the conditions of the competition in a number of 
industries regulated by the code.
<P>
	This had a direct impact on collective bargaining as unions and 
management have realized that a work stoppage can have a serious 
impact on market share and profitability. Changes in trade policies, 
the adoption of new technologies and changing market conditions 
have also had significant effects on federally regulated private 
sectors.
<P>
	In the face of these changes, unions have generally been on the 
defensive, employers have pressed for industrial change and the 
very existence of collective bargaining has come under some 
scrutiny.
<P>
	I reject the view that collective bargaining is no longer relevant. 
Canada has benefited greatly from the collective bargaining 
process. The freedom of workers and employers to organize and 
bargain collectively is a cornerstone of our democratic, market 
based society. It is the means by which labour rates are fairly 
established. It ensures stability, predictability and efficiency. In 
times of dramatic economic change, globalization and new trading 
blocs, an efficient, effective and a responsive collective bargaining 
system is essential.
<P>
	I believe that we are beginning to see a new level of co-operation 
between management and labour. We are seeing the flattening of 
organizations and the emergence of new styles of negotiation. The 
members of the Sims task force recognized that if such 
co-operation is to grow a balance must be found between a number 
of competing objectives. A balance must be found between social 
and economic goals. Work is a form of personal expression and a 
source of social security. Yet many businesses continue to export 
jobs in pursuit of profits. A balance must also be found between 
instruments of labour policy. Protection of freedom of association, 
for example, must be balanced against property rights. A balance 
must be found between rights and responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	While our system of collective bargaining conveys certain rights 
to management and labour it is also based on the expectation that 
labour and management will meet their responsibility to bargain 
fairly and in good faith.
<P>
	Finally, a balance must be found between collective bargaining 
and public interest.
<P>
	Bill C-66 is a balanced and fair piece of legislation which takes 
these dramatic changes into account, which recognizes the need to 
balance competing objectives and which will ensure that the code 
continues to operate effectively into the next century.
<P>
	I would like to use the rest of my time to focus on aspects of the 
legislation which would include efficient administration of part I of 
the code.
<P>
	Bill C-66 would significantly improve administration of part I of 
the code by restructuring the Canada Labour  Relations Board. The 
non-representational CLRB would be replaced with the 
representational Canada industrial relations board. The new board 
would be made up of a neutral chair and vice-chairs with equal 
number of board members representing labour and management 
groups.
<P>
	This would increase the confidence of those appearing before the 
board that their case is fully understood and properly reviewed. 
Decisions made by the board, especially those involving the 
exercise of the board's discretion, would be more credible in the 
eyes of both labour and management.
<P>
	The appointment of part time regional members who are 
representative of labour and management will significantly 
improve the cost effectiveness of the board, give the board access 
to the expertise of persons who are active in labour relations and 
improve links between the board and the labour relations 
community.
<P>
	Measures to reorganize the board contained in Bill C-66 would 
also make it more flexible, allowing it to respond more quickly to 
both routine and emergency issues. Rather than a three member 
panel, for example, a single vice-chair would be able to resolve 
some cases. In some cases such as preliminary motions or requests 
for the extension of time limits this simply makes sense. Access to 
the board would be enhanced by a repeal of the provision that 
requires parties to obtain ministerial consent before filing an 
allegation of bad faith bargaining. This would be particularly 
significant in cases where an immediate board hearing is needed to 
break a deadlock in negotiations.
<P>
	Bill C-66 would give grievance arbitrators a number of 
important new procedural powers. This is necessity because the 
arbitration process has become more and more complex. The 
amendments will make the arbitration process more flexible and 
efficient and are an important step in ensuring that grievance 
arbitration is reserved for the resolution of disputes that parties 
cannot resolve on their own.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I am sorry, but 
your time has expired.
<P>

pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak on the motion that this House give second 
reading to and concur in the amendment made by the Senate to Bill 
C-42, an act to amend the Judges Act and to make consequential 
amendments to another act.
<P>
	As hon. members will recall, Bill C-42 received third reading in 
this Chamber on June 18, 1996. In the Senate the government 
moved and the Senate agreed to an amendment to one clause of the 
bill, clause 5, which was passed by this House. It was a provision of 
general application regarding international activities of federally 
appointed judges.
<P>
	The original purpose of the clause was to clarify the terms on 
which judges could engage in activities abroad, such as technical 
assistance projects in developing countries. It would have changed 
the existing law by allowing judges who participated in such 
activities, with the authorization of Canada, to receive expenses 
directly from an international organization.
<P>
	The original clause 5 would also have established a framework 
within which judges could, with the authorization of Canada, work 
for an international organization of states or an institution thereof. 
Such a judge could, with the approval of the governor in council 
and after consultation with the chairman of the Canadian Judicial 
Council, request a leave of absence without pay in order to be paid 
directly by the international organization.
<P>
	During the consideration of Bill C-42 in the Senate certain 
concerns were expressed about the implications for judicial 
independence of certain aspects of clause 5. It became evident that 
to obtain passage of the bill without further delay, the government 
had to agree to amend clause 5 to restrict its application to one 
specific case, that of Madam Justice Louise Arbour.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	As hon. members will recall, Madam Justice Arbour of the 
Ontario Court of Appeal had been appointed by unanimous 
resolution of the United Nations Security Council following the 
recommendation of the UN secretary-general to the position of 
chief prosecutor of the United Nations war crimes tribunals for the 
former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. For independence reasons the UN 
insists that the chief prosecutor not receive his or her salary and 
expenses from a member state but instead directly from the United 
Nations.
<P>
	Clause 5, as passed by the House in June, reflected sound policy 
and practical considerations and fully respected the principle of 
judicial independence. By moving an amendment to clause 5 in the 
Senate, the government did not accept that the arguments of those 
who said that clause 5 as originally worded would have threatened 
judicial independence.
<P>
	The government moved its amendment for the sole and simple 
reason that it saw no other way to proceed quickly with the bill. The 
Senate's amendment to clause 5 would specifically authorize 
Madam Justice Arbour alone to take a leave of absence for the 
purpose of serving as the chief prosecutor of the UN war crimes 
tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
<P>
	It would also permit her to elect to leave without pay and to 
receive salary and expenses directly from the UN in connection 
with her service as the chief prosecutor. In other words, by this 
amendment, clause 5 would cease to be a general amendment to 
cover the use of Canadian judges for international activities.
<P>
	I would add that while the Canadian Judicial Council would have 
preferred to see the passage of clause 5 as originally approved by 
the House, the council has no objection to the amended version of 
this clause.
<P>
	Bill C-42 would permit Madam Justice Arbour to respond to the 
request of the United Nations secretary-general and the security 
council to take on an international assignment of enormous 
importance to the world at large. They are counting on Canada to 
undertake the necessary measures to allow her to serve in 
accordance with reasonable and understandable needs of the UN.
<P>
	Certainly all Canadians can be proud that one of our citizens, one 
of our judges, is representing this country and indeed the world at 
large in such an important forum. Therefore, I urge hon. members 
to approve the  Senate's amendment to clause 5 of Bill C-42 as 
quickly as possible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6432"> 6432 </A></B>
<P>
	All other aspects of Bill C-42 as passed by the House in June 
remain unchanged. The bill would transfer from cabinet to chief 
justices the authority to approve judicial leaves of absence of up to 
six months as recommended by the last two triennial commissions 
on judges' salaries and benefits and endorsed by the Canadian 
Judicial Council.
<P>
	The bill recognizes the importance of the Court Martial Appeal 
Court of Canada by including the chief justice of that court on the 
membership of the Canadian Judicial Council and authorizes the 
payment of a modest accountable representational allowance of up 
to $5,000 per year to the head of that court.
<P>
	The chief justices of the courts of appeal of the Yukon and the 
Northwest Territories would also be granted similar 
representational allowances.
<P>
	Bill C-42 would also permit the appointments of up to three 
additional judges Canada-wide to the provincial courts of appeal 
which have been experiencing increasing workloads and backlogs 
over the past number of years.
<P>
	It is the minister's stated opinion to recommend that two of these 
new appointments be made to the British Columbia Court of 
Appeal which needs more judges to deal with its workload and one 
to the Ontario Court of Appeal to replace Madam Justice Arbour.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Finally, the bill would correct some of the technical errors and 
clarify some ambiguous language that exists in the Judges Act. 
Therefore, I call on all hon. members to support these changes to 
the Judges Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today on this bill as official 
opposition justice critic, given that Bill C-42 has already been 
debated in this House and sent subsequently to the Senate. It has 
been returned to this House as the result of certain changes the 
Senate wanted to see in the bill.
<P>
	I think that, to properly understand the full implications of the 
changes proposed by the Senate, we must at least look to see 
whether the bill initially met certain requirements and whether it 
followed due legislative process: that is, first, second and third 
reading.
<P>
	Did the government, the official opposition and the third party 
seriously vet this bill to see if it required changing? Was Bill C-42 
studied in committee? Was each clause studied by the 
parliamentary committee of members elected to this House? Was it 
passed at report stage?
<P>
	The answer to all these questions is yes. Bill C-42 passed 
through all these stages. Those who received a very clear mandate 
from the people and who are in the  House of Commons analyzed 
Bill C-42 and passed it. Yes, under the present system, this bill 
must go to the other House, the Senate. Why? Because that is the 
way it is, because that is the way the system works.
<P>
	However, we must not take away the essence of the bill when it 
comes back to us. I think that Bill C-42 as passed by the House of 
Commons achieved the objectives that were set. It revolves around 
four main points, on the basis of which the members of this House 
decided this was indeed a good bill, one that should be passed.
<P>
	I tried to understand the Senate's changes and I think that, for the 
people watching us, following the debates to some extent, to have 
some understanding of the Senate's changes, they must at least be 
familiar with the four main ideas behind Bill C-42.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois supported the bill for many reasons. 
There was, among other things, a series of provisions which 
created new positions for judges. As we know, the present law 
allows the Canadian provinces and Quebec to create seven 
additional positions. With the change proposed in Bill C-42, which 
was passed by the House, legislative assemblies in each province 
can now decide, if necessary, to increase from seven to ten the 
number of additional judges.
<P>
	Given what the provinces are experiencing, given what Quebec, 
Ontario and other provinces are experiencing, given the court 
delays, given the workload of judges, this change was normal. This 
has to be left alone. It was passed by this House.
<P>
	There was also a series of clerical and wording changes. It was 
normal to update this law, to make it fairer. Judges were granted 
leaves of absence in order to ensure their independence. This is a 
very important criterion if we are to properly assess the changes 
proposed by the Senate, which must be approved by the House of 
Commons.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-42 included a new paragraph requiring the approval of the 
Governor in Council only for leaves of absence of more than six 
months. At the present time, his approval is required for leaves of 
absence of a month or more. If a judge wanted a leave of absence of 
one month, he had to submit a request to the Governor in Council.
<P>
	This change was to keep away the executive branch, to keep 
judges' decisions free from any political intervention. It was a 
deliberate choice, a very important change for the Canadian legal 
system, for the Quebec legal system. We welcomed this change and 
we supported it in this House.
<P>
	The fourth amendment provided for in Bill C-42, which was 
quite new, and met a need in today's world, but which has been 
directly impacted by what came back to us this morning from the 
Senate, was the possibility for a judge, with the government's 
authorization, to take  part in legal activities at the international 
level. Until now, judges had to devote themselves exclusively to 
their judicial duties. There exists, furthermore, a tradition requiring 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6433"> 6433 </A></B>
<P>
judges to avoid involvement in situations that could oblige them to 
take a stand in public. Bill C-42 therefore represents a departure 
from our legal tradition in that it would allow judges to take part in 
international activities. But this was a good thing, since Bill C-42, 
which was duly passed in the House of Commons, set out very 
clearly how this was to be allowed.
<P>
	This bill also rightly provided that a judge could not be paid 
twice. In other words, if a judge took on international duties, during 
that time he could not be on paid leave nor receive any kind of 
remuneration from the country where he had been appointed a 
judge.
<P>
	Clearly, as a whole, the amendments in Bill C-42 met a national 
need, an immediate need, a need of those involved, as well as an 
international need given the major conflicts and international trials 
we are faced with nowadays on a regular basis. In a sense, the bill 
was a response to the needs of the international community.
<P>
	This bill was carefully reviewed by a team of experienced 
researchers as part of a thorough analysis, and it was decided that 
the bill should be passed without amendments, that certain 
comments should be made in committee, but the elected 
representatives decided very democratically to pass Bill C-42 this 
way.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of my analysis, in Canada, we have 
another House, a non-elected House, some of whose members I 
could describe as slightly out of touch with reality, it is a fact, 
people who occasionally nod off, lulled by the sounds of party 
politics. One morning, in a fleeting moment of wakefulness, a 
senator said: ``Fear not, we shall not let this bill pass without 
amendments. We will amend it for the sake of justifying the money 
we make here at the Senate. At least part of the $43 million spent 
yearly on the Senate must be justified''.
<P>
	The senators decided to take a specific example. They said: ``Let 
us amend Bill C-42 in a specific fashion, taking one judge in 
particular. This way, every time judges want to get involved on the 
international scene, they will have to start all over, going first 
before the House of Commons, then before the Senate. This will 
give us a little work to do. It will give us a chance to poke our noses 
into these matters, and make amendments. It will be great fun''. So, 
to a large extent, the Senate basically considers the general idea 
behind this bill as a specific case, and decided to amend it to have it 
apply only to the case of Madam Justice Arbour from the Court of 
Appeal of Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Some of our listeners, including the Liberals across the way, may 
think that the Bloc is trying to protect some Quebecer. The fact is 
we are do advocate the principle of independence. But in this case, 
where the Liberals condone, to some extent, the attitude of the 
Senate, the person involved is a judge from the Ontario court of 
appeal.
<P>
	This amendment has been sent to us after the House of 
Commons went through a clear and comprehensive process: first, 
second and third readings, not to mention a clause by clause review 
in committee, and report stage. Now we have to start all over again; 
we have to review the nice amendments made by the Senate. But 
what prompted the Senate, if not partisan considerations, to make 
amendments such as these?
<P>
	I decided to have some fun. I rarely do this, but I read the great 
philosophical debates of the other place. Once in a while, we 
should read what senators have to say on a particular issue.
<P>
	I read the <I>Debates of the Senate</I> for Monday, October 28, for 
November 7, and for October 22, 1996, to see what senators had to 
say on Bill C-42. I must say I was very surprised by the depth of the 
senators' review, by the seriousness with which they reviewed the 
legislation, and particularly by the sources that prompted them to 
propose amendments.
<P>
	In the case of one senator, whom I will not name, out of respect 
for her, one such source is the infamous gossip magazine <I>Frank</I>. 
The senator said: ``Listen, in Ms. Arbour's case it does not make 
sense. We have to make a specific amendment''. The October 23 
issue of the gossip magazine <I>Frank</I> carried an article on Madam 
Justice Arbour's friends in high places. It stated: ``Ms. Arbour has 
many friends and allies to boost her to the top- It was Goldstone 
who finessed Arbour's appointment through the United Nations. In 
Canada, the deal was stick-handled through judicial circles by her 
common-law husband, the sebaceous deputy attorney-general of 
Ontario, Larry Taman''.
<P>
	The senator relied on this gossip magazine, this rag and the 
article published in it to say that a specific amendment had to be 
made to Bill C-42 to deal with the appointment of Madam Justice 
Arbour. Can that be the only evaluation criterion by which one can 
determine if a bill coming from the House of Commons, which is 
composed of democratically elected members, must, yes or no, be 
amended? Every four or five years, we go before the people to get 
elected. I find it hard to believe that a senator with such great 
intellectual capacity, one who likes to quote <I>Frank</I>, would be 
prepared to stand for re-election now and then.
<P>
	The same senator went on to say, in her analysis: ``I am informed 
that Justice Arbour's contracted salary with the United Nations is 
US$250,000 tax free with, in addition, many more hundreds of 
thousands in expenses. With remuneration like that, Canadian 
judicial benches will soon be empty if Canadian judges are 
permitted to roam internationally in procurement of such 
employment and remuneration''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6434"> 6434 </A></B>
<P>
	Still, why should it matter to senators that such a person should 
earn US$250,000.? If the senator is afraid that judicial benches 
will soon be empty, since there would surely be judges who would 
decide to work internationally, she has nothing to worry about.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I believe the Minister of Justice and the Government of Canada 
would be only too happy to appoint their good friends to the bench. 
Good? We know very well that, at the federal level, these are 
political appointments. But, up until now, even though these 
appointees have been friends of the government, I have no 
complaints, at least as far as Quebec is concerned. Having practised 
law before becoming a member of Parliament, I saw that the judges 
were quite competent, after all.
<P>
	When the Conservatives are in power, all the judges are Tories, 
and when the Liberals are in power, all the judges are Liberals, but 
that is part of the game, as we say in my part of the country.
<P>
	But let us be clear. Let us reassure the senators so that they are 
not worried or afraid. We will always find judges, we will always 
find very competent and well trained persons for the bench. The 
walls of the temple of Canadian justice shall not crumble because 
one, two or three judges decide to serve on an international tribunal 
and put their knowledge at the service of the world community. I 
thought that only one senator thought this way, but I read on and, 
unfortunately, there is more than one.
<P>
	There is another senator who is a former member of this House. 
He was appointed to the Senate by the previous government. He 
says that there must be an amendment. He approved of the 
proposed amendment and said: ``Listen, the independence of the 
judiciary is one of the principles that all Canadian parliamentarians 
must strive to protect and advocate''. This is profound and it is true. 
He thought long and hard before coming to that conclusion.
<P>
	``The independence of the judiciary is one of the last defences 
for the respect of democratic values in this country''. When a 
non-elected senator speaks of democratic values in defence of an 
amendment proposed by the Senate itself, I think this goes against 
the very principle of independence he claims to be promoting.
<P>
	In Canada, we have written rules, unwritten rules, customs, and 
what not. The Minister of Justice or his parliamentary secretary 
must certainly know that there is an unwritten rule that says that 
Parliament should never adopt a bill for one specific judge. Never. 
To do otherwise is to go against the independence of the executive 
branch and of the courts.
<P>
	I know that this is not meant to be a specific legislation, that Bill 
C-42 is not about Madam Justice Louise Arbour, but by bringing a 
specific amendment, by changing the spirit of a provision to make 
it specific to a particular case in order to solve a problem, I think 
the Senate is making this a specific legislation.
<P>
	I think it is dangerous and deplorable that the government has 
decided to give up its powers because of the wishes of the other 
place. The government had taken a stand in Bill C-42. It had clearly 
stated its position. However, for considerations that nobody else 
knows, it has decided to yield to the Senate to amend the legislation 
and, indirectly, to undermine a recognized principle.
<P>
	During the debate on Bill C-42, many things were said about 
impartiality, about the appointment of judges and about the whole 
legal system within which this legislation must be viewed. I will 
not repeat them.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	However, if the government is using the Senate to amend a piece 
of legislation, to bring amendments to a bill or to parts of a bill 
because of things it had not noticed, it is cause for concern. I do not 
think this is the case. I know the Minister of Justice. We can agree 
or disagree with his position in certain matters, including his 
decision to refer to the Supreme Court a matter of a very political 
nature affecting Quebec, we can disagree with some of his 
decisions, but I think the justice minister is a man who knows his 
bills inside out.
<P>
	He is a man who, before making a decision, has the bill analyzed 
by his advisers, by his team of researchers, by experienced lawyers. 
And only then does he decide to table a bill. It has been discussed, 
he changed his position. The bill was passed after it is discussed, 
after the government and the opposition parties debated it.
<P>
	I think that it is unthinkable that, in 1996, the Senate can force 
the government to backtrack on an issue as important as that of the 
independence of the courts.
<P>
	I say to the government and its representatives that they are on 
the wrong track, they should not do this. Instead, they should make 
the Senate toe the line on this sort of issue. In this case, we are not 
in agreement with the Liberal government, the Canadian 
government, on this amendment. In fact, if I had not afraid that it 
would be interpreted as opposition to Bill C-42, I would have asked 
the House not to approve the bill at second and third reading. But as 
for the substance, as I said earlier, we are in agreement with Bill 
C-42.
<P>
	As the opposition party, we are against the amendment made by 
the Senate through the government. We will therefore be voting 
against this amendment.
<P>
	I urge the government to do its homework over again. I urge the 
government to consult its lawyers, researchers and special advisers 
a second time. I urge the government to do its homework over 
again, to take another look at the bill, so that it knows exactly what 
the situation is on this extremely important issue, so that we have 
legislation that is clear and that does not encourage judges to leave  
Canada. That is not what the Bloc Quebecois wants. We want 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6435"> 6435 </A></B>
<P>
legislation that is clear. We want judges to know the rules ahead of 
time, and if a judge has expertise in a certain field and would like to 
be useful at the international level by being seconded to a court 
outside his jurisdiction, I think we should encourage that with 
legislation that is clear.
<P>
	There should be a fair and equitable process for all individuals 
who would like to take advantage of this international experience. 
The amendment proposed by the Senate would make this 
impossible. How each case is evaluated would depend on the 
amount of pressure on the government opposite. I think this is 
disastrous in a society that calls itself democratic and emphasizes 
the independence of the executive and the judiciary.
<P>
	In concluding, I would urge the Minister of Justice to review his 
calculations, if he has done any, to review everything with his legal 
advisers to make the necessary adjustments and in the end decide 
that the amendment proposed by the Senate is bad for the Canadian 
judiciary system and therefore for the Quebec judiciary system.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
been listening to the debate so far and primarily to the speech by 
the hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill River. The speech 
that he read sounded to me as though it was a speech written by the 
Minister of Justice who did not feel it important enough to show up 
here to read it himself. That being said, looking at the content of the 
speech, he urged us to deal with this amendment quickly, that we 
should rush it through in order to facilitate the government's 
agenda. I wonder why the rush.
<P>
	As has been pointed out, there is a problem with Madam Justice 
Louise Arbour, a justice of one of the superior courts in the 
province of Ontario, who is currently on international assignment. I 
believe the rush is to legitimize her current assignment.
<P>
	Section 55 of the Judges Act states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No judge shall, either directly or indirectly, for himself or others, engage in any 
occupation or business other than his judicial duties, but every judge shall devote 
himself exclusively to those judicial duties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We know that Madam Justice Louise Arbour is not devoting 
herself to those judicial duties. She is in actual fact working abroad 
for the United Nations. She has accepted an appointment from the 
United Nations. Hence the rush by the government.
<P>
	Also when we listened to the speech this morning, we learned 
that the Senate had a problem with Bill C-42. As the hon. member 
for Prince Albert-Churchill River stated, in order to get this bill 
through quickly and in order to legitimize Madam Justice Louise 
Arbour's  current dilemma of not being exclusively devoted to her 
duties, the government amended the bill in the Senate and that 
amendment is now back in the House for debate.
<P>
	The member spent some time talking about that amendment. 
However, the interesting thing is that there are two amendments, 
not one but two amendments. If I heard the member correctly, he 
did not mention that there were two amendments. He only dealt 
with one amendment.
<P>
	Let me read the first amendment which the other House has sent 
back for our consideration:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Page 1, preamble: Strike out line 1 and substitute the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the Canadian Judicial Council has been consulted with respect to certain 
provisions of this act, particularly section 5, and agrees with the purpose of section 5;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Canadian Judicial Council is made up of the chief justices 
and is chaired by Chief Justice Lamer of the Supreme Court of 
Canada. That is the highest court in the land and he is the highest 
judge in that court. Perhaps it is not unusual for them to pass 
judgment on legislation before it becomes law, but obviously the 
minister, in the other House, in order to push this legislation 
through as quickly as he could, decided to introduce this new 
preamble which says that the judicial council, which is chaired by 
Chief Justice Lamer, agreed with this particular section of the bill 
and indeed agreed with the entire bill.
<P>
	I want to deal with the appearance of independence and integrity. 
For the record, we all know that Chief Justice Lamer is a man of 
integrity. His reputation is not being disputed in any way, shape or 
form. However, I am calling into question very much the fact that 
the Minister of Justice has put the chief justice in a very awkward 
position by putting this preamble in the bill in the other House and 
which is now being debated here.
<P>
	Why? Quite simply, clause 3 of Bill C-42 confers a benefit on 
the chief justice and his spouse, who also happens to sit on the 
federal bench. As far as we are aware, clause 3 of Bill C-42 confers 
this benefit on the chief justice and his spouse alone. We have 
heard the Minister of Justice say there is one other couple but he 
has not divulged their names. Therefore, we are not sure if there is 
another couple. If there is another couple there is a maximum of 
four, but we do know that there are two. The chief justice and his 
wife benefit by clause 3 of section 2 and could very well benefit to 
a substantial degree.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has written to the chief justice of the 
supreme court asking: ``What do you think of Bill C-42? Do you 
like it?'' He reads Bill C-42 and there is section 3 conferring a 
benefit upon himself. What is he supposed to do? He is put in a 
most difficult and  compromising position, courtesy of the Minister 
of Justice who wrote to him asking what he thought of Bill C-42. 
The integrity of the chief justice of the supreme court has been

compromised by this preamble and this preamble is here by the 
choice of the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The point is that the independence of the judiciary is being 
slighted in the worst way in this odious amendment. And I do say 
odious amendment because what was the chief justice to say? He 
could either concur with the bill and accept the benefit which was 
within the bill. Perhaps he agreed with clause 5 because of the 
benefit. I hope not. As I said, he is a man of integrity and I would 
not question his integrity. But I do question very much that the 
Minister of Justice has placed him in this position. That is why this 
particular amendment must be defeated. If we have any semblance 
of respect for our judiciary, this amendment must be defeated.
<P>
	This morning I rose on a point of order regarding the fact that by 
this amendment this is now a hybrid bill, a public-private bill 
because of the fact that Madam Justice Louise Arbour is being 
specifically mentioned in the amendment.
<P>
	If I can go back to my point on the situation of the chief justice 
being dragged into this bill, I would like to quote from the <I>Alberta 
Report</I> of October 28, 1996, page 27. Professor Morton from the 
University of Calgary was speaking to the Senate committee 
regarding this bill. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Professor Morton instructed senators at length on the importance of judges 
appearing impartial. The Supreme Court ruled in 1984 that impartiality means the 
``absence of bias, actual or perceived''. Earlier this year, the Canadian Judicial 
Council of which Mr. Justice Lamer is the titular head, said the relevant test of 
improper conduct by a judge is whether ``public confidence would be sufficiently 
undermined'' by it''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Comments recently retired University of Toronto political scientist Peter Russell: 
``It is very troubling that a main beneficiary of the change is the chief justice. That 
raises questions of whether there was any communication between him and the 
government. I think the public deserves some answers''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was prior to the amendment to the preamble. Now we know 
there has been communication with the chief justice and this 
perception is now a very, very difficult situation.
<P>
	Returning now to Madam Justice Louise Arbour, I mentioned 
this morning the fact that Madam Justice Louise Arbour's 
exemption from section 55 of the act is rightly the matter of a 
private bill. Again I quote the <I>Alberta Report</I> of October 28, 1996, 
page 27:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Madam Justice Arbour sought and won the UN job herself. Then Mr. Rock agreed 
to amend the Judges Act to allow judges to take unpaid leaves of absence</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If that is not a petition by an individual, a person to have an 
exemption from the law, I do not know what is.
<P>
	I quoted a ruling by a Speaker in the other House and I will quote 
a bit of it again: ``A public bill relates to a  matter of public policy, 
while a private bill relates to a matter of particular interest or 
benefit to a person or persons. A bill containing provisions which 
are essentially a feature of a private bill cannot be introduced as a 
public bill. A bill designed to exempt one person from the 
application of the law is a private bill and not a public bill''.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	It is fairly obvious from reading the <I>Alberta Report</I>. That 
Madam Justice Louise Arbour sought and won the appointment by 
the UN herself and then got the concurrence of the Minister of 
Justice to introduce an exemption to allow her to obtain the 
position seems to be a rather odious way of exempting a person 
from the Judges Act. Independence and integrity are very much 
being called into question here.
<P>
	I am looking at Beauchesne's citation 1055 which talks about 
private bills demanding ``peculiar vigilance, lest public laws be 
lightly set aside for the benefit of particular persons or places''. 
The way that the contents of this bill, which are the appropriate 
subject matter of a private bill, are being passed is certainly not in a 
vigilant process.
<P>
	Therefore I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after ``that'' and 
substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a message be sent to the Senate to acquaint Their Honours that the House disagrees 
with the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-42, an act to amend the Judges 
Act and to make consequential amendments to another act, since Amendment 1 
places the Chairman of the Judicial Council in a conflict of interest and Amendment 
2 has negatived the original intent of Bill C-42 to amend public policy and now 
introduces a waiver to s. 55 of the Judges Act for Madam Justice Louise Arbour, 
which according to the House of Commons rules and practices is properly the 
subject matter of a private bill and thus should not be inserted in a public bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The Chair will 
look at the proposed amendment and will advise the member. The 
hon. member may want to continue with debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> I can continue on, Madam Speaker, if you want to 
have time to rule on whether or not that is an acceptable 
amendment. I certainly hope that you find it is so.
<P>
	Regarding that particular amendment, if I may draw your 
attention to the amendment that I have just given to you, the 
Speaker ruled this morning, and he quoted certain references and 
precedents, that he did not have the authority to amend a message 
from the other place and that the right to amend the message from 
the other place rested with this House. On my point of order which 
asked that the part regarding Madam Justice Louise Arbour be the 
subject matter of a private bill, he felt that the decision had to rest 
with the House rather than with the Chair. I do hope you will agree 
that we can debate the motion and arrive at a conclusion by this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6437"> 6437 </A></B>
<P>
House on whether or not we want to proceed with what is being 
proposed by the Senate as an amendment to Bill C-42.
<P>
	However, continuing on, the concerns that we have regarding 
Madam Justice Louise Arbour cannot be overstated. Again, I 
respect the integrity of Madam Justice Louise Arbour and the work 
she has done on the bench.
<P>
	The point is that while she has the reputation as being an eminent 
jurist and has been selected by the United Nations for this arduous 
work in Brussels, according to the <I>Alberta Report</I> she sought the 
job herself. She was not selected because of her reputation around 
the world. The point is that if she did, this government has 
acquiesced in a most inappropriate manner, in a retrospective 
manner rather than in a proactive manner.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has told the House many times that his 
responsibility is to uphold the rule of law. It is his responsibility to 
uphold the rule of law. We now have a Canadian jurist in another 
country working for the United Nations to uphold international law 
and to prosecute horrendous and horrific crimes. We do not doubt 
the great work that needs to be done over there and we do not 
criticize the fact that it is an honour for a Canadian to prosecute.
<P>
	However, we do concern ourselves with the integrity of the 
judicial system at home. If it requires a waiver of the Judges 
Act-retroactively I might add-for the jurist to go over there to 
uphold the rule of law, we are sending the wrong message. The 
message being sent is that we are prepared to bend and 
retroactively change our laws to allow this to happen when she is 
over there to uphold the law. There is an incongruity which needs to 
be addressed very carefully.
<P>
	The rules of the House have been circumvented somewhat by the 
fact that this was introduced as a public bill, that it passed this 
Chamber as a public bill, is now back before us as a hybrid 
public-private bill which is not allowed by the rules of the House. 
There is division in the House whether we should be circumventing 
the rules in this way. I feel this casts a shadow on the appointment 
of Madam Justice Louise Arbour to fulfil these obligations for the 
United Nations. If the minister had wanted Canada's reputation as a 
prosecutor for justice to go around the world, then he should have 
been more careful in the way he approached the matter.
<P>
	I respect the integrity and the competence of Madam Justice 
Louise Arbour. She is a jurist and in her new job she is to be a 
prosecutor. It means she will be on one side prosecuting the other 
side. I do not dispute the fact that she is prosecuting crimes of a 
horrific nature. But the point is that she is a prosecutor and she 
presumably intends to return to the bench and to that independent, 
impartial position. She has in essence removed herself from that 
independent, impartial position by accepting this position as a 
prosecutor.
<P>
	Again, I am very much concerned that when she returns to the 
bench her impartiality might be challenged. It is a very problematic 
question. I would have hoped that the Minister of Justice would 
have thought that through, discussed it with the other members of 
the House, perhaps even discussed it with members of the other 
Chamber in order that Canada could have made and endorsed this 
appointment in order for Madam Justice Louise Arbour to take up 
these onerous duties and be a shining light for justice around the 
world and for Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it never ceases to amaze me the nonsense that spews from the 
mouths of Reformers on occasion. The nonsense has come forward 
today in relation to this bill, an important bill in a number of 
respects. The bill would allow one of our eminent jurists to do a 
very important international duty, to prosecute war crimes at the 
request of the United Nations.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Canada has always been in the vanguard of justice on the 
international front. It has always stood for integrity and 
responsibility in doing our part to ensure that war crimes are 
punished and that our nation participates in just causes. It is out of 
respect for the reputation of Canada that Canadians are often asked 
to participate in such fora.
<P>
	However, something so good and so noble is being dragged 
through the gutter by the Reform Party. That ought not to surprise 
anybody. If anybody is interfering with judicial independence, it is 
the Reform Party. There is no doubt that Madam Justice Arbour 
will acquit herself and her country well in her new duties. We feel it 
appropriate to bring forward the amendments and allow this to 
happen in accordance with the rules of the United Nations.
<P>
	Another point has been raised by hon. members of the Reform 
Party. They have questioned the integrity of the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court. What is being brought forward in this bill is simply 
an amendment to bring the Judges Act in relations to pensions into 
equality with public service pensions, members of Parliament 
pensions and with other pensions. This amendment has been 
requested for a significant number of years. It has been brought 
forward along with a number of other amendments to the Judges 
Act. It is that simple.
<P>
	The Reform Party questions how many people on the bench are 
married to other judges. There are four couples that we know of in 
that circumstance. There may be more but they are not required to 
report to the Minister of Justice when they fall in love and decide to 
get married. However, something that is good, something that is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6438"> 6438 </A></B>
<P>
appropriate and something that brings these plans into line with 
other plans is being questioned and turned into something bad.
<P>
	This is very symptomatic of all that the Reform Party has stood 
for and has brought forward. It is to take things that are good and 
honourable and to turn them into something else. I ask the hon. 
member, in light of these circumstance, why the Reform Party 
continues to try and degrade good pieces of legislation which will 
bring honour to this nation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, I am certainly glad to respond 
to that intervention by the member for Prince Albert-Churchill 
River.
<P>
	Let me be perfectly clear. In my speech I said that I would never 
think of challenging the integrity of the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court. I have no intention whatsoever of challenging the 
integrity of Madam Justice Louise Arbour. I am quite sure that her 
integrity and the respect which she enjoys is well deserved.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	What is not well deserved is the way in which the government 
has gone about amending the rules. It has put these two eminent 
jurists in a very difficult, awkward and compromising position. 
They are not there of their own choosing, they are there because of 
the government.
<P>
	If the member for Prince Albert-Churchill River cannot 
understand that point, perhaps that is why this bill and this 
government is in the mess it is in today regarding these two 
situations. The government has created the problem. It is not the 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. His integrity is 
impeccable. He has been put in a compromising position by the 
Minister of Justice.
<P>
	I do not know too much about Madam Justice Louise Arbour but 
I presume her integrity is also impeccable. She had been put in a 
very difficult position by the Minister of Justice who has allowed 
her to leave her duties on the bench against section 55 of the Judges 
Act and assume a position prior to legislation being passed by this 
House and the other place. That is the crux of the matter. Reform 
members feel that Madam Justice Louise Arbour is now 
compromised in her ability to prosecute and be a shining light for 
Canada. We think it is great and fully endorse the fact that a 
Canadian has been chosen to that high and prestigious position.
<P>
	As I said earlier, these were horrific crimes and people have to be 
held accountable according to the rule of law. Surely those who are 
sitting in judgment, those who are prosecuting and those who are 
speaking on behalf of the world community that has been shocked 
by these crimes would want the confidence of knowing that the 
people who are performing these arduous duties are there without 
the slightest blemish or hint of problem from the country from 
which they come.
<P>
	The point is that the government has put these two people in a 
most awkward and compromising position.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is with some consternation that I keep hearing 
the Reform members talking about certain things that cause us in 
Quebec to wonder what planet they are living on.
<P>
	I do not want to return to the question of pensions and so forth, 
because I think it has nothing to do with the amendment before us, 
but the hon. member seems unable to distinguish between a judge 
appointed to serve an international community, who has an ad hoc 
mandate, a specific mandate to serve as attorney, which is one 
thing, and a judge who decides from one day to the next to request 
leave without pay to act as crown prosecutor in Canada, Ontario or 
Quebec. These, I think, are two different things.
<P>
	For a judge to decide to take on a specific assignment to go and 
serve internationally to help an international community gather 
evidence to convict individuals who have committed major crimes, 
that is one thing. However, I do not understand the hon. member 
saying that once Ms Arbour, in this particular instance, returns to 
Canada, should she resume her duties as judge, there would be 
doubts as to her impartiality. What world do the Reformers live in?
<P>
	Are they forgetting that judges are lawyers, crown counsel or in 
private practice before they are appointed judges at some point? 
When arguing his case, is the crown attorney right to question the 
judge's impartiality because he comes from the private sector, or 
vice versa?
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	I have often argued before judges whom I knew to have worked 
for the crown. Do I fear from the outset that they will not be 
impartial? It is part of the training of someone in the legal 
profession to be able to separate things.
<P>
	To conclude, I would ask the member if he does not think it 
beneficial to Canadian and Quebec jurists to work internationally 
showing how we do things. Does he not think international 
exchanges should be promoted?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, in quick response to the 
member's question, yes, we have prosecutors and lawyers who are 
appointed to the bench and they are expected to make impartial 
judgments. However, this is a different situation. Someone is going 
from the bench and becoming a prosecutor. That is the opposite 
direction.
<P>
	The intent is that at some later point she will return to the bench. 
She is not being asked to resign; she is being granted a leave of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6439"> 6439 </A></B>
<P>
absence. That issue has never been dealt with before. As far as I am 
aware, if a judge leaves  the bench to become a prosecutor, he or 
she cannot return.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a 
few comments to make about Bill C-42 which has come back from 
the other House.
<P>
	I would like to make a few initial comments about the justice 
critic for the Bloc. Obviously he does not remember the path which 
this bill followed. The bill did not go before the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. Witnesses were not called. 
We were assured by the government that this was a housekeeping 
bill. The government said it was a rather innocuous bill which 
deserved rapid passage through the House and that is exactly what 
happened.
<P>
	If we are to criticize those who have looked at it in a more 
exhaustive manner, then we should really look at what they are 
saying about the bill.
<P>
	The hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill River, who was 
the one who indicated to our caucus that this was just a 
housekeeping bill and a rather innocuous one, now says it is a very 
important bill.
<P>
	When this motion on Bill C-42 came back, I examined the 
reasons for it. Why would it come back? It is a housekeeping bill. It 
is an innocuous bill. It was not an important bill.
<P>
	I read what witnesses who appeared before the committee of the 
other House had to say about the bill, as well as some of the 
senators' comments. In the short time I have I will quote some of 
the expressions made by one of the witnesses who appeared before 
the committee in the other House with respect to Bill C-42.
<P>
	I will quote from the testimony of Professor F. L. Morton. I do 
not have time to touch on all of his testimony but I would like to 
quote a portion of it: ``The government is concerned, as well it 
should be, with the current status of Justice Arbour and the 
implications of her status for those responsible at justice. The 
government seems to hope that by passing Bill C-42 as quickly as 
possible it can retroactively legitimate apparent indiscretions by 
Justice Arbour and possibly others''. That is a pretty serious 
statement. It was not made by someone from the other House, who 
may be detached from reality, as was suggested by the hon. 
member from the Bloc a few minutes ago; it was made by a 
professor of law.
<P>
	Professor Morton went on to say: ``For the past week I have tried 
to ascertain whether or not Justice Arbour is currently acting within 
the letter of Canadian law. On balance it seems that there is 
considerably more evidence to suggest that she is not''.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	Again, this is certainly something we were not aware of at the 
time that we examined the bill and the bill passed through this 
House. We were not aware of those opinions and the ramifications 
of this bill.
<P>
	To go on to quote Professor Morton's discourse:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My understanding is that Justice Arbour left for The Hague on August 1 to 
undertake new duties as ``Special Advisor'' to the UN Commission on War Crimes; 
and that as of October 1-that is, more than two weeks ago-she officially took up 
her new responsibilities as Chief Prosecutor. Apparently the government has 
attempted to ``authorize'' Justice Arbour's actions through two orders in council as 
authorized by section 54 of the Judges Act. Does section 54 authorize leaves for the 
type of activity that Justice Arbour has already undertaken? Not according to the 
testimony of Mr. Rock before this committee on October 7.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Professor Morton quoted the justice minister, stating this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is no provision in the Judges Act for a federally appointed judge such as 
Madam Justice Arbour to be granted a leave of absence without pay to work for an 
international organization such as the UN, nor does the act permit the salary and 
expenses of a judge during a period of leave to be paid by an organization or entity 
other than the Government of Canada or, in the case of expenses, by the government 
of a province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> With your 
indulgence I would like to inform the House that the amendment of 
the hon. member for St. Albert is in order.
<P>
	Please continue debate, the hon. member for Crowfoot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Madam Speaker, to carry on with the testimony of 
Professor Morton:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It would appear that Justice Arbour agreed to the appointment before it had been 
approved by the Minister of Justice (or any other officials), thereby forcing the 
minister to react to a fait accompli. Furthermore it then appears that the minister, 
rather than recommending to Justice Arbour that she postpone her new activities 
pending necessary amendments to the Judges Act, sought to temporarily legitimate 
her actions by an order in council; and then (because the order in council is conceded 
to be insufficient) sought to retroactively legitimate J. Arbour's new employment 
with general amendments to the Judges Act, Bill C-42, thereby forcing the hand of 
Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will conclude my quoting from the testimony of Professor 
Morton with this passage:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No doubt some will say that this is nit-picking. My response is simple. If the 
justice minister and appeal court judges cannot be expected to comply with the letter 
of the law, then who can? Indeed within the last month the justice minister himself 
pronounced on the meaning and importance of the rule of law. When Mr. Rock 
referred the issue of Quebec's so-called ``right of secession'' from Canada to the 
Supreme Court he declared that:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The rule of law ``is a living principle that is fundamental to our democratic way of 
life. In substance it means that everyone in our society, including ministers of 
government, premiers, the rich and powerful and the ordinary citizen alike, is governed </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><A NAME="6440"> 6440 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>by  the same law of the land. We are all bound by the Constitution, by the Criminal 
Code, by acts of Parliament and the legislatures''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	These are some observations. I only have time to refer to 
Professor Morton's concerns about Bill C-42 but there are others, 
including former Professor Peter Russell, who have expressed 
concerns about aspects of the bill. I feel that it is the duty of 
members of this House to closely examine these concerns.
<P>
	I conclude by referring to the amendment the hon. member for 
St. Albert made and which I seconded. I am not completely 
satisfied with that and I offer an amendment to the amendment 
which reads: ``That the amendment be amended by adding ``and 
that this House respectfully request that Their Honours respond to 
this message no later than June 19, 1997''.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, as I am reading the amendment moved by the 
Reform Party, I find it somewhat dangerous to state in the 
amendment that the chairman of the judicial council is in a 
potential conflict of interest. We know that the chairman of the 
judicial council was merely consulted with regard to Bill C-42 as 
he is an extremely important player in its implementation.
<P>
	We only have to look at what happened in the past with highly 
charged issues such as the case of Judge Bienvenue when all 
parliamentarians rebelled and rose to condemn the state of affairs. 
In the end, the people in charge of the issue were the members of 
the judicial council. To consult the chairman of the judicial council 
on such a bill is, I believe, necessary and very important.
<P>
	I would like the member to tell me in what way he believes the 
chairman of the judicial council is in a conflict of interest with 
respect to the debate we are having on Bill C-42.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I would like to 
inform the House that the Chair will reserve its right to look over 
the subamendment as proposed by the hon. member for Crowfoot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Madam Speaker, I acknowledge the question from 
my hon. friend from the Bloc.
<P>
	The fact is that this bill has not been thoroughly examined by 
this House. We know the history of the bill as far as this House is 
concerned. The examination of the bill has occurred by individuals 
outside this House, particularly members of the other place who 
called witnesses.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, I know that you are in the middle 
of an answer and I am very reluctant to intervene at this time. If you 
could keep your train of thought we will get back to you right after 
question period.
<P>
	As it is now 2 p.m., we will proceed to Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to relay to the House an act of bravery and courage by a 
constituent of mine in the riding of Scarborough Centre.
<P>
	Ronda Sparkes was recently awarded the Medal of Bravery by 
the Governor General of Canada for her unselfish and heroic act of 
bravery.
<P>
	On November 30, 1993, Ms. Sparkes along with her friend Kelly 
Kramil, went to the aid of three people caught in a strong Pacific 
Ocean undercurrent at a resort in Manzanillo, Mexico. As soon as 
the two women realized that the swimmers were in deep trouble, 
they grabbed a life ring and jumped into the ocean in spite of the 
rough waters. Ms. Sparkes and Ms. Kramil managed to keep all 
three people afloat until a rescue boat arrived and brought the 
exhausted group back to shore.
<P>
	I want to congratulate Ms. Sparkes on her Medal of Bravery and 
extend my praise for her courageous deed.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it would appear 
that the Canadian government is planning to withdraw, by the end 
of March 1997, its 40 per cent share of the funding of the 
agricultural day haul transportation assistance program, to which 
Quebec contributes to the tune of 60 per cent.
<P>
	In the Lanaudière area only, these cuts will mean an $80,000 
shortfall. Some 800 individuals will be affected, mainly students 
picking berries and canning vegetables. Moreover this will deprive 
vegetable producers of labourers who live far from their work place 
and have no other means of organised public transportation.
<P>
	In order to maintain a program which has a significant impact on 
this sector of our economy, the federal government must contribute 
to its funding. If it withdraws, it should at least compensate Quebec 
financially.

<P>
even acknowledge the fact that since the introduction of the Young 
Offenders Act, youth violent crime has increased by over 400 per 
cent.
<P>
	It does not take much to conclude that this Liberal oriented 
document simply is not working. Rather than address this 
legislation as unworkable, the minister's recent comments indicate 
the probability of punishing the provinces by removing funding if 
they do not change their ways.
<P>
	He claims that 80 per cent of the funding goes to incarceration 
while only 20 per cent goes to alternative measures. He also claims

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since Ed Broadbent's motion that called for the abolition of child 
poverty by the year 2000 was passed unanimously by this House 
approximately seven years ago, child poverty has actually grown 
by 41 per cent. This is at a time when the families of wealthy 
corporate executives, who in the 1980s made 12 times as much as 
the poorest families, now make 24 times as much.
<P>
	The Liberals have allowed the most privileged and powerful in 
Canadian society to turn their backs on the children who make up 
Canada's next generation. Many Canadian families are under 
severe stress, while the prosperity of the new economy is blowing 
into executive pay packets but not into children's lunch buckets or 
into their educational opportunities.
<P>
	The leader of the NDP, Alexa McDonough, has called for the 
restoration of balance into our economy. We are calling for a cap of 
$200,000 or less on executive salaries that can be deducted from 
corporate taxes as a business expense and to direct the tax savings 
to programs to reduce child poverty.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there have been further changes in the last few hours in 
the situation involving the great lakes region of Africa. The United 
States has just announced that it will not send troops, but will only 
provide logistical support for the mission being planned.
<P>
	Rwanda's foreign affairs minister said that he did not feel the 
mission was necessary other than to ensure that humanitarian aid 
reaches refugees who have returned home. It would appear that 
even this statement is not up to date, because the Rwandan 
government has apparently said in the last few hours, minutes even, 
that in their view the entire mission is no longer necessary.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Given that all observers 
apparently feel that American involvement is essential to the 
success of the mission, and given that the United States has 
announced that they will not take part, that they will not send 
ground troops and participate fully, what alternative is planned to 
ensure the safety of troops and to guarantee the multinational 
character of the intervention?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, the situation is 
evolving very rapidly. According to reports, 500,000 refugees have 
returned to Rwanda. At this time, General Baril and observers from 
the United Nations, the United States and elsewhere are assessing 
the current situation in eastern Zaire, at the border with Rwanda, 
particularly in the southern part of that region.
<P>
	When we have the information, we will know exactly how many 
Rwandan refugees are in Zaire. Will they return to Rwanda? When 
they go back to Rwanda, they are home and there is no longer any 
need for military intervention because they are in their own 
country. It is strictly a question of providing them with 
humanitarian aid.
<P>
	The situation is evolving. General Baril, who was appointed to 
lead the mission, is now in Kigali. There will be a meeting of 
military commanders in Stuttgart, Germany, on Thursday or Friday 
chaired by General Baril, for the purpose of evaluating military 
requirements.
<P>
	Tomorrow, there will be a meeting of political representatives at 
the United Nations. That will be held in New York. Saturday, in 
Geneva, all representatives of countries contributing humanitarian 
aid will meet to evaluate needs and see what can be done.
<P>
	As we speak, the mission is still on. The statement to the effect 
that the United States has announced officially that it will not be 
present does not match my information. I spoke with Mr. Lake 
myself yesterday evening. He told me that he and the others were 
assessing the situation and that he would be in Stuttgart on 
Thursday, and that a decision would be made at that time. The 
United States has assured us that it has not changed its basic 
position.
<P>
	The situation is changing rapidly and we should be pleased that 
the refugees have been able to return home without military 
assistance. I think this is a great achievement that should make 
everyone happy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the Prime Minister for his information, but there is 
one point on which I still have a question.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister tells us that there is no need for any 
military intervention in the case of the refugees who have gone 
back to Rwanda, I would like to ask him if the Canadian 
government has obtained assurances from the Rwandan 
government that the safety of these people will truly be assured. In 
our opinion, it is not obvious that these people are necessarily 
completely safe once they return to Rwanda.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, these are Rwandan citizens returning to their own country. 
Local authorities assure us that measures have been taken to help 
them return to normal life in their country. This is within their own 
country.
<P>
	At this time, the Rwandan government does not want military 
intervention with respect to its own citizens within its own borders. 
This is entirely normal under international law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the mission that we supported and that the government set 
up was for the very purpose of saving lives, of ensuring that food, 
medicine and water reached all these people, many of whom are in 
terrible straits. I know that the Prime Minister is concerned about 
these people.
<P>
	We have soldiers over there who are being prevented from doing 
their work. I would like to know what steps the Canadian 
government has taken, or can take, to ensure that they are in a 
position to take action. It is far from obvious, just because a certain 
number of refugees have returned home to Rwanda, first, that they 
are safe, and, second, that humanitarian aid-the purpose of the  
mission-water, food and medicine can reach those who have not 
yet made it

back and those still travelling and dying daily. Is the Prime 
Minister in a position to ensure that the troops already there can 
take action?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the information I have is that the Rwandan government 
welcomes those wishing to provide humanitarian aid. There is no 
doubt on this score. They will facilitate the movement of people 
who must travel there to distribute food, clothing, and necessary 
medication. In this regard, we have the assurance of the Rwandan 
government that everything will proceed normally. This aid will 
not necessarily be distributed by the armed forces, but by 
organizations that can dispense these services.
<P>
	As for eastern Zaire, a reconnaissance mission is assessing the 
situation. It is now at the site, accompanied by Rwandan 
authorities. Flights are also being made over the area to assess 
population movement. It will be with accurate information about 
what is taking place that the Stuttgart meeting will be held and a 
decision taken on the nature of the military intervention, if the need 
still exists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	In light of rapid developments in the situation in Zaire, does the 
Government of Canada approve of the restricted mandate which the 
U.S. government and Rwanda seem to want to impose on it, in 
other words, a mandate that excludes opening and maintaining 
humanitarian corridors outside Rwanda?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as the Prime Minister pointed out, it is important to 
examine the situation in Zaire very carefully. It is very important to 
share information with other countries that are members of the 
multinational force. Tomorrow, during the meeting at the UN and 
later at the meeting in Stuttgart, we will be asked to examine and 
evaluate what the next step should be in achieving the goals set by 
the UN last week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
considering that the numbers that were to be involved in the 
multinational force are now, according to current information, 
being reduced, what is the level of resources, human and otherwise, 
that the Government of Canada would judge to be essential if this 
multinational force is to fulfil its mandate effectively?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the Prime Minister said to earlier questions and as I just 
stated, we are looking for better information and intelligences in 
the southern province of Kivu in Zaire. At this time we know there 
are a number  of refugees there but we do not know how many. We 
are also not sure whether they will be moving across the border in 
the next 24 or 48 hours.
<P>
	As soon as we can evaluate that very carefully we will determine 
whether the continuing aid for the multinational force to provide a 
secure environment for humanitarian aid is required or whether the 
emphasis will be fully shifted to supply that humanitarian aid to 
Rwanda.
<P>
	We will certainly keep the House informed. I offered yesterday 
to maintain an ongoing consultation through the committee system. 
We will make sure that as each development takes place Parliament 
is made fully aware of each development.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government's aid mission in Zaire seems to be all over the map. 
The immediate crisis is over. We know that and are glad for that, 
but humanitarian aid is still required, as was just mentioned.
<P>
	The disaster assistance relief team is stuck in Uganda and our 
soldiers have not even been allowed past the airport in Rwanda.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister explain to the House just what our 
mission to Central Africa is and what efforts he is making to ensure 
the safety of our Canadian troops?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the mandate is very clear. The mandate has been given to 
an international force to go into Central Africa to help provide 
food, medication, shelter and other needs to the refugees. At this 
time we are all on the side of Zaire.
<P>
	I am happy to see that the representative of the third party 
realizes that probably half of the refugees are back in their country 
of Rwanda and others are moving. At this moment a survey is being 
made by a team in eastern Zaire to evaluate the situation to find out 
what is happening to the refugees who are still there. We are told by 
the Government of Rwanda that it will open the southern part to let 
the refugees into Rwanda in the days to come.
<P>
	By the end of the operation we will know if there are still some 
Rwandan refugees in Zaire. If there are none, the problem will 
become strictly humanitarian. As I said earlier, the Government of 
Rwanda is willing and eager to receive help from all the countries 
that want to contribute to this settlement of the people coming back 
home after two or three years.
<P>
	It may be that in the next three or four days we will be in a 
position where the armed forces will not be required any more. At 
this moment the Canadian soldiers who are in Kigali are 
completely safe and in no danger. They are awaiting the evaluation 
that will be made by General Baril and the other military officials 
involved. They will be meeting in Stuttgart, Germany on Thursday 
or Friday  and the decision will be made at that time about what 
kind of forces and who outside Canada will be contributing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6446"> 6446 </A></B>
<P>
	The British are contributing and the Americans say they will be 
there and many others. I was on the phone with President Mandela 
a few minutes ago discussing the matter. He wants to be there and 
he wants to have a strong African participation in the effort.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
certainly the safety of our troops should be one of the government's 
top priorities.
<P>
	We were invited into Bosnia and Haiti. Yet Canadians still 
suffered over 120 casualties in Bosnia, including 12 deaths.
<P>
	Rwanda, as the Prime Minister said, is still refusing military 
troops and the armed forces. Eritrea is opposing our involvement 
and South Africa is no longer willing to commit troops, as we 
understand it. It is not clear how welcome the Canadian troops are.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister ensure to Canadians that he will not 
commit Canadian troops beyond the immediate relief team there 
already until African countries agree to and support our 
involvement there?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the resolution at the security council last week was 
unanimous. When the meeting was called by Canadians before the 
resolution, we expected to have 25 countries show up, and 75 came 
and everybody was very eager to have a resolution adopted and 
everybody wanted to find out what kind of contribution they could 
make.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, the actual commitment of troops will be 
discussed in Germany on Thursday or Friday. Depending on the 
evaluation of the situation, a decision will be made by the military 
officers who are in charge. As of this moment, the meeting has 
been called by General Baril, a Canadian, who received a mandate 
from the security council to prepare troops if military intervention

<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
hope that when that decision is made it is a practical decision, not a 
political one.
<P>
	There is a human cost that is paid every time we send our troops 
into theatres of action. They are the best in the world and we 
support our military without reservation. The government, 
however, must not over extend our military reach. Many military 
analysts are saying that Canadians and Canadian troops should not 
be supporting another military engagement.
<P>
	The Prime Minister knows that Canadians need to make an 
informed decision regarding committing Canadian troops to Zaire. 
Will the Prime Minister tell us whether he plans to scale back our 
commitments in Bosnia and Haiti?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, three years ago we had more than 4,300 Canadian troops 
committed abroad. They were stationed in the former Yugoslavia, 
Cyprus and so on. At this very moment we have about 2,000 troops 
in Bosnia, Haiti and Africa. This is less than half the amount of 
people who were committed three years ago.
<P>
	I have been informed by the Minister of National Defence that to 
commit more troops to Africa at this time is not outside the 
capacity of the military. In all the discussions we have had, the 
Canadian military is very well respected around the world. I was 
very confident in asking it to take the lead and go to Zaire.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	By participating in the Tokamak project, Canada is making a 1 
per cent contribution to the international nuclear fusion research 
effort. The Prime Minister is no doubt aware that this 1 per cent 
contribution gives Canada access to 100 per cent of all 
developments in this area of research and that his unfortunate 
decision to cut Tokamak's funding by $7.2 million will exclude us 
completely from this very promising area of research.
<P>
	I call on the Prime Minister's common sense. Given the 
fundamental importance of this project and the extremely positive 
impact it will have on Quebec's economy, would the Prime 
Minister not consider personally interceding to find the $7.2 
million necessary to carry on such an important research project?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I have told the hon. member a number of times in 
this House, very difficult decisions have had to be made during the 
exercise of program review and returning fiscal order to the books 
of the nation. AECL has not been immune from these very difficult 
exercises.
<P>
	As I have explained to the hon. member on a number of 
occasions, fusion research is not a priority for this government. 
Therefore when we have to make tough fiscal decisions, we have to 
decide what our priorities are and we have decided. I think the hon. 
member understands the reasons why we made the decision we 
made.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as it is 
a matter of finding the meagre $7.2 million required to maintain 
Tokamak in operation and ensure we do not lose the substantial

<P>
economic benefits of this project, the Bloc Quebecois will take the 
liberty today of making a suggestion to the government.
<P>
	Since the Minister of Natural Resources claims-she just said so 
herself-she can no longer afford to fund this project out of her 
department's budget, why does the government not draw on the 
Federal Office of Regional Development for Quebec and the 
National Research Council of Canada, as it did for the TRIUMF 
project in British Columbia?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me reiterate that fusion research is not a

every CANDU reactor that is sold we create over 4,000 person 
years of employment in the province of Quebec, primarily in the 
area of Montreal.
<P>
	Let me remind the hon. member that for every CANDU reactor 
we sell we spend over $150 million in the Montreal area, in its 
economy.
<P>
	In fact, by repriorizing the activities of AECL in terms of selling 
CANDU reactors in the export market we are directly contributing 
to the economy of Montreal and Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in August 1984 
senior scientists at Health Canada were sounding alarm bells about 
the danger of HIV and AIDS. At the same time that legislation was 
drafted to protect the blood supply, the Liberal government of the 
day ignored the warnings in the legislation because it did not want 
to touch such a hot potato just before the election.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Why is the government 
hiding the fact that it had warnings and draft legislation prepared 
that would have protected the blood supply and saved thousands of 
Canadian lives in 1984?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member ignores the fact that the 
government has co-operated completely with the investigation 
being conducted currently by the Krever commission.
<P>
	The government has put all of its cards on the table in a very 
serious way to resolve a problem which has been ongoing and 
which preceded this particular administration.
<P>
	The member will also recognize that in the interim report the 
recommendations that related to the federal jurisdiction were 
immediately addressed. The Government of Canada is doing its 
very best to co-ordinate all factors that come into play in ensuring 
that such a tragedy will not happen again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, some 
co-operation. We have a legal challenge, we have an end run with 
transfusion Canada and now a gag. That is co-operation?
<P>
	Justice Krever thinks this information is vital for his inquiry. The 
blood supply killed thousands of Canadians, yet this government 
refuses to give him the information. Cabinet secrecy, it says. 
Nonsense. The only secret is this government's trying to keep from 
the public that Liberals could have protected the blood supply in 
1984. Instead they chose to do what was politically expedient. They 
chose to do nothing.
<P>
	My question, again, is to the Prime Minister, who was deputy 
prime minister in 1984. Why will he not release these documents to 
Krever? What is the government trying to hide?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the documents referred to are documents related to the 
operation of the cabinets of previous governments, not this

cabinet information from previous administrations.

Starting January 1, 1997, an additional 500,000 Canadians will be 
covered by unemployment insurance, because they will now 
qualify for coverage under this system''. I must be dreaming. Did 
the minister spend time in his constituency office? Did he look at 
the bill? Did he read his department's documents? These 
documents are clear: 500,000 more people will pay premiums, but 
not one additional person will qualify.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that paying premiums does not 
equate being covered by the system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what I do recognize is that we 
have a modern employment insurance system which indeed covers 
an additional 500,000 people. I checked again, since it was the 
fourth time that this question was put to me.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	I checked yesterday afternoon to make sure that the data I had 
was accurate. In the course of this verification  with my advisers, I 
found the same thing I do when I go, every Friday, to my 
constituency office, which is also in eastern Montreal. I can tell you 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6448"> 6448 </A></B>
<P>
that, out of these 500,000 Canadians who now qualify under the 
new system, which is based on the number of hours, and who work 
part time, 270,000 are women. We are very proud of our reform.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, it 
does not apply now but only as of January.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that, to be covered under the system, 
one has to qualify, and that the new legislation which will come 
into effect in January triples the basic requirements for all those 
who are currently not in the workforce, particularly young people 
and women, including those of Saint-Michel, and others, and that it 
doubles these requirements for all the others, including pregnant 
women? This is the new economy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
reading from a finance department document entitled ``Revenue 
Measures''. It shows that the finance minister has raised taxes 12 
times in 1994, 11 times in 1995 and 7 times this year. This is a 
$1,500 increase in federal taxes for the average taxpayer and a 19 
per cent increase in federal government revenues. It is a far cry 
from the minister's claim that he has not raised taxes.
<P>
	Can the finance minister explain why a document produced by 
his own department shows he has raised taxes 30 times? Will he 
explain why he refuses to cut government waste and permanently 
lower taxes as Reform has proposed in its fresh start election 
platform?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
between 1993 and 1997-98 the revenues will have increased by 
some $23 billion, $600 million of which is from excise tax 
increases. I would remind the hon. member there has been no 
increases in personal income taxes. Of that, $2.2 billion is from 
closing tax loopholes. Does the hon. member object to the closing 
of tax loopholes? Does he object to the fact that we have perhaps 
closed some of the loopholes used by his wealthy friends for the 
betterment of the average Canadian?
<P>
	The vast majority of the increase, $17.1 billion of the increase, 
has arisen due to increased economic activity. The country is 
working and that is what it is all about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, he has 
not raised personal taxes, he has raised taxes on persons. According 
to the Fraser Institute there has been a $3,000 national pay cut since 
the government came to power.
<P>
	Let me provide some areas where the government can cut its 
spending so that it can indeed introduce lower taxes. How about the 
$3,600 grant this government gave to the Mary Kay distributor in 
Midland, Ontario? I know the industry minister will say it was for 
research and development but frankly I do not buy it. There was 
$10,000 for the tattoo shop in Vancouver. I am sure that was very 
vital spending.
<P>
	Why does the minister squander tax dollars on these 
boondoggles while families, seniors and low income Canadians 
desperately need tax relief? And could I have the answer without 
the waving of the arms and the aneurysm?
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Just wave your 
arms and all things will be revealed unto you.
<P>

reduction of $500 that somebody who is going to buy a $15,000 car 
will get this year compared to last year. Let us talk about the $3,000 
reduction on a $100,000 mortgage for somebody who rolls their

certainly be living in another world when he says that he has met a

<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Leaving aside the arrogance, because in order to 
say people are keen, one really has to be cut off from reality.
<P>

will use the example of a person from Papineau-Saint-Michel, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6449"> 6449 </A></B>
<P>
who has been laid off after 50 weeks of work, who has worked eight 
hours a week for a total of 400 hours in the year. Working for 52 
weeks at six dollars an hour, this person has earned $2,400. I am  
asking him this question to make sure I am right, if the hon. 
member for Papineau-Saint-Michel understands properly.
<P>
	Is it not true that this person will pay premiums for each of the 
400 hours worked, whereas none were paid before? Is it not true 
that this person will receive no benefits after being laid off, for 
having worked only 400 hours instead of the requisite 910? Is it not 
true that the premiums paid will not be reimbursed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, excellent written question. I can 
explain, and I think the official opposition will understand. As 
regards the people in my riding, when you talk about the new 
employment insurance system, they appreciate that the system 
focuses on active measures and that they may be covered from the 
first hour they work.
<P>
	That is, people who were not working 15 hours a week because 
only 10 or 12 hours were available did not pay and were not 
covered. Now, from the time they pay and have worked even only 
eight hours in a week, it counts. These hours will of course be 
added to other hours they do in other weeks, where the average is 
better. So, from the moment the system is in place, coverage is 
expanded and flexibility is greater.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question is not written, because I followed the debate, 
and I know how it went, and I was here when we debated the reform 
now under the minister's responsibility.
<P>
	I repeat my question. With 400 hours worked in a year at the rate 
of eight hours a week, paid six dollars an hour for an annual salary 
of $2,400, the person will have to pay now where he did not before. 
This person is not eligible for benefits and will not be refunded his 
contributions, because he earned more than $2,000. Will the 
minister confirm that this person will now be a contributor but not a 
claimant? That is the question.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the show of 
support, it brings back fond memories.
<P>
	I will repeat that the new employment insurance system 
promotes a return to work and encourages people to work as many 
hours as possible-it promotes employment, in other words. We 
see this system as a way to encourage people to return to work and 
do as many hours as possible to improve their coverage.

than its words.
<P>
	Professionals across the country say that the best way to prevent 
youth crime is to make sure children are being raised in caring 
stable homes by a primary caregiver or someone the child knows in 
the neighbourhood. Reform's fresh start for the family includes a 
child tax benefit so parents can better afford to raise their children 
in this way.
<P>
	Because tomorrow is National Child Day and since this Liberal

will it take some real action and extend the child tax benefit to 
anyone with children under 12 regardless of how they are caring for 
their children?

<P>
	It was this government that two and a half years ago created the 
National Crime Prevention Council. It was this government that 
two and a half years ago began plotting a national crime prevention 
strategy. Through our policies and through our legislation we have

payments are determined and enforced in this country. Those 
measures are going to assist in the support of children when parents 
divide.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance has told the House, the money we 
derive from the change in the tax system on child support is being

<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe there is a problem due to the fact that the pension fund belonged to the 
Singer company that was transferred to the United States, which closed its doors here 
and has declared bankruptcy in the U.S.</BLOCKQUOTE>

it is able to recover the cost of doing so from the Singer company?
<P>

response to counsel very shortly.
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development and my 
predecessors have reviewed this case several times since 1993. 
However, I wanted to check personally some facts that go back to 
the period from 1947 to 1964.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister confirms that there was a case, but the problem here is that 
there is also a statute of limitation. As soon as that kicks in, the 
Singer employees will have to go to court, and their average age is 
80. That is what we are trying to avoid. Time is of the essence.
<P>
	Considering that between 1947 and 1962, the federal 
government was responsible for the pension plan, that there was a 
$700,000 surplus remaining in the plan at the end, and that the 
government allowed Singer to use that money, which was not 
allowed under the contract, I would like to ask the minister 
whether, aside from the trouble the government may have 
recovering these amounts, he will finally admit that the 
government must acknowledge its responsibility and act quickly on 
this case?

	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to inform the House that Canada will be leading a high 
level, major donor meeting this Saturday in Geneva. I intend to 
chair the meeting on behalf of the Canadian government.
<P>
	The purpose of this meeting is to co-ordinate humanitarian aid 
and to discuss the transitional nature of those Rwandans who are 
now leaving the refugee camps along the borders inside and outside 
Zaire in order to regain shelter within their own respective 
communes.
<P>
	A number of donor countries have already announced their 
participation, including the United States, a number of European 
jurisdictions, Japan and Australia.
<P>
	I am also pleased to inform the House that Rwanda will be 
represented by one of its cabinet ministers.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister and has to do with the 
Canada-Chile agreement that was signed yesterday.
<P>
	The NDP regrets that the government did not take the 
opportunity to build into that agreement a mutually shared 
enforceable code with respect to labour and environment.
<P>
	Has the government made any studies of who will be affected by 
this agreement? Will there be any adjustment programs like the 
Liberals called for in previous free trade agreements when the 
Tories were in power? Will there be adjustment programs and are 
there any studies? If there are not, will there be any studies so that 
we will know who will be hurt and how the government plans to 
help them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the absence of the minister of trade who is in Toronto 
today with the Chilean delegation promoting major business 
investments in both countries, I can assure the hon. member that 
the agreement includes both a major side agreement on labour and 
one on environment that allows both countries to work out the basic 
standards that can be met.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6452"> 6452 </A></B>
<P>
	A dispute settlement resolution system goes with it and there 
is a referral system. The agreement breaks new ground and 
establishes the fact that there can be a relationship between 
environment, trade and labour matters to encompass the whole 
notion of sustainable development.
<P>
	We would be happy to send the hon.member a copy of those 
agreements.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion in relation to the 
amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-42, an act to amend the 
Judges Act and to make consequential amendments to another act; 
and of the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPEAKER'SRULING">SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before question period an amendment to the 
amendment was moved by the member for Crowfoot. The 
subamendment stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by adding ``and that this House respectfully 
requests that Their Honours respond to this message no later than June 19, 1997''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I took this subamendment under advisement. The purpose of the 
subamendment is to add to the amendment already before the 
House the words already quoted.
<P>
	First, I would remind the House that when the Senate has 
amendments to a bill, and these are under consideration in the 
House, the debate must be strictly related to the amendments. This 
is specified in citation 742 of Beauchesne's sixth edition.
<P>
	Second, the purpose of a subamendment is to alter the 
amendment and not to enlarge the scope of the amendment or to 
bring in a new element foreign to the amendment. I refer the House 
to citation 580 of Beauchesne.
<P>
	As stated in Beauchesne's citation 553, the House can give an 
order only to itself, to us here. Were this subamendment adopted it 
would seem an order to the other place.
<P>
	For all these reasons I rule that the subamendment proposed by 
the hon. member for Crowfoot is out of order.

	The House resumed from November 8 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-62, an act respecting fisheries, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is my information that the hon. member for 
Comox-Alberni has 17 minutes remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
barely got started on my speech on the fisheries act about two or 
three weeks ago so I would like to resume. For those watching, if 
they wish to look back in <I>Hansard</I>, they will get the first part where 
I was dealing basically with the aboriginal fishery and what Bill 
C-62 is all about.
<P>
	This bill is about power: power for the minister and power for 
the bureaucracy. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans already 
has all the power and strength it needs to manage the fishery. The 
difficulty is that my colleague from Delta challenged the minister's 
authority and right to an aboriginal commercial fishery, not an 
aboriginal food fishery. Nobody disputes that. It is the right of 
aboriginals to fish commercially with other fishers not being 
allowed to fish that is being challenged. There is no equality in the 
fishery. That is what this bill is about.
<P>
	Talk about overkill, the bill will extinguish the public right to 
fish. I have fished in the Alberni Canal for the past 15 years. That 
has been my right as a Canadian and this bill will overturn that. The 
only way that I or anyone in this House can go fishing will be with 
a decree or some kind of ministerial authority and that is absolutely 
wrong.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6453"> 6453 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	In a nutshell that is what is wrong with DFO. It manages from 
the top down. I have worked in the industry with the people at the 
bottom and they are a hard working and dedicated bunch. But it is 
the top end. As the member for Skeena has often said, why is it that 
DFO, a couple of blocks from the House of Parliament, has to have 
an office with 1,000 people? It is a two-hour plane ride to the 
nearest fish. The problem with DFO is that it is a top down 
bureaucracy.
<P>
	This bill would give the minister complete discretion to manage 
the fishery through ministerial decrees and that is absolutely 
wrong. As well, within the bill there is absolutely no detail as to 
how this will be carried out. How are we as members in this House 
supposed to look at the bill and deal with the bill when there are 
absolutely no details on how it is going to be enforced? It will all be 
done through regulations at a later stage.
<P>
	The Fraser River fishery has almost been eliminated. There has 
been practically no non-native commercial fishery on the Fraser 
River and that is this government's action. What happened to the 
equality of all fishers?
<P>
	In British Columbia native fishers form 40 per cent of the 
fishery. They are already well represented in the fishery yet this bill 
will give them exclusive rights. This is not a slam against native 
fishers. What this country is about is equality of all Canadians. All 
Canadians regardless of their origin should have the right to that 
fishery and the minister wants to overturn that.
<P>
	This is not just hearsay, it has been shown in the courts and it is 
law. Only commercial fishers have the right to sell fish. This has 
been shown in the Van der Peet, the NTC Smokehouse Limited and 
Gladstone supreme court decisions. The court ruled that 
aboriginals have no right to an exclusive commercial fishery yet 
this bill will overturn that. Bill C-62 is the minister's attempt to 
work his way around the law to give exclusive rights to specific 
groups which is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	I do not believe the minister understands the bill, but do his 
bureaucrats? Absolutely. They are right on. This bill is coming 
from the bureaucrats, not from the minister. This is a classic 
example of a minister being run by his own bureaucrats.
<P>
	This minister has shown his incompetence on the west coast 
through the lighthouse issue, the coast guard issue and now on the 
fisheries issue. He does not understand and does not care to look 
into what is going on on the B.C. coast. He is bungling once again 
by fundamentally taking away our public right to fish.
<P>
	Let me quote the Liberal red book: ``Conservation and 
rebuilding of fish stocks will be the top priority of Liberal fisheries 
policy, a policy that will also encompass broader ecological and 
environmental decisions. A Liberal government will implement 
effective conservation measures immediately, because if remaining  
stocks are not conserved now, there will be no fisheries industry 
left on which to build sustainable development''.
<P>
	One of the very first actions of this new minister was to close 
down a substantial number of hatcheries on the west coast. Clearly 
that is not conservation. The government continues to ignore the 
fact that the fishing industry is in serious danger from declining 
stocks. There are problems with the Americans mainly in Alaska. 
We need strict enforcement of the conservation measures.
<P>
	The Liberal red book states: ``A Liberal government will deal 
with foreign fishing outside the 200-mile limit and scrutinize 
foreign quotas within the 200-mile limit''. This has not happened 
under this minister.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The west coast fishery is being ignored by this government. 
British Columbia has 12.9 per cent of the population. We have over 
3.8 million people. We are a cash cow to the government and we 
are tired of being ignored by the government.
<P>
	Earlier I mentioned issues that the minister has ignored, for 
example, lighthouses. The former minister and the present minister 
have taken the people out of the lighthouses. The cost is very small, 
about $3.5 million.
<P>
	They say that automated lighthouses will cover the fishers and 
aircraft but they do not. People are needed to tell them about the 
fog. A person needs to tell them about the size of the waves. During 
the last storm in British Columbia a significant number of the 
automated lighthouses went down. They did not report the weather 
at a time when the aircraft and the fishers needed that information.
<P>
	The B.C. coast is one of the most dangerous coasts in the world 
because of the topography, the weather and the all-round climate. It 
is not a nice place for flying in the fall or winter, nor for taking 
fishing vessels through the inlets and coves. We need those 
lighthouses; we need those people. Yet the government has decided 
to trim them out at a paltry savings of $3.5 million. But the largesse 
is fine when the government gives Bombardier $87 million as a gift 
because it happens to be in Montreal. What happened to east and 
west? This is what happens to the west coast time and time again.
<P>
	The same issue arises with the coast guard. The coast guard and 
the fisheries were amalgamated. A number of bases have been shut 
down. Search and rescue on the west coast is extremely important. 
Timing is important. Yet the safety of people on the west coast does 
not seem to have any effect or impact on the government.
<P>
	I could go on at length on what the government has not done for 
the west coast.
<P>
	This bill is significant to all Canadians. The public right to fish is 
a right which we have had in common law since Confederation, yet 
the minister and the government want to extinguish it. They want to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6454"> 6454 </A></B>
<P>
put the right to fish  under ministerial decree. That is absolutely 
wrong. It is a signal of where the government is going.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-62 only deals with the government's 
official problems. It does nothing else. It does not deal with the 
issues. There is no reason to support it. Therefore, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' and 
substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-62, an act respecting fisheries, be not now read a second time, but that the 
order be discharged, the bill withdrawn and the subject matter thereof referred to the 
Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The amendment is in order. The debate will now 
be on the amendment.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	Before I give the floor to the hon. member for Labrador on 
debate, I will go to questions and comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the 
speech given by my Reform colleague. You will allow me to make 
a comment instead of asking a question. My colleague may have 
lost his momentum since he started his speech before the 
parliamentary break and finished it just now.
<P>
	I would like to remind the members and the ministers present, 
and all those who are listening, about the irritants that Bloc 
Quebecois members mentioned during their speeches-and we will 
have the opportunity to repeat them-so that we can relate these 
irritants to the amendment proposed by the Reform Party and really 
understand what is happening here this afternoon.
<P>
	The main point which annoyed the Bloc in this bill was clause 
17, the provision on management agreements. My honourable 
colleague also mentioned these agreements. Thanks to his 
discretionary power, the minister can decide who will be party to an 
agreement. He can chose whoever he wants.
<P>
	What I understood from my colleague's speech is that he 
criticizes the repeal of a privilege that until now all Canadians 
could enjoy, provided they lived close enough to a lake or river, of 
course, that is the privilege to fish.
<P>
	I think the issue of fisheries management agreements is worth a 
closer look. I also think that, before we proceed any further, the 
minister should go back to his drawing board. I must also remind 
the House, as I think my colleague did, that we are dealing with the 
bill of the century, which proposes the merging of four existing 
acts, some of which are as old as the Canadian Constitution itself. It 
is very important that we do a good job because it could be another 
100 years before this legislation is reviewed.
<P>
	The other point I would like to stress concerns the delegation of 
powers to the provinces. There are clauses  in this bill that allow or 
indicate delegations of powers, specially with regard to fishing 
licences and the environment.
<P>
	I am not sure that both sides of the House agree on the extent of 
the powers being delegated. With regard to the intent of the bill, 
when the Minister, in Part I, deals with the delegation of powers 
relating to fishing licences, I think this is both inadequate and 
contradictory.
<P>
	Clause 9, I think, provides that a provincial Minister of Fisheries 
may, by delegation, issue licences. But clause 17 provides that the 
Minister has the discretionary power to decide who will receive the 
various licenses. I think this is contradictory.
<P>
	I say it is inadequate because provinces, including British 
Columbia and Quebec, are asking for more powers. When we talk 
about delegating powers with regard to fisheries, we do not mean 
only the authority to issue licences. For the sake of consistency, 
fisheries management must include control over fishery officers 
and the allocation of resources among communities, which is very 
important.
<P>
	This fall, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been taken 
to task. The department lost a court case on its handling of the 
delegation of powers and the establishment of fisheries boards. Part 
III of the bill provides for the establishment of quasi-judicial 
tribunals to deal with issues and administrative sanctions relating 
to fishing licences.
<P>
	Once again, allowing the Minister to use his discretionary power 
to appoint fisheries judges for a period of three years is no way to 
improve the situation. I do not see any difference with current 
procedures, under which sanctions are imposed by Fisheries and 
Oceans regional directors.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Those appointed will be in the minister's pay. Their mandate will 
last only three years. I think Quebecers and Canadians alike 
deserve a justice system that is much bigger, tighter, and above all 
more professional and politically neutral.
<P>
	I will conclude with a question to my colleague. I will try to 
make it short. My colleague moved that the bill be not read a 
second time but sent back to the Standing Committee on Fisheries 
and Oceans. I would like him to examine the matter more carefully, 
because I understand there is still a lot of work to be done, and I 
will let him conclude this debate. Later this afternoon, I will get 
another chance to comment on this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> The member is absolutely correct, Mr. Speaker. 
That is the reason for my motion, to take it back to the committee 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6455"> 6455 </A></B>
<P>
so the committee can examine it. This has been charged through far 
too quickly. The public  right to fish, as the member says, is a 100 
year old law. This is absolutely right.
<P>
	It is this type of statement that puts people on the west coast in 
the frame of mind of saying: ``Why does B.C. not take over the 
fishery? Obviously Ottawa does not care about it''. It is this type of 
legislation that is fueling that sentiment. The member is correct. 
We want to take it back to the fisheries and oceans committee and 
deal with a number of these major concerns, call witnesses and deal 
with it in detail.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will take the two minutes 
remaining. I appreciate that the Liberal member for Labrador is 
impatient to make his speech on this subject but I would also like to 
have other Liberal members take part in the debate. I would like 
them to take the floor this afternoon and tell us why we should rush 
through an act which is supposed to be the act of the century, while 
Reform members are saying we should go back to the drawing 
board.
<P>
	I believe that Reform members are right and I think it is up to the 
Liberals to convince us this afternoon.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Labrador, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to have the honour to speak in the House of Commons. It 
is my first time speaking during a debate. While it is a bill about 
fisheries, I will speak to some degree to the fishery but as this will 
also be my maiden speech, I will be injecting some other 
discussions and comments.
<P>
	I am pleased to support Bill C-62, the new fisheries act, which is 
long overdue. It is the first major rewrite of this act since 1868. Bill 
C-62 will make it possible for governments to work together with 
stakeholders to build the fishery of the future. If we have the will, 
together we can create an industry that is self-reliant and 
economically viable, an industry that will provide good incomes 
for both the large and small fishing enterprises.
<P>
	Canada's fishery resource is the mainstay of hundreds of coastal 
communities. I have 24 communities in my riding spread along the 
coast of Labrador from L'Anse-au-Clair in the south to Nain in the 
north. That is a coastline of 600 miles or so. We all know how stock 
declines have devastated many of these communities 
economically. We are working to rebuild those stocks. We must 
also ensure that the stocks on both coasts do not suffer a similar 
fate.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	It is my privilege and honour to talk about the relevant issues 
that tie in with the fishery and other developments in Labrador.
<P>
	First, I would like to tell the House that I am the first elected 
native born Labrador person in the House of Commons. I was born 
in a small community on the coast  of Labrador in a place called 
L'Anse-au-Loup. Its population is about 600. I grew up there and 
then I went to Memorial University in St. John's. I went back to 
Labrador and taught school. Fifteen years ago I moved into Goose 
Bay and launched a municipal political career. Thanks to the 
support from the good people of Labrador I want to do my very best 
to represent their needs here in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Labrador is a big land. It consists of 300,000 square kilometres. 
It has 1,000 miles of coastline. There are 24 communities along the 
coast of Labrador. There are four communities in central Labrador, 
the Goose Bay area, Sheshatshit, North West River and Mud Lake. 
It has the mighty Churchill Falls, which have been so hotly 
debated. Western Labrador is the mining capital of iron ore in 
Canada, located in Labrador City and Wabush.
<P>
	I am indeed very proud to represent these 33,000 or 34,000 
souls, representing a voting population of about 18,000.
<P>
	Labrador is very distinct. It has very diverse and distinct 
cultures. There is the Innu population of Sheshatshit and Davis 
Inlet. My colleague who is in the House was in Davis Inlet with me 
last week, as well as the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs. 
We signed an agreement to provide a better future for the people of 
Davis Inlet.
<P>
	In addition to the Innu culture is the Inuit culture. The Labrador 
Inuit Association is their parent body. They are doing very well in 
moving along on land claims. Also the Metis people live on the 
south coast and in central Labrador.
<P>
	We have the settlers who moved in from Europe and other 
places. In Goose Bay we have ancestors from Germany, Britain and 
Holland, as well as many other cultures. It is a very diverse land, a 
very big land and a great challenge for its member of Parliament to 
represent. I feel very honoured and very comfortable. Indeed, I feel 
poised to continue to serve the needs of the people.
<P>
	I also want to thank my colleagues in the House. The Prime 
Minister made a personal visit to Labrador last summer. The 
Minister of Transport came with me and spent eight days 
performing official duties in Labrador. I want to thank my other 
colleagues who have travelled with me through Labrador and who 
continue to travel with me.
<P>
	The natural resources committee went to Labrador last week to 
hear 12 presentations. I met with that committee again today and 
they were very struck and incensed by some of the comments they 
heard from the richest of people, in terms of economies in the west 
to some degree, and from the poorest of people. The extremities of 
life are found along 20 kilometres of the Labrador coastline. They 
include sectors related to the mining industry and so on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6456"> 6456 </A></B>
<P>
	I would encourage my colleagues to visit Labrador with me and 
to share the cultures and the great surroundings. It is a rural 
frontier riding. It is basically unknown in this House to a large 
number of people. I am up to the occasion. I welcome all my 
colleagues, as I have welcomed them in the past.
<P>
	It is important to the people of Labrador to have members of 
Parliament visit. It is important to this House to share the great 
knowledge and wealth of understanding which Labrador has. I am 
going to carry forward the issues of the people of Labrador. I am 
one spoke in a wheel of 295, so I need support. I will go forward 
and generate that support in the way I have just outlined.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Many of my colleagues, if not all of them, who have travelled to 
Labrador in the past, have shown interest in coming back in one 
capacity or another, with family, friends, to do some fishing, to tour 
around, to look at the historic sites or whatever the case might be. 
That speaks well of Labrador. We have a lot to offer and I think the 
rest of Canada must know that. I plan to make sure they know it. 
Mr. Speaker, you have heard me and will continue to hear me in 
caucus, in this House and around Parliament Hill supporting and 
taking pride in my riding.
<P>
	In promoting Labrador I want to mention that I speak often about 
the trans-Labrador highway. I spoke today on the trans-Labrador 
highway. I will be speaking again in the late show, in the four 
minutes allotted, one of these evenings. I speak often in the 
Atlantic caucus and the national Liberal caucus on it. I try to 
promote it wherever I can and I will continue to promote it. It is a 
must that the road become a reality in Labrador: a trans-Labrador 
highway through Quebec, through Baie Comeau into Fermont, 
Labrador City, Wabush, Churchill Falls, Goose Bay, down to the 
coast of Labrador and on into Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and 
P.E.I. That circular route is a must.
<P>
	It is my task to make sure that my colleagues understand that 
issue and at some point in the near future it becomes a fast track 
reality. It is a must. It is my number one priority. I will not settle, 
slow down or take a back seat to anything but promoting that 
highway and making it a reality.
<P>
	I mentioned the fishery in my initial remarks. I want to mention 
it again. As I stated, I am a member of the fisheries committee. I 
am honoured to say that I come from a very strong fishery riding. 
Off the coast of Labrador there are 17 shrimp licences which are 
shared among the Atlantic provinces. The people of Labrador get 
three and a half of those licences. We like sharing with people. We 
like sharing with our colleagues. These licences are worth $180 
million annually to the economy.
<P>
	In addition to that, we have thousands of tonnes of turbot, 
scallops, crab and God knows how many seals. There are millions 
of seals. One of these days we are going to come to our senses and 
realize what they are doing to the ecosystem of the North Atlantic 
and deal with that in the true context.
<P>
	The point I am making is that the resources are there. I am proud 
to say that the minister of fisheries, his colleagues and his staff are 
working with me to put together a plan whereby the people on the 
coast of Labrador can further benefit from the fishery, so we can 
keep our plants open and the workers can go on to have sustainable 
incomes.
<P>
	Our people do not want to be on employment insurance or 
anything like that. They want sustainable incomes and a 
sustainable economy. We have the resources. It is a matter of how 
they are managed. Management, development and working in 
conjunction with the minister of fisheries and the government, I 
know that Labrador will have a much more successful future than it 
is currently encountering.
<P>
	In the fishery we also have the Atlantic salmon issue which is an 
ongoing debate and one which the conservationists say we have to 
close down and so on. It is an ongoing debate. I am very pleased 
that the hon. minister of fisheries has seen fit, based on discussions 
with me and the people in my riding, to put together a task force to 
look at the implications of the salmon fishery. Hopefully we can 
rationalize this issue and come to some common understanding for 
the betterment of all concerned.
<P>
	I want to mention the Department of National Defence as well. 
Goose Bay is the low level flying capital of Canada. The German 
air force, the Dutch air force, the Royal air force from Britain and 
of course the Canadian air force fly out of Goose Bay doing 
advance low level flights.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The allied countries of Europe are contributing in excess of $100 
million a year to our economy. It is basically the mainstay of the 
economy of Goose Bay and the surrounding area. We want to make 
sure that we keep that economy and we forge ahead and develop 
that industry whereby it will be on the positive side for Canada, 
Labrador and for the people of Happy Valley, Goose Bay. With the 
onslaught of Voisey's Bay in my riding, Goose Bay will benefit as 
well as Labrador City, Wabush and other coastal communities.
<P>
	We have a very good future. It is a matter of how it is managed, 
how it is looked at by leaders, organizers and planners, how it 
works with government perspectives relative to provincial, 
municipal and federal governments and the economic giants of the 
world like Inco.
<P>
	My colleague from Nickel Belt and I are planning a business 
partnership exchange. We hope to exchange  business views that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6457"> 6457 </A></B>
<P>
have taken years to accomplish in Sudbury with our friends, my 
supporters, voters in the good riding of Labrador. I think it will 
benefit Sudbury, Nickel Belt, Labrador and all of us generally. That 
is why this country is so grand, so great and why we can do things 
to help each other.
<P>
	On a further point with regard to the smelter at Voisey's Bay, the 
people of Labrador are currently experiencing a number of 
unanswered questions vis-à-vis smelters, mines, mills et cetera. As 
the days move along I think in the next few weeks some answers 
will become evident. I hope and pray that the corporate giants such 
as Inco and Voisey's Bay Nickel will be making decisions bearing 
in mind the importance of the question of adjacency and how it 
applies to the social and economic fabric of the people I represent 
in my riding.
<P>
	At the end of the day we will come out of this happy, partners, 
and maybe we can all do better in sharing our great resources.
<P>
	I am particularly concerned with the people who are on welfare, 
untrained or who need literacy training. I am interested in looking 
at the youth. I see the pages in this House and they are looking 
forward to university and a new career. The people in my riding are 
no different. We need something to come back to. Too many people 
are leaving Labrador because there are no jobs. It is a shame we do 
not have jobs when we have so many great resources, so many 
great developments, and we wonder why we cannot continue. I 
know the people will be trained. I know Voisey's Bay Nickel, the 
good institutions of Labrador, the province and Canada generally 
will provide for the youth. They will be back and they will be 
happy and we will sustain a great Labrador into the future.
<P>
	I want to mention a few other points. The environment is 
extremely important. We need sustainable development and it has 
to be environmentally friendly because we have a very pristine 
environment in Labrador. Without a good environment no one 
gains.
<P>
	I want to reiterate my support for the land claims process that is 
currently under way by the Labrador Inuit Association and the 
impending claim for the Labrador Metis Association.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not mention Churchill Falls as it relates 
to the ongoing discussions nationally. I support the discussions 
currently under way by the premiers as they relate to contracts. We 
have to honour the legal jargon relating to the signing of deals and 
so on. I do feel that we need to benefit from Churchill Falls, the 
upper Churchill. I think we can also develop the lower Churchill 
and other hydro generation in Labrador; 5,000 megawatts have 
been developed and I think there are another 4,000 or 5,000 
available. I am sure that in due course we will proceed along these 
lines.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The Labrador west situation, IOC, Wabush mines, Quebec North 
Shore and Labrador Railway are great boosts to the economy. As I 
said, it is the iron ore capital of Canada.
<P>
	When there are situations where 65 per cent of the railway is in 
Labrador and 100 per cent of the ore coming out of Labrador and of 
the 140 jobs only 10 are people from Labrador, I have reason to be 
concerned.
<P>
	These are the kinds of inequities that I have to address and work 
with the corporate giants of the iron ore companies, Inco and all the 
others in the world, to make sure there is some balance in their 
thinking, some balance in their training, some balance in the 
planning and in their priorities so that the people of Labrador and 
the people of the rest of Canada will all benefit without too much 
frustration.
<P>
	In retrospect, the mood in Labrador is to forge ahead in terms of 
socioeconomic, culture, training, education of our youth and 
various other things. Certainly infrastructure is a priority. I would 
be remiss if I did not mention that while health care is a provincial 
matter, we are in critical need of a major health facility in Labrador. 
It was nice to hear the vice-president of public affairs for Inco 
mention the need for a health care facility for Goose Bay. In all 
probability Goose Bay will be a staging point for the mine and mill 
in Voisey's Bay. I found that very encouraging. We will get on with 
the issues and forge ahead with the province and the federal 
government to make sure we get our fair share.
<P>
	We in Labrador are not looking for anything more than is 
reasonable. Labrador has been a great contributor to the Canadian 
economy and will continue to be a great contributor to the 
Canadian economy. With the support of my colleagues from both 
sides of the House we can work this through the various 
departments and cabinet. We can come to some rational decisions 
affecting Labrador to the benefit of Canadians.
<P>
	I have a couple of concluding comments. I would be remiss if I 
did not mention that I heard the Prime Minister announce that there 
will be parks in northern Canada, Yukon and the Northwest 
Territories. We have a great potential for parks, to which my 
colleague for London-Middlesex can attest. One is the Torngat 
Mountains north of Nain and the other is in the Mealy Mountains 
just south of Goose Bay.
<P>
	It is my hope that some day soon by working with my colleagues 
collectively we will be able to make an announcement that 
Labrador has its first national park. It is very important to 
Canadians and to the culture of Labrador, the pristine areas, to 
develop at least one national park as soon as possible. Tying in with 
that would be other national historic sites like the site of Hebron, 
Hopedale, down the coast in Battle Harbour and  Red Bay. We have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6458"> 6458 </A></B>
<P>
some fabulous areas which I want to make sure are brought into 
their proper perspective.
<P>
	In conclusion, I appreciate the opportunity to speak here today. I 
feel very comfortable working in the House and with all colleagues 
from all parties.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	I take support wherever it comes from but I take advice as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> What about the Gaspé coast?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (Labrador):</B> Yes, we are good to the Gaspé coast. 
There is no question about that. It has a good turbot quota and so 
on. I do look forward to the member's support.
<P>
	However, the important point is that we collectively bring 
ourselves together and understand each other. I am new to this 
game but I am learning. Yes, I do take advice from 20 year veterans 
and 25 year veterans and so on. By doing that, I am making some 
progress. I am looking forward to continuing.
<P>
	With the kind of support I have received to this date and the 
support coming from Labrador and from around the House, I think 
it is going to be very interesting. I believe Labrador will benefit 
from my stay here in Ottawa.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, you join the ranks of close to 4,000 
of us in this House of Commons. Your maiden speech is a rite of 
passage. Usually when we have maiden speeches we get a free ride. 
No one heckles you and surely the Speaker does not intervene in 
any way. I know that in the years to come all of the very small 
things that will have to be improved on in whichever way you 
choose to deliver your speeches will be improved on.
<P>
	However, for today I bid you welcome into the fraternity and 
sorority of parliamentarians. You are one of close to 4,000 now and 
you are welcome here.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-62, 
an act respecting fisheries, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Labrador may have to 
take questions or comments. I think it is normally understood that 
we do not ask questions or make comments after a member's 
maiden speech. However, it is my duty to ask members if they want 
to interfere with his maiden speech in that way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I also want to welcome the hon. 
member for Labrador, who has been here for some time already, 
and to congratulate him on his maiden speech. I wish him a long 
political career, since he said that he would never throw in the 
towel as long as he is in this House. As he may be here for a very 
long time, I urge him to grin and bear it and to keep putting 
pressure on the government. Again, we will see if the riding gets 
more when they are in power. The issue raised by the hon. member 
is also of concern to my constituents.
<P>
	First of all, I want to tell the hon. member for Labrador that I am 
the member for Charlevoix and that I live in Baie-Comeau. 
Baie-Comeau is the gateway to the north through highway 389, 
which goes up to Manic 5. Under the last Conservative 
government, work was done on a link between Manic 5 and 
Fermont, which covers much of the access to the north.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The problem in Labrador is one of road infrastructure. The hon. 
member for Labrador can be assured of my cooperation and that of 
the hon. member for Manicouagan in ensuring the development of 
the whole North Shore region by developing the resources of 
Labrador.
<P>
	As we know, Labrador has fish, wood, iron and nickel. It also has 
the big hydro-electric power station at Churchill Falls. We know 
that Labrador has problems exporting and processing nickel.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member for Labrador of our full 
co-operation and wish him a long, effective career, because if he 
can get a highway for Labrador, it will also benefit Charlevoix, 
especially the area around Baie-Comeau.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (Labrador):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to answer if 
I may.
<P>
	I thank my hon. colleague. It speaks well, which is the point I 
was making. We all need each other. The economy of Quebec 
benefits. The people of Quebec benefit with this trans-Labrador 
highway. Call it northern gulf route, call it what you want.
<P>
	I look forward to working with all members who have a stake in 
this. I thank the member very much. Perhaps at a future date we can 
have a discussion on this. We can put our cards all in the right line 
so we can get on and make this a reality.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State </B><B>(Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too would like to congratulate 
the hon. member on his maiden speech which was very informative 
and very enjoyable I am sure for all the people across Canada.
<P>
	I was particularly pleased to hear about the various initiatives 
that involve his riding, for example, the highway he spoke about. 
We also have a need for a primary highway. In our case it is up the 
Mackenzie valley. We are working on that as well.
<P>
	He spoke about Voisey's Bay. We just announced the first 
diamond mine in North America. I am sure a similar process will 
ensue in his riding. There is so much commonality between our 
regions although we are in two different parts of the country, 
thousands and thousands of miles apart.
<P>
	He also mentioned youth which is my responsibility. What could 
the government do better for young people in Labrador?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (Labrador):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am starting to feel like 
I am a minister now. To have a question asked of me by the minister 
is indeed an honour. It is a very good question.
<P>
	My background is teaching. I spent nine years teaching and I am 
very close to youth. I go into the schools quite often to discuss the 
Chamber make-up et cetera.
<P>
	Last week in Goose Bay during the hearings for the natural 
resources committee we heard quite a few views, particularly in 
relation to youth. The strongest point was that it is very difficult to 
transport people from Hopedale, Labrador, an Inuit community 
near Davis Inlet, and the people from Nain thousands of miles 
away for training.
<P>
	These people have cultural ties. It is slightly different in our 
white society. They are asking us to identify the kinds of things 
they can do, to identify the areas of work in mines, parks and so on 
that they can do. They are asking us to do whatever we can to bring 
the training to them rather than them to the training. Maybe we can 
work together on some of that.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this bill that was introduced by the fisheries 
minister. First of all, I must say that, with this bill, the federal 
government is not taking any action to ensure that, in the future, 
fishing will be done in a responsible way, that is, in a profitable and 
sustainable way, from viewpoint of both the environment and of 
industry workers.
<P>
	To me, this bill represents one of the worst to be introduced in 
the House since our election. Yet, it should be the bill of the 
century. It combines several acts, some of which have existed since 
1867. It is one of the worst bills I have seen, because it does not 
take into account the industry itself. Also, it does not take into 
account those who work in it and, particularly, those who depend 
on it.
<P>
	Did this bill try to do anything to solve the problems of 
overcapacity? Absolutely not. Was there any attempt to solve the 
problem of industry revenues, of the industry's viability? 
Absolutely not. Dis this bill try to do anything to solve the problem 
of over-regulation? No.
<P>
	Furthermore, this bill does not take into account Quebec's 
demands with regard to fisheries. Thus, this bill has the same 
characteristics as many others, that is, that the federal government 
keeps on acting unilaterally and maintains its centralizing 
perspective, which the Bloc Quebecois has always rejected. This is 
also unacceptable to the stakeholders in the industry.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has obviously learned 
well, and learned fast. I must admit that his predecessor was rather 
good when it came to federal paternalism. Notwithstanding his role 
in the now famous October 1995 demonstration of love, his 
predecessor never showed Quebecers he was aware of their needs 
and concerns regarding the fisheries industry.
<P>
	While this bill establishes a regime for the conservation and 
management of fisheries, the minister's priority is to issue fisheries 
management guidelines. Does the minister realize that, before 
issuing such guidelines, he should have asked himself what the 
fishing industry is like in Quebec and Canada?
<P>
	We all know about the current depletion of fish stocks. In fact, 
this depletion led to a moratorium on Atlantic groundfish. On the 
west coast, major steps had to be taken to ensure a degree of control 
over stocks. This goes to show there is indeed a serious problem. 
Will this bill solve this problem?
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Let us see how the minister intends to go about it. As far as he is 
concerned, stock management simply does not exist. There is no 
mention, anywhere in this bill, of this important concept which is, I 
might say, vitally important to the fishing industry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6460"> 6460 </A></B>
<P>
	There are a number of questions, important questions, that the 
minister should have asked himself, questions like the following: 
Who will the fishers authorized to harvest the resource be? Should 
fishing become a profession, with a limit to the number of fishers? 
What types of vessels should fishers use? This bill does not answer 
any of these basic questions.
<P>
	Is the minister blind? Does he have a vision for the future of this 
industry? There is no hint of that in here. This bill will put in place 
a regime for the conservation and management of fisheries. It 
provides the minister with new powers. If the bill is passed, the 
minister will be authorized to enter into agreements with fishers' 
associations or organizations.
<P>
	These agreements could have a serious impact. There could be 
agreements on harvest limits and conservation measures for 
instance. How many licences will be issued and how much will 
they cost? What will the responsibilities and funding measures 
applicable to fisheries management be? To all these questions, the 
minister does not provide an answer.
<P>
	The agreements could also state that fishers are required to 
contribute to biological research. As if it was not bad enough that 
they have to pay to have the right to fish, they could also have to 
pay for research. Now I have heard it all.
<P>
	The government will go so far as to provide guidelines regarding 
the decision to be made in case of major violations of the act. But 
who will be part of this group of fishers? We cannot find out. There 
are no guidelines on this issue. With whom will the minister 
negotiate? Let us not be fooled. We know very well that the 
minister himself will decide who will sit at the negotiation table. 
He will invite his friends, of course, and should the minister not 
agree with those sitting at the table, who will form the group of 
fishers? The minister will have full authority to renege on his word.
<P>
	The fishing industry needs clear and precise answers. It has been 
plagued by uncertainty for too long to now be presented with 
solutions such as those proposed in Bill C-62. This industry, and a 
large proportion of those who live off it, has had to put up with 
unstable and inadequate revenues for too long. Is this what the 
minister wants to offer to these people?
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	In Quebec, we feel the fishing industry is one that must be 
looked after. We feel it is one of the economy's engines. 
Consequently, our approach is totally different from that of the 
federal fisheries minister. The Quebec government's official 
position on fisheries is the one that was stated at the 1994 
conference of fisheries ministers, in Victoria.
<P>
	Quebec then publicly asked the federal government to give to the 
province full authority over fisheries management. Quebec wants 
to take full responsibility for  the stocks fished by its residents. It is 
of course understood that any transfer of responsibility should be 
accompanied by a transfer of the budget set aside for this purpose.
<P>
	Quebec wants its fair share of fish stocks taken by residents of 
more than one province. Let us consider how the industry in 
Quebec sees this share. I would like to point out at this point that 
Quebec's position was unanimous, including the government and 
all partners who took part in the forum on Quebec maritime 
fisheries.
<P>
	The industry in Quebec believes it is essential to get out of the 
traditional pattern of interprovincial competition and concentrate 
on joint management of a renewable resource. A quota would be 
applied to the available volume of a particular species and would 
determine how the industry would manage that species.
<P>
	If this mechanism is applied to all species, it will determine the 
resources available to each province. This will put an end to 
provincial bickering. There will be no more lobbying to 
appropriate a greater share of traditional resources.
<P>
	Professional fishers would then enjoy stable access to their 
resources and feel more secure in the major investments they must 
make in this industry. Once their share is established, the industry 
and governments, federal and provincial, would be able to 
concentrate their efforts on developing this sector on a sound basis.
<P>
	The entire industry stands to gain. When we know what we are 
entitled to and what is available, we are in a better position to 
manage the resource and subsequent processing. The minister is 
aware of the Quebec government's position in this respect. He was 
advised of this position in September by the Quebec Minister of 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<P>
	Once again, the federal government is encroaching on Quebec's 
jurisdiction. We see duplication in matters such as the conservation 
and protection of fish habitat and pollution prevention. In case the 
minister did not know, Quebec has happens to have a Minister of 
the Environment and Wildlife. He is responsible for the protection 
and use of the aquatic environment and the resources found therein.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Quebec has jurisdiction over civil rights, private property, 
municipal authorities, physical planning and resource 
management, and this includes any matter of a local or private 
nature. It is therefore up to Quebec to take the responsibility for 
managing the aquatic environment and to take all necessary steps 
to protect it, to ensure the quality of that environment and to 
conserve its resources.
<P>
	So what is the federal government doing here? Why more 
duplication? This is unacceptable federal encroachment. Since 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6461"> 6461 </A></B>
<P>
1993, we have said repeatedly in this House that this government is 
increasingly encroaching on the jurisdiction of the provinces.
<P>
	This government must absolutely allow the provinces to decide 
if they rather be subject to federal standards or to their own. 
Quebec has asked not to be subject to federal standards. The 
minister must reconsider and respect Quebec's wishes, thus 
preventing costly duplication.
<P>
	I would like to draw attention to the new structure imposed under 
Bill C-62. This bill provides for the establishment of fisheries 
tribunals. The members of these tribunals could be appointed by 
the government for three year terms, and then be reappointed. As if 
the government had run out of places in the current structure to 
appoint its friends, it is now creating fisheries tribunals. This way, 
the minister retains complete control over the sentences handed out 
by these tribunals. We know full well that those who are appointed 
by the government must toe the government line.
<P>
	Does the industry agree with the proposed creation of fisheries 
tribunals? No, it does not. Those involved do not want to answer to 
an administrative tribunal. We have magistrates in Quebec and 
Canada. Our judicial system is very efficient. The people in the 
fisheries industry want to be treated like any other citizen, they 
want to be tried by the judicial system in place, not some new 
structure.
<P>
	The minister must abandon his plans to establish fisheries 
tribunals and go back to the drawing board as soon as possible. He 
must review his bill. He must listen to what the industry has to say. 
He must also take into account Quebec's demands, and ensure that 
his bill meets the needs of those who depend on the fisheries.
<P>
	The fisheries industry is too important an industry, in Quebec as 
well as in Canada, to have a bill imposed on it that does not meet 
the needs of those who depend on it. It is therefore imperative that 
the minister go back to the drawing board.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
listening intently to the hon. member's comment.
<P>
	I want to say that this bill is the first rewrite of the act since 
1868. All across Canada we have seen the need for stabilization in 
this industry. There is a very great need. The member spoke of 
stabilization of income and I agree with him. I think there needs to 
be a stabilization of income. But this will happen only if there is a 
professionalization of the industry. This is exactly what the bill 
intends to do.
<P>
	I am making more of a comment than asking a question. I think 
the time has come for greater professionalization of this industry 
and for there to be some stability in the harvesting methods. That 
can happen only through a better quota system.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon.member to comment on how he 
would provide for stabilization and professionalization of both the 
industry and income.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
comment, which reflects what members of the industry want, that 
is to make theirs a professional industry.
<P>
	However, the bill before us is silent on these issues. It is merely a 
merging of several existing acts. It maintains the status quo. What 
is new in this legislation? For example, does it say anything about 
how to make the industry viable and profitable? Does it say that the 
government is prepared to protect the investments made by fishers 
to develop their industry? The answer is no. This bill is general in 
nature, except for the fact that it gives the minister more and more 
power over the various organizations.
<P>
	We know that, the more the minister consults these 
organizations, the less he follows up on what people are asking 
him. The same thing happened with other bills. Therefore, the 
problem will not be solved with a minister like this one, who does 
not give a hoot about the consultations he holds all over the 
country. The minister made a lot of people come to meet him and to 
make representations. What was the result of this whole exercise in 
the proposed bill? Nothing. A big zero.
<P>
	For example, did the minister streamline regulations to help 
members of the industry adjust more easily? No, nothing was done 
in this regard. What about the issue of excess capacity? There is 
absolutely nothing on this either. Again, the minister has a 
short-sighted vision of what is going on in this industry. He does 
not realize that, if the bill is passed by this House, it will apply for 
many years to come and fishers will have to do without any 
improvement. The result is that the industry will once again 
experience total chaos.
<P>
	The minister must review his position, and I hope many Liberal 
caucus members will inform him of their intentions and get their 
message across.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a few 
comments for my colleague. First of all, I would like to 
congratulate him. For a member from Chicoutimi, even if people 
say fishing is not that good up there, I believe some people like to 
troll for redfish and go ice fishing in the winter.
<P>
	But what I find so surprising is that the hon. member took the 
time to do his homework and to read the fisheries bill.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6462"> 6462 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Now let me explain. People from Chicoutimi are not as familiar 
with the sea as the hon. member for Newfoundland or I myself 
might be, but he understands the problem perfectly.
<P>
	Before I put a question to the hon. member for Chicoutimi, I 
would like to elaborate on the comment made by the hon. member 
for Newfoundland. I must say it is very apt, and because this lady 
replaced the former Minister of Fisheries, Mr. John Crosbie, I 
suppose I can expect her to know something about the fisheries as 
well.
<P>
	She pointed out that the fisheries industry was keen on 
professionalization. I want to make sure I understood correctly. I 
imagine she will have a chance to make her speech this afternoon.
<P>
	When the first moratorium was established, Newfoundlanders 
referred to this as an act of God, and claims for financial assistance 
were the order of the day. When the second moratorium was 
proposed, again by a Minister of Fisheries from Newfoundland, but 
this time flying the Liberal colours, and I am referring to Mr. 
Tobin, the minister said that before the fisheries resume, it would 
be necessary to rationalize, by either reducing the number of 
fishers or their quotas.
<P>
	The hon. member for Chicoutimi touched on this in his speech. 
Where are the government's measures for rationalization? The 
fishers said that one way to achieve rationalization would be to 
professionalize the industry. Where are the criteria for a 
professional fisher?
<P>
	There is nothing in the bill. The minister should provide 
guidelines. He should tell us what his strategy is. But no, nothing, 
despite invitations to do so from other governments.
<P>
	The hon. member for Newfoundland should tell us later on in her 
speech what the professionalization of fishers should entail. I wish 
she would mention this later on.
<P>
	As for questions and comments on the speech made by my 
colleague from Chicoutimi, he mentioned initiatives by British 
Columbia and Quebec and that he would like to see a study, a 
breakdown of resources. I wish he would tell us more about this, 
because I think he hit on the right word, referring to the situation as 
total chaos.
<P>
	Before starting up the fisheries again, it is useful to discuss how 
much we intend to catch. For the benefit of the House, I may point 
out that nearly 75 per cent of fish species now being caught in the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence or which were being caught before the 
moratoriums were already subject to individual quotas. These were 
referred to as enterprise allocations, and in some cases were 
transferable. That is also a management tool.
<P>
	Nowhere in the bill does the minister provide any guidelines. 
Nowhere. One wonders what is going on here. We are entitled to an 
explanation from the minister. And  if he cannot give us one, he 
should let someone else do his job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, as regards the first part of the 
statement made by my colleague from Gaspé, I would like to 
inform the members of this House that, despite everything that 
happened in July in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, if the 
minister decides in the coming hours to take a real stand on ice 
fishing in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, because the 
flooding caused river banks to shift, this activity cannot continue 
without the permission of the minister of fisheries. I therefore 
invite the hon. members of this House to come and visit us and take 
part in this winter activity, thus giving the region a much needed 
boost in light of everything it went through. We are therefore 
promoting winter tourism.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	As for his comment on the bill itself, I would simply like to say 
there are three problems the bill does not resolve. It maintains the 
status quo as regards the problem of overcapacity. Only the 
industry and the provinces concerned can decide what quotas the 
industry can absorb and the resource can tolerate. This must be 
decided not by federal standards and in high places, but by those 
who are close to the people earning their living from it.
<P>
	To my way of thinking, this bill represents the status quo. The 
Bloc Quebecois wants to encourage the growth of a more 
independent and cost effective fishing industry-which is 
important for the people living off this resource-and especially 
one that is free of the many subsidies, which do not please 
everyone. We want to get rid of this sort of thing.
<P>
	People want to work, they want to earn a living from this 
resource. They want to develop it into something that is cost 
effective. So let us give these investors-small or big-all the 
means they need to draw reasonable incomes from this industry.
<P>
	I am sure, as it is a regular occurrence, that we will not be seeing 
people exerting pressure on the ministers any more in an attempt to 
remedy things. Why not correct everything when we have the 
opportunity? We could do it, if the current minister of fisheries 
went back to the drawing board.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, it is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for 
Cumberland-Colchester-employment insurance; the hon. 
member for Châteauguay-National Defence; the hon. member for 
Davenport-Pesticides Products Control Act.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for St. John's 
West.
<P>
	I listened intently to my colleagues from the Bloc. Many of us in 
the House have heard them say on every issue that no matter 
whether it makes good sense or common sense, they would have us 
turn everything over to Quebec.
<P>
	The member, although he spoke very passionately and 
articulated his views very well, should understand that fish do not 
respect boundaries. They do not understand jurisdictions. Fish 
swim between international boundaries and they swim between 
provincial jurisdictions. For the member to stand up and say that 
we should turn everything over to Quebec, he is not understanding 
the fundamentals of what fisheries is all about.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak on this new fisheries bill. As someone who 
served as a parliamentary secretary to Brian Tobin, the former 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, I have learned a little bit about 
the fishing industry. I probably have a lot more to learn about it 
because it is a very complicated area.
<P>
	Before I took over the position of parliamentary secretary, I 
think I had two experiences in the fishery, going out to fish. Both 
times I was not able to catch any fish, so my friend did not invite 
me any more to go fishing with him because he figured that I was 
not good luck for him.
<P>
	This is a very important bill. I know that my colleagues in the 
Reform Party think it is very important. That is why they are 
listening very intently. I am sure they know that I have some very 
interesting things to say.
<P>
	This fisheries bill is long overdue. As has been stated earlier in 
this House, since 1868 the act has not been reviewed in a 
comprehensive way. The area I want to concentrate on is habitat, 
which is very important, but before I get into that I want to make 
some general comments.
<P>
	This bill modernizes and updates the Fisheries Act. Members of 
the House should be saying that this should have been done a long 
time ago and not complain about how it fails to deliver. In fact it 
does deliver on some of the fundamentals of the fisheries, which is 
to have a fishery of the future, a fishery which is environmentally 
sustainable, a fishery which is economically viable and a fishery 
which reflects a commitment to the coastal communities.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	This new fisheries bill is about building partnerships. I know 
many members in the House, including both opposition parties, the 
Reform and the Bloc, have talked about partnerships and how 
important it is to develop partnerships in the industry.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to meet many of the members in the 
industry. Whether it was the aboriginal community, the 
commercial industry, the sports fishery or the small communities, 
they wanted a change in the fisheries. They wanted a change which 
would help build a stronger and more sustainable fishery. One way 
they wanted to do this was by building strong partnerships.
<P>
	The reason we want to build strong partnerships is so that people 
will have a vested interest in the fisheries. It will ensure that when 
people are involved in the fisheries, they will act in a responsible 
way.
<P>
	One of the highlights of this bill is it builds partnerships. It also 
gives the minister the ability to sign agreements and ensure that the 
communities and the industry are very much involved in the 
management of the fisheries.
<P>
	The other area this legislation tends to emphasize is the 
administrative side. One of the things that many groups talked 
about and which was important for B.C. was to ensure that there 
was more local input in the decision making. Some of the changes 
in this bill ensure that we have boards not only in the Pacific but in 
the Atlantic as well. This will ensure that those boards are sensitive 
and that the decision making is based on regional needs and 
requirements. The bill addresses that particular concern.
<P>
	The bill also deals with licences, how licence appeals are to be 
based and the whole licensing policy. This is very important for 
British Columbia and all of Canada.
<P>
	I could go on and on about a whole array of subjects that are 
important and which my colleagues have failed to talk about. They 
have only talked about jurisdiction.
<P>
	When I worked with the former minister of fisheries we looked 
at the salmon treaty and tried very hard to deal with that. As 
members know, this act incorporates the act which was brought in 
to deal with foreign overfishing. This will be simpler and easier to 
deal with.
<P>
	This is a very good bill. We have to compliment the minister of 
fisheries for bringing in legislation which is modern, up to date, 
flexible and which reflects some new realities in the fisheries. The 
fisheries have changed a lot and the demands from the 
communities have changed a lot. If we want to have sustainable 
fisheries and truly want to protect our fisheries, the act will provide 
the needed flexibility to do so.
<P>
	One of the most important components of this bill is habitat. 
This bill amends the habitat provisions to help habitat in the 
Fisheries Act. These important provisions of the legislation allow 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to delegate several freshwater 
habitat protection responsibilities to provincial governments that 
are in a better position to fulfil them. That is a very good common 
sense approach.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6464"> 6464 </A></B>
<P>
	We heard the member of Parliament from Chicoutimi talk about 
allowing the provincial government to deal with this. That is what 
this bill does. It states that it wants to delegate several freshwater 
habitat protection responsibilities. This addresses some of the 
concerns that have been put forward. It makes very good common 
sense.
<P>
	This government has continued to make sure that we take a very 
common sense approach. Where the provincial governments can do 
a better job, where they can administrate better, where they can 
deal with the responsibilities and where we can reduce overlap, this 
legislation deals with it.
<P>
	Canadians have said they want us to reduce overlap and 
duplication with the provinces. This bill deals with that by having 
delegation agreements with the provinces. It deals with it by 
clarifying roles and setting out clear responsibilities that will 
improve habitat management and make it more consistent across 
the country, that will help to eliminate the overlap of federal and 
provincial roles in freshwater habitat protection and reduce the 
confusion that results from such overlap, that will clearly spell out 
which level of government will be responsible for what aspects of 
habitat management. These agreements would not change the 
constitutional responsibilities of the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian fishing industry is an international industry with 
80 per cent of Canada's production being exported to over 70 
countries worldwide. Canada is the world's fifth largest exporter of 
fish and seafood products. There is a significant international 
component to the whole fishing industry. The members of the Bloc 
would not agree with that because they do not realize that 70 per 
cent of the fishery involves exports. They think it should be 
mandated provincially but it has a very international mandate.
<P>
	Recently I travelled across Canada as the vice-chair on the 
national Liberal task force on aquaculture to regions with active 
aquaculture industries. It is a new developing industry. I have come 
away with the impression of a positive future for this rapidly 
expanding industry.
<P>
	For example, in 1995, B.C. sold $165 million in farm fish and 
fish products while employing thousands on a full time basis. 
Eighty-five per cent of this product is exported to markets in the 
United States and along the Pacific rim. This new industry will 
provide jobs, business opportunities and boost the Canadian 
economy. That is why we as Liberals recognize that.
<P>
	We recognize the new opportunities that exist in this area which 
is why we have a task force. It is unfortunate that other members 
have not recognized the opportunities that exist out there.
<P>
	I will conclude by giving other members an opportunity to speak 
as well. The objective of the  provisions of the bill is to clarify roles 
and responsibilities. This legislation will go a long way to protect 
fish habitat. I urge hon. members to support this much needed 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was delighted 
that my friend from Vancouver South decided to address this 
fisheries bill.
<P>
	I am also delighted to learn that he has gone sport fishing twice. I 
did not realize that he had invested so much time in the pursuit of 
fish but I think it is a very worthwhile objective for him. I believe 
he is taking his anti-capital punishment leanings a little too far 
when he goes fishing and does not catch any fish, that is not the 
purpose of it.
<P>
	I would also suggest that success in fishing has something to do 
with virtue. Virtue is rewarded. I would be happy to take him out 
fishing with me sometime. A little of my virtue might rub off on 
him and he might have a little more luck. We will see about that.
<P>
	The issue I want to question him about has to do with the 
delegation of authority for habitat to the provincial government. It 
is common knowledge in British Columbia and I believe right 
across this nation that the current premier of British Columbia, 
Glen Clark, makes Brian Mulroney look like the truth fairy.
<P>
	When we turn something as critical as habitat over to that 
provincial government we must have some very stringent 
guidelines in place, guidelines that we know will be lived up to and 
fulfilled. Otherwise I would fear for the habitat.
<P>
	We have plenty of examples in B.C. where the provincial 
government is responsible for protection of habitat. In the last few 
years it has fallen down on the job. For example, there have been 
instances where construction of the new island highway on 
Vancouver Island has led to the desecration of good coho habitat. 
How can we turn this kind of responsibility over to that provincial 
government without some ironclad guarantees?
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would love to take the member up 
on his offer to go fishing with him but I am afraid I might get 
arrested and spend two days in the slammer and I am not sure if I 
want to do that. I will have to get certain guarantees that I will not 
be arrested when I go fishing with the member.
<P>
	The hon. member for Delta has a very good point about making 
sure that we have standards. Part of this legislation is to make sure 
that we have national standards to ensure that all provinces, when 
they manage the habitat, have signed an agreement. Within those 
agreements there will be standards to which they must adhere. I 
agree with him that we need standards but that is in the bill. Part of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6465"> 6465 </A></B>
<P>
what the bill is all about is to give those powers so that we can 
negotiate and have national standards.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member to go back to the bill. This is one of the 
main purposes of the bill, to ensure that there are national standards 
and habitats are protected. That is under the minister's 
constitutional mandate and the agreements will be there to do it.
<P>
	As much as I agree with him, I think if he reads the bill he will 
understand and recognize that his concerns have been dealt with 
under the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise this evening to speak on Bill C-62. I want to thank 
the hon. member from the Bloc. I must admit I miss these days of 
not being able to listen to him. His knowledge of the industry is 
deep and I still miss being in the fisheries committee.
<P>
	The new bill contains provisions that will authorize the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans to enter into legally binding fisheries 
management agreements with commercial licence holders, 
aboriginal organizations and other groups, for example, the 
recreational fishing industry.
<P>
	This new approach to management, or partnering as we are now 
calling it, will serve as a cornerstone for developing a new 
relationship between the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and 
fisheries stakeholders. We have heard on a couple of occasions this 
evening about the confusion that exists with regard to management 
and partnering. I would like to clarify some of those issues.
<P>
	What is partnering? It is the logical next step in the evolution of 
fisheries management. It will build on and extend their existing 
co-management approach. It will provide for a more efficient and 
effective fisheries management regime and also increase the role of 
industry stakeholders in the decision making process. It will also 
provide greater opportunities for community involvement. Like 
any partnering arrangement, co-operation cannot be imposed. It 
will be up to the stakeholders whether they wish to discuss and 
pursue fisheries management partnering with DFO.
<P>
	A partnering agreement between DFO and a group of 
stakeholders will spell out the terms and conditions on how the 
fishery will be managed for a defined period of time. It will be 
legally binding on both parties. This type of security, provided 
through a legally binding agreement where the rules of the game 
are clearly specified, is what many sectors of the industry have 
been requesting for quite some time.
<P>
	It will provide incentives for better conservation and 
management of the resource plus give fishers the certainty that will 
allow for better business decision making and as we said earlier, for 
more stable incomes.
<P>
	Discussions were held with most sectors of the industry on a 
partnering approach. In fact these discussions are  still ongoing. 
Many of the ideas which are being discussed have come directly 
from the industry. The concept is work in progress. There are still 
many important issues to sort out with stakeholders. There are 
already some fisheries in Canada where co-management, which is a 
precursor to partnering, are already in place. For example, in 
British Columbia we have a co-management process with the 
Geoduck fishery since 1990 allowing fishers ongoing input into the 
management and decision making process.
<P>
	Similar arrangements exist for halibut and sable fish fisheries 
where fishers have direct involvement in the management of their 
fishery. In Quebec, the beluga fishery has been managed since 1982 
on a co-management basis, also allowing input from aboriginal 
fisheries into the management of that fishery.
<P>
	Agreements in some of the maritime region's crab and shrimp 
fisheries provide the basis for industry to participate in the decision 
making process and to share the costs of managing the fishery and 
research.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Co-management is used in exploratory fisheries as a way to 
conduct scientific and market studies to determine if a commercial 
fishery would be sustainable and viable.
<P>
	In the maritimes, exploratory fisheries for skate, monkfish, 
Jonah or rock crab and red crab are under way. This approach is 
allowing the industry and government to learn more about these 
fisheries in terms of biology, harvesting practices and potential 
markets.
<P>
	Our goal is to continue to build on these types of initiatives. Not 
everyone is ready for change nor do they understand the concept 
fully. There are those who support the approach and have requested 
further consultation. Others wrongly view this as DFO's way to 
privatize the resource. Some have suggested that partnering is only 
for high valued lucrative fisheries. This is not the case.
<P>
	To set the record straight the following should be understood. 
Partnering will allow for joint decision making by licence holders 
on the management of the fishery. It will allow industry and 
government to work together to ensure conservation of the resource 
remains paramount.
<P>
	It must be considered for fishers in all sectors of the industry and 
for other resource users and their communities should they wish to 
explore this approach further. It requires each party, for example 
DFO and the sector, to bring something to the table. It is a two way 
street where benefits must accrue to both parties and allow for a 
more stable operating environment for fleet sectors who are 
prepared to share in the management of the fishery.
<P>
	A cornerstone of the partnering approach is that these 
agreements must be in the public interest and not give  preference 
or special treatment to individual groups. The agreements will not 
be imposed on the fishing sector. Both parties must agree on the 
terms and conditions for the agreement to come into force. It must 
complement and enhance our resource management objectives for 
the fishery, namely, the environmentally sustainable, economically 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6466"> 6466 </A></B>
<P>
viable, integrating both economic and social considerations, and 
encouraging the industry to be self-reliant.
<P>
	Both parties should adopt a flexible approach toward developing 
partnering agreements. These agreements can take on many 
different designs which will depend on individual circumstances.
<P>
	There are some things that partnering will not do. It will not 
lessen the power of the minister with respect to conservation of the 
resource or prevent the minister from taking action to address 
conservation concerns. It will not result in change in historical 
landing patterns or current management strategies to conserve the 
resource or require all fishers to enter into partnering 
arrangements.
<P>
	It should be understood that partnering may not be applicable or 
feasible in all fisheries. It will not be considered for only high 
valued lucrative fisheries. All sectors of the fishery are encouraged 
to explore the process.
<P>
	Backroom deals will not happen. All stakeholders subject to the 
agreement will be consulted with regard to the proposed 
agreement. It will not privatize the resource or result in the fishery 
being administered or managed by large corporations, nor will it be 
designed solely to pass on fisheries management costs to the 
industry.
<P>
	Partnering means for the fishing industry that it will provide the 
basis for industry to proceed on a new regime of fisheries 
management, a fishery that will have less government involvement 
and real industry input into the decision making process which is 
what has been requested of this government and other 
governments.
<P>
	Partnering will require working with fisheries in coastal 
communities to find more efficient and effective ways to manage 
their fisheries. The industry has a legitimate role to play in fisheries 
management.
<P>
	Partnership will set the framework for the industry to be more 
accountable for its actions and assume more responsibility for 
management activities specifically related to their sector. It will 
create a more stable operating environment in that DFO would 
formalize longer term allocation scenarios. This would allow for a 
stable operating environment within the industry allowing for 
longer term business planning.
<P>
	With this in mind, partnering has the potential to change the 
behaviour of fishers to focus on conservation as they become true 
stewards of the resource. In some cases partnering could mean 
sharing the financial responsibility for fisheries management and 
science.
<P>
	What does partnering mean for DFO? DFO would be able to 
evolve from being solely accountable for the management of the 
fishery to a position of shared accountability. It will continue to be 
responsible for conservation and protection of the resource. DFO 
will set the standards and audit industry performance to ensure that 
the standards are being met. It will be able to manage the fishery 
more effectively with reduced resources, focusing on its mandate 
of conservation, doing what government does best and letting the 
industry do what it does best.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Partnering will allow for direct and full dialogue with the 
industry. A typical partnering agreement will clearly set out: the 
allocation process for access to the resource; those who are in the 
fishery, and the process for additional participation in the fishery; 
mechanisms for each party to have a say in the decision making 
process; suggested sanction levels for various offences; roles and 
responsibilities for each party in the management of the fishery; 
and the financial obligations for each party.
<P>
	Where do we go from here and what will happen next? The 
legislative authority to enable DFO to enter into the partnering 
agreements has been tabled in Parliament. The new fisheries act, if 
passed, will provide the basis for the legal implementation of 
partnering agreements. Until the new act is law, legally binding 
partnering agreements with respect to management of the fishery 
cannot be entered into.
<P>
	The final details on how formalized co-management and 
eventual partnering will work will evolve through industry and 
DFO consultations. DFO has been consulting and will continue to 
consult with the industry.
<P>
	Partnering will provide an opportunity for all sectors of the 
fishing industry to speak with a more united and effective voice. It 
is in line with the Government of Canada's desire to see more 
influence flowing to the fishers and consequently to their 
communities where fishing is the mainstay, and I can say that this 
is no more true in any riding than it is in mine.
<P>
	The idea of the industry and government working together 
co-operatively to achieve joint goals and objectives makes 
common sense. Partnering has the potential to evolve as the 
management regime of choice as we proceed into the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say it had 
been a while since I had last heard my hon. colleague from St. 
John's West speak.
<P>
	I will be as brief as possible, but I just could not let what the hon. 
member for Vancouver South said at the beginning of his remarks 
pass without comment. We are hearing speeches from Liberal 
members from coast to coast, from Newfoundland to Vancouver.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6467"> 6467 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Vancouver South said that fish does not 
know boundaries. I would like to start my speech by stating that, 
at present, under the existing legislation and the proposed 
legislation as well, if we look at the situation in the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence, around Newfoundland for instance, live cod falls under 
federal jurisdiction. But when it is dead, regardless of where it 
is-be it in Newfoundland or in Gaspé, Quebec-it becomes the 
responsibility of the province, because the provinces have 
jurisdiction over processing plants. They are the ones that issue 
licences. That is why the current minister and his predecessor have 
had and still have all kinds of problems. Nothing was done about 
streamlining.
<P>
	Why do I raise this issue? Because my hon. colleague has been a 
member of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans for 
the past two years, yet, as far as I can see, this bill does not contain 
any guidelines as to the direction the industry should take in the 
future. We have heard about Brian Tobin's plans to limit fishing 
capacity, but there is not a word in here about future directions.
<P>
	Worse yet, while partnership agreements are provided for, they 
may only be entered into with the minister's approval, based on the 
opinion of the minister. I refer the hon. member to paragraph 17(1). 
It clearly states that the minister may enter into an agreement with 
any organization that, in his opinion, is representative of a class of 
persons or holders. We do not know who will be part of such a 
group. It would be very important to specify it.
<P>
	Another thing is very clear, and I wonder how the hon. member 
will be able to sell this to her constituents. I also wonder how Nova 
Scotia members will do it. It is clearly stated and the hon. member 
said it: to be part of a management agreement, one will have to pay 
new management fees, in addition to the fishing rights that people 
began paying in 1995. Such is the heritage left to them by Mr. 
Tobin.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I see that the Minister of National Revenue is with us. I hope we 
will hear from her this afternoon. This is another bonus for the 
government. Once again, it will take money from the pockets of 
fishers. I thought we had only one tax system in Canada: a person 
works, earns money and pays taxes. However, in the case of fishers, 
and the hon. member for Nova Scotia said so literally, she makes 
no bones about it, there will be two tax systems. How will she sell 
this to her constituents?
<P>
	I say this in the presence of the revenue minister, and I am very 
comfortable doing so. Maybe she will provide a reply. It was just 
indicated that Canadian fishers will be subject to two tax systems. 
They will pay when they file their tax return, but the government 
will also take money from their pockets. I would appreciate a reply 
from the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. As I said before, he has a great knowledge of the fishery.
<P>
	The member knows that this is the first time since 1868 that the 
act has been rewritten. There were a great many flaws in the act.
<P>
	As the member is well aware, the ongoing consultations have 
tried to work out for the benefit of the industry and the stakeholders 
in the industry what is the best area of jurisdiction for the provinces 
and what is the best area of jurisdiction for the federal government. 
This bill speaks to that. It outlines very clearly where the 
jurisdiction lies. That was not done by the federal government 
alone or the provinces alone; it was done in consultation with all of 
the stakeholders: the fisher people, the harvesters, the provinces, 
and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The bill is clear. It is very streamlined and simple. It outlines 
exactly what the provinces will be responsible for.
<P>
	There will be ongoing consultations. It is not a closed book. If 
something is not working, then we will talk about it and we will 
make it work.
<P>
	One of the things that will happen is that the fishery will be 
managed. It will not be open for everyone to rape and pillage as 
was done in the past. All of us know what happened to the fishery 
on the east coast. We all know what will happen to many other 
stocks if they are not managed properly.
<P>
	That is what the bill is designed to do. It is what the bill will do 
in a fair and consultative way with the provinces and the 
stakeholders.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-62.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament from British Columbia, I am pleased 
to rise on behalf of many of my constituents whose concern over 
the management of the western fisheries is far more than just 
academic. Many of my constituents and those of my colleagues 
have been and are directly impacted by government fishing 
policies. Unfortunately, this impact lately and largely has been 
detrimental due to the injustice reflected by present Liberal 
government policies.
<P>
	Bill C-62 rewrites the Fisheries Act and combines with it the 
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act.
<P>
	What do we see in the fisheries today? There are problems in the 
fisheries. Much of them are the result of government 
mismanagement. On the east coast much of the fishery is closed 
due to the collapse of the groundfish stocks. On the west coast there 
are severe problems. There are continuing problems with the 
Alaskan 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6468"> 6468 </A></B>
<P>
catch of Canadian bound salmon which remain unresolved with the 
Pacific salmon treaty.
<P>
	On the west coast we also have the salmon fishery which is our 
key fish stock. It is a fishery which is in total disarray. There have 
been almost no non-native commercial fisheries on the Fraser 
River, which borders my constituency, for the past two years. The 
government native only commercial fishery is also in disarray.
<P>
	Unfortunately the fisheries act which is before us today does 
nothing to address the foundational problems which exist in the 
government's high-handed approach to the fisheries.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	Fisheries mismanagement has already had a deep impact on the 
livelihood of many B.C. fishers. I fear that continued 
mismanagement and the mindset we have seen hold dire 
consequences for the future.
<P>
	Perhaps the most significant injustice in the present system and 
one which has received a fair amount of press coverage in my area 
is the manner in which the government has flaunted a supreme 
court decision that has literally established a race based fishery 
policy which benefits B.C.'s aboriginal fishers at the expense of the 
rest of the fishers in the province of British Columbia. In doing so 
it has trounced Canadian legal tradition and thus violated the rights 
of all Canadians.
<P>
	In 1992 the fisheries minister of the day told fishers that the 
supreme court decision of Sparrow v. the Queen required the 
establishment of an exclusive native only commercial fishery 
specifically in law. In 1995 after the Fraser report's scathing 
condemnation of the government's race based policy, the supreme 
court declared unequivocally that its previous ruling did not call for 
such a system.
<P>
	The native only commercial fishery was undermined by the 
supreme court's August 1996 Van der Peet, NTC Smokehouse and 
Gladstone decision. The court ruled against an aboriginal right. 
They have no right to an exclusive fishery. B.C. natives do not have 
a constitutional right to catch and sell fish commercially. Once the 
decision came down in August, regular commercial fishers, 
including my colleague, started to fish with the native commercial 
fisheries and had a full right to do so.
<P>
	Thus, with no mandate from the courts, no mandate from the 
Canadian people and no mandate from Parliament, this government 
today maintains an unjust and, I will say, discriminatory policy in 
the fisheries on the west coast.
<P>
	Specific to this management of the fisheries and specific to the 
item I have just mentioned, there is nothing that government can do 
under this new fisheries act that it cannot do already under existing 
legislation except, which I point out very specifically, for the right 
to extinguish the public right to fish. This essential change with 
respect to fisheries management is that the minister gains 
substantial powers to do what currently requires the specific 
authorization of Parliament or cabinet. This flies in the face of 
democracy and the good interests of the public fisheries in Canada.
<P>
	The fisheries act which Canadians hoped would restore equity in 
the system fails to do so. As a result, the Reform Party cannot 
support this bill.
<P>
	Today, I would like to take the time I have been given to read 
into the record a report that throws much light on many of the 
issues we are talking about today. It is a report written as a response 
to the Fraser River Sockeye Public Review Board. It is of note that 
this report is an evaluation commissioned by DFO on the 
performance of DFO with regard to the recommendations of the 
Fraser report which I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	I will proceed to read this response into the record so that we can 
see the whole picture and how DFO has responded to what needed 
to be done. Some of the department's responses to the 
recommendations of the Fraser report are incomplete and others 
are still under study. The comments of this evaluation fall into six 
categories: management; institutional arrangements; the quality of 
the management principles; the aboriginal fishing strategy; the 
environment; and user groups views and responsibilities.
<P>
	Under the title of management, specifically risk aversion 
management, the first recommendation is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recommend that DFO retain and exercise its constitutional responsibilities and 
not in any way abrogate its stewardship of resources under federal jurisdiction. 
Conservation must be the primary objective of both fisheries managers and all others 
participating in the fishery. The conservation ethics must prevail throughout and be 
adhered to by all.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The comments on the evaluation were:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-DFO did not achieve its escapement targets for Fraser sockeye in 1995.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-stock-specific conservation of Fraser River sockeye is threatened.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DFO cannot hope to succeed without a clear vision of what it is trying to achieve 
i.e., achieving conservation is more than just meeting escapement targets. The first 
requirement, therefore is an explicit definition of ``conservation''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There can be no conservation of Fraser sockeye salmon in the long run without 
equivalent care and protection for the habitat on which fish stocks rely. In this light, 
the pending expiration of key programs as the Fraser River Action Plan, and the 
funding base that has supported it in recent years, is of utmost concern.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In terms of outcome, however, DFO was not fully successful.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DFO came close to achieving its escapement targets in 1995-It did not, however, 
fully achieve them. There were escapement shortfalls relative to target levels for all 
major run groupings with the most significant for the late runs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6469"> 6469 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The escapement shortfalls in 1995 indicate the need for even more prudence in 
DFO's planning and management than it exhibited in 1995.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Retaining and not abrogating: DFO officials do not believe they have in any way 
abrogated their responsibilities, but recognize there is perception of this, particularly 
in commercial and recreational fisheries. DFO did not directly respond to this part of 
the recommendation or the perceptions or concerns that underlie it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Conservation must be a primary objective: Again from DFO's point of view this is 
a problem of perception, not substance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is a difference between recognition of intent and confidence in success. In 
1995, run sizes were significantly overestimated, and fishing effort was sharply 
curtailed-As a result, public confidence in DFO's ability to achieve its conservation 
goals have been underestimated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I can attest to that.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While escapement targets are above levels necessary to preserve the runs in 
aggregate, they are not in themselves necessarily adequate to preserve weaker stocks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DFO did not achieve its escapement targets because it overestimated run size both 
pre-season and in-season-DFO was not always able to curtail fishing effort as much 
as required.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Failure to meet these targets, even if it does not place the resource-in 
aggregate-at risk, does point to the challenge of ensuring that DFO's conservation 
goals are achieved.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The unprecedented poor returns in 1995 suggest that DFO may also need to 
reconsider the targets it aims to meet. There is the longstanding concern about the 
diminution of weak stocks and the growing number of strong stocks-Making 
conservation a top priority requires reconsideration of their targets themselves and 
not just how they might be more consistently achieved.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those are comments to the first recommendation. The second 
recommendation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recommend that DFO take immediate steps to initiate a process of planning 
for the future of the fishery, addressing all critical problems affecting conservation 
and sustainability, through an ongoing consultative forum. Among the problems to 
be considered would be over-capitalization, user-group allocation and ensuring 
equitable treatment under the law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Comments to this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fleet reduction, in itself, will not address the fundamental problem underlying 
over-capitalization of the fleet-the common property nature of the commercial 
fleet.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The intersectoral allocation issue may not get resolved as planned. It is not clear 
whether a supportable framework will in fact be developed and implemented.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To date, DFO has not established a broad, multi-stakeholder consultative process 
to plan for the future and address critical problems affecting conservation and 
sustainability. DFO has not identified the responsibilities and composition it should 
have, nor its relationship to existing processes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	The third recommendation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recommend that DFO and PSC adopt a risk aversion management strategy 
because of the great uncertainty on stock estimates, in season catch estimates and 
environmental problems. Conservation goals must be achieved before any other 
priorities are addressed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A risk averse strategy has not yet been developed. We found in 
our evaluation that DFO's actions were not the result of an explicit, 
well-defined risk averse management strategy, but rather were a 
response to the unprecedented events of the 1995 fishery.
<P>
	DFO's actions were not based on a well-defined risk averse 
management strategy. The question of how DFO defines risk 
averse and how risk averse is expected to promote conservation 
must be addressed. Without this clarity there is no way to test if 
DFO's activities are in fact guided by well conceived and well 
defined strategy or whether their activities in themselves define 
what DFO means by risk averse.
<P>
	The fourth recommendation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recommend that DFO, in conjunction with provincial authorities, First 
Nations, commercial and recreational fishing groups implement (both in marine and 
in-river areas) a revised system to ensure that catch information is timely and 
reliable, given that accurate counting and timely reporting of catch are fundamental 
to conservation. The system must also include a more stringent paper trail. There 
must be stricter control of landing and sales slips and a retention of sales slips with 
fish through to retail sales or export.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recommend that DFO explore the application of new technology to collect 
information on stock levels in ocean areas in order to supplement catch statistics.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	They made recommendations on institutional arrangements. We 
recommend that DFO develop better co-ordinated, inter-party 
communications among its staff and between staff and PSC, First 
Nations, commercial and recreational fishing groups with a greater 
degree of co-operation aimed at enhanced in-season management 
and post-season evaluation and at fostering working arrangements 
among all parties, and facilitate clearer and more transparent 
management and allocation policies.
<P>
	The recommendations are an institutional arrangement and there 
are a number. We recommend that DFO and PSC give First Nations 
greater and more meaningful access to and involvement in the 
management process.
<P>
	Quality management principles is another area. We recommend 
that DFO make a commitment to quality management principles in 
the management of fixed stocks by specific region and in this 
context for the third party quality auditing organization be 
contracted to provide ongoing services.
<P>
	There is a litany of recommendations and a litany of where DFO 
has fallen short in meeting these recommendations.
<P>
	I recommend to the House that the department again reviews all 
of these recommendations and the shortfalls so that, indeed, what is 
in the bill today will better reflect the well founded concerns and 
act accordingly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to put forward an amendment from 
the Reform Party. I move that the amendment be amended by 
adding:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``and that the committee report back to the House no later than June 19, 1997''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has provided her 
subamendment. The Chair will rule on it shortly. In the meantime 
the debate will continue. Questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for her submission today. I agree wholeheartedly with 
what she had to say. The one point she made which I certainly 
support is the fact that the only thing the government can do in this 
bill which it cannot do in existing legislation is to extinguish the 
public right to fish. That may not seem like much but let us look at 
the implications of it.
<P>
	Clause 17(1) says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Her Majesty in right of Canada, represented by the Minister, may enter into a 
fisheries management agreement with any organization that, in the opinion of the 
Minister, is representative of a class of persons or holders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What does that mean? It means in the first instance that the 
public right to fish is eliminated. The minister now will control the 
resource. He will be able to say to his friends that they have the 
right to capture a certain amount of the fish stocks and that is just 
the way it will be. There is no appeal when something like that 
happens.
<P>
	For instance, he could go to a lodge owner who was a good 
contributor to his party-and I am not suggesting in any way, shape 
or form that the current minister would do this, but it opens a door 
for someone to do this kind of thing in the future.
<P>
	Some minister in the future who lacked a sense of fair play and 
what is right and wrong could come to a friend who was a great 
contributor to himself or to his party and say: ``I'll give you 20,000 
fish to harvest'' and that would be it. It would be a fait accompli.
<P>
	The bill says as well in clause 19:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister shall publish a fisheries management agreement in the manner he 
sees fit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Therefore, he does not have to tell you and I that he has given 
this other individual 20,000 chinook to harvest. He does not have to 
tell anybody, except it states in clause 18 that before a fisheries 
management agreement is entered into, notice of it shall be given to 
the holders or persons likely to be subject to it.
<P>
	The only people he has to tell are the people who are liable to 
catch the fish. In the instance of a sports fishing lodge operator he 
lets the guys know who are coming to his sports lodge that yes, they 
can catch these fish because he has this agreement with the minister 
that  gives him the right to do it, but the public does not have to 
know.
<P>
	How does that affect us? If we take my friend from Labrador 
who spoke earlier or we take into consideration my friend from 
Vancouver South who spoke of his history of two trips out sports 
fishing, what that means is that they could be barred from fishing 
simply because somebody else has been secretly given the right to 
catch those fish.
<P>
	The impact is on the public. It is on the individuals. It is on you 
and me and anybody else who wants access to that resource. We 
will lose it. We lose access to the resource.
<P>
	The member for Vancouver Quadra said here the other day that 
we did not understand the section of the Magna Carta that dealt 
with the public right to fish because we did not speak the language 
that the Magna Carta was written in, so how could we understand 
it. He was casting aspersions on the Supreme Court of Canada 
because as recently as last August in the Gladstone case the 
supreme court acknowledged that the public right to fish has 
existed since the time of the Magna Carta. That public right can 
only be extinguished by competent legislation, in other words by 
legislation which passes through this House.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	How the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra could say we 
cannot justify the public right to fish and the existence of that with 
reference to the Magna Carta is beyond me. The Supreme Court of 
Canada can do it and certainly we can too.
<P>
	What happens if we extinguish that public right to fish and we 
give the minister the authority to dispense fish to his friends? We 
open the door to all sorts of secret arrangements and pay-offs, 
pay-offs from the public purse so to speak, from the public 
treasury. This is a resource owned by all Canadians yet it could be 
doled out and given to whomever the minister sees fit, to 
whomever he wants to make that donation. That is totally 
unacceptable. It is something I do not think the people of British 
Columbia can tolerate. It is certainly something that this House 
should not tolerate as well.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. I believe we are now into private 
members' time.
<P>
	The ruling with respect to the subamendment will be made the 
next time the matter is called. The member will have the right to 
reply to the question from her colleague the next time the matter is 
called.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-284, an act to amend an act for the Recognition and 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and to 
amend the Constitution Act, 1867, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, in May of this year I introduced Bill 
C-284. I sent an information package to every member of 
Parliament describing why protection of property rights should be 
strengthened and how this should be and could be accomplished 
without amending the charter of rights and freedoms. In the 
package I described the three main reasons that government should 
aggressively defend every person's right to own, use and enjoy 
property, namely: property rights make society richer; property 
rights protect freedom and democracy; and property rights protect 
the environment.
<P>
	No doubt government members are getting tired of debating 
property rights. The reason Reformers continue to bring the issue 
to the floor of the House of Commons is that Canadians' property 
rights are not adequately protected in Canada.
<P>
	Property rights were first debated by Reformers on February 24, 
1995 when the hon. member for Skeena introduced Motion M-301 
which proposed an amendment to add property rights to section 7 
of the charter of rights and freedoms. The Liberal government 
opposed protection of property rights.
<P>
	This year the member for Comox-Alberni introduced Motion 
M-205 which proposed to strengthen the property rights provisions 
of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Motion M-205 was debated on 
June 10, September 30 and November 5. The Liberals opposed 
protection of property rights during debate and voted against 
Motion M-205 on November 6, 1996, believe it or not.
<P>
	Because Motion M-205 was votable and similar to my bill, the 
subcommittee for private members' business decided that my Bill 
C-284 would not be votable. The subcommittee's decision wasted 
literally hundreds of hours of effort and research on behalf of my 
own office. It wasted some of the fine legal analysis and drafting by 
the House of Commons legislative counsel branch. It is sad that the 
Liberals are more interested in their own social engineering than in 
protecting the fundamental rights of Canadian citizens.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	Motion M-205 and Bill C-284 outline the specific property 
rights that need to be better protected in federal law. However my 
bill goes further by describing the legislative means needed to 
implement these improved property rights protections.
<P>
	I want to make all Canadians aware of the obvious contradictions 
in the Liberal government's opposition to improving property 
rights protection. I want to point out how the Liberal government of 
the nineties is totally at odds with the position which Liberal 
governments took on property rights during the sixties, seventies 
and eighties. Today's Liberal government opposes strengthening 
the protection of property rights in the Canadian bill of rights, 
while the Liberal governments of the sixties, seventies and eighties 
argued forcefully and repeatedly for the inclusion of property rights 
in the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	Where did the Liberal government lose its vision? When did 
Liberals decide to oppose strengthening every person's property 
rights? Was it when the current Prime Minister took over?
<P>
	It is odd that while the Liberals were being led by the Right Hon. 
Pierre Trudeau they aggressively supported including the 
protection of property rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, but now that I call for the strengthening of property 
rights they have changed their minds. Now that Mr. Trudeau's 
strong philosophical and ideological principles about fundamental 
rights and freedoms are no longer guiding the Liberal Party, it does 
an about face on strengthening the protection of one of our 
democracy's most important fundamental rights, that being 
property rights.
<P>
	Unfortunately and contrary to what today's Liberals are saying, 
Canadians do not have these rights and protections under federal 
law. The only protection Canadians have to turn to if the federal 
government arbitrarily takes their property is the Canadian bill of 
rights. Unfortunately, the Canadian bill of rights falls far short of 
providing the protection which every Canadian thinks they now 
have.
<P>
	We each have seven fundamental property rights. The bill of 
rights only provides rather feeble protection for three out of the 
seven: the right to the enjoyment of property; the right not to be 
deprived of property except by due process; and the right to a fair 
hearing. Those are the only three. Even these rights can simply be 
overridden by saying so in the legislation. They are rather weak, 
feeble and quite useless, just like what the Liberal government did 
with Bill C-22 which cancelled the Pearson airport contract.
<P>
	Unfortunately for Canadians, if the government does decide to 
arbitrarily take a person's property, the Canadian bill of rights does 
not provide protection for the following property rights. There are 
four of them which are not adequately protected: the right to be 
paid fair compensation; the right to have compensation fixed 
arbitrarily; the right to receive timely compensation; and the right 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6472"> 6472 </A></B>
<P>
to apply to the courts to obtain justice if they  feel that any aspect of 
their property rights has been denied or infringed upon.
<P>
	That is why we need to improve the bill of rights. That is why we 
need to strengthen the protection of property rights in federal law 
by passing motions such as M-301, M-205 and bills such as Bill 
C-284 which we are discussing today.
<P>
	On June 10, 1996 the hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill 
River, Saskatchewan, who is also the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Justice, outlined the Liberal government's reasons 
for opposing better protection of property rights. He said in 
summary that there is already more than adequate protection for 
property rights. He said that the laws already provide fair 
procedures and fair compensation and that common law already 
provides the presumption of compensation. He said that much of 
the responsibility for regulating property is provincial. He said that 
it would establish a hierarchy of rights in the bill of rights. Finally, 
he said that it may prevent socially useful legislation.
<P>
	In my speech to the House on November 5, 1996 I destroyed 
these pitiful excuses one by one. I exposed the real reason that the 
Liberals oppose property rights, namely, it would affect their social 
engineering agenda. I made it abundantly clear. I refer people to the 
<I>Hansard</I> record of that day to read how those arguments were 
destroyed.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	The Liberal Party under the leadership of Pierre Trudeau was not 
afraid of entrenching property rights in the Constitution. However, 
the Liberal Party of the 1990s is afraid that even strengthening 
protection of property rights in federal law as proposed in my bill 
will interfere with its plans to re-engineer Canadian society.
<P>
	I first became interested in property rights during the debate on 
Bill C-68, the Liberal government's half-baked, tax wasting 
scheme to register every rifle and shotgun legally owned by every 
law-abiding citizen in Canada. That was when I became aware of 
the lack of property rights in Canada. That bill will affect 20 
million legally owned firearms owned by five to eight million 
law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	It did not deter Liberal social engineers that this half a billion 
dollar expenditure of public funds would not in any way reduce the 
criminal use of firearms or that it would not improve public safety. 
Liberals believe that they need to tax anything that moves and is 
healthy and if it continues to move it needs to be regulated. When it 
stops moving, I think they believe they have to subsidize it.
<P>
	As I read Bill C-68 I came to understand that the most dangerous 
part of Bill C-68 was not the flawed registration scheme but it was 
the absolute power the justice minister was giving himself and 
those government ministers that follow him. The most dangerous 
part of  Bill C-68 is the absolute lack of respect and protection for 
property rights of Canadian citizens.
<P>
	Just as a little aside, the debate we just had today in regard to 
fisheries and the debates we have been having in so many areas 
over the past three years impact on property rights. The ministers in 
the legislation in this House are giving themselves absolute rights 
and are taking away the rights of the Canadian people. Those rights 
need to be protected.
<P>
	The lawyers in the Library of Parliament who analysed my bill 
cited C-68 as a bill that would be affected by property rights. They 
themselves zeroed in on C-68 as being one of the bills that would 
be affected. With the passage of Bill C-68 the Minister of Justice 
prohibited or banned over half a million already registered 
handguns and thousands of rifles, all firearms that are commonly 
used for hunting and sporting purposes.
<P>
	As a consequence, the minister dramatically reduced the value of 
these firearms and all but eliminated the market for the sale of 
these firearms. With the passage of Bill C-68, the Liberal 
government violated the fundamental property rights of hundreds 
of thousands of sports shooters, farmers, hunters, fishermen, 
collectors, aboriginals and even museums that own firearms.
<P>
	Section 117.15 of Bill C-68 grants the Minister of Justice 
through the governor in council the powers to prohibit any firearm 
which in his opinion is not reasonable for hunting or sporting 
purposes. Section 84(1)(e) of the Criminal Code of Canada used to 
prevent the prohibition of any firearm commonly used for hunting 
and sporting purposes but no longer. The Minister of Justice can 
ban any firearm he thinks is bad regardless of how safely the 
firearm is being used. What the firearm is being used for or how 
many Canadians are legally using this type of firearm makes no 
difference.
<P>
	The Liberal government has given the Minister of Justice the 
absolute power to ban every firearm in Canada. Not even the 
Supreme Court of Canada could overturn his decision no matter 
how ridiculous because the legislation states ``in his opinion''.
<P>
	There are a few Canadians who might agree with the Minister of 
Justice if he banned all guns. However, I ask everyone to consider 
this very scary truth because it can happen: if it can happen to one 
type of property such as firearms, it can happen to anything that a 
citizen owns. We do not have strong, effective property rights 
protection protecting Canadians from their own government. It 
could affect land. It could affect businesses. All types of property 
could be at risk. I have many other examples but I am citing some 
of the ones I am most familiar with. Section 119 of Bill C-68 even 
gives the Minister of Justice the power to make firearm regulations 
or ban firearms without parliamentary review if, again in his 
opinion, that fatal phrase, the regulation he proposes is urgent, 
immaterial or insubstantial.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6473"> 6473 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Section 116(2) of the Criminal Code used to require the justice 
minister to lay every regulation before Parliament at least 30 days 
before its effective date, but no more.
<P>
	So here we have a prime example of the Liberal government's 
overriding the fundamental property rights of hundreds of 
thousands of law-abiding citizens. The value of the firearms 
banned by the Minister of Justice is the property of the persons who 
own the firearms. All they have is some very limited protection in 
the Canadian Bill of Rights. All other rights and freedoms are 
protected under the charter of rights and freedoms but not property 
rights.
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves why were property rights omitted from 
the charter of rights and freedoms but all other rights contained in 
the Canadian Bill of Rights were put into the charter.
<P>
	Here are some other examples of how government runs 
roughshod over property rights. Under the guise of improving the 
environment the government can pass laws which restrict the use of 
private land. Private property owners are already concerned that 
Bill C-65, the Liberal government's endangered species act 
legislation, may be extended to include federal government control 
over endangered species on private lands.
<P>
	While this bill is before Parliament there is time to clarify this 
point. But what if the government arbitrarily decided to extend the 
endangered species act to cover private lands? What protection 
does the individual property owner have? The answer is no 
constitutional protection whatever, only the very limited protection 
under the Canadian Bill of Rights. That is what I am proposing to 
change. I am not proposing a constitutional amendment but simply 
to strengthen the Canadian Bill of Rights so we have something at 
least.
<P>
	The federal government also reveals its arbitrary abuse of 
individual property rights by imposing monopolies on grain 
producers in the west. A farmer in western Canada can grow wheat 
and barley but he can sell it only with the permission of the federal 
government, the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Some farmers have proven they can get more money for their 
wheat and barley by selling it in the United States than to the 
Canadian Wheat Board but they are denied the opportunity to get 
their extra value from the sale of their property and the fruits of 
their labour by government decree backed up by government force. 
Some of them have their trucks seized. Some of them face heavy 
fines. Some of them have gone to jail for trying to do what every 
other property owner takes for granted, selling their private 
property.
<P>
	Here are just three examples of the federal government's power 
to arbitrarily take property to control it. The Pearson airport deal is 
another example which is remarkable in that it was revealed that 
Americans investing in Canada have more property rights under 
the North American Free Trade Agreement than Canadians 
investors have under Canadian law. That is shocking.
<P>
	I am not saying that it is wrong for the government not to take 
property. What I am saying is that if the government does take a 
person's property they need to have better protection for their 
property rights.
<P>
	Bill C-284 would extend property rights protection in the 
Canadian Bill of Rights for all seven fundamental property rights, 
including the right to fair and timely compensation, the right to 
have compensation fixed impartially, the right to apply to the 
courts to obtain justice.
<P>
	Further, property rights would be extended to include not just 
future bills passed by the House of Commons but would include 
any law in force in Canada and any order, rule or regulation passed 
by Parliament. Bill C-284 goes much further than just expanding 
the description of each person's property rights. My bill introduces 
a number of measures which come as close as possible to 
entrenching property rights in federal law.
<P>
	The first measure proposes that a person can be deprived of their 
property rights only if it can be demonstrably justified in a free and 
democratic society. This means that the federal government can 
still deprive a person of their property. However, the government 
must be able to prove that the taking of the property serves some 
reasonable and justifiable public purpose. The prohibition 
measures in Bill C-68 would just not pass this test.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	The second measure proposes that in order to override the 
enhanced property rights protection in the Canadian Bill of Rights 
the government would have to pass ``a declaration of 
notwithstanding'' with a super majority vote, which means a 
two-thirds majority of the members of the House of Commons. 
This demonstrates that sometimes fundamental rights need to be 
overridden by government for the greater good of society, but it 
should not be easy for government to do so.
<P>
	Third, my bill proposes that a declaration of notwithstanding 
would be automatically repealed by using a five year sunset clause. 
This guarantees that if the government decides to override property 
rights in a bill it must be automatically reviewed by Parliament 
every five years and must pass another super majority vote in the 
House.
<P>
	Finally, my bill proposes an amendment to the Constitution to 
permit the use of the super majority vote and comes as close as we 
can to entrenching this measure into federal law by requiring a 
super majority vote in the House to change it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6474"> 6474 </A></B>
<P>
	A lot of work has gone into this bill, only to have the Liberals 
avoid the issue by declaring it non-votable. Because property 
rights were omitted from the charter of rights and freedoms, they 
should be strengthened in the Canadian Bill of Rights. That is what 
I am proposing. It is the second best choice, because the Canadian 
Bill of Rights is not entrenched in the Constitution. That could 
be changed, if necessary, by Parliament. Again, I am proposing 
a two-thirds majority vote.
<P>
	The Library of Parliament has done an excellent analysis of my 
bill. I recommend that all members read it before they decide 
whether this is a good bill or not.
<P>
	Even the courts of Canada have been very timid in protecting 
property rights because they are not strongly protected. This bill 
would address that problem. The courts have had to invent the 
applicable standards with regard to property rights, something they 
have not done very well.
<P>
	Canadians at present are second class citizens in the world of 
international trade. Our main trading partners all have stronger 
property rights than we have as Canadians. That puts us at a very 
distinct disadvantage.
<P>
	I have a little time left. I wonder, if I would be silent for a few 
moments and not say a word, would it make any difference? When 
I listen to the debate that takes place in this House and I see 
members vote, I wonder if they were even listening when the 
debate took place.
<P>
	We were given the impression that there would be free votes on 
Private Members' Business. Will that be the case with this bill? Is 
there any point to going through all of this exercise and all the work 
which has been put into this bill?
<P>
	I really appeal to members of the House to take a close look. 
Remember, property rights are fundamental. We have to have 
property rights if we want to have a strong society.
<P>
	In light of all the work which has been done on this bill, I ask for 
the unanimous consent of the House to send the bill to the Standing 
Committee on Human Rights.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, is there unanimous 
consent to refer the bill to committee?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member does not have 
unanimous consent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased this evening to have the opportunity to speak to Bill 
C-284, brought forward by the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville. The bill  proposes that the Canadian Bill of 
Rights be changed to provide further protection pursuant to 
property rights.
<P>
	The Canadian Bill of Rights is part of Canada's longstanding 
tradition to human rights. The bill has included provisions 
protecting property rights since it has been in force. Section 1 of 
the bill of rights recognizes the right of the individual to life, 
liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property and the 
right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Property rights are also protected at the federal level by statute 
and common law. Federal statutes that regulate the disposition of 
property have been designed to ensure that people are treated fairly. 
That is, these laws provide for fair procedures and for fair 
compensation where property rights are affected.
<P>
	Property rights are also protected at the provincial level. For 
example, the Alberta Individual Rights Protection Act protects the 
ownership of property by a due a process clause. The Quebec 
Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms provides some protection 
to the peaceful enjoyment and free disposition of his or her 
property.
<P>
	The common law also protects property rights. For example, 
judges frequently apply the presumption of compensation where 
someone is deprived of their property.
<P>
	It is important to remember that the Constitution assigns much 
of the responsibility for regulating property to the provinces. In 
fact, section 92(13) of the Constitution Act provides that the 
provinces have exclusive power to make laws relating to property 
and civil rights in the province.
<P>
	That is not to say that the federal government cannot legislate in 
ways that affect property, but that its jurisdiction is limited in these 
respects.
<P>
	On the whole, the average Canadian enjoys a very high level of 
protection for property rights under the statutes and the common 
law applicable at the federal level, including already the Canadian 
Bill of Rights.
<P>
	I would venture to say this is generally true at the provincial 
level as well. This protection reflects the value that we as 
Canadians place on property rights. The right to own things, a 
home, a car or other possessions, is basic to our way of life. The 
right to use and dispose of property is also fundamental, although 
we recognize that these are not unlimited rights, which the hon. 
member for Yorkton-Melville recognized very explicitly in his 
speech.
<P>
	In Canada we place a very high value on property rights, the 
right to own many of our possessions. The right to use or dispose of 
the property is also very fundamental to our way of life. These 
rights we value very highly in this country of ours. These property 
rights are ingrained in our legal system. They are ingrained in 
statutes at the federal level. They are ingrained in statutes at the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6475"> 6475 </A></B>
<P>
provincial level. They are ingrained in human rights legislation at 
the federal level and within the common law.
<P>
	In fact, a basic premise of our legal system is the right to own 
and dispose of property. Our laws, whether legislated or judge 
made, are replete with examples of rules concerning the ownership 
and use of property.
<P>
	For example, our laws concerning real property, lands and 
buildings contain many rules protecting both purchasers and 
vendors. Thus when I consider the broad range of legislation and 
judicial precedence that protects property rights, it is not clear to 
me that the solution offered by the hon. member provides any 
further protection. Taking that into account, it is important to 
reflect on what the proposed amendment would actually do.
<P>
	It singles out property rights from all the other rights in the 
Canadian Bill of Rights for very special protection. Again, section 
1 of the Canadian Bill of Rights recognizes the rights of the 
individual to life, to liberty, to security of the person and enjoyment 
of property.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	Out of all those very fundamental rights to Canadians, the 
Reform Party tries to raise property rights up for special protection. 
It seems that all of these rights are very important. When one 
considers the right to life and liberty, certainly one would not raise 
the value of property higher than those very special and important 
rights to all of Canadians.
<P>
	I do not understand why we would want to have this particular 
amendment. It would end up establishing a hierarchy of rights in 
the Canadian Bill of Rights which would not be appropriate. Each 
of the rights in the Canadian Bill of Rights is of equal importance. 
They are all very important. To say that one is more important than 
the other would not be appropriate.
<P>
	The Canadian Bill of Rights is historically significant. It 
represents one of the first steps toward a constitutionally 
entrenched bill of rights. Just over 20 years after the Canadian Bill 
of Rights was enacted, we did provide constitutional protections in 
the form of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Since 
then our energies have been focused on the charter. In light of that 
evolution, I do not think we should be revisiting the Canadian Bill 
of Rights.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the right to own and dispose of property 
is not an unlimited right. It is limited by laws that regulate the use 
of property in the public interest. For example, land use, planning 
and zoning laws may limit the type of building that can be placed 
on residential lots. They may limit the type of construction in 
certain types of business districts.
<P>
	Environmental laws regulate everything from the disposal of 
hazardous waste to the removal of trees. There are laws that 
regulate the ownership of transactions and shares in limited 
companies. Other laws regulate bankruptcy and the ownership of 
land by non-Canadians and so on. All of these laws impose real 
limits on the ownership and use of property.
<P>
	No one disputes that these are necessary limits in a free and 
democratic society. When that is realized, it is incumbent on us to 
think carefully about the implications of amending the property 
rights protection in a general human rights document.
<P>
	I am concerned about what effect a general and broad provision 
on property rights may have on these laws. I am equally concerned 
that socially important legislation could be challenged in the courts 
on the basis of such considerations.
<P>
	The United States has had considerable experience with property 
rights and we can learn from its experience. Initially constitutional 
property rights were used in the United States to prevent socially 
useful legislation such as regulating hours of work. Later on the 
courts adopted a more enlightened view but still attempts to 
regulate the environment or trade in endangered birds or land use 
have been met with court challenges based on conflict with 
property rights in the American bill of rights. This sort of general 
provision has complicated the regulation of whole varieties of 
areas germane to the public interest.
<P>
	Canadian courts have demonstrated that they will go their own 
way in interpreting the provisions of the charter and our other 
human rights laws. However, the proposed amendments would 
leave us with uncertainty about the meaning of property rights and 
the effect of the amendment on a wide variety of laws that touch on 
property in one way or the other.
<P>
	I certainly have a great deal of sympathy for the purpose behind 
Bill C-284. Like the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville, I feel 
very strongly about the importance of property rights in our society 
and legal system.
<P>
	Having said that, I would also say that so far as I am concerned 
we have more than adequate protections in our statute law and 
common law for property rights. Not only do I not see the necessity 
for the proposed amendment to the Canadian Bill of Rights but I 
am also concerned in some respects about its impact.
<P>
	In light of the American experience I would think it far better 
that we continue to rely on the very extensive protections of 
property rights that already exist in our laws. For these reasons I 
cannot support the bill.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	When we look at the history of our nation, the history of the 
evolution of property rights within the common  law system, going 
back to the system of law evolving in many provinces and in the 
national government from the common law of England, we have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6476"> 6476 </A></B>
<P>
that basis. The basis is stated in many statutes designed to protect 
property rights from the actions of government or other 
individuals. This is both at the federal and provincial levels. At the 
municipal level these would be covered by provincial statute.
<P>
	All of these types of protections are offered our citizens as we 
enjoy property of various types. The protection of our property is 
important. Our common law and statute law are absolutely replete 
with examples of how we seek to protect and ensure that our 
citizens can enjoy their property fully and completely without 
fetter, without hindrance from other individuals, government and 
so on.
<P>
	While the hon. member's bill is well intended, I believe that if 
we closely examine the protections that are currently available to 
all citizens of Canada-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as our colleague, the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville, has mentioned, this is the third time the House 
has had an opportunity to debate property rights. On each occasion, 
we have heard the same arguments from both sides of the House.
<P>
	I listened very carefully to the member for Yorkton-Melville, 
and the least one can say is that our colleagues in the Reform Party 
are consistent and persistent, because, as I said, we are now looking 
at the third bill or motion concerning property rights. On each 
occasion, the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, opposed this 
kind of motion and was even more strongly opposed to a bill, 
although the bill now before us is not votable.
<P>
	Why is the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, opposed to a 
bill with a purpose like that of the bill brought forward by the 
member for Yorkton-Melville?
<P>
	In his speech, our colleague mentioned two or three of the 
reasons he introduced this bill. First of all was the fact that 
recognizing property rights makes society richer and also provides 
better protection for the environment. In the same vein, he pointed 
out that these rights are not protected by existing legislation.
<P>
	I will show, in the few minutes available to me, that property 
rights are recognized by both our federal and our provincial 
legislation, and I will refer to the situation in Quebec.
<P>
	In his speech, our colleague also mentioned that it was not the 
purpose of his bill to amend the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, in other words to introduce a constitutional amendment.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	I want to say right away that this argument will not wash. Unless 
I misunderstood or misread clause 6 of Bill C-284, it is clear that 
the purpose of this bill is among other things to amend the 
Constitution Act, 1867 to reinforce property rights so that, as 
provided in clause 6, every time a bill would have the effect of 
modifying property rights, its passage would require the support of 
two-thirds of the members of this House. Clause 6 also proposes to 
amend the Constitutional Act, 1867 so as to recognize the principle 
to which I just referred.
<P>
	I think it is quite clear, although I am not a constitutional expert, 
that what my Reform colleague wants is a constitutional 
amendment with all its troublesome implications.
<P>
	That being said, the real issue in this debate is whether in our 
society, in Canada and in Quebec, property rights are recognized. 
Can individuals across Canada acquire property or goods and 
dispose of them as they wish, always with due respect for the law? 
Is this actually the case?
<P>
	When we look at the situation in Quebec, the answer is an 
unqualified yes. The Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
specifically recognizes property rights. Section 6 of the Quebec 
Charter Rights and Freedoms says that every person has the right to 
peaceful enjoyment and free disposition of his property, within the 
limits provided by law.
<P>
	In other words, in practice this section means that yes, every 
person has a right to property which allows him to purchase goods, 
movable or immovable, and to dispose of them as he sees fit, 
always within the limits of the law. That is what we must remember 
in this debate. The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to adopting this 
legislation but recognizes property rights as a basic right that is 
currently protected by our statutes, both federal and provincial, and 
which in our view does not need additional protection.
<P>
	Another point. If by some misfortune this kind of bill were 
adopted by the House and if by some even greater misfortune, a 
constitutional amendment were tabled to recognize property rights 
in the Constitution, in the charter of rights and freedoms, this 
would have far reaching consequences for the way our institutions 
operate in each province, and especially in Quebec.
<P>
	It would mean that all legislation passed, previously, now or in 
the future, with the aim of limiting or circumscribing the right to 
property must come under our basic law, which is the Constitution.
<P>
	I have a few examples of potential consequences. The Secretary 
of State for Justice mentioned a few earlier, but I think it is 
important to repeat some of the basic ones.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Quebec has agricultural lands protection legislation, which was 
passed nearly 20 years ago by the PQ government of René 
Lévesque. It naturally limits property rights. It circumscribes the 
right by limiting the acquisition of agricultural lands and by 
preventing any change in their status in agricultural terms when 
they are sold.
<P>
	If there were an amendment like the one proposed by our 
colleague, could people challenge this legislation right up to the 
Supreme Court and risk, essentially, the revocation of legislation 
sought by all Quebecers, which still today despite difficulties in 
applying it meets with everyone's approval?
<P>
	The scenario is the same in the case of legislation on income 
security. Under this legislation in Quebec, known as the Loi sur 
l'aide sociale, an individual may not own a building worth more 
than $50,000 without his social security being affected. Such a 
provision, clearly, limits the right to property. Does this mean that 
the Government of Quebec or another province wanting to keep 
such a provision could find itself stymied before the higher courts 
if a bill such as the one proposed by our Reform colleague were 
passed?
<P>
	Other provisions also lead us to conclude that existing 
legislation, or provincial powers to legislate on property matters, is 
quite adequate to permit both enjoyment of the right to property 
and to offset this right with all of our social rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to speak to my colleague's private 
member's bill, Bill C-284, which proposes to strengthen and 
protect individual property rights through a number of legislative 
measures.
<P>
	The member and I have worked together because I had a similar 
votable motion, No. 205, which was debated in the House on June 
10, September 30 and November 5. The procedure was very 
interesting because I received a number of inquiries from Liberal 
members who were interested in the bill. Since it was a private 
member's bill they would have the opportunity to vote impartially, 
so-called.
<P>
	However, when it came time to vote every Liberal voted against 
the motion. It is very rare in the House that on a private member's 
motion all members of a party will vote the same way. It was clear 
from my perspective that Liberal members had been told not to 
vote for the motion. The reason was it would have embarrassed the 
government on Bill C-68 dealing with firearms. It would have 
embarrassed the government on the endangered species act, 
because if a specific plant grew on your land, a little extension of 
this legislation could mean that the government could move in and 
take the land without compensation. This is where the Liberals are 
coming from.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-284 would guarantee that every person has the right to the 
enjoyment of that person's property and the right not to be deprived 
of that property unless the person is accorded a fair hearing, paid 
fair compensation, the amount of that compensation is fixed by an 
impartial person, and the compensation is paid within a reasonable 
amount of time.
<P>
	It does not tie the government's hands. Reform is saying that if 
we take something away for the public good then the owner must 
be compensated. This is not rocket science. The Americans have it, 
other provinces and countries have it, yet when comes to Canada 
this appears to be somewhat vague.
<P>
	In addition to the property rights provision proposed in my 
motion, Bill C-284 proposes specific legislative measures to 
strengthen and protect the bill of rights.
<P>
	Section 7 of the charter of rights and freedoms provides:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not 
to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental 
justice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Canadians believe in a free and democratic society, fundamental 
justice and the necessity for fairness. Most believe that property 
rights are among those very basic rights. Yet property rights, as 
opposed to what the member from the Bloc would say, are not 
protected. I want to make that very clear. There is no guarantee of 
fair treatment by the courts, tribunals or officials who have the 
power over individuals or corporations. There is simply no reason 
why a government should have the freedom to expropriate private 
property without fair, just and timely compensation, and this is 
what this bill is about.
<P>
	In the past there have been many attempts to deal with private 
property concerns and I will run by a bit of history on where we are 
going.
<P>
	In 1960 John Diefenbaker introduced and passed the Canadian 
Bill of Rights. The bill of rights includes property rights yet the 
guarantee of protection is marginal at best. There is no provision 
that government must pay just compensation whenever it 
expropriates property.
<P>
	Former Prime Minister Trudeau fought to include property rights 
in the charter of rights and freedoms, yet the Liberals have voted 
down my motion, the same Liberals across the floor of this House. 
It just does not make any sense; a former prime minister pushing 
for rights and yet these people across the floor are opposed to them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6478"> 6478 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1968 Mr. Trudeau as the minister of justice tabled a Canadian 
charter of human rights which included protection of property 
rights.
<P>
	In 1969 Prime Minister Trudeau wrote that the charter should 
protect the right of the individual to the enjoyment of property.
<P>
	In 1978 Mr. Trudeau's constitutional amendment bill included a 
clause representing fundamentally the same protection he had 
suggested 10 years earlier.
<P>
	In 1980 Trudeau attempted to include the property rights clause 
in the proposed charter.
<P>
	As minister of justice our current Prime Minister supported 
Trudeau's attempt to include property rights in the charter of rights 
and freedoms. The Prime Minister described property rights as ``a 
central value of our society and an essential agreement for the 
charter, a right which all Canadians should have regardless of 
where they live in our country''.
<P>
	I am disappointed that our present Prime Minister did not stand 
by his words and vote for property rights in this House.
<P>
	In 1982 Pierre Trudeau made the last attempt to include property 
rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In 1982 
property rights were left out of the charter and Canadians were 
denied property rights once again. In 1988 the House voted 
overwhelmingly to support a motion that proposed: ``The 1982 
Constitution Act be amended in order to recognize the right of 
enjoyment of property and the right not to be deprived thereof 
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice and 
in keeping with the tradition of the usual federal provincial 
consultative process''.
<P>
	This was passed in the House with a majority of 108 votes of 
support versus 16 against.
<P>
	Clearly this points out that through the 20 years in the history of 
this House various administrations have supported private property 
rights. It did not get that far and it is not in legislation, but the 
leaders have supported it. Yet here we have the crowd across the 
floor trashing it again. Property rights were removed from the 
Charlottetown accord against the wishes of many Canadians. I 
would suggest that is one of the reasons why the Charlottetown 
accord failed. Any attempts to entrench property rights within the 
charter have failed.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	My colleague's bill, Bill C-284, avoids concern about federal 
interference in provincial jurisdiction. Bill C-284 applies only to 
federal law and to operations of the federal government. That is 
important. It does not tromp on provincial territory, as the Bloc 
member was saying.
<P>
	Most provinces support the entrenchment of property rights. 
British Columbia, Ontario and New Brunswick have passed 
resolutions supporting the inclusion of property rights in the 
charter. In a 1987 Gallup poll 87  per cent of the people supported 
increased property right protection. It is there. The Canadian 
people want it and yet the Liberals refuse to recognize it.
<P>
	Many national organizations have also come out in favour of 
greater protection for property rights, including the Canadian Bar 
Association, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Canadian 
Real Estate Association, to mention but a few. The United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, signed by Canada in 1948, 
commits Canada to the protection of property rights. Article 17 
reads: ``Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in 
association with others. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of this 
property''. That was signed by Canada in 1948 and here we are, 50 
years later, still arguing about it.
<P>
	A number of other democratic countries have already taken the 
lead, as I suggested earlier. The United States, Germany, Italy and 
Finland all have private property rights. Why is it that we in 
Canada, supposedly the best country in the world, do not have 
protection for individual property rights? It is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	The fifth amendment of the United States constitution, adopted 
in 1791, provides that the federal government cannot deprive 
anyone of life, liberty or property without the due process of law 
and also stipulates that private property cannot be taken for public 
use without just compensation.
<P>
	Canada alone among the industrialized nations does not grant 
some form of constitutional protection to property ownership. I do 
not understand why this government refuses to grant Canadians the 
protection which was agreed to almost 50 years ago.
<P>
	Protecting property rights does not diminish the rights which 
Canadians already have or prevent the government from carrying 
out its duties for the common good of the nation.
<P>
	Amending the charter of rights and freedoms requires the 
support, as my colleague said, of two-thirds of the provinces and 50 
per cent of the population. Amending the Canadian Bill of Rights, 
as proposed by this bill and by my Motion No. 205, could be 
accomplished in the House.
<P>
	Protection of these rights has been supported by all sides of the 
House in the past and this is the time to move forward.
<P>
	In conclusion, the protection of individual property rights is a 
fundamental freedom which must be protected. It is time that the 
government took a serious look at property rights and put aside 
partisan concerns to work together for the common good of the 
people. I will be supporting my colleague in this bill.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6479"> 6479 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
very much like to thank all of the members who have participated 
in the debate. I appreciate it very much. I have listened carefully 
to their comments.
<P>
	I would like to reply briefly to some of the comments. I do not 
know if it will do much good to argue this because people have 
already decided that they will not vote on it. However, to Canadians 
it is a very important issue. They are out there listening and they 
are going to make the final decision on who is right with regard to 
all this.
<P>
	I would like to make a few comments in reply to the hon. 
member for Prince Albert-Churchill River. He was in error when 
he said that the federal government cannot override property rights 
because it is an area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I would like to point out one area in which the government did it 
and I will tell the House how it did it. Again, I have been battling 
Bill C-68, the useless gun registration legislation which was 
brought down. How did the government override the rights of 
law-abiding gun owners to own their property? It completely 
devalued a lot of property by outlawing certain firearms. How did 
the government do that? By putting the legislation into the 
Criminal Code of Canada it overrode the rights of the provinces to 
regulate it. Otherwise this legislation would have been thrown out 
by the courts. So it has found a way to circumvent the rights of the 
provinces to regulate private property by entrenching it in the 
Criminal Code of Canada. I am hoping the courts will see what it 
has done.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	Let us look at the Pearson airport deal. How did the government 
manage to do that? It is the same thing.
<P>
	I would also like to point out to my hon. Bloc colleague that this 
legislation only affects the federal government. It does not interfere 
in matters that he was describing within the province of Quebec.
<P>
	The member for Prince Albert said that they value property 
rights, that they are ingrained. That is false and I gave three 
examples of how they have been completely disregarded. When he 
said we do not need further protection, that was also false.
<P>
	All the lawyers who have analysed it have said and have agreed 
that this is needed. Listen to what the bar association or the 
chambers of commerce and other organizations have said.
<P>
	The member said there is a hierarchy of rights in the Canadian 
bill of rights. I explained that it has to be put in the Canadian bill of 
rights because it is not in the charter. He never explained why it has 
never been in included in the charter of rights and freedoms, a very 
critical omission.
<P>
	The member also never answered why his government protects 
foreigners better than it protects Canadians. That is a very key issue 
which has never been addressed. He said that it may prevent 
socially useful legislation. What is he referring to, the Pearson 
airport deal, Bill C-68?
<P>
	I wonder if the member agrees that it was right to completely 
devalue all the property. I wonder if he was listening when I 
explained the supermajority provision that my bill provided and 
that it cannot be easily overblown.
<P>
	In conclusion, when we build a strong house we need a strong 
foundation. In order to build a strong society we have to have 
strong foundations. If we do not have property rights, we do not 
have that strong foundation. It is a very key thing. We as legislators 
and parliamentarians have to look at the big picture and build that 
type of society so people can have the protection they need to build 
strong foundations.
<P>
	Big government can abuse its position and the citizens of Canada 
need protection from their own government. That is why I am 
saying we need property rights strengthened in Canada.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my riding of Cumberland-Colchester is a very old 
historic riding, a very rural riding. Five Fathers of Confederation 
came from that riding and many of the communities were built in 
coastal areas at a time when transportation was only by means of 
wooden boats on the coastal waterways. As a result of this long 
history, we have gone through a transition period where wooden 
boats no longer are the mode of transportation and changes in 
sectoral employment have varied immensely.
<P>
	The unemployment rate in my riding today is 14.3 per cent at the 
regional level for the northern region. However, in certain sectors it 
probably reaches 16 per cent to 18 per cent. In my riding there are 
many seasonal workers.
<P>
	The people in my riding, because of this long history, do not 
always have access to the jobs in the larger urban centres. When we 
designed the employment insurance  bill this past year, there was a 
recognition that high unemployment regions such as mine would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6480"> 6480 </A></B>
<P>
have a difficult move through the new Employment Insurance Act, 
that there may be great difficulties in this transition to finding full 
employment without additional support mechanisms to aid in the 
transition period.
<P>
	As a result, our government brought in some measures that 
would help people to excel in entrepreneurial skills. There was a 
self-employment fund and a transitional job fund. We were also 
targeting supplements to families who would need them to take 
them above the poverty line.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development as to how well this additional transitory assistance to 
families who are in need is working and if it is helping those people 
achieve self-sustaining income through the new Employment 
Insurance Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to respond to my colleague's question in the short time that I have.
<P>
	The new EI bill is intended to help people get back to work. 
There is no doubt that we have moved from a passive system to a 
very active system. The employment benefits are there to assist 
participants in obtaining employment and to help them continue 
with their skills development if necessary.
<P>
	If we look at the employment insurance bill, under part II there 
are a number of new tools for people who are looking for work. 
These tools, when agreements are signed with the provinces in the 
next year, will be the cornerstone of that very active participation 
of governments in helping people get back to work.
<P>
	As well, we are now going to a new system on January 1, 1997 
which intends to put all part timers into the system. Some 500,000 
people will have access to employment insurance for the first time.
<P>
	As well, we put in place as the member mentioned a system of 
family supplements. This recognizes that there are many people at 
the low end of the income scale who need protection and through 
no fault of their own at times find it very difficult to find work. We 
want to protect, to better target and to assist families with children 
who have incomes of no more than $25,921. We also put the family 
supplements in place and linked them to the child tax benefit. This 
is a top up of regular benefit rates to not more than $413 per week.
<P>
	At the same time the maximum benefit rate in 1997 for those on 
the family supplement will be 65 per cent of annual insurable 
earnings, while the recipient who falls under the normal category 
will collect 55 per cent of their annual insurable earnings. 
Eventually over the next four years, once the whole program is in 
place, an  individual who is collecting family supplements will be 
able to get a maximum benefit rate of 80 per cent of their annual 
insurable earnings.
<P>
	There is a great potential through the new EI system to help 
those who are at the low end of the scale. It is important as well to 
emphasize that this is a bill which recognizes seasonal employees. 
Because of the fact that we have gone from a weeks based system 
to an hours based system, quite frankly that particular system will 
help-
<P>

has expired. The hon. member for Châteauguay.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="nationaldefence">national defence</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
beginning of November, I questioned the Minister of National 
Defence about his intentions regarding the major defence 
procurement project under which new submarines will be bought 
and the next batch of shipborne anti-submarine warfare helicopters 
will be equipped.
<P>
	I was asking him more specifically whether he was prepared to 
drop once and for all the idea of spending several hundred million 
dollars on submarines whose usefulness has yet to be proven. 
Second, I asked if he could soon share with us his plans for defence 
equipment procurement. My third question was the following: Will 
the minister commit to having a debate in the House of Commons 
on his procurement plans so that the urgency and usefulness of such 
procurement can be publicly discussed, according to our priorities 
and financial capability?
<P>
	In response to my questions, the Minister of National Defence 
indicated quite candidly that they were not ruling out anything in 
terms of defence procurement. I found that this was not a very 
substantive answer from a minister administering a $10.5 billion 
budget, especially after his predecessor and General Boyle had 
resigned, the problems encountered in Somalia and the issue raised 
about the lack of leadership in DND.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	This government should show some good sense and announce 
that it has given up the idea of buying or leasing submarines, in 
whatever manner. Such an acquisition is certainly not a priority, 
given the cuts in social programs. It is even less necessary in the 
present international context. The same goes for shipborne 
helicopters. The government should forget about equipping them 
with anti-submarine and other sophisticated devices for which 
there is absolutely no need in the present world context.
<P>
	Why a debate in the House? If we look back at last year, the 
government, without any justification, went ahead and bought new 
armoured vehicles by awarding a  contract of over $2 billion to GM 
in London without going to tender. It also announced that it was 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6481"> 6481 </A></B>
<P>
going to buy 15 new search and rescue helicopters at a cost of $600 
million, without requiring any Canadian content whatsoever of 
those tendering for the contract.
<P>
	Another bit of madness by this government was the purchase, for 
$23.6 million, of 1,600 new anti-tank missiles, which have 
apparently never been used except for training.
<P>
	It will be recalled that during the election campaign the Bloc 
Quebecois suggested cutting the defence department's budget by 
25 per cent, which would have represented a $3 billion reduction. 
At the time, this was considered ridiculous. But thanks to pressure 
brought to bear by the Bloc Quebecois in the House since 1993-94, 
when the budget was $12.032 billion, it will be $10.5 billion in 
1996-97.
<P>
	In my view, that was the reason-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time is up. I recognize the 
hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to address a couple of the 
questions the member wanted to have answered.
<P>
	He will know that Canada must maintain a multi-purpose 
combat capable force that can operate alongside modern forces of 
our allies and like minded nations.
<P>
	He will know as well that last November 6 the minister 
announced the government's plan to spend to some $500 million on 
six projects over the next five years. I would like to list the projects 
for him.
<P>
	First, there is the $187 million clothe the soldier project to 
provide Canadian forces soldiers with 24 items of weatherproof 
clothing and personal equipment from combat boots and gloves to 
rucksacks and protective eye wear.
<P>
	Second, a $13.4 million contract has been awarded for 60,000 
helmets to Gallet Sécurité du Québec.
<P>
	Third, the department is proceeding with a $27 million project to 
acquire six modern land mine detection systems.
<P>
	Next, the Canadian forces will proceed with a $180 million 
project to equip the army with a modern command and control 
system that provides timely and accurate information which will 
allow the commanders to better plan, direct and monitor missions.
<P>
	We are also moving ahead with a $145 million project to replace 
the turrets on our Leopard tanks.
<P>
	Finally, we are moving ahead with a $15.3 million project to 
purchase 2,524 grenade launchers.
<P>
	The Canadian forces must maintain the combat capability if they 
are to perform their missions effectively. These equipment 
purchases will help them to do so.
<P>
	As for the second question, decisions regarding military 
equipment acquisitions are made in accordance with the guidelines 
provided in the 1994 defence white paper. In that vein, we will 
continue to function in an open and transparent way while ensuring 
that we balance the needs of our domestic and international 
security with our financial realities.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PESTICIDESPRODUCTSCONTROLACT">PESTICIDES PRODUCTS CONTROL ACT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
month I asked the Minister of Health when he would introduce 
legislation amending the Pesticide Products Control Act. He 
replied that he would table it in due course.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to this act have a long history. The 
consultations began in 1989 and culminated in 1990 with a 
publication of the pesticides regulatory review team's report. The 
report recommended modernizing the pesticide registration system 
in order to further enhance the protection of human health, safety 
and the ecosystem. This would be achieved by minimizing risks 
associated with pesticides while still allowing the controlled use of 
pest control products. It is worth noting that health, environment, 
agriculture and the chemical industry representatives unanimously 
supported the report's recommendations.
<P>
	In 1994 the government began to implement the 
recommendations put forward by this review team. First, the 
government transferred the responsibility for the Pest Control 
Products Act from the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food to 
the Department of Health.
<P>
	Then a Pest Management Regulatory Agency was created within 
the health department. This agency is charged with administering 
pesticide regulation as well as other pesticide related methods. The 
agency contains a pesticide alternatives office for advising on the 
availability of possible alternatives during the pesticide 
registration process.
<P>
	Eight years after the start of the consultation process, the 1969 
Pest Products Control Act is still waiting to be amended. Our 
dependence on pesticides in agriculture, urban settings, forestry, 
aquaculture, you name it, is still considerable. Such dependence 
can negatively affect human health. It can lead to water pollution 
and damage to the ecosystem.
<P>
	It is now most desirable that the government move quickly with 
amendments that would accelerate the reduction of this dependence 
on toxic substances. Therefore, eight years later speed is of the 
essence and new legislation is due within the life of this 
Parliament.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6482"> 6482 </A></B>
<P>
	Again tonight I ask the minister through his parliamentary 
secretary, when will the legislation to amend the 1969 Pest Control 
Products Act be introduced in the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to further respond to the 
question posed to the Minister of Health by the hon. member for 
Davenport on October 24 which has repeated again this evening.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague knows, the reform of the pest management 
regulatory system was a campaign promise of the government. In 
February 1995 the government announced the creation of a new 
agency, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency.
<P>
	This new agency is mandated to protect the health of Canadians, 
their environment, and at the same time to provide the necessary 
pest management tools needed by farmers and other users. The 
agency has steadily made progress in implementing these reforms. 
Let me cite some examples. International harmonizations have 
been put in place to reduce costs to manufacturers and to save time. 
Operations have been streamlined. The agency has spearheaded 
federal-provincial working groups to find creative solutions to 
persistent pest problems.
<P>
	As to the other question, the minister intends to introduce 
legislation during this mandate to provide the statutory basis for the 
reformed system. This step will usher in the final chapter of the 
reform process. The new legislation will modernize, clarify and 
strengthen the law and the regulation of pesticides, and it will 
provide the basis for a system in which we can all have confidence.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
