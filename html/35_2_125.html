	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That in the opinion of this House, the government should commit itself to having 
full light shed on the events occurring before, during and after the deployment of 
Canadian troops to Somalia, by extending the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry 
until December 31, 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, on January 10, the Minister of National 
Defence announced he was putting an end to the Somalia inquiry, 
conducted by the Létourneau commission and designed to shed 
light on what happened before, during and after the incidents in 
Somalia.
<P>
	Needless to say that, like many Canadians and Quebecers, the 
official opposition is very disappointed with this decision. Today, 
we will attempt to demonstrate to this House that extending the 
mandate of the commission is not only necessary but also 
beneficial to Canada as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	When this commission was established, the Prime Minister of 
Canada stated, and I quote: ``For the first time in a long time a 
government has had the courage to ask for an inquiry into the 
operations of national defence. Never has it been done before''. 
This statement was made by the Prime Minister of Canada on 
September 16, 1996. He stated further: ``In the meantime we have 
to respect the commission and let it finish its work. After that we 
will make our decision based on its recommendations''.
<P>
	At that time, the Prime Minister of Canada told us it was a 
precedent to establish a commission. But on January 10, the same 
government, through its Minister of National Defence, decided to 
put an end to the commission's deliberations. That too is a first in 
Canada.  Never before has a government dared to shut down so 
abruptly an inquiry commissioned by itself.
<P>
	Throughout this period, the Standing Committee on National 
Defence hardly ever met. Again, while this government felt it was 
important for the commission to get to the bottom of the incidents 
that occurred in Somalia, we realize today that this is not going to 
happen.
<P>
	Of course, we will be hear about what happened before the 
incidents in Somalia, about how willing and prepared our troops 
were to be deployed to Somalia to fight on behalf of Canada. We 
will definitely be told about that. In the end, Canada was not ready. 
We decided to send troops over there, but they were not ready for 
the mission. We will probably also find out what happened, in 
terms of the actual events, including the two alleged murders that 
took place in Somalia. The inquiry's mandate was to restore the 
honour and the integrity of the Canadian forces.
<P>
	I have the pleasure of sitting on the House joint committee with 
the hon. member for Charlesbourg, where we proposed a whole 
slew of amendments. I have been sitting on the defence committee 
for three years, and we are constantly being told that the morale of 
our troops is not good. Mr. Speaker, I want to advise you right now 
that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg. As I was saying, morale was not good three years 
ago and it is no better today. It has not been good for a long time, I 
think.
<P>
	The inquiry must find out why the morale of our troops has 
deteriorated so much. This is what matters. It is as though the 
defence minister and the Prime Minister finally decided that the 
Létourneau commission was not important, that it would make 
recommendations, but that- So, the minister decided to set up 
another committee to look at the issue of morale, without waiting 
for the inquiry's findings. And this is tragic.
<P>
	The truth is that this government set up the inquiry in the hope 
that the Conservatives, the previous government, would suffer the 
political damage. However, the more the inquiry moves along, the 
more obvious it is that there are links with this government and that 
the period yet to be reviewed would involve friends of the 
government, friends that the government does not want singled out.
<P>
	Remember the great search of April 9, 1996. Commander in 
chief Boyle decided that a thorough search would be conducted 
everywhere, even in garbage  cans, filing cabinets, under chairs, in 
tanks, etc. to find documents that had been lost. This exercise was 
just a big farce and Canadians know that. For six months, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7822"> 7822 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian forces refused to co-operate and, all of a sudden, a 
``search day'' was declared.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	That day, everyone from the top brass on down turned everything 
inside out in an attempt to find the documents. For six months the 
Canadian armed forces had been refusing to co-operate with the 
commission. But the main reason this inquiry was set up was to see 
what went on afterwards. That is what is important. When you want 
to correct a situation, when you want to improve the morale of the 
troops, do you not have to find out what is not working?
<P>
	Who is it they want to protect? There are some very important 
people who will not be able to take part, whom it will not be 
possible to call as witnesses. First of all, there is Robert Fowler, 
who was deputy minister under the Liberals, the Conservatives and 
again under the Liberals, a survivor. Now he is Canada's 
ambassador to the UN. It will not be possible to call him to appear 
before the commission; there will unfortunately not be time. He is 
probably one person who knows quite a bit about the affair. There 
are others. There is also John Anderson, chief of defence staff when 
the events occurred. He was named ambassador to NATO. He is 
another one who will not be questioned.
<P>
	There is former Prime Minister Kim Campbell, who will also not 
appear before the commission. She is consul general in Los 
Angeles. So this person, who said she was intimidated at the time, 
was told: ``Hold on there! If you want it to go well for you, keep 
your lip zipped''.
<P>
	What are they doing now? It is very simple. I would describe the 
Minister of National Defence as the government's firefighter. 
Members will recall this minister's career; he was at transport. He 
decided that there would be no more trains in Canada. Then he was 
sent to human resources; he was the one who decided to close down 
employment centres all over the country. He did the dirty work. 
Now he is at the defence department to do the same thing. They 
have decided to put a lid on it.
<P>
	They had realized that the Liberal government would take quite a 
beating. Members will recall what the Prime Minister told us. That 
was the first time they had set up such a commission of inquiry. It 
is probably also the first time they have wrapped one up so quickly.
<P>
	It is for this reason that the Bloc Quebecois, Canada's official 
opposition until the next election, and aware of its responsibilities 
as the opposition, is asking the government to change its mind.
<P>
	In closing, I will read you the motion, which says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should commit itself to having 
full light shed on the events occurring before, during and after the deployment of 
Canadian troops to  Somalia, by extending the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry 
until December 31, 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If this is not done, we will never know the truth, and it will never 
be over. We will have thrown away $25 million without even 
knowing what really happened.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member of the Bloc Quebecois is trying hard to tarnish 
even more the Canadian army's reputation. We know full well that 
members of the Bloc have no intention of trying to improve the 
situation with regard to the Department of National Defence. They 
just want to drag this department through the mud.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, was the member who just said-or should I 
say he was mumbling-all kinds of things about DND not the one 
who wrote to our military personnel before the referendum to try to 
form his own separatist army? If it was not him, it surely was his 
colleague or another one of these separatists who are out to destroy 
DND.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	Yes, we had problems in Somalia. The government knows that. 
When did these problems occur? They occurred under the 
Conservative government, before 1993. The Prime Minister has 
fulfilled his responsibility and conducted an inquiry. The inquiry 
has already been granted extensions two or three times. Will it be 
allowed to drag on until the year 2025?
<P>
	We must immediately implement procedures that will improve 
the military. That is what the defence minister is doing right now. 
The main objective of this government and of all parliamentarians 
is to improve our national defence department, not drag it through 
the mud as you, separatists, are trying to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we saw, the hon. 
member rambled on a wide variety of issues. He obviously was not 
well briefed on this issue.
<P>
	All I want to say is that, when we look back on the history of the 
Canadian Armed Forces, we see that there are many shortcomings, 
a total lack of leadership, and that the measures undertaken by 
successive defence ministers did not settle anything. Quite the 
opposite, the situation is getting worse all the time.
<P>
	We have a commission of inquiry which, I acknowledge, is 
costing us a lot of money, but it would not cost a whole lot more to 
let it continue its work. Unless the minister changes his mind, on 
March 31, the commission will start to prepare its report. So, from 
March 31 until June 30, nothing will happen, and on June 30, the 
commission will submit its report. This is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	The work of the inquiry is not done. For six months, the armed 
forces tried to hamper the inquiry and hide the truth from it. Some 
documents were tampered with, others were shredded. Some were 
made to disappear.  These people are professionals. Mr. Justice 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7823"> 7823 </A></B>
<P>
Létourneau is an extraordinary man, who wants to get at the truth, 
just like every Canadian and Quebecer. We want to know the truth 
so we can correct the situation.
<P>
	The hon. member is just babbling away. Once Quebec is 
sovereign, we will have armed forces based on what Canada 
currently has, which is why we want a solid and determined 
Canadian army, with good leadership and some kind of vision. 
When we send Canadians to keep the peace in other countries, we 
want them to be prepared and proud to act on behalf of all 
Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
always happy to speak in this House although some issues are 
rather sad and distressing to discuss.
<P>
	I will not remind you of the decisions that were recently made by 
the new defense minister but rather give you some background to 
shed some light on the problems in the armed forces, whose 
reputation the Bloc is trying to tarnish according to some Liberal 
members. I will go over certain facts and give you some 
background.
<P>
	In 1985, the now dead-and-gone airborne regiment was under 
investigation. Of the 568 members of that regiment, 112 had a 
record with the military police and 89 with the civilian police. 
Military leaders were ordered to take steps to remedy the situation, 
but things did not improve.
<P>
	In 1992, at CFB Petawawa where the now defunct airborne 
regiment was based, Colonel Morneau indicated to the then Chief 
of the Defence Staff, General John de Chastelain, that the regiment 
was not adequately trained for this kind of mission and 
recommended that it not be deployed in Somalia.
<P>
	General de Chastelain was near the end of his mandate, but he 
nevertheless ordered the deployment of the regiment, knowing as 
he did that the following month he would be the new consul in 
Washington, in the United States. That was in December 1992.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	In January 1993 there was a new Chief of Defence Staff, John 
Anderson. He travelled to Somalia in February and early March 
with Bob Fowler and other generals. All were well placed to see the 
somewhat aggressive or racist behaviour already reported. 
Moreover, if memory serves, the commander there at the time was 
reprimanded. This was Commander Seward, I believe. He was 
reprimanded, and fined as well, for excessively aggressive 
activities toward the Somalis.
<P>
	During that visit, neither Mr. Fowler nor General Anderson 
reported any abnormal incidents. Curiously, General John 
Anderson was there two days after the first incident involving 
young Shidane Arone on March 4, but there was no report.
<P>
	Six weeks later, the military police decided to launch an 
investigation. We know what happened then. They immediately 
found one guilty party, Kyle Brown. He was charged and sentenced 
to five years in prison. The officers and non-commissioned officers 
were found not guilty. There were a few reprimands, promotions 
were frozen; that was it.
<P>
	Time passed. In 1993, public pressure for something to be done 
started to build up. Incidents continued to occur. You will recall 
that, in February and March of 1994-some members will say that 
it was the Bloc again trying to sully the name of the armed forces, 
which is far from the case-it was reported that certain members of 
the Airborne Regiment at Petawawa were going around with Ku 
Klux Klan pennants and flying Nazi flags on Canadian Forces 
vehicles. Colonel Kenward was in charge at the time, and this was 
tolerated-no problem.
<P>
	The situation just went from bad to worse. It was not simply the 
Somalia affair, but a combination of everything that was going on.
<P>
	Under public pressure, the former Minister of Defence, the hon. 
member for Don Valley East, announced the creation of a 
commission of inquiry into the Somalia incidents, stating that the 
full truth would be known, and that everyone would be called to 
testify before the commission.
<P>
	It should be recalled that around the month of October 1995, in 
this Chamber, members of both the Reform Party and the Bloc 
Quebecois accused the Minister of National Defence of the day of 
having contrived with the armed forces, to a certain extent, to 
prevent the inquiry from obtaining documents.
<P>
	I recall very well that the then minister of Defence had blown a 
fuse, much like the current minister did yesterday. It was quite a 
show. How dare we question the integrity of our armed forces?
<P>
	I would like to point out that if we are simply listing facts, it is 
not to tarnish reputations, as some may think. I regret, but these are 
facts. Members will recall that things which happened in 1994 were 
revealed recently.
<P>
	The funny thing with the armed forces is that the truth always 
comes out, two to three years after the facts, like the incidents of 
Bacovici, sexual abuse at Wainwright, or fraud and embezzlement 
at CFB Valcartier. The list goes on and on. It might be added that 
even a civilian working for National Defence headquarters 
managed to organize a pornography ring from within the 
department.
<P>
	This situation must certainly be due to a glitch in operations. 
Early in 1995, I read a report of Brigadier-General Jeffries which 
said that the problem in the armed forces which could lead to some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7824"> 7824 </A></B>
<P>
shall we say deviant behaviour among some of the military was a 
lack of leadership. I did not say it, a Brigadier-General did.
<P>
	In another report, Colonel Oehring mentioned that there was a 
flagrant lack of leadership and discipline and a complete distortion 
between the top brass and the rank and file. I would remind all 
members that at one point the media revealed that some soldiers 
and sailors had applied for welfare and even went to the soup 
kitchens in western Canada.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	On the other hand, look at some of the officers. Consider 
Admiral Murray with his cavalier and arrogant testimony, who 
lived in a 6,000 square feet house for the astronomical sum of $581 
per month. For a regular soldier who sees how these officers 
behave, it is pretty demoralizing.
<P>
	In fact, this is all par for the course. Look at all the players in this 
case. John Anderson was aware of what happened. He went to 
Somalia, he knew exactly what was going on, and to punish him for 
his lack of leadership, he was appointed to NATO. Bob Fowler was 
deputy minister of Defence for many years. He was in Somalia in 
March 1993, but said nothing and saw nothing. And then, around 
the end of 1995, Mr. Fowler was appointed as Canada's delegate to 
the UN. Interestingly, if we go back even further, we see that he 
was a political assistant to Mr. Trudeau, the former Liberal Prime 
Minister, in 1983-84, and he also happens to be the new Governor 
General's brother-in-law. It looks like the old boys' network.
<P>
	There is also John de Chastelain, who came back as chief of 
staff. He was ambassador in Washington, where he was replaced by 
the Prime Minister's nephew, Mr. Chrétien. Hon. members will 
recall that when the regiment in Somalia was abolished or 
eliminated, General John de Chastelain tendered his resignation, 
which was refused by the Prime Minister. Finally, in December 
1995, General de Chastelain resigned and left the scene, and then 
we had Mr. Boyle.
<P>
	You are signalling to me, Mr. Speaker, that I have only two 
minutes left. I could go on and on, but I will now get to my 
conclusion. My point is that the former Minister of National 
Defence, the hon. member for Don Valley East, as well as the 
current defence minister and the Prime Minister declared, in 
November 1994, October 1995, March 1996 and June 1996, that we 
needed to get to the bottom of this. That it was not just about the 
deployment of the Airborne in Somalia but that there were other 
incidents which, as I pointed out, prompted some officers to point 
to a lack of leadership.
<P>
	What we are doing now is a matter of ethics. I would even say 
that it no longer matters that the commission of inquiry is being 
wound up. Look at the conduct of Admiral Murray. We will never 
know the truth.
<P>
	I think that refusing to give an extension shows a lack of ethics 
and does nothing to enhance the public's confidence in this 
government. It took the armed forces  nearly a year to hand over 
certain documents, and when we look at other commissions of 
inquiry which went on for five years and were about far less serious 
matters, one really wonders about the way the present government 
is behaving. I think we can assume Canadians realize that when the 
Liberal government decided to wind up this commission, it was 
clear there were people it wanted to protect, and I do not think 
Canadians or Quebecers will go along with this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate my colleague on his presentation. As you know, he 
was vice-chairman of the standing committee on national defence. 
He was also on the joint committee of the House of Commons and 
the Senate that proposed changes to the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	I have a question for him. Does he think that the current standing 
committee on national defence has changed from what he knew of 
it in the three years he was on it?
<P>
	They will say anything across the way, but it is a well-known fact 
that Bloc members share in the activities and work very hard to 
move things along. I think the member opposite would do better to 
remain quiet and listen to the question.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague from Charlesbourg whether he 
thinks the Canadian armed forces have changed? I would like him 
to explain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> Mr. Speaker, there have indeed been changes. There 
have been changes in ministers and in chiefs of staff. But I do not 
think the mentality has changed much. My colleague spoke of the 
standing committee on national defence. True, the Bloc 
participated and often made very constructive suggestions. Some 
of my Liberal colleagues opposite know very well that the Bloc 
members tried to resolve certain problems and to take part in 
discussions.
<P>
	The auditor general's report and other reports indicate that the 
Department of National Defence was often accused of 
mismanaging its assets, spending unnecessarily and other things.
<P>
	I am happy my colleague is allowing me to talk about financial 
matters. On Monday, the new Minister of National Defence said 
that all this had cost a lot and that the Bloc was complaining that 
the Department of National Defence was spending too much 
money. It will cost $25 million to find out the truth, who is 
responsible in the chain of command, where the problems lie, how 
improvements can be made and who is guilty.
<P>
	The defence committee often pointed out that there were too 
many generals and that these generals often lacked leadership skills 
or authority over the soldiers. Very often, the corporals and the 
ordinary soldiers bear  the brunt, while the officers get off lightly. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7825"> 7825 </A></B>
<P>
This happened on a number of occasions. The subject was 
discussed in the national defence committee.
<P>
	If the mentality as well as the behaviour is to be changed, I do 
not think the way to go about it is to decide the commission has 
dragged on long enough and that it will have time to hear the last 
witnesses, which is not the case. However, we must, for various 
reasons such as restoring the armed forces' honour or giving 
soldiers back their pride, stop living in the past and pretending that 
Canadian soldiers lived in honour and that everyone is proud of 
them.
<P>
	If we go back three or four years, not everyone is proud of what 
went on in the army. I do not think everyone is proud of the money 
spent for various reasons. With a little effort, the government could 
change all that.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to take part in today's debate.
<P>
	When I hear my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois talk about 
integrity, harp on what happened in Somalia, and repeat the litany 
of problems every Canadian knows only too well, I have trouble 
reconciling this preoccupation with whether or not the Canadian 
Forces have any ethics with the Bloc's approach.
<P>
	My hon. colleagues mentioned the issue of leadership in the 
Canadian forces, I agree with them, there are problems. We will 
have to find ways to address them. Do the hon. members from the 
Bloc Quebecois expect us to apply the same ethics, the same 
behaviour to the Canadian forces as they did to their former 
leader's staff?
<P>
	Should we fire people in order to compensate them? Is this the 
kind of ethics they are promoting here today by preaching at 
Canadians, the government, members of the Canadian Forces? Are 
they not the same people who, when there is a referendum, are 
trying to create a rift within the Canadian forces with alleged plots?
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Is this the kind of integrity the Canadian forces should emulate? 
I hope not. Probably because the two hon. members who spoke 
today will not be candidates in the race to the Bloc Quebecois 
leadership, they do not apply the kind of ethics which has been 
reported in the medias lately.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I think the important thing that Canadians have to address here 
today is whether we as a country are going to benefit from the 
production of historical documents well into the end of this century 
based on an incident that took place in 1993.
<P>
	I refer to a document that reflects comments made on the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation national news, January 13, 
1997. The CBC, in doing its own calculation,  looking at the agenda 
of the Somalia inquiry, looking at the time frame that it wished to 
cover, looking at its own work plan, arrived at the conclusion that 
proceeding at the rate that it had up until the date of this broadcast 
it would take the commission approximately six years to complete 
its work. That is not the government's view. It is an assessment 
made by the CBC in dealing with this issue.
<P>
	I have said before and I say again that Canadians who are 
interested in what occurred in Somalia know who pulled the 
trigger. They know that the incidents in Somalia were totally 
unacceptable. We know there were severe weaknesses in 
leadership. We know there were serious flaws in how we responded 
to what occurred in Somalia with respect to the military justice 
system, how the military investigation was conducted. We 
understand that.
<P>
	I believe the Canadian forces and Canada as a country have to 
move on and turn the corner on this issue by no longer necessarily 
just repeating the litany of events that we all know too well but 
beginning to grapple with solutions.
<P>
	I am acutely aware of the tremendous burden we are placing on 
the men and women of the Canadian forces. I have just returned 
from Bosnia. It is of no value to anyone in Bosnia who is walking 
the streets of devastated towns looking at children with hollow eyes 
to tell them that we are conducting or we are going to extend the 
final date of the Somalia inquiry. Those men and women want to 
know what people in this place are going to do to ensure that they 
are trained properly, that they are equipped properly, that they have 
guidelines and frameworks within which they can function.
<P>
	What the government has done and what I have committed to do 
is present to the Prime Minister of Canada, to the Government of 
Canada and to the people of Canada by March 31, 1997 a 
comprehensive plan and a set of proposals on how we can move 
ahead with restoring the integrity and the pride of one of the finest 
military institutions in the world.
<P>
	That is a considerable challenge. We expect to be assessed, we 
expect the recommendations to be analysed and we are trying to 
draw in as much support as we can from as wide a population in the 
country as possible.
<P>
	Unlike my hon. friends this morning, I believe the one solid 
foundation on which we can proceed is the enormous reservoir of 
public support for the men and women in the Canadian forces. 
There is no question that Canadians are disgusted by what 
happened in Somalia. There is no doubt that they question the 
quality and the training of some of the leadership that has been 
around in the Canadian forces for a number of years.
<P>
	Does it serve any purpose in terms of the objective of providing 
Canada with a very efficient and capable military institution to 
simply recite the problems that we  know a great deal about, or 
would it be useful for the Bloc Quebecois and for other hon. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7826"> 7826 </A></B>
<P>
members in this House representing all parties in the House to set 
forward their views on what we should be doing?
<P>
	To be very fair about this and not to try in any way to minimize 
what occurred in Somalia, what occurred before Somalia or what 
occurred after the incidents were discovered, we still have to look 
at the overall context in which the Canadian forces operate. A 
peacetime environment; some would say yes. I can assure you, Mr. 
Speaker, if you were in Bosnia today it would not look very 
peaceful, although day to day it is these days, but when you see the 
devastation you know how quickly that situation could become 
very dangerous again.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	We have Canadian forces in Haiti. The Canadian forces are as 
much a part of the image of Canada as the Rocky Mountains or the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, wherever one goes in the world. 
With all the problems we have encountered, when they are put in 
the context of young men and women risking their lives all over the 
planet and seeing how other military institutions have had to 
function in these similar kinds of environments, I am not excusing 
the very serious mistakes we have made in the past. What I am 
saying is fair minded Canadians, and they are fair minded people, 
will understand that on balance the Canadian forces are still one of 
the most highly respected military institutions in the world.
<P>
	We can spend a lot of time debating whether inquiries in this 
country should be constituted on the basis that once they begin they 
have carte blanche to go to the end of whatever they feel is an 
appropriate level of inquiry. I do not dispute that. If this place 
decides through legislation that when inquiries are established they 
can continue until the commissioners of inquiry, all the parties 
involved and their legal counsel are satisfied that every document 
has been looked at, every issue has been addressed and every 
question has been asked, if that is what the Canadian people and 
people in this place wish to do we should debate that.
<P>
	To make sure to put the record straight, this commission was 
established on March 30, 1995. The original reporting deadline to 
which the commissioners agreed when they accepted to undertake 
this work was December 20, 1995. We are now in the process of 
debating whether a third extension was appropriate. It was 
extended until the end of June of this year, the third extension. The 
first extension was to June 20, 1996. The second extension is to 
March 31, 1997, and now a third extension to June 30, 1997. The 
commission will have work in excess of two years by the time it is 
asked to bring in its conclusions.
<P>
	I understand the frustration of the commissioners and I 
understand the concerns of members of this place when they say 
they will not have heard every witness, they will  not have been 
able to see every document and they will not have been able to 
address every question. What we must hear from my friends, which 
I hope we will hear in the discussion today not only on the basis of 
the Somali inquiry but in terms of future arrangements of this 
nature, is whether we develop a process that is absolutely open 
ended until everyone is satisfied that everything has been done. If 
that is what people are prepared to propose then I believe at some 
point we should debate that in this place because it has enormous 
implications.
<P>
	What about the people who are in leadership roles? We have 
heard of individuals who have been reassigned and named to new 
positions. What will happen if we get a report seven, eight or ten 
years after events? As an historical document it may have some 
value but in terms of applying the lessons learned from the 
mistakes that occurred, of what value will they be? Where will the 
people be who were in control and in leadership? Worse than that, 
what happens in the interim to these people? Nothing? We have 
chosen to move on.
<P>
	I want to make clear that we have never said who should be 
called before the commission. I have never commented on 
testimony heard before the commission. I have never commented 
on the work plan or the agenda of the commission because I have 
been around long enough to know that Canadians understand that 
the incidents in Somalia that resulted in the deaths of the Somalians 
killed by Canadians are unacceptable.
<P>
	We also know, as my colleagues would be aware, that we have 
had murder trials in this country where more than three, sometimes 
more than five and in fact more than ten people have been killed. 
These trials, looking into the events involved in murders 
committed in this country, have taken place in a matter of months, 
not years. I believe that Canadians who understand what is 
important with respect to the Canadian forces recognize that the 
government had to come to a decision after three extensions to set a 
final date on inquiry.
<P>
	I would also point out to my hon. friends in this place that 
recently another inquiry in a provincial jurisdiction was given an 
extension looking into a matter of great importance in a province in 
this country. When the provincial government in question provided 
the extension for the inquiry it also set a final date for reporting.

<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	I understood that it was very much in the same position as we 
were. It did not want a historical document on what had occurred 
and why it had occurred years after the fact. It wanted to be able to 
move with some solutions to the questions with which it was faced.
<P>
	We indicated to the Canadian people through several 
mechanisms our concern about what had happened in Somalia. 
However, to be very honest, a number of other events clearly 
indicated that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7827"> 7827 </A></B>
<P>
serious measures had to be  undertaken with respect to the future of 
the Canadian forces.
<P>
	I was very pleased when the retired chief justice of the supreme 
court, Brian Dickson, took on the job of reviewing the military 
justice system. A lot of what is so bad about the Somalia incident, 
as brutal as the murders were-God knows there is no excuse for 
that-what happened afterward was equally if not more troubling 
in the sense that the system did not respond adequately.
<P>
	The investigative system did not respond adequately. The 
military justice system has not responded adequately. We have 
empanelled and empowered a group of outstanding Canadians, 
along with Mr. Justice Dickson, J. W. Bird and General Belzile to 
come to the government with specific and comprehensive 
recommendations on the reform of the military justice system and 
commentary on how best to exercise the capacity of investigation 
that is now done by the military police.
<P>
	In addition to that, we will be reporting to the Prime Minister 
and to the people of Canada on accountability in the Canadian 
Armed Forces, on the system of promotions, on a wide ranging 
questioning of ethos and ethics in the military.
<P>
	Beyond that, the Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs has been asked to look at what I describe as the 
people needs of the Canadian Armed Forces; looking at benefits, at 
support systems for families, at accommodation and all the 
socioeconomic requirements of the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	All of this has been done in the last couple of months in response 
to the wide array of challenges facing the Canadian forces. I have 
great faith in the Canadian people and I have great faith in the 
Canadian forces but I also have enormous respect for this place.
<P>
	That is why I hope, through this process today and also in the 
weeks to come, we will get concrete proposals from my colleagues 
in this place on what they think should be done with the Canadian 
forces, not simply to continue an inquiry into an incident that we 
are very familiar with, but to tell us, in a concrete way whether they 
are committed, for example, to funding for the Canadian forces.
<P>
	Are they committed to the kinds of levels that we have 
established for personnel: 60,000 in the regular forces and 30,000 
in the militia reserves? Are they committed to the re-equipping of 
the Canadian forces? Do they believe we should be spending 
money on making sure that we have a combat capable military 
institution and organization that can adequately represent Canada 
around the world as we are called on by our allies to participate in 
various kinds of missions?
<P>
	Are they prepared to say to the men and women of the Canadian 
forces-it is important to hear this today-what is the position of 
the various parties. If they were elected, would they reopen the 
Somalia inquiry?  Are they serious about saying it is in the best 
interests of the Canadian forces to continue the Somalia inquiry or 
is it important to move on and learn from the lessons of Somalia 
and the events that surrounded those incidents?
<P>
	It is critical because we talk about the morale of the Canadian 
forces as though somehow, by saying things here or elsewhere that 
reflect specific concerns about incidents, this is going to help.
<P>
	I have had the great privilege of being the Minister of National 
Defence since October. I have visited nearly every base in Canada 
and I have travelled with the troops in Bosnia. I say without 
equivocation, not just based on my personal observations but 
having been exposed to my colleagues in NATO, having met with 
our NORAD allies in the United States, that every Canadian should 
feel absolutely comfortable about recognizing and respecting the 
role, the capability and the professionalism of the Canadian forces.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the incidents that my hon. friend related at 
Petawawa, at Val Cartier, in Somalia and more recently even in 
Haiti are cause for grave concern. The Canadian forces are an 
institution made up of tens of thousands of men and women. In 
every organization in Canada of that size, in every community in 
Canada of that size, every day there are events that take place that 
are unacceptable and intolerable. They are criminal acts. They are 
assaults. They are abuses of privilege, abuses of leadership 
capacity or roles in life. These things occur everywhere, even in 
professional hockey. That is not to say that in any way we diminish 
the importance of what happened or the fact that the events were 
totally unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Canadians are fair minded. They understand and recognize that 
the Canadian forces cannot be judged any differently or any more 
harshly than any other group of people in the country. They work in 
a very different environment. Very few Canadians sign up to put 
their lives on the line. That is what members of the forces do. They 
are trained to do things that are not terribly pleasant. They also 
have to be properly trained to maintain the kind of appropriate 
relationships among themselves and with the people where they are 
deployed.
<P>
	Surely Canadians are not going to accept an argument that says 
that 125 years or more of service around the world is going to be 
swept away because in today's society things that may or may not 
have been acceptable or even heard about years ago are now 
common knowledge. Surely fair minded Canadians and members 
of this place understand that the Canadian forces are faced with 
challenges that very few, including myself, would ever care to 
undertake on a day to day basis in Bosnia or in Haiti.
<P>
	I want to say this one thing to my friends in the House. 
Regardless of what happened in Somalia, we have to ask:  Who 
would the Minister of National Defence want to cover up for? What 
could have happened that would be more heinous than the beating 
and shooting of young people in Somalia? Why would it be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7828"> 7828 </A></B>
<P>
political advantageous to me or to the government to shut down the 
Somalia inquiry from a political point of view?
<P>
	It has been alleged that the deputy minister of the Department of 
National Defence at the time of the incident in Somalia used 
various tactics to somehow confuse the then Minister of National 
Defence. The then Minister of National Defence subsequently 
became Prime Minister of Canada and left that person in the role of 
deputy minister at the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	I hope that all of my colleagues will be very clear in their 
presentations with respect to what they believe we and Canada 
should be doing for the men and women of the Canadian forces. 
How can we make sure that in the future if any incidents like this 
should re-occur-and heaven knows we all hope that they will 
not-how should we respond to them. That is the question and the 
challenge facing all of us today as far as the Canadian forces and its 
future is concerned.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the minister's comments when he said he was first and 
foremost a member of Parliament; how fortunate that he could 
participate in this debate.
<P>
	On October 9, 1996, the minister said: ``We want a thorough 
investigation of everything that happened in connection with the 
situation in Somalia- I am sure all members of this House-and 
no doubt he included himself-realize that one should not interfere 
with the work of the commission of inquiry''. Well, to order the end 
of the inquiry, is that not to interfere with its work?
<P>
	We are asking the minister and the government to let the inquiry 
carry on for a few more months. The minister says five or ten years. 
He talks about a document of historical scope. This is not what we 
are asking for. We simply ask that they grant an extension so that 
the inquiry can hear witnesses who have not been heard yet and 
who, we feel, are crucial to the whole issue.
<P>
	Today, the minister, calm as always, spoke as an expert and tried 
to quietly sweep the whole issue under the rug. As you have surely 
noticed, this is not always the case, but it did happen today. He tried 
to explain the situation slowly and delicately; he spoke about the 
grassroots, he tried to appeal to our sympathy for those people in 
the forces.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	We know that the people in the Canadian armed forces are 
professionals, the members of the official opposition do not 
question that. We only want to know what is happening because it 
seems that the rotten apples are in the top brass. They way things 
stand now, we will  find out what happened before the incident and 
during the incident, but unfortunately, we will never know what 
happened after, we will not get to the bottom of the attempted 
coverup by this government; that is what we are concerned about. 
That is what Canadians are worried about these days.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, to get back to our trying to cover up 
what happened, as I said previously, the government agreed to 
extend the mandate of the Somalia inquiry first until June 28, 1996, 
then until March 31, 1997 and now until June 30, 1997.
<P>
	Is the hon. member convinced? Does he have proof that a further 
extension of three months, six months or nine months will bring us 
closer to a point where all three commissioners as well as the 
counsel for the witnesses will sit together and say: ``Yes, we are all 
agreed, it is all over, we have shed light on everything''.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that 150,000 documents, totalling two 
million pages, have been handed over to the inquiry and that more 
than 100 witnesses have already been heard.
<P>
	I believe that Canadians genuinely interested in the future of the 
Canada Armed Forces know full well what happened in Somalia 
and they want to make sure that our forces can operate in an 
effective and professional manner in the future. Listing past 
problems over and over again the problems will not reach that goal, 
we have to move on to concrete solutions.

Speaker, I would like to ask the minister a question about 
ministerial accountability, specifically contempt at the military

<P>
	Shidane Arone was tortured and killed on March 16. On March 
18, two days later, the chief of defence staff, John Anderson, and 
the deputy minister, Bob Fowler, briefed the minister saying at that 
time that an unfortunate incident had happened in Somalia.
<P>
	The defence minister at the time, Kim Campbell read in 
<I>Maclean's</I> magazine that there was a suggestion of criminal intent 
on March 18 at the same time that she was briefed without being 
told of criminal intent. It was not until March-

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Monday, February 10 I will be travelling to Brandon, Manitoba for 
the hearing of grain farmer, Bill Keriens. His crime is crossing the 
border to sell his grain. Subsequently, he will be fined for this 
crime and will be brought into court in leg irons and handcuffs.
<P>
	I have to ask, does the punishment fit the crime? All we have to 
do is look at the repercussions of Bill C-41. It was intended to deal 
with petty criminals who pose no threat to the community but the 
reality is that it has been used in cases involving drug trafficking, 
sexual assault, bank robbery and other assaults. These convicts, in 
some cases, are serving nothing more than house arrest.
<P>
	It is obvious we have to define who is a threat to society and that 
the punishment should be in line with the crime. This grain farmer 
in no way is a threat to society. Certainly he does not deserve the 
threat of jail time to be served in the same cell block with other 
criminals as wheat farmer, Andy McMechan, served.
<P>
	Why is it the heavy hand of the law punishes law-abiding 
citizens who are merely fighting for the principle of freedom while 
violent criminals walk free?

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, despite the rhetoric and the promises of a bright future, 
1997 has had a bad start for Quebecers and Canadians. The market 
is still in a slump. While Canada has 1.5 million unemployed, only 
500 new jobs were created in January. And there are fewer jobs for 
young people.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	Self-employed people were responsible for many new jobs 
created in 1996. Yet, the government is doing nothing to help them. 
The new unemployment insurance reform is supposed to give 
wider coverage to workers, but this is only deception. In fact, these 
new jobs that are emerging for self-employed people are protected 
neither by unemployment insurance nor by the vast majority of 
social security programs.
<P>
	The Liberals were elected under the slogan ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. 
The fact is there are ``no jobs, no jobs, no jobs''. When Canadians 
and Quebecers realize that the situation is disastrous, they will pass 
harsh judgment, and the government will pay the price.

	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fight against 
the deficit is being won. Who would have thought a mere three 
years ago that the deficit could be reduced by over $20 billion by 
today? This reduced deficit has meant a strengthened economy and 
record low interest rates.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance prepares his budget, I would urge that 
he stay the course. We need to eliminate the deficit as soon as is 
reasonably possible. Now is not the time for irresponsible Reform 
Party inspired tax cuts which will slow the decrease in the deficit or 
compromise essential programs.
<P>
	Eliminating the deficit will ensure that our children and our 
seniors have a secure economic future.

program is a success. Just look at some of the statistics which help 
to tell the story.
<P>
	For example, in my constituency of Dauphin-Swan River, more 
than $9 million has been invested. These types of projects have 
included road repairs, the development of water systems, culvert 
replacements and the construction of bridges.
<P>
	The Canada infrastructure program is a great benefit to rural 
areas. Almost 62 per cent of the projects were for rural Canada.
<P>
	In order to market our goods and services locally and abroad, 
another program is necessary for our communities' continued 
development.
<P>
	The Canada infrastructure works program is contributing to a 
stronger rural Canadian economy, including my riding of 
Dauphin-Swan River, and that is what I am working toward.

major accomplishment.

	The double tracking of Canadian Pacific between Winnipeg and

program that was the pride of many previous governments to 
speed up the delivery of grain, potash, sulphur and so on. Along 
with this we are watching the deterioration of the terminals in 
Thunder Bay and the tearing down of some of them. This was the 
big infrastructure program the country was so proud of. The 
seaway has now become redundant. It has been described by 
transport officials as a wonderful heritage park.

infrastructure, it would have taken more care with its other policies

international development week gives us the opportunity to reflect 
upon the unique role that Canada is playing worldwide in 
international development.
<P>
	The main players in development are the developing countries 
themselves. It is within their governments, their volunteer 
organizations, their institutions and their communities that the real 
development experts are to be found.
<P>
	However, in co-operating with these partners, Canadians have 
also done their share. From Peru to Zimbabwe, Canadian 
technologies and communication equipment have freed many 
communities from their isolation. By providing legal support, the 
Canadian program has helped countries such as Haiti and South 
Africa develop laws to ensure the respect of human rights and of 
the rule of law.

cultures and aims at concrete results-we have helped developing 
countries. International development week is the opportunity to

them is a full time job. Patrick no longer has the use of his upper 
limbs. His condition requires constant care and assistance, as spinal 
muscle atrophy causes severe muscle tissue degeneration.

is extremely fragile. Mr. and Mrs. Séguin have invested time, 
energy and money. Without the assistance of the Muscular

this Quebec business, which currently employs 85 people. The 
company signed an agreement with a Thai partner to jointly build a 
production facility in Bangkok. FRE Composites will provide the 
new venture with its manufacturing technology and its skills. The 
project is estimated at $4 million.
<P>
	Team Canada opened the doors for this Quebec company to 
export its state-of-the-art technology. This, dear Bloc members, is 
another example of the benefits to be gained from being part of the 
Canadian team.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Wednesday, Governor General Romeo LeBlanc, Commander in 
Chief of the Canadian Armed Forces, honoured 52 members of the 
regular and reserve forces with the Order of Military Merit, 
reminding us that despite current problems, Canada's military has 
distinguished itself not only in armed conflicts but in peacekeeping 
missions and rescue efforts.
<P>
	Eighty-one year old Air Commodore Leonard Birchall was one 
of the 52 distinguished with the Order of Military Merit and is the 
first Canadian to receive the fifth clasp to the Canadian forces 
decoration, signifying 62 years of honourable military service to 
Canada.
<P>
	While on a reconnaissance patrol on April 4, 1942, Squadron 
Leader Birchall sighted Japanese ships swiftly moving in for a 
surprise attack on Ceylon. He alerted the  British fleet of the 
impending attack but was then shot down and taken as a Japanese 
prisoner of war.
<P>
	As the senior prisoner, he made continual although not always 
successful efforts to protect his fellow prisoners from brutality. For 
his efforts he was awarded the British Empire Medal for Gallantry 
and Winston Churchill dubbed him the saviour of Ceylon.
<P>
	I am sure this House joins me in congratulating Len Birchall.

	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is time all levels of government start taking measures to address the 
issue of the underground economy, which is getting worse. This 
situation is largely due to the over-regulation imposed by the 
governments themselves, unions and other stakeholders.
<P>
	All these regulations have a price, which is paid directly or 
indirectly by the public, mainly consumers, who find they have to 
pay a lot of money for services. It is obvious that the problem of 
clandestine work will get worse.
<P>
	The time has come to implement reforms to make clandestine 
work unappealing, not only for workers, but also for consumers. 
One of the first measures should be that all bidders who are 
awarded government contracts comply with the law and be 
subjected to a compulsory verification.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Twenty-two groups from the cultural sector of Canada and of 
Quebec, representing 900,000 workers, have unanimously 
petitioned the Canadian government to maintain and strengthen 
existing cultural protection measures. This request comes on the 
heels of the statement by the Minister for International Trade that 
cultural protection measures that have been around for 30 years are 
going to be scrapped.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister told us that cabinet was 
unanimous on the cultural question. If that is the case, how can she 
explain the statements by her colleague at international trade, who 
said that the rules of Canadian ownership and Canadian content are 
obstacles to the cultural development of Canada and of Quebec?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7833"> 7833 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think that when we 
respond unanimously to the demands of cultural groups this 
morning, it is by saying that we wish to do everything we can not 
just to strengthen existing cultural protection, but to improve it 
for the twenty-first century.
<P>
	We know that we are living in a time of turbulent change, and we 
want to be prepared and to be on the cutting edge when it comes to 
new cultural possibilities, as we were when we became the first 
country to set up a CRTC.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we were perhaps the first country in the world to set up a 
CRTC, but we are perhaps also the first country in the world to 
have sold ourselves down the river, when we look at what happened 
with Ginn Publishing, Power DirecTv and DMX.
<P>
	Given what went on in the past, how can the Deputy Prime 
Minister expect us to believe her when she tells us that her 
government is defending the cultural sovereignty of Quebec and of 
Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question asked by the 
hon. member deserves a very serious answer because Canadian 
culture gives us two opportunities as a country. First is it tells our 
story to ourselves which is essential for our survival as a country. 
Second is it creates almost a million Canadian value added 
knowledge based jobs.
<P>
	When we came in as a government three and a half years ago, we 
pledged to do everything possible to create Canadian jobs for 
Canadians. One of the great success stories in Canadian job 
creation over the last decade has been the cultural sector. Certainly 
we are going to be working very closely with all departments to 
make sure that not only do Canadian cultural jobs continue to grow 
but most important that Canadians have the opportunity to tell 
Canadian stories to ourselves.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, really, I think the Deputy Prime Minister is living on 
another planet. Her government has not created jobs, jobs, jobs in 
the cultural area. It has cut, cut, cut those jobs, with all the funding 
it took away from the NFB, Telefilm Canada and the CBC, to name 
a few. Enough is enough.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	When the American secretary likes what the Minister of 
International Trade is saying, we have a problem.
<P>
	The heritage minister seems to be the only one in cabinet who 
thinks that measures are necessary to protect and develop the 
Canadian and Quebec cultures. Can she  guarantee the House that 
she will give it her full attention?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Yes, Mr. Speaker.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
will take the minister's word for it. Since she will be giving it her 
full attention, I would remind her that the four CBC ex-presidents, 
Al Johnson, Pierre Juneau, Tony Manera and Laurent Picard, as 
well as the Commissioner of Official Languages, say that the CBC 
no longer has the means to fulfil its mandate. The Liberal 
government has cut its appropriation by $414 million since it was 
elected.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Canadian Heritage explain to us the 
difference between the Reform Party, who wants to cut budgets by 
a third, and her own government, which has already cut the CBC 
budget by a third?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, it is incorrect 
to claim that we have cut the CBC budget by a third, Second, we 
have followed the advice of the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, who said on March 16 1995: ``If any cuts 
are needed, there are big ones to be made at CBC''. That is what we 
did, we followed the advice of the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
newspaper headlines spoke of an ``Unprecedented crisis at CBC''. 
Need I remind the minister of the words of her colleague at 
National Defence, who said the existence of the CBC is no longer 
justified?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, concerning the 
abolished positions, the Minister of Canadian Heritage is showing 
her total lack of consideration for the CBC and its employees. Last 
December 15, she claimed only 19 people had lost their jobs at 
CBC, whereas the total is calculated at 4,000.
<P>
	If the minister really has the CBC's interests at heart, and if she 
has the unanimous backing of cabinet, will she cancel the $200 
million in budget cuts slated for next year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. 
member's statements are wrong. If the hon. member is really 
honest when he speaks of cuts, why does he not go and talk to his 
colleague, the Quebec Minister of Culture and Communications, 
who has cut half the jobs at Télé-Québec? There were 580 
employees in 1995, and only 329 were left in 1996.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7834"> 7834 </A></B>
<P>
	We have made some hard decisions, but we have acted fairly, 
and have made fewer cuts and abolished fewer positions than his

cut at Télé-Québec.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PUBLICINQUIRIES">PUBLIC INQUIRIES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is a disturbing pattern emerging with respect to the 
government's handling of public inquiries into wrongdoing causing 
death.
<P>
	When it came to the tainted blood deaths and the murder 
cover-up in Somalia, the Liberals were very eager to investigate 
Tory wrongdoing. However, when the inquiry started to get too 
close for Liberal comfort and too close to the top, there were 
government induced delays, government induced legal challenges, 
document tampering by government officials and political 
interference.
<P>
	In the case of the Somalia inquiry, after the government had 
caused half of the delay, it tells the commissioners they are out of 
time.
<P>
	What is the government going to do to ensure that Canadians 
learn the truth, the whole truth and not just the Tory truth about the 
tainted blood tragedy, the Somalia scandal and the botched airbus 
investigation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the time 
is rapidly coming to a point where the hon. leader of the Reform 
Party is going to have to state clearly what his view of inquiries 
should be.
<P>
	As I have alluded to on a number of occasions in this place, in 
September he was asking us to guarantee that we would close down 
the Somalia inquiry before the election was held.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	To go beyond that, it is very important for the Canadian people to 
know whether the leader of the Reform Party believes that once an 
inquiry has begun it should be allowed to continue until everyone 
who is involved with the inquiry, either as a commissioner, a party 
or a lawyer, is satisfied that everything has been done. If that is the 
position the hon. leader of the Reform Party is taking, then he 
should say so because it has huge implications for Canadians and 
for inquiries to get to the truth in a reasonable amount of time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister does not answer my question, but I believe he 
makes reference to my remarks to the Prime Minister when I asked 
him to guarantee that the results of the Somalia inquiry would be 
made available before the next election; not half a report, not a 
cover-up report,  not a whitewash report but results that answer the 
questions.
<P>
	Does the minister understand the word results: names, dates, 
times, acts committed, acts not committed by ministers, Liberal 
and Tory, deputy ministers, generals, high ranking officials who 
had anything to do with murder and cover-up in Somalia?
<P>
	How can the minister guarantee that those results, the whole 
truth, will be forthcoming from an inquiry when government 
induced delays and political interferences are making it impossible 
for it to complete its work?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a lot of 
Canadians are paying a lot of attention to this. I want to make sure, 
again, that I provide the opportunity to the leader of the Reform 
Party to explain to this place and to Canadians what he really 
means.
<P>
	What he said on September 17 was: ``To ensure there is no 
ultimate cover-up in the Somalia inquiry, will the Prime Minister 
guarantee to this House that the results of the Somalia inquiry will 
be made fully public before the next election?''
<P>
	He can play all the semantic games he wants. He knows that you 
cannot go to an inquiry and force it to hear witnesses it does not 
want to hear; nor can you force it to give results before the election 
if the inquiry is not over. Results are provided when the work is 
done, and that is what we have asked it to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister, as is his custom, resorts to bluster and fluster 
to avoid the real question, what the government has done from day 
one on Somalia and on Krever and on the botched airbus 
investigation.
<P>
	If I had to sum up the Liberal government's approach to integrity 
and accountability-and that is what we are getting at-I would 
have to say that it has gone from the red book to whitewash. The 
Americans have Whitewater; what we have here is whitewash. 
Answers to the Krever inquiry, whitewash; answers to what 
happened in Somalia, whitewash.
<P>
	Why has the government chosen to whitewash the facts rather 
than give Canadians the truth about the tainted blood scandal and 
the Somalia murder cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, sooner or later 
my hon. friend, the leader of the Reform Party, is going to have to 
decide how he wants to do this.
<P>
	This is the manual prepared by the Reform Party to guide it 
through question period and its strategy for this session. This is a 
direct quote from section 13 of the Reform manual: ``Questions 
should not be used to get straight information. That is a primitive 
use of question period that we have now passed''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7835"> 7835 </A></B>
<P>
	What is the point of trying to get to the bottom of something 
when the leader of the Reform Party says that he does not want 
any straight answers? The shame of it is he cannot even ask a 
straight question.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Supreme Court gave its decision on the disclosure 
of the victim's records in sexual cases. In a five to four decision, 
the majority of the justices ordered a stay of proceedings in a case 
of sexual assault, because a rape crisis centre had destroyed the 
records of the victim, which the accused had requested in his 
defence.
<P>
	How is it that the bill introduced in June 1996, which was 
intended to severely limit access to victims' records, has not yet 
been passed? This bill was introduced in June 1996, and still today 
the minister has done nothing to move it along. Will the minister do 
anything to hasten the passing of this bill?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

records for complainants in criminal matters before the courts.
<P>
	Last Tuesday, we began debate at second reading of this bill. I 
hope that in the coming days and weeks we will complete debate at 
second reading and be able to send the bill to committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since June 1996, the Supreme Court has had time to hand 
down two decisions against victims. I can assure the minister of the 
full co-operation of the official opposition in passing Bill C-46 as 
quickly as possible.

	Will the minister undertake to have Bill C-46 passed before the 
next election to ensure victims of sexual crimes enjoy full 
protection?

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Deputy

documents from the blood committee was wrong. Those 
documents happened to  cover the period of time, 1982 to 1984, 
when the Liberal government was in power.
<P>
	Victims of this tragedy want to know why the shredder was 
rewarded with a golden handshake instead of being punished, for

attention to what the government has done to this point.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> It is not a priority of the Reform Party to have 
members in government respect to due process. What the member 
will appreciate is that the department followed all the guidelines 
dictated by-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> I gather you do not want the answer, but I am going 
to give it to you anyway. It may not come down all that well. The 
department has co-operated both with the inquiry and with the 
commissioner with respect to access to information and in all cases 
complied fully.
<P>
	What the member will also want to appreciate is that the 
department had in its possession a preliminary report on December 
3, which is incumbent on governments. Members will appreciate 
that kind of report has to satisfy the requirements under the Access 
to Information Act which says that all investigations must be 
conducted in private. Those under investigation have a right to 
have a normal lifestyle until there is a final report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary talks about co-operation with the inquiry. 
Listen to the story that comes out of the commissioner's attempt to 
get at the facts on the shredding.
<P>
	The first thing the department did was try to block him in court 
with a legal challenge. The second thing the department did was lie 
to him to say that the documents did not even exist. Now the 
commissioner has to go back. He is inquiring about why it blocked 
him.

continually blocking the truth for them, not for me but for them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

opposite would try to draw sympathy for a very tragic situation.
<P>
	He will recall-and if he does not, other members will-that it 
was Liberal Party members on this side of the House who called for 
the Krever inquiry in the first place. Second, they insisted it have

<P>
	On the issue of the cancellation of the Pearson airport 
privatization deal, the transport minister confirmed that the 
government is ready to settle out of court with the Pearson 
developers. Also, we have learned that more than four tentative out

and the federal government but that, each time, the deal was 
rejected by the prime minister's office.
<P>

Canadian taxpayers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

wrong.
<P>
	I can assure him that I have absolutely no knowledge of any 
negotiations currently taking place with Pearson airport's T1 and 
T2 corporation.
<P>

arrange for settlement out of court. But I have absolutely no

<P>
	The assumption that there are hundreds of millions of dollars out 
there which are simply going to be picked up by this consortium is 
false. Were it true that the company is losing all this money it

record on job creation. Every time these figures come out we hear 
the finance minister proclaim how well they are doing compared 
with the G-7. But the facts simply do not bear that out.
<P>
	In fact, according to G-7 figures Japan, the U.S. and Britain all

higher than the OECD average of 8.5 per cent.

above 9 per cent. The Liberals have had three and a half years to fix 
this problem. How in the world can the finance minister explain the

jobs, jobs, jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question the hon.

for our government. The labour force survey that just came out 
which showed only an increase of 5,000 jobs in the last month was 
disappointing.
<P>

report. There were 32,000 full time jobs created last month. There 
have been 91,000 jobs created since last September, just in the last

be a strong job growth year, a strong economic growth year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
fine rhetoric, but frankly it does not pay the rent. I would suggest 
that the only jobs the minister is concerned about are Liberal jobs, 
which is why there is such a theme of cover-up in this place.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has 
always taken a leadership role in addressing the interests of persons 
with disabilities. We had a very impressive task force on which the 
member for Fredericton-York-Sunbury has actually helped us. I 
thank him very much for his creativity and for his advice on this 
issue.
<P>
	That is the reason why the vocational rehabilitation of disabled 
persons program received an extension until March 1998. We have 
made assisting persons with disabilities one of the key priorities of 
the work of the Ministerial Council on Social Policy Reform and 
Renewal in tasks that we are doing with the provinces as well.
<P>
	In addition, I have tasked my senior officials to develop action 
plans for HRDC to ensure that we move forward and integrate the 
disability issues across all of our programs and all of businesses 
across the country.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	The present Prime Minister, in referring to the privatization of 
Pearson airport during the last election campaign, said that the 
promoters would, and I quote, ``initiate projects that would be 
worth up to $200 million annually''. However, lawyers for the 
federal government are now in court to try and prove that the 
profits of private promoters at Pearson were in no way excessive, 
but their experts claim that the promoters could have lost as much 
as $180 million.
<P>
	Are we to conclude from the government's defence in the 
Pearson saga that Ottawa cancelled an agreement that would have 
been profitable for Canadian taxpayers and for travellers, and all 
this simply to support the partisan commitments of the Prime 
Minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, this question and others from the Bloc Quebecois indicate 
that Bloc members fail to understand what the Pearson case is all 
about.
<P>
	The previous government negotiated a less than perfect 
agreement on Pearson with a private company. As soon as it came 
to power, our government tried to repair the damage that was done 
by cancelling the agreement. We have just ceded Pearson to a 
non-profit airport authority, like the ones in Montreal, Vancouver, 
Calgary, Edmonton and other locations.
<P>
	We have never stopped saying we will accept only a fair 
agreement between the complainants and the taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we realize that all this may cost taxpayers tens of 
millions of dollars, without ever getting at the truth of the matter, 
as in other cases now being pursued.
<P>
	Why will the minister not admit that his government preferred to 
make some political hay out of attacking the Conservatives in this 
petty way instead of getting down to the bottom of all this and 
ordering a public inquiry, something the Bloc Quebecois has been 
demanding for more than three years? Is the present government 
afraid that a public inquiry would reveal cases of patronage among 
Liberals as well as Conservatives?
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member and his party still fail to understand the 
present situation. The complainants are more interested in 
obtaining compensation for what they see as foregone profits. 
Their demands are unreasonable.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	Grain movement on the prairies is at a standstill, causing farmers 
real hardship. The government removed the Crow subsidy on grain 
freight, more than doubling farmers' freight costs with a promise 
that things would work better. Does the agriculture minister believe 
that things are working better, as he promised?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously the linkage the hon. 
gentleman draws between the former Crow subsidy and the 
situation with grain movement currently on the prairies is not a 
valid or appropriate linkage at all.
<P>
	As I indicated yesterday in the House in response to a question 
from the NDP, the facts are that we have had a very difficult winter 
season, with heavy snowfalls and particularly cold temperatures. I 
went on to observe that that in itself cannot be regarded as a valid 
excuse.
<P>
	The railways have an obligation to provide sufficient locomotive 
power to pull the grain from the prairies through the Rockies to the 
port positions and also eastward to Thunder Bay. Obviously the 
level of performance in the last number of weeks has not been 
satisfactory and the railways are obliged to do a better job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, farmers 
and Reform MPs stressed the importance of dealing with the rail 
car allocation problem, removing fixed freight rates and making 
other changes to introduce competition into the system before 
removing the Crow benefit and before the new transportation act 
was signed.
<P>
	The minister refused to do this and must be held accountable. 
Every day grain does not move farmers pay dearly. What will the 
minister do to fix this mess that his government has imposed on 
farmers? What is he going to do to get grain moving again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the railways have indicated they 
are taking steps to add to the locomotive power available in 
western Canada for grain movement. That is a welcome 
development. It may not in itself be enough.
<P>
	I will be consulting with them in the days immediately ahead as 
well as with other players in the grains industry,  including the 
Canadian Wheat Board, to determine what additional steps can and 
should be taken to catch up on the backlog and make sure that by 
the end of this shipping season the backlog has been overcome.
<P>
	Beyond that, all of the players in the grains industry have to 
work harder to make sure this does not become a recurring pattern 
in our grain transportation system. The railways should be aware 
that it is cold every January, it snows every January and they have 
to have the machinery in place to cope with it.

hard toward an overarching cultural policy.

to the leaders of the Canadian cultural community, to be open to

putting in place a plan to ensure the security of the staff as well as 
the inmates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
people in this country are fed up with government inaction and 
government sponsored prisoners' rights. Now prison officials are 
talking about negotiating a settlement, if you will, with the 
prisoners at Millhaven.
<P>
	The word of the day is compromise, not responsibility. 
Negotiations with inmates are absolutely foolhardy.
<P>
	Why does the solicitor general support criminals and their 
demands for more rights and not victims' rights? Where is the 
responsibility?

everything is being done to restore order to the prison and to assure

	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The unemployment rate among young people has been a disaster 
throughout 1996 and appears to be heading for a worse showing 
this year.
<P>
	Last march in the budget speech the government announced 
$315 million over three years for youth programs. A year later, 
nothing has happened, even though the Minister of Human 
Resources Development said on October 11, and I quote: ``This fall 
we intend to announce a youth initiative''. I have the feeling the 
government is waiting for young people to grow old because one 
year after it promised new initiatives, we are still waiting.
<P>
	My question is the same one as six months ago: What is the 
minister waiting for to release the funds sitting unused in the 
government's coffers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean for his extremely timely question.
<P>
	Youth unemployment is a great concern for the government. This 
is the reason why the finance minister allocated an additional $315 
million to all other programs we have to help young people enter 
the job market in a more appealing manner.
<P>
	I must say that the situation of young people looking for work is 
something we are extremely concerned with. There are are several 
in my own riding and I know how important it is for young people 
not to lose hope.
<P>
	This coming week, we are planning-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I may, I would be pleased to tell 
the member for Lac-Saint-Jean that the impatience he has been 
showing will soon be addressed as I made sure that the programs 
we are going to make public within the next few days will be 
extremely well designed in partnership with the private sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
often say that young people are not only our future, they are our 
present. For once, the minister seems to be telling us that, six 
months late, he is finally going to announce programs for young 
people. I am starting to believe that it takes an election for this 
government to spring into action.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Does the minister not think that he should include all the youth 
programs, especially their funding, in the ongoing 
federal-provincial negotiations on active employment measures?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be given the 
opportunity by the member for Lac-Saint-Jean to stress again our 
government's commitment to disentangle all the issues relating to 
training and active employment measures aimed at making it easier 
to enter the job market.
<P>
	As for the employment programs we are hoping to announce 
within the next few days, you will see that they are in partnership 
with the private sector. These programs come very clearly under 
the federal government's responsibilities, under our constitutional 
jurisdiction. They will bring hope and help to young Canadians.
<P>
	What we need in our society is to give young people the 
opportunity to get experience. As a society we need their 
exuberance.

respect to the CBC. Thank you. That is good common sense.

	With respect to the international trade minister, he certainly 
brings some common sense to this.

	Why has the government chosen over the past three and a half 
years to ignore the needs of young Canadians for work?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite the opposite. The 
problems of young Canadians who are looking for work are 
something about which we are extremely concerned and want to do 
our very best.
<P>
	The government allocated in the 1996 budget $315 million in 
supplements to all programs that we have to address their particular 
needs. I hope to be in a position to shortly announce programs that 
have been designed, in partnership with the private sector, that 
address the needs of young Canadians who are looking for work. If

keeps intensifying every day. Humanitarian agencies are 
evacuating high risk areas, while refugees flee their camps without 
any assistance or food. The situation is catastrophic, as we could 
see on television yesterday.
<P>
	Since the government wanted to take a leadership role when the 
crisis first started in November, could the Deputy Prime Minister 
tell us today if her government will be as diligent now that the

hundreds of thousands of refugees who are still in Zaire?

concern to Canada.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest was completing his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to refresh the memories of hon. members, this debate has 
to do with the events which took place in Somalia.
<P>
	Specifically, I was asking the minister in response to his speech 
in this debate questions pertaining to ministerial responsibility, the 
relationship between defence command headquarters, the deputy 
minister, the chief of defence staff and the then minister of defence, 
Kim Campbell.
<P>
	The terrible events of March 16 were reported to the minister by 
the chief of defence staff, John Anderson, and the deputy minister, 
Mr. Fowler, on March 18, two days later. At that time the minister 
of defence was not informed that there was a potential problem 
with criminality.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	The minister of defence subsequently read that at that very time, 
on March 18, John Anderson had been reported in <I>Maclean's</I> 
magazine as saying that there was a suspicion of criminal intent 
from the beginning. That means either the chief of defence staff or 
the deputy minister misled or were totally incompetent in advising 
the minister, the civilian authority to whom they were responsible. 
It was not until March 31, almost two weeks later, that the minister 
of defence was informed of the events that took place.
<P>
	That may be incompetence on the minister's part. It may be 
incompetence on the deputy minister's part. But there was 
incompetence. It was either gross incompetence or a cover-up to 
protect the minister.
<P>
	The deputy minister, Mr. Fowler, retained the confidence of the 
government and was appointed to a high ranking position at the 
United Nations. Now either Mr. Fowler was lying or covering up, 
or he misled, but why would this cover-up have started in the first 
place and be allowed to continue? And why would a person who 
was involved in it enjoy the continued confidence of the 
government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. gentleman who has put 
the question is a very, very serious member of Parliament and 
understands the implications of my trying to comment on the 
events he has explained. Please let me try to respond. I do not want 
to be evasive in any way but there are implications to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7843"> 7843 </A></B>
<P>
statements made by  the hon. member that obviously are troubling 
to the member and to others.
<P>
	I want to reiterate to the hon. member that there is absolutely 
nothing which precludes the commissioners of the inquiry calling 
the current ambassador for Canada to the United Nations, or the 
former Prime Minister of Canada who is now consul general in Los 
Angeles, or anyone else. I know it has been suggested that there is 
not sufficient time. However, even as we speak today there is still a 
lot of time between now and the end of March with the commission 
of inquiry to report by the end of June.
<P>
	Although I have been extremely meticulous in not getting 
involved in trying to set the agenda in the sense of recommending 
that witnesses be heard, or commenting on testimony that may be 
heard or allegations that may have been made, I understand the 
hon. member's concerns. I think that the appropriate approach to 
this is for him and members of his party to make clear who they 
think should be heard from because of the importance of the 
testimony that might be forthcoming.
<P>
	I would simply conclude my response to the hon. member by 
saying that the Minister of National Defence at the time this 
incident is alleged to have occurred subsequently became the Prime 
Minister of Canada. Let us be clear that the Prime Minister of 
Canada at that time, prior to the election of our government in late 
October of 1993, continued to provide support to that same deputy 
minister who remained in the position where he was when she was 
Minister of National Defence. I really do not think I can comment 
on why that occurred or whether or not there was any fault in the 
way the deputy minister communicated with the then Minister of 
National Defence who subsequently became the boss of everyone 
as the Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
to the minister, I would like to quote Justice Létourneau yesterday 
with regard to their ability to hear any witness they want to hear. He 
said: ``It is not true in this respect that we have plenty of time to 
call witnesses such as Mr. Fowler and Mr. Anderson. Evidence on 
such important matters presented without the possibility of real or 
substantial testing risks producing a whitewash of the alleged 
cover-up rather than an investigation of it''.
<P>
	I equate the inquiry somewhat to a jigsaw puzzle. In a jigsaw 
puzzle there is a key piece and once that key piece is in place, the 
thing makes sense and comes together.
<P>
	I suggest to the minister that it is not reasonable for the inquiry 
to go to the witnesses at the end of the chain before they have 
established the rest of the pattern, so that when they ask their 
questions they are based on evidence that is directly related to the 
individual they are questioning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand this hon. member as well 
and his deep interest in this matter.
<P>
	I am very concerned that perhaps there is an implication, and if it 
is not correct I am sure the hon. member will have ample 
opportunity to clarify it, that somehow at this stage in February 
1997, a long time after the incidents occurred in Somalia, we 
should still be proceeding on the basis that every witness, every 
document, every incident should be pursued until all of the parties 
involved have been included by the commissioners. As the hon. 
member knows, there are a huge number of witnesses who have 
been heard, in excess of 100. There are over 50 or 60 lawyers 
involved on a continuous basis.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	I do not believe I can comment on the justices' remarks with 
respect to how much time they have to call witnesses. There have 
been witnesses who have been heard for very lengthy periods of 
time. There have been efforts made to pursue certain avenues that I 
have never commented on. Surely Canadians understand one thing, 
that between now and the end of March nothing precludes the 
commissioners' hearing those people they feel are appropriate in 
that timeframe based on their own agenda.
<P>
	If they feel that somehow that would distort or convolute the 
process that is entirely their prerogative. It is not the view that I 
hold, nor does the government hold that view. Seriously, if anyone 
is suggesting that this commission of inquiry should continue until 
everybody is totally satisfied that every question has been 
answered to their satisfaction, I do not think anyone believes it 
would end before the end of this century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to carry on from the minister's comments. I, as much as 
anyone, wish this inquiry had been concluded a year ago. I 
certainly do not want to see it extended forever but I do want to see 
the answers come out. I think it is vital that the inquiry be allowed 
to complete its business.
<P>
	I want to go on record and recognize the excellent work our 
armed forces do. They have been committed in any number of 
places, uncomfortable, dangerous and far flung. They have 
committed themselves time and time again to the duty to which 
they have been assigned. When they commit themselves, they 
commit themselves very well. It works.
<P>
	Therefore I think it is a shame that unhappily the Somali debacle 
has cast a cloud over the whole military force, even for me. After 
36 years of service in the air force I left very proud of my service 
there. I was a senior officer when I left and now I find that people 
who know this almost ask the question ``were you one of those who 
covers up and does not accept responsibility and  does this?'' Most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7844"> 7844 </A></B>
<P>
senior officers do accept their responsibilities. They are good 
leaders.
<P>
	The people who have unhappily been accused in this instance are 
left sort of hanging out to dry unless their case can be heard in 
completeness and therefore they can be found either absolutely 
innocent of any wrongdoing or be found to have been inadequate in 
some way.
<P>
	The Liberal government initially resisted the inquiry being 
compiled at all. It said no, the situation is being investigated by the 
defence department. It was only when Major Armstrong came forth 
in November 1994 that the Minister of National Defence at that 
time was forced to order an inquiry. Even then with the interlude of 
the Christmas break it was sometime in the following year before 
he did it and he announced it as an inquiry under the National 
Defence Act. This means that once again the inquiry would be 
conducted behind closed doors. It would not be open to the public.
<P>
	On March 20 I demanded in this House that the investigation be 
held under the Inquiries Act rather than the National Defence Act. 
The next day the minister, and I congratulate him for doing so, saw 
the wisdom of this and changed the inquiry to come under the 
Inquiries Act, which made it open to the public.
<P>
	Now we are having the inquiry curtailed when it gets into the 
final stages of its job. First of all, it was supposed to investigate the 
deployment to Somali before the predeployment phase, the during 
phase and the post phase, the after phase. It has completed the 
predeployment phase. It is nearing the end of its investigation into 
the deployment phase. But it will not be able to investigate the 
post-deployment phase because of the arbitrary curtailment of the 
inquiry put in by the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	I see this as blatant political interference in a judicial inquiry. 
The minister by his action is denying people who have had 
accusations flung against them to be heard in full, to have justice 
done them. That seems unfair. Justice Latourneau has said that if he 
cannot hear people, he will make no judgment. I think that is 
absolutely right. If we have not given people a chance to testify to 
be heard, to be examined, then it is not fair to find them.
<P>
	What this means is that there may be people who are responsible 
and were responsible who will not be held accountable for their 
actions. I think that is not fair.
<P>
	Also, look at what this decision is going to mean to future 
inquiries. What will people say when they are asked to participate 
on an inquiry? They will say ``Am I going to get two-thirds of the 
inquiry? Will I involve myself in this thing which might turn out to 
be a fiasco that is cut short because of the arbitrary whim of some 
political minister?'' If that does happen, we are going to lose in 
Canada a tremendous capability to examine and assure that justice 
is being done in all aspects of  government. It goes to the integrity, 
the impartiality and the independence of the commission.
<P>
	The minister mentioned in his comments if the Reform Party 
wanted to suggest to the commissioners some witnesses we think 
they should hear. To me that is me interfering with the inquiry. The 
commissioners have established a standing for various people. I 
assume they have done that in recognition of the information and 
the facts this individual has to present to the commission and others 
have been denied. It is not for me to tell the commissioners how to 
do their job.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I neglected to mention that I will be splitting my 
time with the member for Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member then will have about 
four minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Thank you. Also, I would like to point out that this 
inquiry has been hamstrung by the very people it is investigating to 
a large extent. Documents were withheld, information was slow to 
come forward. Then we had that magic Easter egg hunt where 
people were shut down for a day and they went through all their 
files and they amassed a whole gigantic bunch of information that 
was then presented to the commission. I understand there were 
absolutely thousands of pages of testimony that the commission 
then had to do through, page by page, because it cannot overlook 
anything. It might omit something important. This was a deliberate 
withholding of evidence for the commission and it caused a delay.
<P>
	No one doubts that the problem in Somalia was one of command 
and control. That command and control stretched from the theatre 
right the way back to national defence headquarters in Ottawa. It 
also had to do with leadership and discipline. The people on the 
ground obviously were not properly led nor were they properly 
disciplined. We are hearing stories of things that went on that are 
just unacceptable, whether it be in an operational situation or 
anywhere.
<P>
	When the murder of Shidane Arone took place, it was in a 
relatively small compound with at least 80 people in the vicinity 
who could not have helped but heard what was going on. Yet none 
of them intervened, and I do not understand why.
<P>
	Where was the platoon commander, where was the regimental 
sergeant-major, where was the company sergeant-major, where was 
the company commander? How could they let this go on and not 
interfere or intervene? I know there were a number of people who 
actually went into the bunker and saw this going on and they chose 
not to take action. This is totally unacceptable and should not have 
been allowed.
<P>
	The problem I think is that we cannot fix something we do not 
know is broken. We have to find out what has gone wrong before 
we can say ``this is the problem, now we can fix it''. I do not know 
just how that can be  accomplished unless we go right to the end of 
the chain and say ``This is what happened. This was the input. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7845"> 7845 </A></B>
<P>
was how it was dealt with''. If the dealing with it was inadequate, 
then it is only appropriate that we finish it.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	I want to go to the minister's comments with regard to my 
leader's submission. He has mentioned a number of times. I quote 
the leader of the Reform Party from <I>Hansard</I> on September 17, 
1996, page 4308: ``Mr. Speaker, to ensure there is no ultimate 
cover-up in the Somalia inquiry, will the Prime Minister guarantee 
to this House that the results of the inquiry will be made fully 
public before the next federal election?'' In no way does this 
suggest that the inquiry should be shut down. It merely says 
completed.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and his government were elected in October 
1993 for five years, which gives them until October 1998. My 
leader does not call the election; the Prime Minister calls the 
election, and he can call it whenever he wants to. If he is not afraid 
of the inquiry coming out, why does he not wait until the inquiry 
reports and then call the election?
<P>
	I will now propose an amendment to the motion.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all of the words after the word ``inquiry'' 
and adding the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``and directing the commission to make its final report as soon as possible but not 
later than December 31, 1997''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion is in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague from Saanich-Gulf 
Islands, who has over 36 years of military experience, to explore 
further the notion of the culture that allowed the horrific events of 
March 16 to happen and the horrific events that took place before 
March 16.
<P>
	In the member's military experience is it possible in a closed 
environment of a military base for a corporal to find himself in a 
situation in a bunker with nobody else knowing about it, with 
nobody else accepting responsibility other than one sergeant?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have said this before and I believe it 
in my heart. If I had been the commander on scene this would not 
have happened. It would not have happened because my personnel 
would have known that I would not allow it to happen. It would not 
be acceptable to me.
<P>
	The member for Edmonton Southwest has put his finger on a lot 
of the problem. Problems were evident in the airborne regiment 
before it was deployed. These problems were made known to 
higher headquarters, yet the people who were recommended to be 
left at home were still taken there. It was one of those people who 
was recommended to be left at home who was found to have 
committed the crime.
<P>
	Obviously there is a problem somewhere along the line.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	Was it in Petawawa? Was it at land force headquarters in 
Ontario? Was it at national defence headquarters? Where was it? I 
am not sure. I guess the commission has that information. 
Obviously the military culture does not accept this sort of 
behaviour as being normal.
<P>
	What is required is to establish how this aberration happened, 
how it was allowed to happen and who was responsible for having 
not taken action to rectify it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this debate. I want to take 
it in a slightly different direction and try to put a somewhat more 
human face on the actual tragedy that befell one particular 
individual, Kyle Brown.
<P>
	I would also like to show how the terrible circumstances of 
March 16, 1993 in Somalia inextricably linked three lives and how 
these lives were affected so differently as a result of it. There was 
the Somalia teenager, Shidane Arone, who was tortured and killed, 
for which there is no excuse; Robert Fowler, who was at that time 
the deputy minister of defence; and Kyle Brown, who at that time 
was a corporal in the Canadian Armed Forces serving in Somalia.
<P>
	I joined the navy when I was 17. When I joined the navy it was 
really the first time in my life that I learned a sense of brotherhood. 
It was the first time in my life that I ever felt I was just the same as 
everyone else because I grew up on the other side of the tracks. As 
with many people who are in the military for the first time, it is the 
first time that they really get a foundation. One of the tragedies is 
the fact that we do not have a military any longer that allows for 
this kind of involvement, citizenship, renewal and growth.
<P>
	I want to get back to the specific situation of trooper Kyle 
Brown. He was born and raised in Alberta. When he was 14 years 
of age, Kyle's mother died of a drug overdose. A year later his 
father committed suicide. Kyle Brown and an elder sister raised 
and helped look after a younger sibling. Kyle Brown was a 
struggler and a fighter all his life. Kyle Brown did not come from a 
privileged background. He came from a background that many 
Canadians come from, of struggle, and joining the Canadian 
Armed Forces was the pinnacle of his life. He was so proud of this 
and worked so hard to get in. He did not get in right away. He had to 
work to get into the armed forces.
<P>
	I know something of the way the military works, having joined 
the navy when I was 17. When I saw the results of what had 
happened in Somalia I thought it was passing strange. It was 
wrong. There was something inherently not correct in the fact that 
the lowest ranking member found himself with five years in jail, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7846"> 7846 </A></B>
<P>
yet the very  people who allowed the culture to develop got 
nothing. It just did not seem right.
<P>
	When I was in the service, if the ship hit an iceberg the captain 
was at fault. It did not matter who was on the bridge. It had to do 
with responsibility. It goes all the way up the line to ministerial 
responsibility. In our culture, in a greater sense, the fact is that we 
as legislators or leaders accept the mantle of responsibility that 
comes with leadership we must also accept responsibility.
<P>
	I initiated a meeting with Kyle Brown because I wanted to speak 
with him to find out what was going on but, more importantly, I 
wanted to say to Kyle Brown: ``Look, Kyle, what went on is 
inexcusable but you are not alone. Some of us know that we all bear 
some responsibility for what has happened to you''.
<P>
	I first met Kyle Brown when he was in the Edmonton maximum 
security penal institution. It was the first time I had ever been in 
such an institution. I went through all the checks and the clanging 
doors to get in to see this man. At our very first meeting he was gun 
shy because everybody he had encountered in a position of 
authority had screwed him and had worked him over some way: 
journalists who had used him for a story and had dropped him; the 
military justice system that screwed him right from the beginning. 
Kyle Brown, by turning over the film, incriminated himself and 
prevented a cover-up from happening. This is the individual who 
by knowingly incriminating himself prevented a cover-up from 
happening, knowing full well that he would end up carrying the can 
for it. Nobody else would. He ended up in jail.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I believe that denotes character of the highest order. It is 
character from a person who did not come from a privileged 
background. Contrast that to the character of another person 
involved in this, Robert Fowler. He came from a privileged 
background. He had a position of high moral authority in our 
nation. What did he do? He misled the Minister of National 
Defence, to whom he was responsible, for one reason or another 
and as a consequence he was left in his position, either because the 
Prime Minister of the day was incompetent and did not remove him 
or for another reason. That person is still enjoying the confidence 
of the government.
<P>
	I visited the person at the other end of this, the one that showed 
character by incriminating himself to ensure that a cover-up did not 
happen. He knew right from the beginning that what was going on 
was wrong. He knew his participation in it was wrong. He 
participated in it because of the culture of the regiment of which he 
was a part. He was a minor serving person.
<P>
	I saw him in jail. He had tears in his eyes. He said: ``I bear the 
responsibility for this in the eyes of every single citizen of this 
country. I am the lowest form of life. I joined the army and when I 
went to Somalia I wanted to  bring honour to our country. I wanted 
to come back to Canada having brought glory to my country and to 
my regiment. Instead I am in jail. Other people that were involved 
in this are scurrying for cover. No one has accepted responsibility''.
<P>
	The statement which I am about to quote is in response to 
questions posed at a parole board hearing when Kyle Brown was at 
Bowden waiting to get out. I would point out as well that Kyle 
Brown had to pay for his defence himself. His sister went into debt 
to pay for his defence because he had no confidence in the military 
justice system. The first two counsel who went to Somalia took the 
first two people in the line of the people who had been charged. The 
other four people in line had no defence whatsoever. The first two 
people got off. The other four got charged. After that, because they 
are not stupid over there, they realized that anybody who came 
forward with any information was charged, so no one else came 
forward with information.
<P>
	Kyle Brown said at his parole hearing: ``A soldier is taught to 
obey orders without question. He is also taught that he has the 
moral obligation not to execute an illegal command''. Kyle Brown 
has said to me and to others: ``I got what I deserved. I knew better 
and I should not have done it. I did it. I should have fought to 
protect him. I was wrong. I accept the punishment I got''. But why 
the hell did anybody else not end up in jail? Why did the person 
who allowed the culture to develop not end up in jail? Why is Bob 
Fowler, who was the deputy minister of defence who misled the 
defence minister, at the United Nations representing our country?
<P>
	Kyle Brown said further at his hearing: ``The thing that we are 
not told is what to do in a situation where superiors not only give 
illegal commands but execute them''. What do you do in a situation 
in Somalia where the senior non-commissioned officers are going 
around drunk? There is no leadership. There is no accountability. 
Then the lowest ranking member of the armed forces ends up in 
jail. What kind of a signal does that send to everybody else in the 
armed forces? That is what we are talking about here.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	We are talking about people in positions of authority accepting 
the responsibility for their positions and not sloughing it off to 
somebody else like the corporal who showed character while the 
deputy minister showed none. That is what this is all about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want 
to congratulate the two Reform members who spoke on behalf of 
their party.
<P>
	I have had the pleasure of working with the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands whom, I think, is a true gentleman. The hon. 
member was in the military for a number of years. He knows the 
problems that plague  the Canadian forces. We sat together on the 
joint committee. The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7847"> 7847 </A></B>
<P>
knows what he is talking about when he discusses the morale of our 
troops.
<P>
	I also want to congratulate the other member who spoke. I 
believe these people, like us, want to get at the truth.
<P>
	At this point in time, it is estimated that the inquiry will have 
cost $25 million. However, the really sad thing is that we will still 
not know exactly what happened after, Canadians will not know 
how some tried to hide the facts, and this is an aberration. 
Canadians can accept the spending of money, provided it is done 
properly.
<P>
	There is a problem in the Canadian forces. There are, and my 
party certainly agrees, extraordinary people in the military. There 
are people who work hard, but the morale of our troops is currently 
being undermined, and we think it is coming from the top. This is 
why we must do whatever is necessary.
<P>
	What we are asking, and I see that the Reform Party agrees with 
us, is for an extension of a few months, not 10 years, just a few 
months.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member if, based on his experience, he 
believes the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party are asking for a 
reasonable extension. Does he think this would allow us to get at 
the truth and then take the necessary steps to correct the situation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, in my view the only way that we 
will ever retain any confidence-not just us but the Canadian 
people and the military-in it is to exorcise all the ghosts and 
demons. No matter how long it takes and no matter how much it 
costs, it will be worth it.
<P>
	Let me bring one more instance into this. Sergeant Mark Boland 
was asleep at the time that this took place. He was a section 
commander. He accepted responsibility for what happened because 
it happened on his watch. Even though he was not on site, these 
people were under his direct command and he accepted 
responsibility. He pleaded guilty to dereliction of responsibility 
because it happened. He did a plea bargain and got nine months.
<P>
	He is a career military person. He recognized it was wrong. The 
military said: ``Okay, plead guilty. We will give you nine months 
and you can get on with your life''. He got his nine months and then 
the military appealed. Then he got over a year and they could then 
kick him out.
<P>
	Mark Boland was an exemplary career soldier. If the 
commission wants to hear horror stories about what really went on 
in Somalia it should interview him. Mark Boland was given a direct 
order by a superior commissioned officer who was pissed out of his 
mind to shoot a Somali in cold blood. He would not do it. All the 
commission had to do is ask him.
<P>
	Mark Boland does not have standing before the commission. 
How can this possibly be? When the military police came to Mark 
Boland's home in Petawawa to arrest him the second time, they did 
so in front of his wife and children. He hauled him out of his home 
with his children screaming: ``Daddy, what is happening? What is 
going on?''
<P>
	This was the kind of treatment afforded the lower deck as 
differentiated from the treatment afforded the upper deck. That is 
why there is a morale problem in the Canadian Armed Forces today 
and people do not have to be rocket scientists to figure it out.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, right 
off the bat, I want to say that I will be sharing my time with the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	``The most important asset of government is the confidence it 
enjoys of the citizens to whom it is accountable. This erosion of 
confidence seems to have many causes: some have to do with the 
behaviour of certain elected politicians, others with an arrogant 
style of political leadership. The people are irritated with 
governments that do not consult them, or that disregard their views, 
or that try to conduct key parts of the public business behind closed 
doors.'' These wise words are not from me, but from the red book 
of the Liberal Party of Canada. It goes on to say: ``A Liberal 
government will take a series of initiatives to restore confidence in 
the institutions of government.''
<P>
	During the election campaign, the Liberal Party came out as a 
model of integrity, advocating integrity and transparency, wanting 
to restore the public confidence in politicians and their institutions. 
Instead, Liberals have become masters of cover-ups, shady deals, 
obfuscation, hidden and hypocritical actions.
<P>
	It is with great pleasure that I support the motion put forward by 
my hon. colleague from Shefford, which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should commit itself to having 
full light shed on the events occurring before, during and after the deployment of 
Canadian troops to Somalia, by extending the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry 
until December 31, 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Just as the commission itself asked for.
<P>
	As we all know, this inquiry was abruptly and prematurely 
terminated by the defence minister and the federal government. We 
have the right to ask why this commission of inquiry is not being 
treated with the same tolerance usually shown other royal 
commissions.
<P>
	This decision is unprecedented. This is the first time a 
government refuses to extend the mandate of a royal commission 
or any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7848"> 7848 </A></B>
<P>
other judicial inquiry. So it is quite  normal that we should question 
the motives behind this precedent, which will unfortunately go 
down in history.
<P>
	However, we are all the more puzzled when the commission 
chief, Mr. Justice Létourneau, says that this deadline means that he 
and the commission will be unable to get to the bottom of this 
affair.
<P>
	Thanks to our Liberal colleagues, Quebecers and Canadians will 
not be able to get the full story on the role of the top army and 
government brass in this affair. Once again, therefore, it is the little 
guys who will pay, in this case, the lower ranks.
<P>
	Just when the Somalia inquiry was getting to the meat of its 
mandate, it is suddenly reined in. Why? ``Because it has already 
cost the taxpayer too much'', is the defence minister's reply. And a 
wonderfully deceptive reply it is, coming from a Liberal minister 
whose government will soon call an election.
<P>
	Of course, they trot out figures of $25 million, which may seem 
huge to the ordinary person, but they neglect to say what they 
include. The amount is actually more like $14 million, when you 
deduct the cost of legal representation for certain witnesses, and the 
$10 million spent by the Department of National Defence getting 
ready for the inquiry.
<P>
	In addition, if the costs of this commission are compared with 
those of commissions held over the last 15 years, it can be seen that 
this latest one is not out of line, far from it. As an example, the 
1994 commission on new reproductive technologies cost the 
taxpayers of Quebec and of Canada exactly $29,726,730, while the 
commission on aboriginal peoples, which ran from 1991 to 1996, 
apparently cost the astronomical sum of $51,220,732.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	As you can see, the first point raised by the minister regarding 
the fact that the Somalia inquiry was costing too much simply has 
no basis in fact.
<P>
	They also referred to the time involved. As I said earlier, the 
commission on aboriginal peoples went on for five years; the 
commission on new reproductive technologies took four years; the 
commission on the future of the Toronto harbour area-imagine, 
the future of the Toronto harbour area-nearly four years; and this 
one, which goes to the very heart of organization and discipline 
within the Canadian armed forces is taking too long? This 
argument does not hold water.
<P>
	This is like hiring a detective to investigate a somewhat 
unsavoury situation, and after a while, when the detective has 
almost found what he was looking for, I tell him ``Listen, you 
already cost me $10,000. This is getting too expensive. We are 
going to stop there'', although I know perfectly well the detective is 
about to find out the truth. ``Besides, it is taking too long. I can  
wait no longer. I must find a way to deal with the problem''.
<P>
	If I want the detective to stop his investigation at this point, it 
may be because I realize he is about to discover that I am involved. 
That is what we are talking about here.
<P>
	It is important for the commission to use the available tools 
carefully and with restraint, so as to shed every possible light on 
the events, and to do so as efficiently as possible. We should not be 
surprised that all this takes time.
<P>
	And when a commission ends up looking for months on end at 
documents that have been tampered with and when it is inundated 
with thousands of documents that suddenly came to light, as 
happened in this case, obviously this slows down the commission's 
work. The government also tells us the procedure is too 
time-consuming and that we have to get on with the solutions 
instead of dwelling on the problems. But how can we find a 
solution to a problem that must be further defined and clarified? 
Unless of course we want to avoid shedding any light on the 
problem we want to solve.
<P>
	Did not the former Minister of National Defence promise that 
the commission would have all the time and all the resources it 
needed to get to the bottom of this issue? Since this involves 
getting to the heart of the problem, and the heart of the problem is 
the senior political and military authorities in this country, the 
government prefers to skim the surface.
<P>
	It would have been embarrassing for the Liberal government to 
admit that Mr. Anderson, appointed by this government as 
Canada's ambassador to NATO, Mr. Fowler, appointed by this 
government as Canada's ambassador to the UN, and Ms. Campbell, 
appointed by this government as consul general in Los Angeles, 
had been involved in something illegal. Rather than asking these 
VIPs, these honourable folks, to appear before the Somalia inquiry, 
they terminated the commission so as to get off the hook.
<P>
	I believe that the government's decision is motivated purely by a 
desire to gain votes. The government has asked the commission to 
wrap up its public hearings on March 31, and to table its final 
report by June 30. There are rumours of a general election in early 
June, with the 9th being mentioned. The Prime Minister has not 
consulted me, of course, but there is talk of June 9. The public 
hearings would, therefore, be over by the time the election is 
called, and the government would not be embarrassed by the report 
either, as it would be published after the election.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	If this is the case, if the government makes this kind of decision 
purely for electoral reasons, and thinks that the voters will not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7849"> 7849 </A></B>
<P>
remember the turpitude of the  government when they mark their 
ballots, well the Bloc Quebecois will be there to remind them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the situation that we have before us we have seen 
Canadians participate in Somalia. They were part of a team that 
went in to take over a state that had failed. All the infrastructures, 
political and otherwise, had gone and it was led by gangs.
<P>
	Canadians followed the call of the United Nations and the United 
States. The airborne battle group was sent to participate. It was 
stationed at Belet Huen and the situation there was out of order. It 
was under fire on many occasions. This was unlike any other 
peacekeeping group, one where live bullets were being fired on a 
regular basis. Thievery, looting and raiding of the group's lines 
were a daily action. The group was under the kinds of stresses that 
no other peacekeeping operation was under.
<P>
	As a consequence, our Canadian soldiers undertook operation 
deliverance as a humanitarian mission of unprecedented 
complexity and difficulty. The environmental conditions were the 
worst faced by Canadian personnel in war. There was 35 degree to 
40 degree weather throughout the period and our troops contended 
with sandstorms, venomous snakes, insects and the ever present 
threat of malaria and dysentery.
<P>
	Nature represented one threat. Our personnel were susceptible to 
mortar and artillery fire, small arms fire as well as stonings and 
swarmings. It was a dangerous duty.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not understand the point of my 
colleague's remarks. Is he speaking as part of questions and 
comments or is he beginning his speech?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is only five minutes. I would ask 
the hon. parliamentary secretary to make his comment or question 
and wrap it up fairly quickly please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it has been only three 
minutes.
<P>
	As part of the specific mission they secured an area of about 
30,000 kilometres, escorted humanitarian convoys, carried out 
extensive demining operations, destroyed or put under guard vast 
quantities of weapons. But their condition did not end there.
<P>
	They also did their best to improve the lives of the local 
population. Let me give a few examples. At the Medina hospital at 
Mogadishu the airborne did much the same in Belet Huen. Field 
engineers fixed machinery, soldiers helped repair the local jail, 
doctors and nurses from the battle group surgical team assisted the 
staff at  the international medical corps hospital. This is the side of 
the story that does not get told.
<P>
	They were awarded commendations by the Americans for 
executing their job in a very professional manner as the best 
operators in the field at that time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I note that the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of National Defence wanted to use this 
period to begin his speech ahead of time. I do not hold it against 
him.
<P>
	The arguments he raised are totally irrelevant to the speech I just 
made. He intimates that we do not in our speeches recognize the 
worth of the job done by the military on bases and in missions 
around the world and, particularly, in the case of the mission to 
Somalia.
<P>
	That is not the issue. This week, I heard the Minister of National 
Defence giving a member of the Reform Party a dressing down, 
saying that she lacked respect for the military because she raised 
the question.
<P>
	We are not questioning the quality of the work the military does 
here and throughout the world, but rather the quality of the work of 
this government, which is taking away the credibility of the 
Canadian military.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for Shefford, who 
is renowned for his integrity and perspicacity. If only these 
qualities were contagious, because, as you know, in light of a 
number of recent decisions, we have every right to criticize, be 
concerned and demand an explanation. That is what opposition 
days are for.
<P>
	To those joining us, I would like to point out that we, as the 
official opposition, an informed and responsible opposition, have 
decided to ask this government to explain its actions in what has 
now become the unfortunate Somalia scandal.
<P>
	Let me remind everyone of what our motion states, so as to make 
the terms of this debate perfectly clear. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That in the opinion of this House, the government should commit itself to having 
full light shed on the events occurring before, during and after the deployment of 
Canadian troops to Somalia, by extending the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry 
until December 31, 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I hope government members will rise and give us an explanation 
on this. You know full well that Privy Council legislation provides 
for the establishment of commissions of inquiry. Inherent to the 
democratic process is this mechanism whereby outsiders, often 
experts, are asked to look into a particular matter or contentious 
issues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7850"> 7850 </A></B>
<P>
	Is this something anyone from British Columbia to Quebec to 
Newfoundland can be proud of? Can this government show 
support for the unfortunate incidents that have taken place in 
Somalia?
<P>
	What is it all about? First of all, it involves people who have 
died, were killed, murdered under mysterious circumstances. As 
parliamentarians, we deal with foreign policy matters. The 
members of this House, and government members in particular, 
although there is a consensus around this, all of us, regardless of 
our affiliation, have been recognized as believing in the 
international community. Not only do we believe in the 
international community, but we believe in sending people over, 
who, through their action, presence, conviction or expertise, will be 
able to help settle conflicts quickly or before they even start.
<P>
	Will someone from the government tell us why, after it was 
decided to deploy our forces in Somalia-where, I admit, the 
situation was unclear-Canadian soldiers became involved in 
murder and people were killed in their own country? This is what 
we are talking about.
<P>
	Of course, when we raise this issue, the minister adopts a 
holier-than-thou attitude. He tries using his well known eloquence, 
but it will sound hollow in the ballot box when Canadians render 
their verdict on the attempted coverup by this government.
<P>
	What we are asking for is simple. We are not trying to discredit 
the military. We all know there are people who decided to join the 
Canadian Armed Forces because it gave a meaning to their life. 
These are honest, brilliant and studious people who made a career 
choice. We do not question that. What we question is the way 
decisions are made, the way the chain of command works. Why are 
we faced with situations such as the one we are discussing today?
<P>
	Our hope was that the government would get to the bottom of 
this issue, and we will continue to urge it to do so. It is not true that 
the inquiry was given every possible opportunity. We all know that 
the inquiry went through all kinds of tribulations, that it had trouble 
obtaining some documents.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	We all know the defence department did not offer the 
co-operation it should have provided early on to help 
commissioners get all the documents that would have allowed them 
to do their work properly.
<P>
	What is the government trying to hide? There is a long tradition 
of commissions being set up and, generally speaking, the results 
have been positive. One can think of the Laurendeau-Dunton 
commission, which helped define Quebec's needs. As a rule, 
commissions of inquiry are tools to first gain expertise and 
knowledge, and then, ideally, to lead to very specific measures. We 
could, with the material from this inquiry, if it is able to get to the 
bottom of things, restructure, review the chain of  command, 
restructure the decision making process within the Canadian 
Armed Forces.
<P>
	It is sad. It is not a memorable day in a democracy when the 
authorities, when one is an authoritarian minister as the defence 
minister is, when one chooses to use one's power to intimidate. 
When all is said and done, what has the minister decided? He has 
decided to intimidate. The inquiry and its commissioners are told: 
``You will not get to the bottom of things; you will not be given free 
rein''.
<P>
	It is true that it may call witnesses up until the month of March; 
it is true that it may table a report in the month of June, but the 
workload, all the documents that must be dealt with, the 
complexity of the subject are such that time becomes a determining 
factor in the commissioners' ability to tackle the full scope of the 
matter.
<P>
	There is nothing to be proud of in the lengths to which the 
minister is going in his refusal to be transparent, because that is 
what it boils down to. But you should have heard the Liberals on 
the campaign trail talking about transparency, ethics and integrity. 
It was one superlative after another when this government was 
telling us how determined it was to govern differently. But each 
time anything slightly controversial comes up, each time an 
explanation is called for, we find ourselves up against an aging 
government, worn down by time, whose instinct is to cover up and, 
let it be said, not just to cover up but to forget about integrity.
<P>
	There is still time because, thanks to the vigilance of the member 
for Shefford and his colleagues, we are giving an opportunity to 
this government, a government that will have to face the people in a 
while, and you know how ready we are on this side of the House.
<P>
	I see that the member for Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle is once 
again nodding his head. I hope he will vote in favour of the motion. 
We are giving the government and all members an opportunity to 
rise one after the other and put an end to this coverup operation, to 
vote for integrity, for honesty, for transparency. And if these words 
still mean something to the people on the government side, they 
will vote in favour of our motion, allowing the commissioners to 
get to the bottom of things, and they will grant the extension the 
commissioners are requesting, because that is the right thing to do, 
in light of what went on in Somalia.
<P>
	I hope that the government members will take advantage of this 
opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to my colleague, the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, with great interest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Listening is not enough, understanding is needed 
too.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7851"> 7851 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bertrand:</B> Exactly, I listened, and I understood.
<P>
	If I may, I would like to make a few comments. It is true that the 
Somalia inquiry is looking into a very complex matter, the events 
that occurred in Somalia, what happened before the troops were 
sent over, and what happened afterward, of course.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	We have always respected the inquiry's independence, and the 
government has never commented on what ought to be looked into 
by the Somalia inquiry, nor on the testimony given to it. Its 
mandate was extended until the end of June 1997, which means that 
it will have sat more than two years.
<P>
	If, for internal reasons, the commission wants to hear testimony 
which reflects the opposition's concerns, it is free to do so. We are 
anxiously awaiting the final report in order to-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Is the 
member reading his speech, asking a question or making a 
comment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bertrand:</B> It is a comment, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is a very important point for the House, 
but in our parliamentary system we do indeed have the right to read 
notes. I regret this, personally, but it is up to the hon. members to 
deal with the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bertrand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was saying that, on this side of the 
House, we are anxiously awaiting the final report of the inquiry in 
order to implement its conclusions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a model of 
ingenious spontaneity. I have every respect for the hon. member, 
and I am sure that if he looks at the Privy Council documents, 
which I would urge him to read, that he will agree the Privy 
Council admitted when the previous extensions were granted that 
the estimates of the time it would take the commission to finish its 
work had not been accurate.
<P>
	What the hon. member should consider is this. At this stage, and 
considering the importance of the subject-the hon. member must 
never forget that human lives were involved-would he not prefer 
to avoid any recurrence of this kind of situation in the future? And 
if we are to avoid a recurrence, would the hon. member agree that it 
is preferable to get to the bottom of all this and let the 
commissioners do their job?
<P>
	No one in this House has any reason to doubt the dedication of 
the commissioners, so if they need more time to do their job, I 
think the hon. member should be mindful of the point I just made, 
show some maturity and keep an open mind, emphasizing the need 
for transparency and integrity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands has about a minute and his colleague has about a minute to 
reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government was very keen to pursue the inquiry while it was 
examining things that happened under the Tory mandate, but now 
we are getting toward the post-deployment phase. Although the 
events happened in March 1993, events followed and after the 
October 1993 election when the Liberals were in power a 
substantial amount happened since then.
<P>
	Does the member see any connection between the fact that the 
inquiry was fine when it was at arm's length but now that it is 
getting closer it may be not so appropriate?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has a quick mind, 
as we all know, and of course we were making those connections. 
We see a government that will be hard pressed to defend the 
choices that were made. This takes us back to the chain of 
command. The hon. member for Verchères pointed this out in his 
comments on recent appointments and the politicians involved in 
the way in the government managed this crisis after the deployment 
in Somalia. We are very much aware of those connections.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. members, it being 1.15 p.m., it is 
my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith all questions 
necessary to dispose of the supply proceedings.
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The question is on the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House 
to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the amendment will

<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, before you call it 1.30 p.m., I think 
you will find that there is unanimous consent for the hon. member 
for Calgary Southwest to sponsor Bill C-341 instead of Motion No. 
259 on the order of precedence.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The House has heard the proposition of 
the hon. member for St. Albert. Is there unanimous consent to 
allow him to move the motion he has just made?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, could someone explain to me the 
consequences of changing the order of priority?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is up to the member for St. Albert to do 
so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Does the hon. member for St. Albert wish to clarify the matter 
for his colleague?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, the clarification is that there have 
been some resignations in the House and in order to maintain the 
order of precedence I have brought forward the request for 
unanimous consent to make the changes on the order of 
precedence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, we do not have unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Clearly, we do not have unanimous 
consent in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, before we declare it 1.30 p.m.-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No, no. Consent has not been given.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Shall we continue with the opposition day 
debate, Mr. Speaker? That is the subject of my speech.
<P>
	Before we call it 1.30 p.m., perhaps we could see whether there 
are other speakers on this question among our colleagues, before 
we go on to other things.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I fully understand what the member is 
trying to say, but, unfortunately, or fortunately, the Standing Orders 
provide that the vote must be taken at 1.15 p.m., and that is why we 
had to have it then.
<P>
	We seem to be in the doldrums. If we can declare it 1.30 p.m. 
now, we can proceed with private members' business. Otherwise, 
we are obliged to find something else to deal with for ten minutes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I have to admit I was 
not paying too much attention, but our speaker is not here and I was 
wondering if you could suspend the House for a few minutes until 
we are ready to bring our speaker forward.
<P>
	I apologize, Mr. Speaker, we have a member from the great 
province of British Columbia who is prepared to speak on the 
motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It seems we can now call it 1.30 p.m. Is it 
agreed?

in order to enhance deterrence and bring the penalties into line with 
the seriousness of the offence.

	Let me say for the record that I support the motion of the hon. 
member and I am happy to do so. I do, however, want to in my 
speech today broaden the debate around this whole issue and say as 
a starting point generally I support what works. I think the whole 
issue of drunken driving and how to solve the issue of excessive 
drinking and the problems that arise from it is a complicated one 
and there are no simple solutions.
<P>
	I support the member's concern for ensuring that penalties for 
drunken driving are proportional to the crime. I believe that 
whether penalties currently provided for in the Criminal Code are 
proportional to the offence of drunken driving is a debatable point 
and I look forward to this bill's being approved and passed on to 
committee where it can be debated more fully.
<P>
	In considering the deterrent effect of criminal laws and criminal 
penalties we have to take into account the different types of people 
who commit drinking and driving offences and how they might be 
best influenced. Not everyone has the same motivation depending 
on their age, their background and not everyone will be affected the 
same way by a change in the law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7853"> 7853 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe that people are deterred from drinking and driving by 
a host of factors. Criminal law penalties for drinking and driving 
are undoubtedly an important factor but, as I have said, not the 
only factor.
<P>
	The challenge is to find the point at which criminal penalties do 
represent a strong deterrent and the point at which they do not. If 
we stray beyond that point we risk a situation where we have little 
return in terms of increased deterrence for the effort placed into 
increasing the penalties. Such a situation would tell us that our 
efforts to decrease drinking and driving could be better located in 
other areas that would bring significantly greater deterrence.
<P>
	There seems to be at least four different kinds of people who 
commit drinking and driving crimes. I am not sure that all four 
types would response positively simply because the criminal 
penalties for drinking and driving crimes were increased from what 
they are.
<P>
	First, there are the young people who commit drinking and 
driving crimes. Some of them are not even of legal drinking age. 
For many of these, illicit drinking is a form of rebellion or an 
expression of their growing desire to be an adult or a response to 
peer pressure, or a combination of these factors and others. A 
concurrent drinking and driving crime might simply by a response 
to the same factors that precipitated the illicit drinking. With young 
people who drink and drive there may be little or no thought about 
any of the potential consequences of drinking and driving, whether 
it be death, injury, criminal consequences or licence and insurance 
consequences, even if there is the sensation that ``it won't happen 
to me''; that well known teenage sense that they are invulnerable 
may overcome good sense as it often does in other circumstances.
<P>
	Perhaps increased deterrence might be best accomplished for 
young persons through the use of peer counselling or public 
education. I think it entirely possible that increased penalties under 
the Criminal Code would be somewhat in the bottom half of the list 
of measures that would actually deter these young people who 
commit drinking and driving crimes.
<P>
	It is doubtful to me that increased criminal penalties would have 
any greater effect on the young person's decision about drinking 
and driving than the current criminal penalties have.
<P>
	A second type of person who commits drinking and driving 
crime is the otherwise responsible adult drinker who in a moment 
of bad judgment drinks too much and then makes the alcohol 
impaired decision to drive or who drinks and then takes an 
irresponsible but calculated risk to drive. I imagine that such 
calculated risks typically focuses on the likelihood of detection by 
the police, that any thought about personal safety or the safety of 
others is put out of mind and does not enter the equation.
<P>
	It seems to me that increasing the penalties for drinking and 
driving crimes would not do much to deter such persons. They are 
weighing out whether they will get caught. They are not concerned 
that the minimum penalty is at present $300 or $1,000 or that they 
might have to spend 30 days in jail as a minimum for a second 
offence rather than the present 14 days for a second offence.
<P>
	This group might be better deterred by focusing on certainty of 
detection or alternatives to driving or on messages that will help 
the individuals to think about small but unacceptable risk of death 
or injury to self or others. In other words, we might be better off 
instead of spending money on putting more people in jail, to spend 
more money on police as a deterrence to drinking and driving.
<P>
	Next, there would appear to be a group of people with unique 
problems who choose to drink and drive. These are the alcoholics 
who compound a drinking problem with driving after they drink.
<P>
	I am careful to note that there are, on the other side of the matter, 
some persons who are alcoholics who very responsibly choose not 
to drive after they drink. They find other solutions to any 
transportation needs they have after they have been drinking.
<P>
	Perhaps conquering the underlying alcoholism provides the best 
hope for alcoholics who drive after drinking. However, not all 
alcoholics are prepared to admit that they have a problem that 
requires treatment.
<P>
	Certainly it seems important to encourage alternatives to driving 
after drinking, given that many alcoholics are not prepared to admit 
to a problem or to submit to treatment.
<P>
	It should disturb all of us that if we are going to be sending more 
people to jail we need also to put in more resources within the jails 
so that they can bring in alcohol problems or drug abuse problems 
so that at the end of the day we find something that actually does 
work and helps solve the problem.
<P>
	There is a fourth group of persons who commit drinking and 
driving crimes. These are the people who simply do not care what 
happens to themselves or to others as a result of their behaviour. If 
they want to drink, they do and if they want to drive, they will. If 
somebody gets killed or injured along the way, that is just the way 
it goes.
<P>
	Increasing the penalties for Criminal Code drinking and driving 
offences would have no impact on this small but very frightening 
group. Ultimately the decision about drinking and driving rests 
with individuals of all types and minds.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7854"> 7854 </A></B>
<P>
	For those of us who do not drink and drive, the solution seems 
simple. If you drink, do not drive. If you cannot stay where you 
are, have someone drive you. If you cannot walk or take a taxi, 
then do not drink.
<P>
	While to you and me the risk, however remote, of having a tragic 
accident and killing someone if we were to drink and drive is likely 
to be a great deterrent, there are those who are simply not deterred 
by this thought, nor are they deterred by the criminal law 
consequences, whether they be present penalties or increased 
penalties.
<P>
	For these reasons, rather than boosting criminal penalties, I 
would prefer to see further development of drinking and driving 
counter measures that aim to change attitudes to the point where 
driving and drinking become completely unacceptable in all 
circumstances, not only in those circumstances where death or 
injury occurs.
<P>
	This would necessarily involve finding ways to help people keep 
their drinking separate from any driving. Efforts would have to be 
specific to the characteristics of the different groups that I have 
broadly set out so that there would be the greatest effect for the 
work that is done.
<P>
	More important, individuals would have to begin taking 
responsibilities for what they do and say in their homes and 
schools, offices and communities to prevent drinking and driving.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that criminal law penalties have no deterrent 
value; quite the contrary. We all know that they are. They are and 
our present penalties already hold significant deterrent value.
<P>
	However, it is far more effective to combine criminal penalties 
with a range of other attempts to combat drinking and driving. 
Training for service personnel in bars and the use of designated 
non-drinking drivers are examples of efforts that help prevent 
drinking and driving.
<P>
	Public education that raises the issue and helps young people to 
think of the consequences and to make the decision not to drive 
after drinking before they find themselves at a party is another 
example.
<P>
	Families can encourage all family members to call for a ride 
with no questions asked should they ever drink and not have a 
method of transportation available. Similarly, families can 
encourage their members to call for help rather than accept a ride 
from a drinking driver.
<P>
	In short, we have to make it socially unacceptable to drink and 
drive. We are now getting there. No doubt there are people who 
obey the law if only because it is the law. For others, the risk of 
death or of killing someone else is a far greater deterrent than the 
increased penalty that might be imposed under the criminal law in 
the event that they were detected and convicted.
<P>
	It is clear that the largest percentage of victims among persons 
killed by drinking drivers are the drinking drivers themselves and 
their passengers, rather than the other people in vehicles or on foot.
<P>
	Rather than looking at someone who tries to keep someone else 
from driving after drinking as a killjoy or a busybody, we need to 
reach the point where intervening is the socially responsible thing 
to do.
<P>
	Criminal law can be asked to do its part to reduce drinking and 
driving. In my view it already does. Whether it could do more is a 
debatable point but we should not rely solely on the criminal law 
and we should allow other systems and other players to play a role 
in order to end the tragic waste brought about through drinking and 
driving.
<P>
	It is a trap to think that only increased penalties under the 
criminal law can make a difference.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the motion. It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should consider strengthening 
penalties in those sections of the Criminal Code which deal with impaired driving 
offences in order to: (<I>a</I>) enhance deterrence; and (<I>b</I>) bring the penalties into line with 
the seriousness of the offence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	At first glance we think that it is unacceptable for people to drive 
while drunk, and they should be very severely penalized. This is the 
kind of motion which demands that we look at the current situation 
and ponder whether the proposed solution is adequate.
<P>
	After having consulted with the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm, our justice critic, and a number of experts on 
the subject, we have come to realize that the current penalties are 
quite significant and that the solution to this problem lies in more 
education.
<P>
	What we need is more adds, more visits to schools and social 
clubs, we need to enlist the help of police officers who go into the 
schools and people who have speaking engagements with social 
clubs. This is the way to change behaviour, not by sentencing 
people to a couple more years under the Criminal code. The 
Criminal Code has already been strengthened and to further do it 
will not necessarily solve the problem.
<P>
	I would like to tell you about Operation Nez rouge, an initiative 
which has been more productive than the punitive approach. It 
originated in Quebec and is now in operation across Canada. It 
came into being at Laval University, in Quebec City, as a fund 
raiser for the swim team. It has been growing since and has been 
extended to several provinces.
<P>
	During the holidays, people tend to celebrate a lot and drink too 
much; they can call ``Nez rouge'' to have somebody drive them 
home. As a result the number of  accidents has fallen sharply. This 
is the kind of behaviour we want to promote. While providing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7855"> 7855 </A></B>
<P>
transportation, we educate people. Over the years, they are getting 
the message. Solutions for the future lie in this kind of initiatives.
<P>
	I will make another point, which might have some relevance for 
Reform members: in some provinces, deterrents are combined with 
provisions under the Criminal Code. In Quebec, each time a person 
is sentenced to a six month suspension of their driver's licence, the 
agency responsible for the driver's licence system automatically 
doubles the suspension, which goes up to a year. There already is a 
deterrent. We have taken measures in this regard. Drivers are aware 
of these regulations. The deterrent effect of losing one's licence is 
doubled.
<P>
	For repeat offenders, the penalty is stiffer. When someone is 
caught a second time, the penalty is much stiffer. Instead of, say, a 
six month suspension, the licence is suspended for a year or two; so 
there is definitely an additional penalty. A second suspension 
almost automatically means that the person will not be allowed to 
drive for a very long time.
<P>
	These are measures that already exist. They are in place and they 
are effective. Adding to or strengthening the penalties set out in the 
Criminal Code as proposed in the motion will not give better 
results. The law already acts as a deterrent.
<P>
	The kind of behaviour that leads a person to drive while he or she 
is impaired and should not be driving requires preventive action. 
People have to make it a habit not to let a relative or a friend leave 
with the car when he or she is not fit to drive. Strengthening 
penalties in the Criminal Code by two or three years will not keep 
someone who has had one drink too many from driving. It is a habit 
that has to be acquired.
<P>
	I would like to draw your attention to the second part of the 
motion, which says that penalties should be brought into line with 
the seriousness of the offence. We think that penalties already are 
in line with the seriousness of the offence. The impaired driver who 
has not caused any damage will not receive the same sentence as 
the one who has caused physical injury or any other kind of 
damage.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	This judicial discretion granted to the judges is, in fact, being 
used adequately and it does send a message to the accused. Judges 
can take it into consideration. I think judges should be able to 
continue to pass sentences according to the directions they are 
given, and to use their discretion to determine how serious the 
offence and the impacts are and to bring the penalties in line.
<P>
	We are also against this motion, because it implies that there are 
currently no deterrent provisions in the Criminal Code, as if there is 
a free for all, as if drunken  drivers face no or minimal penalties, 
which is not true, because we do have deterrent provisions.
<P>
	The motion implies that there is an inequity in the sentences 
handed out, but when we look at those sentences, we find no 
evidence of such a thing in the court decisions. Of course, if we go 
for sensationalism, if we read reports in the Saturday or Sunday 
newspapers about terrible accidents and horrible situations, it may 
make us lean toward the motion before us. However, we have to 
look more closely at these kinds of situations. We have to get a true 
picture of what is going on. We also have to determine who is 
responsible in that area of jurisdiction. For instance, are the 
provinces taking their responsibilities? Are the measures suggested 
here not similar to what Quebec is already doing, which is doubling 
the penalties for anyone who loses his or her driving licence 
following a Criminal Code offence?
<P>
	For all these reasons, we think that the authorities are already 
taking their responsibilities properly. We think that the measure 
suggested in this motion would not help to sufficiently change 
drivers' attitudes within two, three, four, five or even ten years. The 
number of people who drink and drive will not decrease because 
the penalties are be more severe. We already have very severe 
penalties.
<P>
	In conclusion, we think more ought to be done in terms of 
education and the provinces, the not for profit organizations 
dealing with such issues, and the people fighting alcoholism ought 
to be given the means to do their jobs. Let us give them funds to 
enable them to intervene in their sector of activity. Then we will 
really be serving society.
<P>
	The punishment underlying the motion before us will not resolve 
anything, except to send the message, in an approach I would call 
superficial and election oriented, that we can resolve the sort of 
problem we run into with this sort of solution. It seems to me to be 
a bit like the case of the adolescent who gets his knuckles rapped 
instead of an explanation of why his behaviour is unacceptable. 
The second or third time his knuckles are rapped, he does not even 
remember any more whether it hurts. However, if time were spent 
educating him so he understood what was going on, most times his 
behaviour could be changed to something more socially 
acceptable. I think this is more the way of the future.
<P>
	I hope the House rejects this motion and that, if the situation is 
ever debated again, it is with a view to understanding how the 
problem can really be solved, because we see here an attitude 
similar to the attitude of the Reform Party in many other instances. 
The way to resolve things is to come down hard on people's 
knuckles, and yet the problems require a much more subtle 
approach.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7856"> 7856 </A></B>
<P>
	I think the members tabling such motions should go into each 
community and see how things work. Let them look at the results. 
Let them ask what the numbers are so  that, based on the 
consequences that are known, we can take appropriate measures 
and not simply go for sensationalism.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak today on the 
motion of my hon. colleague from Prince George-Bulkley Valley. 
The motion to get it clear is not overreacting; it is simply a motion 
which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should consider strengthening 
penalties in those sections of the Criminal Code which deal with impaired driving 
offences in order to: (a) enhance deterrence; and (b) bring the penalties into line with 
the seriousness of the offence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	I have four adult boys. They are normal young men who are 
enjoying life to its fullest. Every night when they leave the house I 
worry that they will become a statistic because somebody else is 
out there drinking and driving. I share that worry with most parents 
across this country.
<P>
	I have had the unfortunate circumstance of talking to parents 
who have been in the position of having lost children to an 
impaired driver. One of my board members is a father whose son 
and grandchildren were quickly killed by an impaired driver in 
Prince George, B.C.
<P>
	A father encouraged me to get involved in a campaign he is 
starting up to go across Canada with the message that drinking and 
driving kills. He lost his young 23-year old son who was just 
beginning life, full of opportunities. Early one evening an impaired 
driver went through a stop sign, ran into his vehicle and killed him 
instantly.
<P>
	That driver had had numerous impaired driving charges, had had 
his licence suspended and had been brought to the attention of the 
police twice that very same day, once for sideswiping parked cars 
while impaired and once for running red lights in the community 
while impaired. Was he taken off the streets, put away for the day, 
incarcerated or whatever because he had had impaired driving 
charges months before that? No, he was left on the street to 
continue to drive while impaired and in the evening he killed a 
young man who had had his whole life ahead of him.
<P>
	People who drink and drive lack responsibility. They have 
choices. They can make a decision. They know there are penalties 
out there. They know their licences can be suspended but that does 
not seem to send a very strong message to them. They do not seem 
to consider the seriousness of what it is they are doing. I share the 
concerns of my hon. colleagues.
<P>
	I will admit I had some problems with the private member's bill 
which said that if impaired driving caused death it should 
automatically be a seven year minimum  sentence. If it was a first 
time occurrence, I thought that seemed a little bit harsh.
<P>
	Since being elected to this place and in the true fashion of 
Reform, I put the issues to my constituents. Therefore I shared with 
them my concern that it might be a little harsh for a first time 
offender and asked what they thought about it. There were 3,685 
constituents who responded to my questionnaire. The question was: 
Should anyone convicted of impaired driving causing death be 
sentenced to a minimum of seven years incarceration?
<P>
	They answered the question knowing I was a little 
uncomfortable with it if it was a first offence. In response, 2,463 or 
66.84 per cent said yes, they felt that there should be a seven year 
minimum charge. There were 1,082 or 29.36 per cent who said no. 
They shared my concern that in some circumstances it might be 
overreacting to it.
<P>
	I have to believe that those people out there who dealt with the 
issue looked at it from their own circumstances and recognized that 
suspended sentences are not reducing people's use of alcohol and 
driving. A few months of incarceration is not stopping people from 
drinking and driving.
<P>
	I will not argue with the Bloc and the Liberal members who say 
education is important. One thing that impresses me more than 
anything else is that because of the education on impaired driving 
and that driving and drinking can kill, young people today are far 
more responsible than people our age.
<P>
	Young people today when planning an evening out in most cases 
will have a designated driver along with them. Young people today 
are more willing and more likely to leave their cars at home and 
take cabs or public transit. They are far more aware that drinking 
and driving might kill. However, that does not protect those young 
people from those among us in society who drink to extreme and 
then get behind the wheel, thus turning their vehicles into 
dangerous weapons.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Today of all days, when an individual tried to drive a vehicle into 
the House of Commons shows us that vehicles can be and are a 
dangerous implement. When that vehicle is put into the hands of 
somebody who has had too much to drink or is impaired because of 
other substance abuse, it is an extremely dangerous weapon on our 
streets.
<P>
	Some of the crime statistics are quite frightening. People know 
there is a law against drinking and driving. We all know that those 
convicted of crimes while under the influence of alcohol are given 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7857"> 7857 </A></B>
<P>
lenient sentences. Most of the support material in the Criminal 
Code are cases of impaired driving. Most of the Criminal Code 
book is a history of cases of impaired driving which have gone 
through the courts.
<P>
	The Mothers against Drunk Driving have an ongoing campaign 
to bring forward things at which we should be looking, and the 
changes that should be made to legislation but they have not been 
very successful in convincing the government.
<P>
	Some of the stats, as I mentioned, are quite frightening. I am 
going to use the stats from 1994 because those are the ones that I 
have at my disposal. There were 1,414 people killed in Canada as a 
result of impaired driving. When that figures is broken down it 
shows that 3.8 people each and every day are killed as a result of 
impaired driving. In Canada 311 people are injured each day by 
impaired drivers. The Ontario Medical Association estimates that it 
costs Ontario $100 million per year to treat impaired driving 
injuries. Another frightening statistic is that one out of five drivers 
every night are impaired.
<P>
	Education is fine but people do ignore the message that is being 
put out loud and clear through MADD, the Mothers Against Drunk 
Drivers program, court programs for anyone who has had 
successive impaired driving charges; Alcoholics Anonymous 
programs and throughout out the schools systems. Do they help? I 
would suggest that from the statistics before us that people are 
ignoring the information. To consider it a social disease which is 
not recognized as being a criminal is naive. It is not only naive but 
it is a refusal to look at what is happening and to try and do 
something about it. It is naive to think that education is going to 
stop that kind of behaviour.
<P>
	I come from a family which unfortunately has been touched by 
alcoholism. My father spent many years bringing treatment 
programs into the province of Alberta and is recognized for having 
done so. I believe that we have to consider alcoholism as a disease 
and treat it as such. But that does not stop us from saying that it is a 
criminal activity to drink and drive. We must do all that is in our 
power to see that is stopped.
<P>
	I do not want to join the ranks of other parents who lose a child 
because of someone who drank too much, got behind the wheel of a 
vehicle, a very dangerous weapon under those circumstances and I 
would be left to mourn for the rest of my life.
<P>
	I am in a position where I can try and do something about it. I do 
not think it is too much to ask this government to look at the 
Criminal Code and at changes that can be made to that federal 
legislation to send a strong message to people who will make the 
decision to drink and get behind the wheel of a vehicle and drive. It 
is not too strong a message to tighten up the Criminal Code and 
make the offences a whole lot stronger to get the killers off the 
streets.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to commend my colleague from Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley for demonstrating his leadership on this 
very serious issue.
<P>
	As my colleagues who have spoken before me have mentioned, 
there is an epidemic taking place today, despite all the programs the 
police have established to catch drunk drivers.
<P>
	The problems are many and it is worthwhile to establish what the 
problems are and the impact which these problems have within 
Canada today.
<P>
	The cost to Canadian society of drunk driving is enormous. In 
1994, 87,838 people were charged with impaired driving and l,414 
people were killed. That is three times higher than the murder rate.
<P>
	The government has made an enormous effort to implement laws 
and regulations to deal with gun registration. Those initiatives will 
have no effect whatsoever on decreasing the murder rate in Canada.
<P>
	There is an epidemic within our midst that is causing three times 
as many deaths as homicides and the government has done nothing 
to address it. However, the government has an excellent 
opportunity. It could employ some of the ideas which are contained 
in Motion No. 78 to address the epidemic.
<P>
	The cost is massive: almost $400,000 per fatal accident; 
$310,000 per fatality; $12,000 per injury. That is only the tip of the 
iceberg.
<P>
	In my dealings with drunk drivers, both in the emergency 
departments of hospitals and in jails, I have noticed a couple of 
things. First, in a jail I was dealing with an individual who had been 
charged and convicted over 22 times with drunk driving offences. 
The individual laughed when talking about it and felt that it was a 
joke. The penalty is not a deterrent in its current form.
<P>
	The second problem that exists is that it is extraordinarily 
difficult for the police to actually convict someone who has been 
drinking and driving. Currently it takes a police officer about six 
hours to do all the paperwork required to prosecute an individual 
for drunk driving. That is why when an individual is pulled over 
who is over the limit, a police officer would rather suspend the 
person's licence for 24 hours and send him or her home than 
actually go through the process of prosecuting. People who 
habitually abuse the system, who drink and drive, know that. They 
know that if they drink and drive, although the penalties are 
supposedly quite high, the actual penalties are quite low.
<P>
	We must do a number of things. We must enable police officers 
to prosecute individuals who drink and drive in an expeditious 
manner.
<P>
	An intelligent trial lawyer can get most people who are charged 
with drinking and driving off very easily through a number of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7858"> 7858 </A></B>
<P>
loopholes in the system. It extends right from the moment that the 
blood test is taken to the trial.
<P>
	I cannot emphasize how important it is for the government to 
take initiatives to streamline the process and give our police 
officers a hand in deterring this epidemic. They must be able to 
send a clear message to people who are considering getting behind 
the wheel when drunk that it is not acceptable and if they are caught 
they will be prosecuted and levelled with a penalty which will be 
more than a slap on the wrist.
<P>
	My colleague from Prince George-Bulkley Valley has put 
forward this motion to enable the House to put forward some very 
stringent penalties to deal with this epidemic. This is not something 
that is benign. The statistics prove the rate is very high. It is very 
costly to society.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	It is incumbent upon us in this House to take the leadership role 
once again and demonstrate to the Canadian public that we are 
interested in their safety and we are going to put forward some 
intelligent ideas to address this problem. It also involves intelligent 
ways of dealing with the issue.
<P>
	As my colleague before me just mentioned, alcoholism is a 
disease and it must be treated as such. That is why as part and 
parcel of the conviction for drunk driving, individuals who have 
committed this offence must have drug and alcohol abuse treatment 
as an obligatory part of their sentences. Merely sentencing them 
and sending them back on the street will do absolutely nothing to 
prevent this situation from occurring again. Drug and alcohol abuse 
is a complex situation and it must be addressed through 
counselling. Although counselling and treatment are not absolute 
solutions, we desperately need them.
<P>
	One of the big problems in our penal institutions is that not 
enough emphasis is placed on the drug and alcohol abuse of those 
who are incarcerated in our penal institutions. A greater emphasis 
must be put on dealing with the drug and alcohol problems of these 
individuals instead of merely incarcerating them. Regardless of the 
reasons they were originally charged and convicted, it is important 
to make sure we break the cycle of crime, punishment and 
recidivism which tends to occur not infrequently in people who 
commit a wide range of criminal offences, be it drunk driving, 
murder, robbery, assault causing bodily harm and so on.
<P>
	I once again commend my colleagues, especially my colleague 
from Prince George-Bulkley Valley for putting forward this 
motion which tries to address the epidemic of drunk drivers. I 
implore the government to take heed of his initiatives and to 
employ them.
<P>
	I hope the government takes a leadership role with its provincial 
counterparts, the attorneys general from across the provinces. It 
could work with them to establish an effective way of preventing 
this problem through obligatory treatment for alcohol and drug 
abuse. It could impose significant penalties for those who choose to 
drink and drive and who get caught, also for those who drink and 
drive and commit offences in terms of the injuries that occur to 
defenceless and innocent civilians.
<P>
	Getting behind the wheel of a car when you are drunk is akin to 
picking up a gun and shooting somebody. That car is a potential 
weapon. It is a lethal weapon that has been used with undue and 
tragic frequency within this country.
<P>
	People often do not realize that there is sometimes a great deal of 
callousness and utter disregard for the pain and suffering of victims 
by some drivers when they get behind the wheel drunk and injure or 
kill somebody. I remember a tragic case in which a drunk 
individual killed a young man who was driving another car. Both 
the drunk fellow and his buddy were injured. He was conscious but 
his buddy was not. He grabbed his buddy, dragged him into the 
driver's seat and put himself in the passenger's seat. He was totally 
uncooperative with the police and he lied repeatedly throughout the 
process. He did everything he could to get off. There was no regard 
whatsoever for the young man I had to treat three bays down who 
had a massive head injury and was dying.
<P>
	I implore the government to take heed of my colleague's 
initiatives which are constructive, worthwhile, productive and for 
the betterment and the health of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Motion No. M-78 introduced by my colleague 
from Prince George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
	Motion No. M-78 asks that the government consider 
strengthening penalties in those sections in the Criminal Code 
which deal with impaired driving offences in order to enhance 
deterrence and bring the penalties into line with the seriousness of 
the offence.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	When we look at the facts they simply tell us that the problem is 
not being addressed or resolved. Drinking and driving is the largest 
single criminal cause of death and injury in Canada. I am going to 
repeat that because of the seriousness. Drinking and driving is the 
largest single criminal cause of death and injury in Canada.
<P>
	The death rate from impaired driving is three to four times the 
national murder rate. To put this into perspective, in 1992 there 
were 732 homicides in Canada. During that same time there were 
2,500 deaths resulting from impaired driving.
<P>
	Clearly we have a problem and clearly we are not addressing that 
problem. It is in perceptions, I would suggest, that people seem to 
think that if they cause  death or injury using a tonne of metal and 
plastic they are not capable of driving, that somehow it is okay, it is 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7859"> 7859 </A></B>
<P>
not really their fault. I would suggest that it is their fault and that 
our law enforcement system and our court system in many ways are 
set up to shield these people. Again, it is goes back to what about 
the victim in these cases.
<P>
	I would like to go through a number of facts to bring things into 
perspective. In 1994 alcohol was involved in 47 per cent of motor 
vehicle fatalities in Ontario and almost half of the traffic fatalities 
in British Columbia. In Ontario of the 176 pedestrians killed in 
1994, 57 per cent involved the use of alcohol by either the victim or 
the driver of the vehicle.
<P>
	We often forget to think about the passengers. We think about 
someone else being in another vehicle, but in the case of passengers 
in the vehicle with the impaired driver 25 per cent of fatalities are 
passengers.
<P>
	Another terrible figure is 88 per cent of all persons killed in 
marine vehicle accidents involved alcohol. We tend to think of 
driving simply motor vehicles on the road. What about boats? In 
my province of British Columbia the police have cracked down, 
and rightfully so, on drinking while operating a boat because it has 
been terrible. People tend to say they do not want to drink and drive 
on the road but as soon as they get into their boat on the lake they 
think having a beer or many beers is okay. It is not okay because 
they are still driving a vehicle, and 88 per cent of all persons killed 
in marine accidents involved alcohol. That is a terrible statistic. 
How many more people have to die before something is done?
<P>
	Clearly my colleague has addressed the situation. He said that 
we have a problem. All Canadians, every member of this House 
and all parties should say yes to this motion.
<P>
	In 1995 Justice Peter Cory of the Supreme Court of Canada 
remarked: ``Every year drunk driving leaves a terrible trail of 
death, injury, heartbreak and destruction. In terms of deaths and 
serious injury resulting in hospitalization, drunk driving is clearly 
the crime which causes the most significant social loss in this 
country''.
<P>
	Sixty-five per cent of all suspensions issued for impaired driving 
were issued for a second offence. What does this second offence 
tell us? Why in the world should we have to speak to the second 
offence or subsequent offences in drunk driving? There should not 
be a second offence.
<P>
	The reason I say that is I was in Sweden a number of years ago. 
The Swedes enjoy having a drink and going out to have a good 
time. However, they would not dream of drinking and driving. 
Why? The penalties are there. I believe it was five years automatic 
at that time. The second time they are gone, no licence.
<P>
	This is the type of penalty that we require. We have to get the 
attention of the drinking driver. That clearly has not happened.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	An analogy was photo radar where part of the problem was 
political will. Let us remember the last election in Ontario and the 
antics the electorate went through about photo radar. I would 
suggest that the attitude on drinking and driving is similar. The 
public said it did not want photo radar. Speeding cars were killing 
people but the political pressure was enough for the Ontario 
government to pull out its photo radar. In fact, Ontario sold it to my 
province of British Columbia where it is being used and speeding 
has decreased.
<P>
	I use that analogy because I believe it is the same mindset we are 
seeing with drunk driving: ``While it is a problem, politically we do 
not think we should address it. Perhaps the next administration or 
the provincial government or someone else will deal with it''. That 
simply is not happening.
<P>
	What have we set up? We have set up a system where a good 
lawyer, as my colleague says, can get most people off. The court 
system is clogged. Most of the cases in court now deal with 
impaired driving and the penalties are simply not there. It is a 
mindset and an attitude that goes through our whole system. 
Clearly a wake-up call is required.
<P>
	I hope my colleagues on all sides of the House will clearly 
consider this motion and pass it when it is voted on. Although it is a 
motion and not a bill, it will send a clear message to all 
governments to deal with this problem in a significant way and put 
deterrents and educational programs in place so that the deaths on 
our highways are put to an end.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this private member's motion my colleague 
from Prince George has put in. I applaud him for having done so in 
order to address this very serious problem of driving while 
intoxicated and drinking while driving.
<P>
	I appreciate the support that has come from the other side of the 
House, the Liberal speaker, who addressed this. It is good to see 
that most people are behind this type of action being taken against 
individuals who choose to get behind this killing machine after 
they have been drinking.
<P>
	The one thing I would like to point out in this moment that I have 
is the deterrent factor. A lot of times when we talk about bringing in 
harsh or stronger punishment for various offences that have been 
committed, people believe it is not the thing to do because it will 
not deter. I know that argument is holding true on capital 
punishment, for example. The argument against capital 
punishment, most of the time, is simply that it does not deter crime.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7860"> 7860 </A></B>
<P>
	However, regardless of whether it does or does not deter crime, 
when the kind of punishment that this particular motion is calling 
for with regard to drinking and driving is put in, maybe a deterrent 
is not exactly the real message. Maybe the message should be that 
our system is failing in a great way in getting the punishment to 
fit the crime.
<P>
	Let me give a couple of examples. We have individuals who are 
on trial or have been on trial and have been convicted of a certain 
type of crime, such as second degree murder in the case of Mr. 
Latimer out of Saskatchewan, and we have another individual who 
goes to trial who has originally been charged with first degree 
murder for viciously strangling his wife. I guess they proved that 
there was not any intent. They lowered the crime to manslaughter, 
which is a lesser crime than second degree murder. One must 
wonder about these two kinds of cases.
<P>
	It is not that they are trying to deter an individual regardless of 
what they do. Does the punishment meet the crime? That is very 
important throughout our judicial system.
<P>
	Probably the most obvious action taking place recently 
indicating that our justice system is designed to do other things is 
individuals such as Andy McMechan, who sold his own property 
across the border illegally, without a wheat board permit and was 
thrown into jail in handcuffs, taken to court in leg irons where he 
remained in jail for a fairly lengthy time.
<P>
	The man did not steal anything. He did not assault anybody. He 
broke the law. No one is denying that. He simply did not get a 
wheat board permit to do what he did. Yet he is treated in this harsh 
manner, in this hard way while at the same time individuals who go 
into other people's homes on invasions and destroy the property, 
who steal or who assault, even sexually assault or rape someone, 
are loose and walking the streets.
<P>
	What in the world is going on? When does the punishment fit the 
crime? This bill is designed to do just that.
<P>
	I appreciate what the Liberal member said. It is not a matter of 
why teenagers drink, why alcoholics end up behind the wheel when
<P>
they are drinking. None of that is really important. The important 
part of this whole thing is that a message has to be sent to any 
individual, regardless of the circumstances, that if they drink and 
get behind the wheel, the penalty will be severe. Not that it deters 
anyone. I will not argue that. However, the penalty will be severe. 
It is not an acceptable thing to do in Canada. We are going to 
develop a lower tolerance level for this dangerous activity.
<P>
	That is the message that needs to be sent. I hope all members 
would wisely support this unanimously and get it under way.
<P>
