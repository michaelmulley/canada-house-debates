</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (for the Minister of Justice and Attorney

and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to be able to lead off the debate on the third 
reading of Bill C-12, an act to amend the Judges Act and to amend 
another act in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would make certain amendments to the Judges Act that 
would ensure appropriate and fair compensation for the federally 
appointed judiciary in Canada.  It is intended to implement the 
commitments made by the government in its response to the report 
of the 1999 Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize that the chair of the Judicial 
Compensation and Benefits Commission, Mr. Richard Drouin, who 
appeared as a witness before the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights, expressed his satisfaction 
with the government's decision to implement most of the 
recommendations enumerated in the commission's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strength of Canada's judiciary is a key factor in our 
prosperity and health as a nation.  As the guardians of the 
constitutional right of Canadians to have peace, order and good 
government, judges form an important pillar in our democratic 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An independent judiciary is essential to the rule of law. Judges 
must be free from undue influence of any kind, be it from those 
with money or power.  There is a growing recognition that 
stability, human security and the rule of law are necessary 
preconditions to economic growth, and there is a growing 
appreciation that an independent judiciary with the proper 
resources is the first step down this path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to the principle of 
judicial independence, as it is a fundamental precondition to 
ensuring the vitality of the rule of law in our democratic system 
of government.  The three constitutionally required elements of 
judicial independence are security of tenure, independence of 
administration of matters relating to the judicial function, and 
financial security.  It is in direct support of the principle of 
judicial independence that section 100 of the constitution has 
conferred on parliament the important task of establishing 
financial security of a federally appointed judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to report that during the second reading debate 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Progressive Conservative Party 
indicated their support for Bill C-12.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Bar Association has also expressed its support for 
Bill C-12.  In fact, in its written submissions to the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, the 
Canadian Bar Association expressed the view that Bill C-12 not 
only enhances judicial independence in promoting financial 
security for members of the judiciary but also helps to attract 
high quality candidates to the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask all members of the House for their support.  This 
bill would ensure that our judges are compensated fairly and 
appropriately in order to maintain the quality and independence 
of Canada's judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make reference to the hon. member for 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, who has proposed an 
amendment for Bill C-12.  His proposed amendment to Bill C-12 
would require that the transcripts of testimony heard before the 
Supreme Court of Canada be made more accessible to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, the proposed amendment, an addition to 
section 75 of the Judges Act, would require the Registrar of the 
Supreme Court of Canada to ensure that testimony heard before the 
court in open session be recorded in electronic format and made 
accessible to the public in the same manner as the <I>Debates</I> 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the greatest of respect for the member, we cannot accept 
this proposed amendment as it is not within the scope of Bill 
C-12, nor is the Judges Act the appropriate place for such an 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any matter relating to procedure before the Supreme Court of 
Canada would fall under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of 
Canada Act.  Section 75 of the Judges Act applies solely to 
administrative matters relating to the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, as members know, Bill C-12 would make amendments to the 
Judges Act that would ensure appropriate and fair compensation 
for the federally appointed judiciary.  It is intended to 
implement the commitments made by the government in its response 
to the report of the 1999 Judicial Compensation and Benefits 
Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. members of the House for their attention today 
and ask for their support in the passage of Bill C-12. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before commencing I would ask for the unanimous consent 
of the House to split my time with the member for Surrey Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to allow the hon. 
member to share his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the bill amends the Judges 
Act to implement the government's response to the recommendations 
made by the 1999 Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission. 
Among those recommendations is a retroactive salary increase of 
11.2% for approximately 1,013 federally appointed judges.  This 
would cost the federal government approximately $19 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase is retroactive to April 1, 2000, and would raise 
the base salary from $179,200 to $198,000 for judges who sit on 
appeal courts and superior courts in each province.  The salaries 
for the chief justices in those courts would increase to $217,000 
from $196,500.  These same increases would also apply to federal 
court judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judges on the Supreme Court of Canada would remain the 
highest paid.  The eight regular judges would see an increase to 
$235,700 from $213,000, while the salary of the chief justice 
would rise to $254,000 from $230,200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the fourth time the government has sought to amend the 
Judges Act.  During the 35th parliament the government introduced 
Bill C-2 and Bill C-42, and during the 36th parliament, Bill 
C-37, all of which were relatively minor pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1998, Bill C-37 was introduced to establish the 
Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission.  Bill C-37 also 
increased judges' salaries retroactively, providing an 8.3% pay 
increase over two years.  This meant an average $13,000 pay 
increase for federal judges, with salaries increasing from 
$159,000 to over $172,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be hard pressed to think of any other public servant, or 
any hard-working Canadian for that matter, who received that kind 
of pay increase in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada, the consumer price index from 
1996 to 1998 rose 2.55%.  It is safe to assume that the salaries 
of most Canadians across the country would be affected by that 
statistic.  Not only have the salaries of judges increased at a 
rate substantially higher than those of most Canadians, but their 
salaries are already indexed.  I think that is important to 
remember.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No other senior public servant or any other lower level public 
employee has been given such a significant pay increase in the 
last number of years.  While the government indicates that the 
raise is a reasonable one, it is interesting to note that senior 
public servants have received raises of no more than 5.7%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only public servants and other public employees who do 
not receive these types of extensive benefits.  The very people 
who administer our justice system, the people on the ground who 
do the practical work in looking after the safety and security of 
Canadians first hand, seem to be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in 1998, the same year that federal judges were 
given these generous salary increases, RCMP officers who had 
their salaries and wages frozen for five years were finally 
granted an increase of a mere 2% in March 1998, retroactive to 
January.  If the concern is that judges receive these raises to 
ensure that there is no corruption of our justice system or any 
undue influence, is the same not true for the men and women who 
serve in our federal police forces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second pay increase was given to RCMP officers in April 1998 
and later that year they received another small increase. 
However, over the five years that their salaries were frozen and 
in the next year, 1998, the RCMP received an increase of only 
3.75%.  These frontline officers are putting their lives on the 
line every day for Canadians, but the average three year 
constable received an increase of less than $2,000 over those 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, the bill would provide an 11.2% increase to judges 
who are making well over $120,000 or $130,000 a year, some over 
$200,000 a year.  There are so many other people within our 
justice system who are absolutely vital in ensuring that the 
system is functioning properly but are not getting the same kind 
of increase.  These are often the same men and women who are 
forced to cope with the results of several years of cutbacks to 
the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would assume that if money can be found to increase the 
salaries of judges, then money could also be found to give local 
police and RCMP the resources they need to do their jobs 
effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, in many provinces crown attorneys do not have sufficient 
resources to prosecute the cases they are charged with.  In this 
context I am especially thinking of the new legislation the 
government is bringing forward in respect of organized crime. 
While I support many of the principles, I wonder about the 
genuine attitude of the government in failing to provide 
adequately for the resources for frontline officers and frontline 
prosecutors to get the job done.  There is no question that in 
the Canadian justice system there is a significant amount of 
delay and backlog, which needs to be remedied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another appalling situation in our country is the embarrassingly 
low wages paid to members of our armed forces.  It is ridiculous 
that people who protect our nation, both at home and abroad, and 
put their lives at risk to ensure some measure of security for 
all Canadian citizens are fighting with antiquated equipment and 
are often forced to go to food banks to make ends meet.  Now we 
hear that the minister is authorizing a raise in the rents that 
our armed forces have to pay.  I do not think that is acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand from the government that the main rationale for 
this pay increase for judges is that the federal government must 
compete with high paying law firms to attract superior candidates 
to the bench.  While I believe that a competitive salary is 
required to ensure good candidates, I do not believe that there 
has ever been any great shortage of candidates for the bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such cities as Toronto and Vancouver, where a $200,000 plus 
yearly income for a lawyer may not be unusual, it is not outside 
the realm of possibility that such people may not be attracted to 
the bench for fear of a pay cut.  However, in Manitoba, for 
example, I believe there would be no shortage of competent 
lawyers available for judicial appointments at $190,000 and, 
indeed, at perhaps even less considering the compensation 
packages and extra benefits that come with such appointments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps that is a problem of the mandate of the commission and 
of the restrictions it had.  Perhaps those regional differences 
should be reflected in salaries or expenses.  The commission was 
operating at a bit of a disadvantage.  It did not have the 
appropriate mandate to discuss those kinds of significant 
differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians in the legal profession, no matter what their 
salary, would consider it a great honour to be appointed to a 
judgeship at any level.  Over the past decade there have been an 
average of eight candidates for every opening on the bench.  As I 
understand it, the eight candidates are previously screened for 
suitability.  One assumes there would be at least one qualified 
applicant out of the eight.  I have great respect for the legal 
profession.  I believe there are many more than eight qualified 
candidates for one position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of my constituents, and most likely the majority of 
Canadians as a whole, would not consider a salary increase of 
almost 20% for federal judges over a three year period to be the 
best way to increase the quality of our justice system.  We must 
ask ourselves how the government can justify giving federal 
judges a salary increase of 11.2% over and above the 8.2% 
increase they received in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase would in no way remedy the current backlog of 
federal court cases.  That issue must be dealt with by the 
administration of the courts, the responsibility of which 
primarily lies with the judges.  I have great confidence that the 
judges are capable of taking steps to ensure justice is dispensed 
in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pay increase would in no way help the thousands of front- 
line police officers who are at a severe disadvantage in their 
daily efforts to fight crime.  I am not saying judges should not 
be well paid.  They should be well paid and most Canadians would 
argue that they are.  It is a question of whether they should be 
paid more than they are already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party has great reluctance in supporting the bill on the 
basis that it ignores the real problems of the Canadian justice 
system and the manner in which judges are appointed.  That is 
another issue we could perhaps leave for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The backlog of the courts would not be remedied by the bill. The 
appointment process, which many Canadians believe should be 
reformed to make the judiciary more independent and publicly 
accountable, would remain the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administrators of the justice system, the provincial 
attorneys general, crown attorneys, police officers and members 
of the federal police force, the RCMP, would still be handcuffed 
by a lack of sufficient resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps nothing can be done with respect to the proposal in view 
of the structure and mandate of the commission and the 
constitutional obligations recently imposed upon parliament by 
the Supreme Court of Canada.  However I urge all hon. members to 
consider a better way of dealing with the issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the people of 
Surrey Central to participate in the third reading debate on Bill 
C-12, an act to amend the Judges Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin my remarks I would like to congratulate the chief 
opposition justice critic, the hon. member for Provencher, who 
has made excellent comments and explained very eloquently the 
official opposition's position on the Judges Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to implement the federal government's 
response to the report of the 1999 Judicial Compensation and 
Benefits Commission regarding compensation and benefits for 
judges.  It would amend the Judges Act to increase judicial 
salaries and allowances, modify the current judicial annuities 
scheme and put into place a separate life insurance plan for 
federally appointed judges.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 makes other consequential amendments to the Judges Act 
and the Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act.  The commission is 
appointed for a four year term and mandated to consider the 
compensation and benefits of judges and to make recommendations 
to government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission consists of three members appointed by the 
governor in council and it should be noted who nominates the 
three persons.  One is nominated by the judiciary, one by the 
Minister of Justice and one, who acts as a chair, is nominated by 
the first two members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government accepted the commission's recommendation of a 
salary increase of 11.2% retroactive to April 1, 2000.  The 
salary increase will cost approximately $19 million.  The 42 page 
bill contains nothing but amendments, replacements or additions 
to previous clauses changing the salaries of 1,013 federally 
appointed judges.  There are also amendments to compensation 
benefits, early and special retirement provisions, pro-rated 
annuities, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judiciary had initially proposed a salary increase of 26.3%. 
It had said the federal government must compete with high paying 
law firms to attract superior candidates to the bench.  However 
federal representatives told a hearing into judges' salaries 
earlier this year that there was no shortage of candidates for 
the bench, pointing out that there had been eight applicants for 
each federal job over the last decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last pay raise for federal judges was in 1998 when they 
received 4.1%.  In 1997 they received another 4.1%.  The judges 
received more than 8.2% in increases over two years.  Judges' 
salaries are also indexed so they receive annual cost of living 
increases.  While we have no position on judges' salaries and 
pensions we favour generally that they be comparable to those in 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 35th parliament the government introduced two bills, Bill 
C-2 and Bill C-42, amending the Judges Act.  In the 36th 
parliament there was Bill C-37.  All these bills, including Bill 
C-12 which we are debating today, have been said to be 
administrative in nature.  Four times the Liberal government has 
come forward with amendments to the Judges Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have with the bill is that the pay increase 
for federally appointed judges is higher than the increase the 
federal government is prepared to grant much lower paid public 
service employees.  Lately it has been the practice of the 
government to grant raises to senior officers in the military, to 
senior bureaucrats and now to judges while dragging its feet on a 
general salary increase for staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we do not dispute the salaries of appointed judges and 
others, they should generally be in line with the private sector. 
It is apparent that staff in the lower echelons of our justice 
system is being ignored.  Public servants should get salary 
increases in keeping with the average Canadian wage earner.  The 
government has awarded pay raises and bonuses to judges and 
senior bureaucrats while frontline police officers and lower 
level public servants receive little or nothing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 27, 1998, RCMP officers secured a pay raise of 2% 
retroactive to January 1, 1998.  They received a second increment 
of 1% on April 1, 1998, and an additional 0.7% increase on 
October 1, 1998.  RCMP officers had their wages frozen for five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition will review and closely scrutinize the 
provisions of Bill C-12, including the annuities scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the government has tailor made legislation to fit 
certain individuals and situations.  Legislation tailor made to 
fit an individual would compromise the impartiality of our 
judiciary.  The changes proposed to the Judges Act would allow a 
judge who is married for the second time to another judge after 
the death of his or her first spouse, also a judge, to collect 
both or two survivor's benefits upon the death of his second 
spouse.  One could only guess why the government would 
contemplate such a rare and highly unlikely situation.  We will 
be investigating that and we will be vigilant while debating the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We propose an independent and publicly accountable judiciary 
that would safeguard Canadians from the arbitrary power of the 
state.  However it must remain the responsibility of parliament, 
not the courts, to debate and assess the conflicting objectives 
inherent in public policy development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the last bill to amend the Judges 
Act, Bill C-37 in the 36th parliament, created the Judicial 
Compensation and Benefits Commission which provided the federal 
government yet another opportunity to make patronage 
appointments.  The failure of the current bill to introduce 
changes to the appointment process means that important and high 
paying positions in our court system will remain part of the 
patronage system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the Canadian Alliance would like to see the patronage 
appointment process in the judiciary overhauled to make it more 
transparent and publicly accountable.  One option would be to 
strike a committee to review and interview candidates whose names 
would be put forward to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The input of the provinces, which are affected directly by 
decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, is required in such 
matters.  At the moment there is no input from the provinces in 
the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 69 of the Canadian Alliance declaration of policy, which 
is always dictated by the grassroots members, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that a non-partisan civil service, an independent 
judiciary and competent leadership of government agencies, boards 
and commissions are vital in a democracy.  We will therefore 
ensure appointments to these positions are made through an open 
and accountable process based on merit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, both Liberal justice ministers since 1993 have 
failed to introduce a victims' bill of rights, address important 
issues pertaining to drinking and driving or even pass a young 
offenders act.  Instead they occupy the justice committee with 
administrative matters at the expense of more important issues. 
The country is experiencing a backlog in the courts and criminal 
trials are being put on hold, yet the government tinkers with the 
salaries of judges.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that judges are somehow caught up in the legislation. 
We acknowledge that judges are very hard working and want to 
contribute to making our judicial system fairer and faster as 
well as to making Canada a better country.  We are talking about 
Liberal government mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's unfair treatment of Canadians who work or are 
otherwise involved in the criminal justice system knows no 
boundaries.  Its inequitable treatment of Canadian workers 
extends all the way to the federal court benches.  It does not 
treat the victims of crime fairly, and today we are debating a 
bill that does not even treat judges fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not address the multitude of concerns that many 
Canadians have with the judicial system.  My colleagues and I 
strongly oppose the bill unless it is amended. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to make some 
remarks with respect to Bill C-12, the Judges Act, which deals 
specifically with the compensation and remuneration of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had an opportunity to review some of the technical 
amendments.  These amendments correct some of the language in the 
bill to ensure that there is parity, that the French and English 
versions correspond exactly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the minor amendments are very technical in nature, for 
example: clause 12, line 9, removes the language “plus $2,000”; 
clause 23, section 44.01(6), line 9, amends the English version 
with “takes effect on the day this section comes into force”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party supports these amendments and any attempt 
to ensure consistency in legislation.  These amendments would 
affect approximately 1,000 federally appointed judges.  When it 
comes to the issue of whether it is deserved, I would make the 
case that judges deserve a fair compensation package given the 
stress that is involved, the important work, and the ongoing and 
increasing complexity of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also necessary to note the importance of independence when 
it comes to our judiciary.  Some individuals have talked about 
comparing judges' salaries to those of others in the public 
sector.  There is some danger in doing that.  Judges play a very 
unique role, as do other public servants.  However, to try to 
somehow bring into play the underpayment of armed forces 
personnel, the need to give greater compensation to the policing 
community, those in the administrative justice community, leaves 
the wrong impression and tries to diminish the importance of what 
judges do.  It is a very complex melee that is somewhat like the 
pay equity argument we have embarked on at various times in the 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The complexity of the law, the way in which the law has evolved 
and the interpretation that goes on daily in the courtrooms 
across the country, is something that is very onerous for judges. 
We had a comprehensive bill yesterday on organized crime.  It is 
a step in the right direction, but it is legislation that would 
probably lead to a number of court challenges. 
That emphasizes the impact of changes in legislation.  It also 
emphasizes the necessity for judges to deal with it and to put in 
place a proper judicial interpretation of the legislative 
initiatives that are taken here.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, in Canada we have not seen any active attempts, at 
least that have been reported, to influence the judiciary by 
organized crime, but we must be vigilant.  We must maintain the 
scales of justice and ensure that justice continues to be blind 
to outside influences on decisions made by the judiciary.  We 
must ensure that it never happens.  Part of this, I would 
suggest, comes from a fair compensation package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that our judiciary is independent, at arm's 
length and is feeling secure in their occupation.  Thus, our 
party would support an attempt for a fair salary to preserve 
judicial independence.  The Conservative Party has a long 
standing interest in the administration of justice and in 
ensuring that the judiciary are given support.  Much of that 
support must come from financial stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government accepted the recommendations that came from an 
independent Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission.  The 
board made recommendations after broad consultations and 
examinations of all economic factors that should have been 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First reading of the bill occurred on February 21, 2001, and the 
Judges Act would implement the recommendations made by the 1999 
Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission.  The legislation 
does not come out of thin blue air.  It came about from 
recommendations of an independent commission.  It also followed a 
1997 supreme court decision that established new constitutional 
requirements for determining compensation, requiring every 
Canadian jurisdiction to have an independent, objective and 
effective commission.  It takes away the normal allegations that 
we often see pertaining to interference and an unfair process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also increase salaries and allowances, improve 
the judicial annuities scheme and put in place a separate life 
insurance plan for federally appointed judges.  It would make 
consequential amendments to the Judges Act and Supplementary 
Retirement Benefits Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, because of the increasing complexity of the 
law, although there is no shortage of applicants, many judges 
weigh heavily the decision to leave private practice and enter 
into a new form of service to the law.  That decision, I am sure, 
is one that many members can appreciate for many members of 
parliament have left behind other careers to come and serve their 
country in this Chamber.  It is very much analogous to the 
decision that judges take when leaving their profession to serve 
a higher calling, to serve the courts and their country in the 
form of interpretation and administration of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years there has been growing concern for some 
decisions made by judges.  However, I would suggest that this is 
not reason enough to deny that judges play a crucial role. 
Organized crime is on the rise in Canada.  It was addressed 
somewhat yesterday with the introduction of a package of changes 
to our laws.  New legislation, such as this one, goes some 
distance to addressing this very serious matter, but it is 
crucial that judges would now be required to interpret this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many other institutions, we have seen judges in recent 
years come under attack for their salaries and the compensation 
they receive when compared to the low end of compensation.  It 
sometimes seems somewhat askew, but I would encourage people to 
keep in perspective the salaries that are received at the high 
end, that is, the salaries that are sometimes paid to athletes 
and movie stars, and the role they play and the return they offer 
to society.  It is important to look at the entire scheme when 
one considers the pay scale.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judicial compensation and benefits commission has been 
appointed to a four year mandate.  It is required to consider all 
these factors in arriving at its recommendations.  When one 
considers the private sector scale in the area of the law, many 
judges take a pay cut upon assuming a role on the bench.  There 
are many lawyers who are making modest salaries, for example 
those who continue to strive to administer the law in crown 
attorney offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legal aid is often not mentioned in these deliberations.  There 
are many legal aid lawyers who later go on to make significant 
contributions in courtrooms in their current occupations.  They 
also go on to serve the country nobly as members of the bench, as 
judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arguably it is the best training ground. I have often compared 
it to a MASH unit when it comes to triage and the medical 
profession.  Legal aid lawyers and crown attorneys who are 
working in provincial and supreme courts across the country go on 
to become fantastic judges.  I have borne witness to that myself. 
I had the opportunity to work with some individuals who later 
were elevated to the bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring back to the commission, its recommendations were based 
on research comparing judges' salaries to lawyers' salaries in 
the private sector and to performance bonuses of senior federal 
deputy ministers.  It looked at the importance of salary and 
benefits in attracting the best of the best, the outstanding 
candidates that we require to administer the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Judges Act would officially establish the judicial 
compensation and benefits commission, requiring the commission to 
convene every four years and report its recommendations within 
nine months.  There is a very strict mandate and timeframe within 
which it must review the adequacy of judicial compensation.  The 
commission would also consider the economic conditions at the 
time, the cost of living, overall economic position of federal 
judges, the financial security of the judiciary to ensure 
judicial independence, and the need to attract the best of the 
best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendations are not binding but the supreme court in its 
decisions requires the government to publicly justify any 
decision and acceptance of recommendations.  These salary changes 
have already been put on the record.  They range in the area of 
$200,000 for the Chief Justice of Canada, the puisne judges, and 
various federal court judges across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increasing complex legal malaise that faces judges and 
lawyers is something that we must consider when weighing the 
question of compensation.  There has been quite a lengthy 
commentary about the need to compensate members of the RCMP, 
members of our armed forces and other public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not to deny in any way that those salaries must be 
reviewed and elevated as well.  It is not to suggest that if we 
compensate judges fairly we should not be focusing attention on 
these areas as well, or to deny that there are other very 
important pieces of legislation in the legal field that we should 
be examining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members have mentioned the need to bring forward a youth 
criminal justice act and the important fact that after seven 
years it has not happened.  There is also a need to examine a 
plethora of other legislative initiatives.  We have seen the 
government's failings and shortcomings when it comes to 
addressing issues of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supports the concept that we must move on a number of 
areas in the near future.  It is not to suggest that the bill 
should be given any great priority.  It is the government's 
decision to set the priorities in terms of the legislative 
timetable.  It is in everyone's interest to move the legislation 
before us forward and to get on to other important issues of the 
day.  When that happens it would allow some of these other fields 
to be considered.  When the legislation receives passage we can 
then look at other areas in terms of compensation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will briefly say a few words about 
the bill.  It has come up in the previous parliament.  We are 
disappointed and will not support it for the reasons the critic 
of my party mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will bring up two important issues.  First, I will look at the 
California example which could have been adopted by this bill or 
another bill.  It deals with the issue of re-organizing our 
criminal justice system to make it more efficient and 
expeditious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To improve convictions and make the system less expensive we 
should consider a public defender system.  We should work with 
the provinces to implement a public defender system to ensure 
quicker, fairer and less expensive convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public defender system has worked in California.  It has 
been compared to our present system and absolutely no difference 
was found in the manner or fairness of convictions.  However the 
public defender system was found to be more expeditious and less 
expensive.  Given the backlog in our present system, I encourage 
the government to look at the California model which would go a 
long way to increasing the efficiency of our judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue is the manner in which judges are chosen.  As 
we have heard today from members of other parties and my own, we 
take issue with the manner in which judges are chosen.  It is not 
as equitable as it could be.  There are other ways of doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They elect judges in parts of the United States and that system 
works very well.  U.S. judges are not chosen in the same manner 
as ours.  Elections give people a say in selecting the judges 
they would face in a court of law.  The election of judges is 
efficient at a certain level, provides for public scrutiny and 
allows people to compete and be evaluated for the position who 
would not otherwise be able to.  Furthermore, candidates are 
judged upon their record.  They are also prevented from running 
in the manner in which we run as members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, I am happy to see the government's organized crime bill 
move toward adopting RICO style amendments.  In our country, 
organized crime costs taxpayers about $17 billion a year 
according to 1996 statistics.  The number doubles when we take 
into consideration people who are killed or injured and the 
psychological damage inflicted upon their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to look at amendments similar to the 
RICO act south of the border.  RICO has enabled the U.S. to put a 
dent in organized crime.  The tools of our judicial system for 
dealing with organized crime have to date been paltry.  The 
problem is massive.  There are some 18 organized crime groups 
within our country today.  Seventy per cent of the money they 
generate comes from illicit drugs.  That is a scourge for all of 
us in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit of the Americas will take place April 20 to 22.  As 
host, we have an enormous opportunity to bring forth a 
comprehensive plan to deal with the illicit drug trade.  For the 
first time there is agreement in South America.  I met with the 
secretary of state and president of Colombia a month and a half 
ago.  During my visit a great commitment was given on the part of 
that country, which has been racked by the drug trade, to put the 
issue on the table.  Let us talk about a pragmatic approach to 
the illicit drug trade.  I hope it will be put on the table and 
that the 34 nations attending will address it in a pragmatic way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are a few solutions that can be employed.  First, remove 
tariff and non-tariff barriers and double taxation systems for 
countries and expand the free trade movement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT11"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT11"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1050

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Developing countries that are producers of illicit drugs, like 
Colombia, Peru and parts of Brazil, do not need aid, they need 
trade.  If we are to help the poorest of the poor within those 
countries we must remove the trade barriers that impede them from 
being economically self-sustaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, stated 
very clearly that people in developing countries need trade 
barriers removed and that the western developed countries are 
impeding their removal.  It would be far less expensive, more 
efficient and fairer if we removed barriers to trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canada and other countries of the hemisphere need to 
employ RICO-like anti-racketeering amendments to attack the 
organized crime gangs involved in the production and sale of 
drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to attack organized crime gangs we must chase the 
money.  The people in the Hell's Angels do not wear leather. They 
wear Armani suits.  They hide behind the law and use it to their 
advantage when they are being chased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make the law work for law-abiding citizens.  We need 
to make the law work for police officers.  We need to make the 
law work against organized crime instead of allowing crime gangs 
to hide behind it.  That is why enacting RICO-like amendments, 
going after the money and business interests of crime gangs and 
cutting the economic legs from under them are the most efficient 
ways to deal with them.  I encourage the government to put this 
on the table at the summit of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, we need not only tougher penalties for drug traffickers 
but a new approach toward treatment.  What we know today about 
drugs and neuroscience shows very clearly that drug addicts have 
a medical problem.  I believe we need to approach addicts in a 
medical fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very good programs.  Some European models have 
60% one-year success rates for hardcore narcotics abusers.  That 
is extraordinary.  Why do those programs work?  They work because 
they focus not only on detox and counselling but on medical 
treatment and skills and job training so that addicts can stay 
away from the drug environment.  Getting addicts away from the 
drug environment is critical because re-entering that environment 
sets off a neural cascade within their brains that prompts them 
to renew the drug habit.  The European model is an effective one. 
I can only impress upon the government to adopt it because there 
is an alignment of the stars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Latin American countries believe we should put more emphasis 
on consumption than on production because dealing with the issue 
at its source, as we have done historically, has not worked.  The 
Americans for the first time have said very clearly that we need 
more emphasis on consumption.  Senator McCain agreed when he was 
in Colombia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the plan is there.  The government has an 
opportunity to take it to the summit of Americas so that our 
country and our hemisphere can be a safer place to live. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
presume that was a speech on the Judges Act.  I heard a few 
sentences about it.  That is the bill we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I very much believe in the three pillars of democracy: this 
parliament and its elected members; a free press; and an 
independent judiciary.  The last aspect is very important to me 
and I think to all members on this side of the House, contrary to 
what I heard in the member's speech.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, members of the Canadian forces are getting hit with 
another rent increase that will overshadow the recently announced 
pay raises.  Here is a quote from one member of the military: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a member of the military I feel you should be made aware of 
the real facts the defence minister does not understand.  My pay 
went up $74.63 a month.  As of September 1, my rent will be 
increasing $100 a month. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of members of our forces, why does the defence 
minister boast about pay increases when in reality he is clawing 
it all back in rent increases? 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has it all wrong.  There was not 
only the pay increase on April 1 to which he refers, but there 
was a retroactive one that goes back to October 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the rent increases over the last three years and 
we compare them against the pay increases we have given over the 
last three year period as well, the pay increases are far in 
excess, 10 times in excess of the rent increases which, by the 
way, are levelled off at 25% of the gross family income and meet 
the provincial general guidelines on rent increases. 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that the soldiers do not see it the 
same way as the minister.  Here is another quote that I would 
like to put to the minister from a family member of a soldier: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone was so happy when it was announced that our soldiers 
were finally getting a pay raise, and it is true that this was a 
slap in the face when the defence minister gave his okay to up 
our rents.  We are back to square one. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the minister.  Why will the defence minister 
not drop this ridiculous rent increase and give our soldiers and 
their families a break for once?  Roll back the rents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, for example a corporal would be getting a rent 
increase in the area of $35 to $40 a month but over the last 
three years has had a pay increase of some $600 a month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 70% of the people who work for the military live in market 
accommodations.  The other 30% do not.  We as a government have 
an obligation, not just the military, to make sure that we are 
charging market rent.  We also make sure that their rent is below 
25% of their gross income and that their pay increases are far in 
excess of the rent increases.

Speaker, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency tells us that it has 
put together a comprehensive plan to deal with an outbreak of 
foot and mouth disease in Canada.  Unfortunately it has not 
advertised and circulated this plan to industry stakeholders. 
This means that municipalities, local veterinarians and farmers 
do not know how they fit into contingency plans to contain an 
outbreak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday at committee the CFIA stated that its plan would be 
put on its website before the end of the day.  It was still not

Speaker, I do not know where my hon. friend has been for the last 
number of years.  The fact is that for 80 years the federal 
government has contributed in some way to provinces for the 
construction of highways.  We agreed on a basic 25,000 kilometres 
of the national highway network.  The Minister of Finance 
announced $600 million for that purpose last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we would like more money and I am hopeful that more money 
will be applied.  We have just announced funding allocations to 
the province of British Columbia.  Hopefully that will deal with 
the very pressing problem in Revelstoke.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, funds are not lacking.  In B.C. alone 
last year the minister took more than $750 million in fuel taxes 
but put zero back into B.C. highways.  How does the minister 
justify that?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have been accused of a lot of things in my life but 
not of being a thief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the Government of Canada uses fuel taxes as part of 
general revenues to fund the many government programs Canadians 
demand, including the $600 million that the Minister of Finance 
has announced.

strychnine poison has been available for purchase by farmers for 
use in the control of the Richardson's ground squirrel.

strychnine such that it is currently available only in a premixed 
form with the amount of ingredient limited to .4% by volume. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current allowable limits for strychnine have greatly reduced 
the effectiveness of the poison with the result that the 
populations of Richardson's ground squirrels are steadily 
increasing.  The crop and hay land damage caused by this squirrel 
is very costly to farmers in regard to productivity, equipment 
repairs and injury to livestock.  They petition parliament to 
amend the relevant regulations so as to permit the sale of 
concentrated liquid strychnine to registered farmers until such 
time as an effective alternative can be found.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 19—<B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Antarctic treaty system: (<I>a</I>) what does 
Canada contribute; (<I>b</I>) which department is in charge; and (<I>c</I>) 
what is the total cost incurred by Canada? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade has overall responsibility for the 
co-ordination of Canada's participation in the Antarctic treaty 
system. A number of other departments and agencies, notably 
Environment Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Transport 
Canada, Natural Resources Canada, the Canadian Polar Commisssion 
and the National Museums of Canada provide expertise on specific 
issues under consideration in the context of the Antarctic treaty 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's status as a contracting party to the Antarctic treaty 
does not entail any assessed or voluntary financial 
contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the current fiscal year, April 2000 to March 2001 costs 
that can be directly attributed to the Antarctic treaty system 
include the following two items: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Participation in the Antarctic treaty meeting of experts on 
guidelines for Antarctic shipping held in London, U.K., April 
2000, $7,500; and participation in the special Antarctic treaty 
consultative meeting held in the Hague, Netherlands, September 
2000, including costs of preparation and production of reports, 
$18,750. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the following items, while not directly ascribed to 
the Antarctic treaty system, represent cost incurred to support 
the various international organizations associated with the 
treaty that support international scientific co-operation in the 
Antarctic: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientific committee on Antarctic Research, SCAR, annual 
contribution and participation in biannual meeting in Tokyo, 
Japan, $15,000; Canadian committee for Antarctic research, CCAR, 
which constitutes Canada's national committee for SCAR, support 
for secretariat, publications, participation in biannual meetings 
of SCAR working groups in Tokyo, Japan, and costs of annual 
meeting, $42,5000; and Council of managers of Antarctic programs, 
COMNAP, annual contribution and participation in annual meeting 
in Tokyo, Japan, $7,200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the broader issue of Canada's scientific contribution to the 
Antarctic treaty system, since acceding to the Antarctic treaty 
in 1988, Canadian government and university scientists and 
experts have participated in the work of many technical and 
scientific groups and contributed in several fields. Specific 
examples include expertise in oil spill prevention and 
containment in ice infested waters; waste management in polar 
regions; and development of a code for polar shipping, of an 
Antarctic flight manual, of the environment management plan for 
the McMurdo Dry Valleys, of environmental monitoring guidelines, 
and of a system of protected areas for Antarctica. These 
activities receive support from a number of government 
departments and institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian scientists continue to contribute to the work of SCAR 
working groups and as active scientists. Between mid-1997 and 
mid-2000, Canadian scientists wrote or co-authored some 85 
publications on Antarctic and bipolar science in a broad range of 
scientific disciplines. The Arctic-Antarctic exchange program 
promotes collaboration and exchange between scientists working in 
the two polar regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Canada also contributes to the exchange of information 
between the Arctic Council and Antarctic treaty meetings.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before we began question period my 
hon. colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca used his speech to 
express his concerns with the judicial process in Canada.  One of 
the government members got upset with him and said that basically 
the status quo is acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be proud of our judiciary.  We have some great people 
involved in the justice system.  Most Canadians would not dispute 
that.  We have to focus on how we can make our current systems 
better.  In many cases the status quo is not acceptable and I 
think most Canadians feel that something needs to be done to keep 
the judiciary at arm's length from the government to some extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague mentioned a number of solutions.  He mentioned 
elections.  I do not know whether he necessarily supports them 
but he mentioned them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another option I would like him to comment on is the idea of 
setting up an independent body that would review the applications 
for judges and the process of appointments so that they would be 
taken out of this place and out of the hands of the Prime 
Minister.  That would make the system work a little better and 
would keep the judiciary at arm's length from the government and 
from this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my hon. colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca to 
comment on that particular area of improving the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague has 
asked a very good question and has basically articulated the 
solutions I have put forth here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is accountability.  The issue is about removing power 
from the Prime Minister and giving it back to the people.  While 
we have an excellent judiciary, we can do certain things, such as 
having an independent body, which the hon. member spoke about, 
such as having supreme court appointments made not by the Prime 
Minister but ratified by parliament on an advisory from the Prime 
Minister.  The same thing could happen in provincial legislatures 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of elected officials, it happens at a certain level 
in the judiciary.  It happens in California and it works very 
well.  It takes the power away from a single individual, which is 
what we have in our country today, gives a little broader 
accountability and gives members of the public the opportunity to 
have some say about who will judge them when they are in front of 
the courts.  It works very well in California.  Very few judges 
are removed.  Most of them stay.  Only those who are really not 
doing a good job are removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, as my colleague mentioned, we have an excellent 
judiciary.  These solutions are just a way to perhaps make it a 
little better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the House ready for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The question is on the motion.  Is it 
the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA FOUNDATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK187">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 5 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-4, an act to establish a foundation to fund sustainable 
development technology, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-4, the Canada 
foundation for sustainable development technology act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premise of the legislation is that it will establish a 
foundation to fund innovative projects, primarily within the 
areas of climate change and air quality.  This is a premise that 
the PC Party supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that Canada made a strong commitment at Kyoto to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and put into place measures to 
help reduce the impact of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact it was the Conservative government, in 1992 at Rio, 
which first established a strong position respecting the 
environment, one that the current government has allowed to 
lapse. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us fails in its effort to improve the 
environment and to bring forward new sustainable development 
technology.  The fault is not with the premise of the bill but 
with the specifics or lack thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill clearly states that the foundation would be established 
with an initial fund of $100 million.  Although the fund may be 
increased over time, it is unlikely that it is the government's 
intention to do this.  That would be determined based on the 
success of the foundation to meet its objectives.  However I 
question how the foundation would determine whether its 
objectives are being met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment put forward in committee whereby the foundation 
would be required to submit detailed reports on specific 
projects, namely the extent to which they were successful in 
meeting their goals, was denied.  At most steps in the process 
the government has refused to accept amendments from any of the 
opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a very trying job in committee listening to 
government deliberations and listening to it defending its 
position on particular aspects of the bill.  If all parties had 
gone to committee with an open mind, the bill could have been 
improved.  The Conservative Party would have supported it along 
with the NDP, the Bloc and the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are left with legislation that promotes sustainable 
development but without guidelines in place to allow the 
foundation to determine whether those objectives are being met. 
There are some air quality issues that are difficult to 
accurately measure, but that does not mean there should be no 
standard in place to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been widely criticized by the auditor general 
for its lack of accountability on various projects or programs. 
Too little information is being made available regarding the 
spending of public funds.  Yet the government will continue the 
tradition with the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment that would have improved the legislation 
proposed that access to information be applied to the foundation. 
That amendment as well as the one I just mentioned would have 
improved the accountability and openness of the foundation and 
would have allowed an unbiased view of the projects.  It would 
have enabled the foundation to better determine whether it was 
meeting its objectives.  Without such requirements in place, the 
foundation becomes yet another institution which allows the 
government to give out money as it pleases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that some projects would fail.  Not every 
project, in particular those that promote new technology and 
innovative ideas, would be able to overcome obstacles and 
setbacks.  That is understood and it is not the objective of 
accountability and quantitative reviews to restrict projects or 
call into question their ability to succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, if it is impossible to quantify the ways in which a 
project could reduce greenhouse gases to improve air quality, it 
is not to say that such a project is not good.  There should be 
overall guidelines in place, at least general guidelines, to 
allow the foundation to achieve some level of accountability for 
public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of funds brings me to another problem with the 
legislation, another area where a lack of detail prevents me from 
supporting the bill.  It is one more example of inconsistency 
between what the minister said about the legislation when it was 
introduced in the House and what is actually entailed in the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the foundation would be funded with $100 million 
of taxpayer money.  When the minister appeared in committee he 
continually stated that it would be the intention of the 
foundation to leverage projects on a 1:4 basis.  In other words, 
the foundation would provide 25% of the total funding required to 
bring a project to fruition and other private or public sources 
could be accessed to supply the remaining 75%.  In no way is that 
an inconceivable or unnecessarily restrictive objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other government programs available to help fund 
projects such as the ones that would be considered by the 
foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a list of other public programs.  There is the annual 
allocation of $58 million for the energy research and development 
program.  On March 8 the Minister of Industry announced $62 
million in scholarship and fellowship funding to the Natural 
Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. On March 12 
there was an announcement of funding of $73 million for four new 
networks of centres of excellence.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget of the Canada foundation for innovation is $2.4 
billion, plus a recent addition of $750 million announced by the 
government on March 6.  Technology partnerships annual allocation 
is $300 million.  The industrial research assistance program 
annual allocation is $7 million. Technology early action measures 
allocation is $57 million.  What the list shows is that there are 
other avenues available for funding for sustainable development 
projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not mean that the legislation is redundant.  It means 
that there was ample opportunity for the government to set out 
specific limits on funding flowing from the foundation.  With 
other options available, the government did not have to worry 
about funding a project at 100%.  The minister said that the 
object would be to fund projects at 25%, and yet nowhere in the 
legislation is there any mention of any sort of limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed an amendment at committee stage that would have 
established a limit of 50% funding although the minister had been 
indicating at the time that the $100 million would be leveraged 
into $400 million.  The amendment proposed a 50% limit so that 
the board of directors of the foundation would not be unduly 
restricted or bound by unnecessary limitations.  The amendment 
would have established a guideline for the board, one that was 
consistent with the intent of the bill as the minister outlined. 
The amendment was voted down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of detail within the legislation may be dismissed.  The 
government may say that the legislation should not needlessly 
restrict the board of the foundation.  It is an example of sloppy 
legislation, one that is loosely worded and open to misuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also proposed in committee an amendment which was successfully 
adopted with the support of Liberal members of the committee. The 
amendment changed the date on which the legislation would take 
effect.  As it was worded, the provisions of the act could come 
into force on a day or days to be fixed by order of the governor 
in council.  It meant that the government could choose to 
implement certain sections of the act while allowing other 
sections to be implemented at later dates or not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also meant that the government could choose not to have the 
Official Languages Act apply or maybe it would not require annual 
reports by the foundation to parliament.  Such a provision opened 
the process to abuse.  It is one more example of the original 
looseness of the legislation.  While the clause has been amended, 
other clauses have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to give the impression that the PC Party does not 
support the objectives of the bill.  Improving air quality and 
reducing the impact of climate change are objectives that all 
Canadians support.  There are numerous alternative sources for 
fuel that need to be advanced, particularly as the world 
continues to deplete its oil and gas reserves.  These fuel 
sources are not only slowly disappearing, but their environmental 
impact is causing undesirable consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been a world leader in such areas as fuel cells and 
solar energy.  These are areas that need to be developed so that 
the ideas and technologies can be applied in the marketplace, 
even at national and international levels.  The Ballard fuel cell 
is one of the more recognized examples of Canada's innovative 
leading edge in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the parts of the legislation that I appreciate is that 
the ideas generated with the assistance of funding from the 
foundation are to be widely applied in the interest of improving 
air quality for all Canadians.  It means that if there can be 
broad application of the technology or other uses of the idea 
then it should be promoted since the overall goal is to improve 
air quality across the country.  That is one reason the 
foundation would assist with the development of projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is admirable and something that the PC Party supports, 
I refer back to the way the legislation has been crafted.  The 
legislation states that at the time of dissolution of the 
foundation any money remaining would be divided among the 
projects currently being funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it may sound reasonable at first glance, it is really 
saying that a project may receive unneeded money simply because 
it is still considered an active file at the time the foundation 
ceases to exist, when and if that ever occurs.  Understanding 
that there is no sunset clause in the legislation, the 
legislation could conceivably go on forever.  A project that has 
received funding may at a latter part of its development no 
longer require money, but because it is still one of the 
foundation's projects it would receive a portion of the unused 
funds.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting it will happen but it could happen. The 
foundation could literally have tens of millions of dollars on 
its books and 12 or 50 projects.  The money by law would be 
legally divided among those projects, whether or not they 
required additional funds.  As long as they are open files they 
would get a portion of those funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed an amendment in committee to the clause that would 
have seen the money revert to the government at the termination 
of the foundation.  Canadian taxpayers would get back any money 
that had not been allocated at the time the foundation 
terminated.  It would make sense since taxpayers would have 
contributed to the original funding of the foundation.  Therefore 
any leftover funds should revert to the government.  Again the 
amendment was voted down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that it is not inconceivable to be 
dealing with tens of millions of dollars, perhaps even $100 
million.  There is no limit on the amount that has to be in the 
foundation, if and when it is dissolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the legislation that would prevent the 
government from providing new funds at any time to the 
foundation. There is an unrestricted ability for the government 
to increase the moneys available to the foundation without any 
guideline in the legislation covering such actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is another example of how little control the legislation 
would have on how the government manipulates the foundation.  The 
PC Party would tend to support legislation aimed at improving air 
quality, promoting sustainable energy and developing new 
technologies.  It is the sloppiness of the legislation that 
prevents me from supporting the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now review what is lacking in the legislation.  First, 
there are no controls on spending.  Nowhere in the legislation is 
there a limit on the amount of money the government plans to put 
into the foundation over the long term.  More important, there is a 
limit on the amount of money that would be provided for specific 
projects.  Even though the minister stated that the foundation 
would likely provide one-quarter of the necessary funding, 
nothing was mentioned in the legislation to provide guidelines to 
the directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the foundation is not open to access to information 
inquiries or to review by the auditor general.  Third, the bill 
lacks clearly defined terms for directors, something that I tried 
to address through amendments.  These are all problems that could 
easily have been addressed by the government in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disappointing not to be able to speak in favour of the 
legislation.  Sustainable energy is something that we all need to 
strive to achieve, particularly given the fact that fossil fuel 
supplies are decreasing.  Moving to fuel cells or using existing 
fuel sources and more environmentally friendly ways are goals 
that we should all support if we want to improve air quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the job of the opposition parties to improve legislation 
where necessary.  In this case the legislation needs to be 
amended.  We have tried to do that.  Unfortunately we were unable 
to improve the legislation to the point where the PC Party could 
support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have one 
quick comment on one of the member's points regarding limits on 
the contributions to projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made it clear that the contribution agreement with 
the foundation would set those limits.  The reason he did not 
want to put that in the legislation was to avoid cases where a 
good project that went over some arbitrary limit could not be 
handled.  If it is put into the contribution agreement or into 
the regulation the same function everyone was in favour of in the 
legislation would be accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
comments, but I do not agree with him.  If the intent of the 
legislation is to be clear on the limitation of funding, the 
legislation should clearly state that and not leave it up to the 
board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the fact that some projects may require 100% funding, 
such as projects that would be under the purview of hospitals and 
universities where limited funding is available from other 
sources, they would still be available for funding under the 
agreements I have listed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I did not add them up, there was somewhere around $3.5 
billion or $4 billion worth of additional government funding 
available from other projects.  In no way would any good project 
need to be turned down on the basis that it could not be funded 
100%, because there would be funding available from other sources 
which could take up that other 50% or 75% that may be required.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I will start my speech with a discussion 
about the Internet and personal computers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we live in a world environment where technology is 
changing at an ever increasing pace.  It is creating a lot of 
opportunities but it also is creating some problems as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet is a great tool to use for research.  Many people 
are now shopping on the Internet.  E-mail of course is a very 
efficient and effective method of communication and is becoming 
increasingly popular.  People do banking online.  Many companies 
or individuals for various reasons host websites, which are great 
sources of information for people to access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the use of computers in today's world is an 
absolute necessity.  Businesses use them for data management and 
for accounting purposes.  As members of parliament, we rely on 
computers extensively for our word processing and all of our 
communications efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because technology, computers and the Internet are so pervasive 
in our society and becoming increasingly relied upon, consumer 
and customer confidence in the case of people who do business 
online is being questioned.  There are issues of privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My private member's motion is designed to fill a void that 
currently exists in the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Internet was first developed and its use expanded upon, 
I do not think a lot of the pioneers who were behind the 
development of the Internet and the entrepreneurs who broke 
ground in improving the way computers worked ever envisioned that 
the Internet could be used for such perverted and corrupt 
purposes.  I am speaking partially about the fact that children 
in some cases are being targeted and lured into situations where 
they might be abused by sexual predators.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion seeks to specifically provide new criminal code 
provisions to deal with people who disrupt electronic commerce on 
purpose.  I am talking about computer hackers who hack into 
computers in an attempt to steal or retrieve data or to simply 
cause a computer malfunction.  One of the most terrible acts occurs 
when people wilfully and maliciously export computer viruses for 
the purpose of disrupting business and commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of my research for my motion, I contacted a constable 
with the RCMP commercial crimes division.  I asked how the police 
would deal with people who with premeditation and malice exported 
a virus.  I asked if they exported the virus for wide 
dissemination or if they were targeting a different organization, 
would that be dealt with differently.  One would think that 
different acts would have different consequences in terms of the 
criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constable's answers were vague and he was not forthcoming. I 
told him that he was not giving me the answers for which I was 
looking.  He told me that that was because there was a vacuum in 
the criminal code.  He said they did not have the tools to deal 
with this.  He informed me that in many cases people were charged 
under a section of the criminal code termed mischief to data. 
However, it was not specific and not targeted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion seeks to have the government introduce a bill that 
would have specific provisions in the criminal code which the 
police could use to charge people who engaged in activities such 
as hacking or exporting computer viruses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I receive all party support for this motion.  I am 
proposing that provisions be put in the criminal code.  I have 
not delved into what specific crimes should be delineated or 
added to the code nor have I made any reference to what the 
penalties ought to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill came before the House of Commons, it would receive 
second reading, go to committee and would come back to this place 
for report stage.  There would be many opportunities for us to 
debate the specific charges and what the penalties associated 
with them would be.  This is the appropriate place for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to offer my opinion.  The penalties associated with 
criminal acts of computer hacking and exporting of viruses ought 
to be quite severe.  I see these as wilful acts of malice and an 
attack on personal property.  I see these acts as no different 
from those of an arsonist or somebody who breaks into a home and 
robs it.  The penalties associated with these types of activities 
ought to be in that type of category which would act as a 
deterrent to the crimes themselves.  We currently do not have 
appropriate provisions in the criminal code for the police to 
deal with individuals who are engaging in these activities nor do 
we have appropriate deterrents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to state for the record that my constituency office 
in Saskatoon had a problem with a hacker.  My staff had to 
establish what is called a firewall.  I do not know the 
technical aspects of that, but it is a situation whereby a 
computer system is set up so nobody can hack into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Anna Kournikova virus which hit earlier this year infected 
many members' computers.  My staff in Ottawa informed me that my 
computer received 130 of the Anna Kournikova viruses. We should 
take whatever reasonable measures we can to prevent that type of 
thing from happening. 
I also have some resolutions of the Canadian Association of 
Chiefs of Police on such things as Internet luring and the 
exploitation of children, criminal activity involving Internet 
and sexual activities with young people and other regulations and 
enforcement provisions of Internet matters.  The Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police has recognized that there is a 
need to be filled.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While my motion is specific and restricted only to computer 
hackers and virus exporters, there are obviously other things 
that need to be addressed as well.  However I believe it has a 
basis of common sense and practicality.  I hope it will receive 
the support of all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take this opportunity to say that I am fortunate 
that this motion was drawn.  For the viewers watching who do not 
know how it works in this place, private members of parliament do 
not have the privilege of proposing legislation to the House, 
except through the private members' lottery system.  While we can 
table bills or motions in the House of Commons, they simply sit 
there in a state of suspension for an indefinite period of time. 
Periodically a lottery is held in which members' names are drawn. 
If we are fortunate enough to have a motion or a bill drawn, we 
then appear before a committee and a select few of those bills 
are actually deemed votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am fortunate enough to have had that happen to this 
motion, a member should not have to rely on good luck or fortune 
to have a proposal such as this come before the House of Commons. 
We should look at reforming the system of private members' 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a private member, if I had an initiative, a suggested 
proposal or an amendment to legislation that I wanted to bring 
forward on behalf of my constituents, this would be an effective 
means me to do that.  It would also be a means to hold the 
government accountable for the laws and rules.  If I am not 
afforded the ability to do that, it restricts my ability as a 
member of parliament to act as an effective member of the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the House that while it may be politically expedient 
to try to restrict initiatives from coming forward, we all 
benefit if opposition members are afforded an ability to be as 
effective as possible.  The ability to bring forward motions or 
bills is something that should not be restricted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have effectively covered the premise of my private 
member's motion which is the need to fill a void in the current 
Criminal Code of Canada and set out specific offences related to 
people who willfully disrupt electronic business and commerce in 
Canada.  Their behaviour is very offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I will have the support of all members of the House to 
have the government bring forward legislation to fill that void 
and properly address what is a growing problem in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in the debate on 
private member's Motion No. 80 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
immediately amend the Criminal Code to create a separate category 
of offences and punishments for computer hackers and persons who 
willfully or maliciously export computer viruses, both of whose 
activities disrupt the normal conduct of electronic business in 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin my remarks in support of this common sense 
initiative by congratulating my colleague, the hon. member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt, for bringing this matter to the floor of the 
House for consideration.  My colleague introduced the motion in 
the last parliament as well but the Liberals ignored it.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's motion is forward thinking and responds to the 
needs of consumers and businesses who are very concerned about 
the shenanigans caused by computer hackers and those who enjoy 
sending out e-mails that crash computers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Criminal Code of Canada, law enforcement agencies and 
the courts are not properly equipped to lay criminal charges nor 
prosecute matters that involve Internet hacking.  Creating a 
separate category would facilitate the prosecution of such crimes 
in a consistent manner and would act as a deterrent for those who 
intend to hack computers with malintent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will describe the seriousness and the losses that can be 
caused by such hacking.  Recent events show how much money can be 
lost because of hacking or computer viruses.  Not long ago 
egghead.com was attacked and three million credit card numbers 
were stolen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last February, a 16 year old boy from Quebec, known as mafia 
boy, was charged with conducting a denial of service attack on 
the world's leading Internet sites, like amazon.com, e-bay, CNN, 
yahoo and e*trade.  The high tech crime spree prompted an FBI 
investigation.  The mafia boy is facing a maximum of two years in 
custody.  These attacks were estimated to have cost the firms 
$1.2 billion U.S. based on lost revenue, loss in market 
capitalization and dollars spent upgrading security systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first quarter of 2000, the FBI reported that 800,000 
credit card numbers were stolen over the Internet in three 
incidents.  In May 2000, the “I love you” virus wreaked havoc 
worldwide and caused an estimated $10 billion in losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 2000, the University of Washington Hospital had a 
website security issue, making all its confidential patient 
information available on the web for three days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the examples that come to light regarding 
Internet hacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International airports, banks, governments, defence departments, 
science labs and power companies are all vulnerable to computer 
hackers and viruses.  Organized crime is a serious threat in this 
century.   What would happen if a hacker managed to trigger 
missiles?  Because they are computer based, someone could hack 
into the computer, fool around and trigger a missile.  This kind 
of threat must be taken seriously, not only in Canada but 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internet use has increased markedly in the past five years. 
Many homes are logged on to the Internet.  Young people are at 
the cutting edge of our computer oriented society.  We must 
impress on our younger generations the serious nature of 
tampering or playing with this technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about liability, responsibility and lack of 
protection in this case.  Security flaws sometimes may not be 
detectable.  When a technology is created sometimes the security 
flaws cannot be detected because they may be in a particular area 
or be service oriented.  If unethical people find the flaw, they 
could exploit it for personal or criminal gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The software companies are not liable for security flaws in 
their products since they have liability clauses in their 
agreements.  Consumers are not protected by industry standards or 
government regulations.  There is no guarantee of security being 
offered for Internet use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kinds of crimes affect our livelihood, our lives and 
invade our privacy.  They threaten the e-commerce worldwide.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian centre for information technology security was 
founded by the University of British Columbia as well as the 
justice institute of B.C. to lead the way in information 
security.  It is an effort in the right direction but such 
efforts need the support of government and law enforcement 
agencies.  There needs to be a law with teeth in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is serious as peace is threatened.  International 
co-operation is imperative.   There may be a disruption in our 
international security if the issue is not handled properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no Liberal action on the issue.  The weak Liberal 
government that lacks vision is not doing anything to address the 
situation.  It is a serious matter.  Rather than making the 
motion votable, the Liberals have ignored it.  I do not know 
whether they will even speak to the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should have taken their cue from my colleague and 
stolen his motion so that Canadians could be protected from 
hackers.  There should be a bill coming from the government, but 
the weak Liberal government that lacks vision has done nothing on 
the issue so far.  Leadership is needed on the issue and it is 
not coming from the Liberal government.  That is why my colleague 
has introduced the forward thinking motion we are debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prevention is always better than cure.  Preventive measures such 
as criminal sanctions need to be adopted.  There should be a 
specific reference in the criminal code for offences related to 
Internet sabotage or hacking.  We are living in a computer age 
and it is necessary to have laws in statutes that reflect that. 
The debate should wake up members opposite.  I urge all members 
of the House to support Motion No. 80. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a common sense motion.  Motion No. 80 requests that the 
criminal code be changed to include a section on offences that 
would allow police to lay charges against any person or persons 
who deliberately export a computer virus or engage in any 
activity designed to disrupt e-commerce and business in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members are asked to support the motion so that we can take 
the right action at the right time and prevent mishappenings in 
the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
participate in the debate on behalf of our justice critic, the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, and present our 
party's position on the motion.  We see it as a justice issue. 
The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
immediately amend the Criminal Code to create a separate category 
of offences and punishments for computer hackers and persons who 
wilfully or maliciously export computer viruses, both of whose 
activities disrupt the normal conduct of electronic business in 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years we have heard of the love bug virus and the Anna 
Kournikova virus.  The latter was sent to the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and to me from a former high 
school chum, Mike Wells.  We make it a point to address issues of 
this nature to rid us of the capacity for hackers like Mike Wells 
to contaminate personal computers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's computer age some have immortalized people like mafia 
boy in the same manner in which the public immortalized Al Capone 
in the 1930s. 
These computer hackers have not killed anyone, but like Capone 
these immortalized computer hackers are nothing more than common 
criminals.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current criminal code is adequate to deal with computer 
hackers.  It covers mischief in relation to data in subsections 
430(1.1) and 430(5).  A hacker is liable to imprisonment not 
exceeding 10 years or punishable on summary conviction.  It also 
includes references to the unauthorized use of a computer where a 
hacker is liable to imprisonment not exceeding 10 years or 
punishable on summary conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that the world is becoming increasingly wired, 
the antics of computer hackers and the creation of viruses have 
become a serious threat to some of the most powerful companies in 
the world.  It has been a real threat to businesses and 
governments around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families and individuals who store valuable personal 
information, priceless family photos, et cetera, on their hard 
drives can have these personal records taken from them, lost for 
perpetuity, through the commission of a thoughtless and callous 
crime committed by a computer hacker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that society has not treated the problem 
seriously.  Many people still consider such actions to be a 
practical joke.  We take it cavalierly and as such we have not 
created any deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many hackers are teenagers, as in the case of mafia boy, who 
think it is a prank.  The creation of a separate offence would 
send the message to society that computer hacking is 
irresponsible and causes serious harm.  Those who cause such 
problems should be held properly accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the learned member, our justice critic and the 
House leader for the Progressive Conservative Party, the hon. 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, it is my pleasure to 
enter these remarks into debate this afternoon. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand in this 
place on a Friday afternoon to speak to the motion.  There is 
always such excitement in this place on Friday afternoons that it 
is a real pleasure to be able to share that with all my 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt who in 
his wisdom saw the increase in the amount of Internet trade that 
takes place in Canada and around in the world.  In trying to 
facilitate that sort of trade and growth he has introduced a 
private member's motion which would require the government to 
amend the criminal code to create a separate category of offences 
and punishment for persons found guilty of wilfully disrupting 
the conduct of electronic business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motive of the motion is definitely in good standing.  There 
needs to be some concern when it comes to security and protection 
of information, protection of privacy and protection of very 
important documents as they travel across the Internet, 
particularly as Internet trade continues to increase.  Yet as my 
colleague said earlier, the criminal code, law enforcement 
agencies and the courts are not properly equipped to lay criminal 
charges and prosecute matters that involve the Internet. Creating 
a separate category would facilitate the prosecution of such 
crimes in a consistent manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives us the chance to talk about the issue and at least 
evaluate it to see what can be done to improve the measures of 
security around Internet trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of my colleagues would remember from the last parliament a 
landmark bill that was passed.  Bill C-6, the Personal 
Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, dealt with 
electronic commerce and specifically private protection of 
information.  I was fortunate enough to work on that bill because 
I was a member of the industry committee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT37"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT37"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a lot of good work in that bill which laid a 
foundation, with help from all parties in the House to move it 
forward.  However, the issue that still needs to be addressed is 
the one my hon. colleague from Saskatoon—Humboldt brings up 
today.  That is the issue of security and the measures that are 
needed in order to be able to lay fraud charges against people 
who are abusing the Internet or abusing e-commerce or doing 
anything else that may arise from wilful wrongdoings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 initially created a legal and regulatory framework for 
electronic commerce by introducing measures to protect personal 
information in the private sector, creating an electronic 
alternative for doing business with the federal government, and 
clarifying how the courts assess the reliability of electronic 
records used as evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework of the bill obviously was suited to putting a 
mandate on the future growth of electronic commerce in the 
country. However, again the area that I think was a bit weak, 
which we talked about—and I believe the government said it 
planned to work on that area—was the area of security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was supposed to be developed in that bill, which I think 
also touches on this private member's motion, was the idea of 
improving the security of electronic signatures through the use 
of encryption.  That was going to be part of the bill.  I know 
there is still an effort going on to develop that, but ultimately 
we would like to see it brought in sooner than later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private member's motion today at least addresses that to 
some extent.  It opens up that debate, not only to look at the 
criminal aspects of what can be done to make sure we try to deter 
illegal activity within Internet commerce, but as well to look at 
ways within the framework of the legislation the House has 
already produced to increase security through forms of encryption 
or other forms of security currently on the Internet, perhaps 
without even looking at going down through the criminal side, as 
my colleague suggested.  That at least gives us the opportunity 
to be able to debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 also went beyond the scope of electronic commerce in 
that it created a legal and regulatory framework to be applied to 
the commercial use of sensitive and private information in all 
areas of business.  During that debate there was much concern 
from people in health care, areas of commerce, small businesses 
and obviously consumers.  Consumers are one of the most important 
aspects of Internet commerce.  They want to make sure their 
information is protected if they are doing transactions over this 
new medium, the Internet.  Their information, whether it be 
financial records, Visa numbers or whatever, is being submitted 
and can be accessed almost anywhere, especially, as my colleague 
mentioned, by hackers or by others trying to do wrong on the 
Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt about it.  This is a concern to many Canadians 
and we need to address what we can do to deter criminal activity 
on this new medium, which increasingly the majority of Canadians 
will be using.  We need to address how we can do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I encourage my hon. colleague to consider, 
especially as we continue to deliberate on his motion.  Hopefully 
the motion will continue on its way and maybe even get to 
committee so we can make amendments to it.  We should look at 
ways to continue to work on the area of security through 
encryption.  That is something that is within the mandate of the 
government and the House.  We can look at ways to improve that 
legislation, as we talked about prior to it passing in the House 
and receiving royal assent earlier this year.  Also, we can look 
at ways to see how that can be co-operatively strengthened on the 
criminal code aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on my hon. colleague's comments when he made reference to 
the RCMP and a few other police organizations, there is no doubt 
that they are feeling left out in the cold in regard to doing 
their part in strengthening the security around Internet 
transactions.  They need to be able to prosecute and lay criminal 
charges against people who disrupt e-commerce business in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is obviously a reason to debate this.  There is a reason 
to strengthen what we have done already in the House.  Hopefully 
we will keep strengthening the ability of Canadian consumers to 
use the e-commerce medium and to be able to trust it.  We need to 
work in a voluntary and co-operative way with industry, because 
there are a lot of great innovations happening out there that do 
increase security on the Internet.  I believe there are many 
things we can do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a moment to once again congratulate the member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt, who I think brings a very important motion 
to the House to at least begin the debate on how we can continue 
to improve the medium of electronic commerce in the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I add my chorus of congratulations to 
those for my colleague from Saskatoon—Humboldt for his foresight 
in bringing the motion to the floor of the House.  We know the 
issue has been raised before.  It has been dealt with by the 
banks, by the police and by a wide variety of individuals across 
the country, including the Minister of Justice, who has shown 
great interest in it.  I can only ask her at the outset of my 
comments to please work with the member to address the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been articulated, the Internet has exploded into our 
lives.  It truly has been an explosion.  It is interesting to 
note that it took 25 years for cable television to reach 10 
million people and it has taken only 5 years for the Internet to 
reach 10 million people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those growing numbers in terms of users, we have seen an 
explosion in criminal opportunities.  We have heard about the 
opportunities for money laundering and computer hacking, which 
not only compromise economies and businesses but can also have a 
profound impact on personal lives with respect to any health care 
data that is shared.  It can also have a devastating effect on 
security issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen some very frightening examples of individuals in 
other countries hacking into security systems.  These security 
systems control and involve missiles and they control other 
defence capabilities that can obviously have a profound impact on 
the country or countries and, indeed, on international security 
at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we need to have some kind of rules based mechanism and 
some laws with which we can identify problems with respect to 
security within our Internet e-commerce, problems such as we have 
today, and with which we can also develop tools to go after the 
people who have shown a wilful disdain for the system and for 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that computer networks have an increasing importance in 
our lives.  We need to develop some rules to deal with this 
because of the profound impact that people hacking into the 
computers can have.  My colleagues have actually articulated that 
already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to the need to involve various partners.  I 
know the justice minister and my colleague are interested in 
this.  There is a need to involve police officers, banks and 
government and bring them together to develop a rules based 
system which will allow us to go after the money launderers, the 
people who are using credit cards illegally and the people who 
are shunting large sums of money from their criminal actions into 
other avenues that are legal.  I think it is the biggest 
challenge with respect to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people see Hell's Angels individuals with their leathers and 
their hogs and think of them as unintelligent, brutal killers who 
terrorize individuals.  Certainly some of them are, but a much 
larger percentage of them are individuals with $1,500 Armani 
suits who are highly intelligent business thugs using the law 
against us and hiding behind the law when it suits them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best things our country can do is follow on the 
example of my colleague, follow on the interests of the justice 
minister and have a round table with representatives of banks, 
law enforcement officers, government representatives and members 
to pull together a series of bills that will enable us to go 
after these people on the basis of their money.  We have to find 
ways of tracking the money.  When we track the money, we have a 
way of dealing with the most vulnerable aspect of organized 
criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it is indeed a balance.  We have to balance the issue 
of privacy of individuals and companies with the greater need to 
enable law enforcement officers to apprehend and prosecute 
individuals who are using the Internet and using banking systems 
in this illegal way.  Historically the banks have had a voluntary 
system of transaction reporting, whereby bank managers are asked 
to report large transactions if they are somewhat suspect.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the banks recognize that this is not working very well. 
They clearly recognize their internal checking mechanisms are not 
working well.  Organized crime knows that and is manipulating the 
system to its advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a country we are known as a major conduit of illegal funds, a 
place where it is very easy to launder funds.  We need to change 
that.  I know there is great political will in the House and 
across the country to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Saskatoon—Humboldt and other members of the 
House are demonstrating an interest, a knowledge and an expertise 
in this area that would allow Canadians to feel a lot safer and 
secure with respect to their funds and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only that.  There are many other issues with which we 
have to deal.  We spoke about the illegal use of the Internet for 
pornography, specifically child pornography.  This is an issue 
that is very difficult to deal with, but as a nation we must work 
with our partners.  The Internet is international.  We have to 
influence and suggest solutions in an international sphere. 
Once we get our house in order, we can actually bring these 
solutions to the international forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in 1998 the Organization of American States signed a 
declaration of principles.  This was a series of recommendations 
which the representatives were going to take back to their 
countries.  The declaration was intended to bring us together in 
dealing with Internet crime and money laundering.  I have not 
heard anything in the House to date on that.  It would be very 
encouraging for the minister to bring this to the floor of 
the House.  By working with like-minded colleagues, such as the 
member for Saskatoon—Humboldt and others, we could pull together 
a good bill that would address these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a new issue.  It is an important and pertinent issue to 
Canadians because of the vast exponential expansion of the 
Internet and the impact it has on our society.  The potential is 
there for individuals to hack into systems and use the 
information for their own criminal intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage members of the House to support my colleague's 
motion.  It is a good motion that will help Canadians.  We look 
forward to a positive response from the minister on this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Motion  No. 80.  I 
would thank the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt for raising 
an issue of national and international importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues relating to cyber-crime, such as hacking and malicious 
virus dissemination, have been widely reported over recent months 
and has caused government and industry and the public to turn 
their attention to these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government shares concerns related to issues surrounding 
cyber-crime.  However, it is important to find out that our 
concerns are related to the proliferation of such activity and 
not about our ability to prosecute such offenders as we have laws 
that address the problem on the books already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Minister of Justice agrees with the principle of 
the motion, she cannot support it as presented.  The simple 
answer or reason is that our current criminal code provisions 
already criminalize this type of behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A short 10 years ago the Internet was in its commercial infancy. 
Now the expansion of the Internet and the technologies associated 
with it in a very real manner have revolutionized our world.  The 
Internet has changed the way we communicate with one another, the 
way we share information and the way we relate to each other. 
Computer networks and the Internet in particular have managed to 
shrink our vast world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's technology allows us to share information with people in 
other countries and on other continents with minimal expense, but 
the Internet has also created corresponding opportunities for 
criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like everyone else, criminals have embraced high technology to 
further their goals.  We are becoming increasingly aware of the 
threats posed by individuals using the Internet.  Hate literature 
and child pornography can be disseminated easily.  Even 
traditional crimes such as fraud and forgery can now be committed 
with the aid of the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hackers, which are addressed in the member's motion, can wreak 
havoc on our economic infrastructure by bringing down critical 
computer and communications systems.  Serious havoc can even 
result from a prank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been incidents where teenagers either unknowingly or 
fully understanding the implications of their actions have hacked 
into sensitive websites. 
The potential damage from a concerted attack by cyber-terrorists 
on a country's critical infrastructure could be catastrophic. 
This is what makes this type of behaviour so troubling.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, Canadians are fully protected from and equipped 
to deal with the conduct described in the member's motion.  In 
fact laws covering this type of behaviour have been on our books 
for over 15 years.  In 1985 parliament created a separate 
category of offences for hackers, now section 342.1 of the 
criminal code.  This provision makes it illegal for any person to 
obtain unauthorized access to a computer service.  Parliament at 
the time recognized that this could be a serious crime, and it is 
therefore punishable with a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to persons knowingly and maliciously disseminating 
computer viruses, parliament also made amendments in 1985 to the 
crime of mischief which is also punishable by a maximum term of 
imprisonment of 10 years.  If actual danger to life is caused the 
maximum penalty is life imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These 1985 amendments make it a crime to wilfully tamper with 
computer data.  This includes conduct such as obstructing or 
interfering with the lawful use of computer data or a computer 
system.  Additionally the traditional laws of attempt, conspiracy 
and aiding and abetting will apply to these offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that our current laws already criminalize the 
malicious dissemination of computer viruses that cause harm, as 
well as attempts and other forms of complicity in such crimes. 
Law enforcement has and will continue to use these provisions 
successfully as in the recent mafia boy case, where the accused 
was charged with 64 counts of hacking and mischief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated earlier we are appreciative of the member's motion. 
However the motion may give the impression that Canada is not 
prepared or equipped legally to deal with such crimes.  This is 
obviously not correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent independent international study on the readiness of 
national laws to deal with cyber-crime, McConnell International 
found that Canada's cyber-crime laws are among the world's 
strongest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Canada is a world leader in this regard, the government 
is committed to ensuring that our laws speak to our changing 
technological environment, while having due regard for 
fundamental human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is an active participant in many international fora which 
are currently studying both the effects and solutions to the 
issues raised by cyber-crime.  These include among others the 
G-8, the Council of Europe, the United Nations, the Commonwealth 
Secretariat, OECD and the Organization of American States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As observers to the Council of Europe, Canadian delegates have 
been integral in negotiating a draft convention on cyber-crime 
that will be adopted later this year and that will stand as a 
benchmark for international instruments in this area.  At the G-8 
Canada continues its leadership role on cyber-crime issues and is 
looking forward to its presidency in the year 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the existing provisions of the criminal code protect 
Canadians fully against those who would use technologies such as 
the Internet for the criminal purposes outlined in the motion. 
The government, in co-operation with its international partners, 
the law enforcement industry, provinces, territories and civil 
liberties groups, is working to ensure that the tools and laws it 
employs are relevant and appropriate in today's fast paced 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to this international work, Canada is reviewing its 
laws to ensure that Canada's laws remain up to date and that 
Canada remains a world leader in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard (Laval East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
you for this opportunity to take part in the debate on this 
motion. I will not be supporting the motion because, in my 
opinion, the criminal code provisions already deal with the 
offences referred to in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, a separate category of offences dealing 
with hackers was created in 1985 under subsection 342.1 and 
provisions dealing with mischief under subsection 
430.1 specifically cover the transmission of computer viruses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though no amendment is necessary as a result of this 
motion, I believe it is reasonable to conclude that the 
Department of Justice reviews its acts on an ongoing basis to 
ensure they are up to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier my opposition colleague asked that we show leadership. I 
believe the government has shown leadership in the past and 
again yesterday when it announced new bold measures and the 
allocation of new money to fight organized crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was following up on a commitment made in the 
throne speech. This commitment reflected the work of the House 
of Commons subcommittee on organized crime and was in response 
to a number of issues raised by the federal, provincial and 
territorial justice ministers at their last meeting, in 
September 2000. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 2000 ministers of justice declared organized crime 
a national priority to be dealt with at all levels through a 
multidisciplinary approach. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministers have agreed to a national program on organized 
crime, with a very strict timetable in four areas, including 
national and regional co-ordination, research and analysis, 
legislative and regulatory instruments, as well as 
communications and public education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code is a national statute that is very important 
to keep the peace in this country. Therefore, we must amend it 
with caution. As my colleague was saying, since 1997 the 
government has not hesitated to amend it when necessary. In 
fact, it amended it eight times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not hesitate to amend it to give increased powers to 
police officers with regard to search and to impose restrictions 
on release on bail. 
It did not hesitate to amend it to enact provisions dealing with 
organized crime, including creating a new offence that makes 
participation in the illegal activities of a criminal 
organization an indictable offence punishable by up to 14 years 
in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That particular piece of legislation broadened the investigative 
powers of police officers, by making it easier, for example, for 
law enforcement agencies to use electronic surveillance. It also 
increased public protection by reversing the burden of proof for 
a person accused of an organized crime offence who is requesting 
bail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government did not hesitate to amend the criminal code to 
modernize Canadian anti-drug legislation. It also enacted 
provisions so that persons found guilty of organized crime 
activities would not be entitled to any sort of accelerated 
parole review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1999, new offences under the criminal code connected to 
fraudulent telemarketing were created.  Canada's power to 
extradite fugitives and to address the problems relating to 
borderless crimes such as organized crime, fraudulent 
telemarketing and Internet fraud, was enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, the government enacted proceeds of crime legislation, 
which made it mandatory for financial institutions and middlemen 
to report suspicious transactions and cross-border currency 
movements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also created the Financial Transactions and Reports 
Analysis Centre of Canada to receive and administer the 
information provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, in February 2001, the Minister of Immigration 
introduced Bill C-11, the immigration and refugee protection act. 
This bill proposes fines of up to $1 million, and a maximum 
sentence of life imprisonment for people smuggling and 
trafficking in human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As can be seen, this government was not afraid to adopt measures 
to strengthen these laws, to strengthen the ability of existing 
agencies to fight organized crime.  In 1997, 13 joint integrated 
proceeds of crimes units were created.  In 1999, $115 million 
went to the RCMP to modernize the Canadian Police Information 
Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1999, the RCMP received $15 million to fight organized 
crime at the three major international airports: Montreal, 
Toronto and Vancouver.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again in 1999, we invested an additional $78 million in an 
anti-contraband initiative to provide resources to the RCMP, the 
federal Department of Justice and the Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency, to help these organizations target contraband and 
distribution networks at Canada's border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In budget 2000, an amount of $584 million was allocated to the 
RCMP, over a three year period. I should also point out that our 
government passed the Witness Protection Act in 1996. Under that 
legislation, a formal national program was set up to help 
protect people who risk their lives to help the police in its 
investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, the new measures announced yesterday by the 
Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General of Canada provide 
that an additional $200 million will be allocated to the fight 
against organized crime. The amendments to the criminal code are 
major ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing to create three new types of offences and 
impose harsh penalties on those who participate, in various 
degrees, in gang activities; to improve the protection of people 
in the judicial system against acts of intimidation against them 
and their families; to streamline the current definition of 
criminal organization; to expand the powers of those involved in 
law enforcement activities; to confiscate the proceeds of crime, 
particularly the profits of criminal organizations; and to seize 
the goods used to commit a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also proposing measures to establish an accountability 
process to protect law enforcement officers against any criminal 
liability when they take actions relating to an investigation or 
to undercover activities in a criminal organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, this government is taking on its responsibilities, and I 
am convinced that it will continue to do so whenever it 
identifies a need for new measures to prevent the type of crime 
mentioned in the official opposition's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the reasons why I will not support the opposition's 
motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt for his 
private member's motion, Motion No. 80, that would require the 
government to amend the criminal code to create a separate 
category of offences and punishments for people who wilfully 
disrupt electronic business in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some years back, when I was a member of the Calgary police force 
and computers were coming into their own, there was already ample 
evidence that people outside the mainstream of business were 
hacking into sensitive files and databases.  It was well known 
even then that hackers were plying their trade to enter into 
security files, sometimes within the police department or the 
Department of National Defence.  It became a form of espionage 
that was sometimes difficult to protect against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, of course, like the present, there was not a lot 
of legislation to help investigators compile data against those 
who committed such activities.  Without sufficient data it is 
difficult to prosecute hackers to the full extent of the law and 
thereby deter that kind of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hackers use all kinds of sophisticated means to be able to do 
what they do and protect themselves.  Police officers trying to 
solve the problem must first get around all the firewalls that 
hackers put up.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would enable police officers to become very 
effective at these types of investigations.  However that takes 
money. The federal government should recognize that because it is 
a global crime it can happen almost anywhere.  It takes money to 
compile enough evidence to knock hackers down to their knees and 
curtail their activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the legislation will include resources to effectively 
deal with the problem.  I am sure the member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt has thought about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired and 
the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on 
the order paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 1.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday, 
April 23, 2001, at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Orders 28 and 
24.
