	The House resumed from March 11 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-250, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act and 
the Canada Elections Act (confidence votes), be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak on this important private member's initiative. I 
congratulate the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster for 
bringing this bill forward. It is something the Reform Party has had 
as policy from its inception. We think it would lend more 
credibility to the electoral process. It is something Canadians 
would appreciate.
<P>
	Recent public opinion polls indicate that although it is very 
likely we are going to head into a federal election within a week or 
so, two-thirds of Canadians believe there is no need for the 
government to call an election. The government is not cooking the 
books, it is cooking the agenda to get the most favourable 
conditions for which to call an election.
<P>
	There is nothing unusual about that. Governments have been 
doing that for years. However, two-thirds of Canadians say it is 
unfortunate in a democracy such as ours for the government to wait 
until it feels it has enough things on the agenda to suddenly spring 
an election. We are all supposed to salute the flag, whether it is 
three years into the mandate or five. It gives the government a 
tremendous trump card going into an election.
<P>
	The agenda which was given to the media today indicates the 
following: Mr. Bouchard to meet with the Prime Minister to sign an 
agreement, photo op to follow; the Minister of Natural Resources 
to sign a research project, photo op to follow; an agreement will be 
signed  with provincial fisheries officials in British Columbia, 
photo op to follow. The whole agenda for this week is a photo op.
<P>
	The government is able to control the agenda not only for photo 
ops but for the electoral agenda. It is no longer a case of whether we 
need an election, whether it is timely or whether there is an issue on 
the front burner of the nation, it is whatever the government thinks 
it can do to better its re-election chances and that is when it will call 
an election.
<P>
	There is something wrong with that. People have to ask 
themselves what is going on in the country when the government 
can trigger a national election based on its needs. Would it not be 
better to level the playing field for all parties? Would it not be 
better to have the government go to the people during the fall of the 
fourth year of its mandate? Everyone would work off the same 
sheet. We would all sing the same chorus. We would not wait for a 
crisis to happen in a province or for the signing of an agreement to 
go to the people. The election would be called at a certain time. 
They could count on it. They could plan for it. That would be fair 
for everyone.
<P>
	When we were considering this bill in committee I raised two 
things which the government has done to give itself an advantage. 
One it already has, the ability to call the election. The other is to 
shorten the election period itself. We are now down to a 36 day 
electoral period. We will likely be heading into it next week.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	The government, by knowing when it will call an election, has 
all the advantages. It knows exactly when it will call the election 
and therefore it knows when to have its advertising geared up. It 
can have its media buys prearranged. Its members can have their 
offices open. They can have literature ordered. They can know it 
all.
<P>
	The back room boys over there have it all figured out. The rest of 
us just hope that we know what is going on. We think it will be next 
week. But money is spent, there is organization and all Canadians 
are wondering whether it will happen. That is too bad.
<P>
	It should be on a four year rotation. The member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster has detailed how that could be done, 
how it would be fair to all parties. This does not give an advantage 
to one side or the other. It is fair to the Canadian people. They do 
not have to wonder whether they will be put through this process. It 
is fair all around.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9962"> 9962 </A></B>
<P>
	That being said, this bill will not pass. I am sorry to break that 
news to the member for Kindersley-Lloydminister. This bill does 
not have a snowball's chance. It takes power out of the frontbench.
<P>
	Every time there is a chance of any of the power being removed 
from that frontbench, every time there is a chance for free votes, 
every time-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Word comes down from the top.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> That is right. Word comes down from the top that 
this bill must not pass. Every time there is a free vote, every time 
there is power given to committee, every time there is any chance 
that we can take a little power out of that little group of people 
sitting in the Langevin Building, it is nuked. There is not a chance 
that this bill will pass. I am sorry to break this to the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminister.
<P>
	That being said, it is likely we will head into an election next 
week. Will this be an election issue? Will this be something that 
gets carried on the stump, as we talk about the issues facing the 
Canadian electorate?
<P>
	This will not be the burning issue. However, this is symptomatic 
of two different visions of Canada when it comes to the role of 
Parliament and the role of members of Parliament representing 
their constituency.
<P>
	It will be a vision carried by the Liberal Party which is that the 
Liberal Party knows best. Not only does it not have to listen to the 
Canadian people, it does not even have to listen to its own 
members.
<P>
	The Liberal Party does not have to listen to people through 
referendums and free votes and representative democracy. What its 
members will tell Canadians is ``don't worry, be happy, we know 
best; the rest of you are cannon fodder in the great democratic 
process''. That will be an issue.
<P>
	When we get on the stump and when we get talking about 
electoral and parliamentary reform, when we talk about the need to 
change things in this institution to give power to members of 
Parliament to truly represent the people who sent them here, that 
will be an issue.
<P>
	We will be talking about recall. We will be talking about the 
right to referendums and citizens initiatives. We will be talking 
about free votes in the House of Commons, not just on private 
members bills but on bills in general.
<P>
	We will be talking about committee power and the way 
committees are manhandled right now by the ministers to do their 
bidding instead of truly giving an opportunity for members of 
Parliament to initiate legislation and to bring citizens concerns to 
the table.
<P>
	All those will be issues during the upcoming federal election. A 
fixed election date is part of Reform Party policy. Recent polling 
results say that people like that idea. They do not like what the 
Liberals are doing here, which is that they call it when they darn 
well feel like it,  the Canadian people can put up with it and pay for 
it and that is just the way it has to be.
<P>
	Although there is supposed to be a free vote, no doubt those 
members have been told on the Liberal side to vote against it. It is 
probably not going to pass, and that is too bad.
<P>
	All that being said, the Liberals should know that if they have the 
guts to call this election on Sunday, as we think, then let us have at 
her. This is a good enough issue to mix in with the others. We will 
see what the Canadian people really think about a government that 
lords it over the people instead of listening to them.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the intent of the bill we are debating at this time is to 
propose holding a general election every four years on a set date.
<P>
	A number of parliamentarians may be in agreement with this 
principle of setting a date on which there will be an election every 
four years. This has a lot of advantages, one of which is that all of 
the organizations can get their acts together, to be ready when an 
election is called.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister is the one who holds the power to 
decide when an election will be held, this gives his party a 
considerable advantage over the other parties, as far as the 
organizational aspect is concerned: fundraising, candidate 
selection, and how the business of Parliament will be conducted.
<P>
	If, for example, it were known that the election would be on a set 
date, the government could set itself a four-year program. The first 
year, it would pass such and such a portion of its electoral program, 
the second year another portion, and so on for the third and fourth 
years, and everyone would know we were headed for an election on 
a set date.
<P>
	We were elected in October 1993. Last year, around the same 
time, there was all sorts of speculation about an early election. 
Some people were even willing to bet that there would be an 
election last fall, so the organizations got themselves in gear and 
there were nominations left, right and centre. There we were, not 
even three years away from the last election, and already talking 
about an early election.
<P>
	To a certain extent, Parliament has been paralyzed for the past 
year, waiting for the day the Prime Minister calls an election. Once 
again, everything points to his making the announcement this 
Sunday, which means we will be going into an election nearly a 
year and half before the end of the mandate given to us by the 
people.
<P>
	What happens in such cases is that the government governs by 
survey. The government orders the polls, the polling firms conduct 
them, they conclude that the party is popular or not so popular, the 
public is losing interest,  one of the ministers is low in the polls in 
his own riding, the Prime Minister is, the Conservative Party is 
going up, the Reform Party is going down, and they are so busy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9963"> 9963 </A></B>
<P>
playing with all these cards that in the final instance they do not 
care about the public interest, only about the interests of the party 
in power.
<P>
	The government can use the polls to set a date when it is likely to 
be reelected, or in certain other cases, as we saw with the 
Conservative Party in its last term, it can delay calling an election 
until the very end, in this case because it knew its popularity was 
dropping considerably and it were obviously headed for a defeat.
<P>
	A fixed election date would help make public debates more 
transparent, more honest, better organized and at least we would 
know where we are going. It would be more democratic. The public 
would no longer have to cope with not knowing when the election 
would take place and it would not be in the position we are in now, 
when the government is accusing Mr. Bouchard of sending his 
request for a constitutional amendment at the last minute, although 
the government still has a year and a half to go.
<P>
	Calling this a last minute request is rather exaggerated. IfMr. Bouchard had known when the election would be called, he 
would not have bothered to send a request at this stage. He 
probably would have waited until after the election or he would 
have set his agenda with the election date in mind. Organizing the 
democratic system in Canada in this way would be better for all the 
provinces, as a matter of fact.
<P>
	One aspect is somewhat disturbing. We hear the Reform Party 
talking about referendums here and referendums there, about free 
votes and constituents voting by telephone or fax. This is a 
parliamentary system, a democratic system by delegation. We ask 
the public to elect us to represent them. Unless we change the very 
principle of the parliamentary system in Canada, we cannot accept 
all these fantastic proposals by the Reform Party, which wants to 
play poker by its own rules and not by the rules that suit everybody 
else.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	If a party is elected with a very clear promise that it will do 
something, the individual elected under the party banner 
necessarily endorses the party's objectives. So there is no reason 
for a decision in the House to be taken on the basis of faxes or 
phone calls received. It is taken along party lines.
<P>
	When we discuss bills that are not in our programs, we will 
obviously consult our constituents. We will, however, always be 
the ones who have to decide, since we are not obliged morally or 
otherwise to vote in agreement with the 40 or 50 members of our 
party we consulted or the 50 electors, who are not members of the 
party but were invited to a public meeting, or according to the three 
faxes we received. We represent all electors  once we are elected 
and we must use our wisdom and conscience as best we can and act 
in the best interest of the people in making a decision, because we 
were elected to represent them.
<P>
	There are, of course, a lot of details in the bill before us. It would 
be worthwhile to have a committee consider it, because it could 
look at some of the problems in greater detail.
<P>
	Personally, I find it difficult to agree with choosing the third 
Monday in October as a fixed election date, because winter comes 
early to many places, and the third Monday of October is surely a 
bad time for elections, particularly in Quebec where it would 
interfere with the campaign leading to the municipal elections, 
which are held on the first Sunday in November. Should the fixed 
date for federal elections be set in October, we would be in a 
difficult spot because we would be in a conflict of interest.
<P>
	The committee would have to take the time to look at what 
happens in each province, in order to come up with a suitable date. 
The idea of an election when the days get longer and warmer, 
around the time of the summer equinox, holds much greater 
interest. It is much easier to go from door to door when the weather 
is good than pick a date like October when the days are getting 
shorter, it is rainy, and there are maybe even snowstorms that 
would perhaps make things difficult.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Unless we are not here any more.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> If the Bloc is no 
longer here, then Canada can obviously do what it wants about its 
election dates. They can opt for the third Monday of October and 
that will not conflict with our municipal elections.
<P>
	Even if we are in favour of the bill in principle, there is another 
aspect that I definitely think should be looked at in committee and 
that is the problem of the ensuing byelections. Dates are also given 
for byelections.
<P>
	What would happen if there were a minority government and a 
government could not be formed? Giving authority to the governor 
general does not appeal to me at all. This is a position the Bloc 
Quebecois would prefer to see abolished, not one to which it wishes 
to give greater authority. There would certainly be many points to 
examine in this bill, although the principle is interesting for most of 
the population.
<P>
	Ultimately, in a democracy, it is much clearer if people know 
exactly what to expect, especially since this will now be much 
easier. We will have a permanent voters list. If there were a fixed 
date for elections, democracy would take on much greater meaning 
and would be better respected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9964"> 9964 </A></B>
<P>
	It would also prevent abuses and irregularities, questionable 
practices or allegations of such practices, which have sometimes 
been made against people who were abusing their authority.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	This did not happen just under the Conservatives; it also 
happened under the Liberals. It is interesting to note that the public 
is not fooled by these governments that hang on to power because, 
generally speaking, governments that have remained in office 
almost five years have usually been defeated in the following 
election.
<P>
	Another possible problem with a fixed date is what would 
happen if there were a non-confidence vote.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you have signalled to me that I must soon wrap up 
so, as I was saying, we are in agreement in principle, but the bill is 
worth considering seriously in committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to support Bill C-250 put forward by my colleague from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster. The bill proposes to have fixed 
election dates. For instance, this year the election date would be 
October 20 and elections thereafter would be held every four years 
on the third Monday of October.
<P>
	In his opening remarks the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster said: ``Along with the Reform Party's 
other proposals for democratic reform such as recall, referendums 
and citizens initiatives, we intend to show how Canada's political 
system can be made more accountable, representative and fair''. 
Those are three points in favour of fixed election dates: 
accountability, better representation and fairness.
<P>
	First, I will consider better representation. I very much believe in 
this bill. It is part of the Reform platform. When I campaigned in 
1993 I felt there was something wrong with our political system 
because at any given time, on the spur of the moment, behind 
closed doors the Prime Minister and a few of his selected 
strategists could secretly determine when an election would be 
held. That is a great disservice to the Canadian public. It denies the 
opportunity for a lot of potential candidates who would be willing 
to run, who would otherwise be willing to seek nomination and 
become involved in the political process.
<P>
	Some excuses used for not running are: inappropriate timing; an 
insufficient amount of time to prepare for entry into public life; 
insufficient time to raise money; insufficient time to become 
known in the community. These excuses would be eliminated with 
a fixed election date. This would affect the number of people who 
would consider running for election, including women. There is a 
big cry that there are not enough women in politics,  that the ratio is 
not 50:50, that there is a lack of balance between male and female 
representatives.
<P>
	This is the case because they cannot plan. If women knew there 
would be an election every four years on the third Monday of 
October, family planning could be a lot easier. Men and women 
could decide after an election that next time one of them would run. 
The quality and number of candidates who would step forward 
would greatly increase. There would be more respect for 
politicians.
<P>
	The accountability point was put forward by the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster. Politicians who were elected knowing 
that the duration of their terms would be four years would be more 
interested in and intent on carrying out the responsibilities of their 
portfolios, including representing their constituents. They would 
do the best jobs they could and would let their records speak for 
themselves. Then they would not have to rely on the prime minister 
of the day prior to an election to fast track certain bills in order to 
improve their visibility or their standing in the polls. They would 
not have to rely on the prime minister to hand out goodies in weak 
areas where they wanted to reinforce their strength.
<P>
	This bill and fixed election dates every four years would provide 
more stability in the political system. This factor of not knowing 
when an election will be called ends up causing more doubt and 
more debate about when is it going to be called. That causes more 
focus on elections than it does on the issues of the day.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I have been here for close to four years and I have not read too 
much about the debt that faces this country. I have not read too 
much about the rising interests costs to service that debt. All I have 
heard is that the interest rates are the lowest they have ever been 
and the government has done a wonderful job.
<P>
	The Canadian economy is not on as strong a footing as the 
finance minister and the Prime Minister would like us to believe. 
There is an underlying danger in that the real problem facing this 
country is not being addressed. I believe if we knew when an 
election would be called, all politicians would be more intent on 
identifying and solving the problems of the country instead of 
talking about those issues that make a party and the member as a 
representative more popular.
<P>
	I feel Canada is behind the times. We are one of the few nations 
that does not have a fixed election date. By having a fixed election 
date we plan for it. A party or a government can be better judged 
and evaluated on what its real intent and purpose is.
<P>
	We had an example this past week where the Liberal government 
closed more deals and did more in the space of 10 days that it had 
in the first three years. Even Premier Bouchard says the transfer of 
manpower training  to the province of Quebec is nothing more than 
a pre-election ploy. He is going to sign the agreement today. He 
goes on further to say that he has to sign it as a provincial premier 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9965"> 9965 </A></B>
<P>
because he has a responsibility to the unemployed of his province 
and he feels that this responsibility at his level will help more 
people get work. I agree with him on that.
<P>
	All provinces should be looking after manpower training, not the 
federal government. Why has it taken three and a half years to 
happen? Why has it been signed after no less than five days of 
political pressure?
<P>
	Another pre-election ploy is the anti-gang legislation for 
Quebec. I am not making this up. The Bloc members have pointed 
it out. The premier of Quebec has pointed it out.
<P>
	It is making a mockery and a joke out of our political system. 
The government of the day controls the agenda and gains an unfair 
advantage on an unsuspecting, trusting general public. If nothing 
else, Canadians generally trust their government. They expect their 
government to perform according to the platform that they get 
elected on.
<P>
	We were hugely disappointed by the two Tory governments. 
When these Liberal members were in opposition, when they were 
trying to seek the confidence of Canadians to govern, the Prime 
Minister on January 20, 1993 talking about Canadians said: ``They 
have had enough of the abuses of Parliament and the arrogance of 
government''.
<P>
	I would need another 30 minutes to talk about the abuses that this 
government, when it was in opposition, talked about. Now it is 
guilty of them as government. There has been the abuse of 
parliamentary committees, abuse of free votes, abuse of jobs, jobs, 
jobs, abuse of Pearson, abuse of Airbus, abuse of Somalia, abuse of 
Krever, abuse of devolution of powers, abuse of the GST, the 
broken promise of the GST, as well as broken promises of what it 
would do when it was elected. In a lot of cases it did exactly the 
opposite.
<P>
	I hope the Canadian public has had enough of this. I hope they 
start to reward honesty rather than misrepresentation. I hope that 
they give a reward to truth in politics rather than the perception of 
politics.
<P>
	This same man said that the Canadian public deserves good 
government. He talked about the abuses of Parliament, of which his 
government is even more guilty than the Conservatives, and the 
arrogance of government. Consider the arrogance of the Prime 
Minister who said: ``If you can't get a job, tough, move''. That is 
pretty arrogant.
<P>
	We should consider the arrogance of the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	Usually we are here for five years and somewhere in the fourth 
year the government starts to hand out its goodies for an election. It 
is only 3.5 years. I wonder what it is hiding. It is hiding something 
with Somalia. It is hiding something with Krever. It is hiding, 
hiding and hiding. It is hiding something with Pearson airport. It is 
hiding in everything it is doing. What is it hiding about the 
economy? What does it know that we do not know that it has to call 
an election in 3.5 years?
<P>
	This is the same Prime Minister who said: ``In politics 
perception is everything''. The government is trying to create the 
perception that everything is wonderful and that the Canadian 
public, when they go to vote, will stay asleep. Certainly the Reform 
Party candidates are going to say it. I am going to say it. I hope the 
Canadian public wakes up, demands more of their politicians, 
demands some honesty and truth in politics, rewards the people 
who have been telling the truth, rewards the people who have kept 
their promises and rewards those who vote in favour of fixed 
election dates every four years, which we will vote on today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak for a few minutes on the bill of my colleague from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster on fixed election dates.
<P>
	I did promise a constituent who takes an avid interest in this 
subject that I would bring up what he sees as a downside of fixed 
election dates and discuss that for a few moments.
<P>
	He argues that fixed election dates will cause a slowdown in the 
economy from six, nine to twelve months ahead of the election date 
because businesses and people who are making investment 
decisions will hold off making those decisions until they see the 
outcome of the election.
<P>
	He also feels that fixed election dates would not stop 
governments from playing politics because knowing when the 
election date would be it would save up its initiatives or its special 
plans until it was close to the election day so it would still be able 
to manipulate the agenda to suit its own interests.
<P>
	There seems to be some credibility to his arguments if you take a 
look at the New Zealand situation last October. A few years ago 
New Zealand introduced a law that the government must notify the 
electorate six months ahead of the election date. In New Zealand it 
is now known six months prior to an election when that date will 
be. During the six months leading up to the election the 
government is required to release the public accounts. Incidentally, 
standard accounting practice is used for that so someone can 
actually tell what the state of the economy is instead of the 
manipulated sort of figures that we tend to get here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9966"> 9966 </A></B>
<P>
	Because of all of that information coming out during that time 
an element of uncertainly develops. Quite clearly there was a 
slowdown in the New Zealand economy during that six month 
period. The number of jobs advertised dropped off, the amount 
of reinvestment dropped off and the dollar weakened slightly as 
well.
<P>
	It did pick up after the election. The economy was rejuvenated 
and suddenly the job situation picked up dramatically. Last week 
there were 22.5 pages of jobs advertised in just Auckland city alone 
in one of the local newspapers. Everything picked up again 
dramatically right after the election but the point the gentleman 
brought to my attention seems to have been played out in New 
Zealand.
<P>
	What we have to weigh, when looking at the overall situation, is 
whether the benefits of having a fixed election date outweigh any 
downside that might come from knowing that date in advance. My 
personal opinion is that they do because on balance certainty is 
always better for the economy than uncertainty. The New Zealand 
example may have been an aberration because the United States 
has fixed election dates. They know when things are going to 
happen and it does not seem from the evidence that I have that there 
is a major impact on the economy in slowdowns or speed-ups based 
on an fixed election date.
<P>
	Perhaps the experience that was brought to my attention by my 
constituent may have been an aberration. As people get used to a 
new system where they actually know the election date, over a 
period of time it will not be quite as important. When you look at 
the balance, the opposite side of actually knowing that date, giving 
the certainty to business that a decision will be made on a certain 
date and they can get on with their plans, I think we still have to go 
for that fixed election date.
<P>
	It also gives pressure groups and the electorate the opportunity to 
works toward that date with any projects that have to be completed, 
any political efforts or persuasions that need to be done.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	As promised, I have put my constituent's point of view to the 
House today. On balance, I would recommend to my colleagues 
that they vote for this bill because I think the overwhelming 
evidence in speeches before me has pointed that there would be a 
tremendous benefit for the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to begin with an aside. I want to thank my friend from Calgary 
Centre who will be leaving the House after this election. I also want 
to compliment him for bringing forward over the last several years 
many good ideas and for generally raising the level of debate in this 
place. I know that he will be extraordinarily successful back in the 
private sector just like he was before he came here.
<P>
	I speak in favour of Bill C-250 put forward by my friend from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster. I know my hon. friend would agree 
that the essence of this bill is accountability, as he pointed out in his 
press release. Accountability is so extraordinarily important today.
<P>
	One of the things I found a little bit alarming is when we saw a 
recent poll that listed where politicians stood in the eyes of the 
Canadian public relative to all the other occupations. At the top it 
had teachers, nurses, doctors and people like that. It then went 
down the list to business people. The clergy was very high on the 
list. Then came journalists. Farther down the list there were 
lawyers. Just above arms dealers were politicians. In a way it is 
kind of funny but it is very sad as well because politicians are 
supposed to be the cream of the crop and are supposed to represent 
the best qualities of the Canadian people. However, for many 
reasons the public has lost faith in politicians.
<P>
	I would argue that one of the big reasons for this is because so 
much power has been usurped into the hands of the government 
over the last many years. Now the public feels very sceptical when 
the Prime Minister and the government talk about letting the public 
have more say in issues.
<P>
	This bill is a chance for the government to redeem itself. Bill 
C-250 would allow the public to know exactly when elections are 
going to be held and it would take power away from the 
government. That is a very good thing.
<P>
	Last week I was back in Saskatchewan where my friend from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster is from. He will be running in a new 
riding called Saskatoon-Rosetown Biggar. I grew up in 
Rosetown. We were out in that area talking to various people. 
Whether one goes to Rosetown, Milden, Biggar, Perdue, Fiske, 
D'Arcy, McGee or wherever it is, the people are out there are 
extraordinarily concerned that they get good representation and 
that they have a way to hold the government accountable.
<P>
	My friend is a man of excellent character. He has tremendous 
qualities that he brings to this place. Unfortunately, for everybody 
here to some degree, all the good qualities that many members 
bring to this place are frustrated because the system simply does 
not allow for politicians to represent their constituents in each and 
every case. I will explain exactly what I mean.
<P>
	When we vote later today, it is supposed to be a free vote. I know 
many members accept that there are good points in this bill. It 
makes sense to have fixed election dates every four years for 
reasons that my friends have pointed out. It just makes common 
sense. Who wants to see the playing field tilted in favour of the 
government? That is contrary to most people's sense of fair play.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9967"> 9967 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians and most hon. members know that this bill makes a 
lot of sense but that will be frustrated later  today, I predict, when 
the government will instruct its members to vote against it. That is 
sad because the bill makes a tremendous amount of sense.
<P>
	It is ironic that on a bill that deals with something as important 
as accountability we will see the government members 
undoubtedly vote against. That is sad. Bill C-250 was very well 
thought out. If we look at what my friend from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster has put into the bill, we come to 
understand he has dealt with all the possible problems that could 
arise from having fixed election dates. He has dealt with the 
problem of minority governments and other concerns members 
have raised.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	It points to the desire to have politicians on all sides of the House 
more involved in determining what are good pieces of legislation. 
Private Members' Business should be a more important part of 
what we do in here. We have a lot of talented people in the House 
who bring good ideas to the floor. I point out that this concept is 
part of the Reform Party's policy. It has long believed in fixed 
election dates.
<P>
	The whole point of Private Members' Business is to gather the 
best ideas, no matter where they come from, even if they happen to 
come from my friend from rural Saskatchewan. I do not think that 
should stand in the way of bills becoming the law of the land. He 
brings a lot of good ideas to this place.
<P>
	It is very frustrating to see good ideas such as this one get to this 
point after a lot of work, only to be turned down because the 
government does not want to lose power. As my friend from Fraser 
Valley East said, that is what this is all about. The government is 
afraid to give up any bit of power.
<P>
	Power is a very funny thing. It is a fixed amount. There is only so 
much power to go around. When the government has a lot of it the 
rest of us have very little of it. That is precisely what we are trying 
to remedy to some degree with Bill C-250. It would take some of 
the power away from the government to set an election date that 
suits it based on when it thinks it can get re-elected.
<P>
	My friend from Calgary Centre made a very good point. He said 
we spend a lot of time studying strategy. There are columns written 
in the media about how the government will use the election date to 
help it win the election.
<P>
	I read a column in the <I>Atlantic Monthly</I> not too long ago by 
James Fallows who has made a study of how the media focuses on 
strategy. There are reams and reams of paper devoted to people 
trying to predict when the government will use its power to call an 
election to lever itself back into power. That is unfortunate. That 
strategy should not be the issue.
<P>
	We should be debating issues such as the debt of over $600 
billion. We should be debating the 37 tax increases  the government 
has brought in over the last three and a half years. We should be 
debating the fact that disposable income for the average family has 
fallen by over $3,000 since the Liberals came to power. Those are 
the issues that should be the subject of analysis in the media. I do 
not think that there should be long columns in the newspaper and or 
entire programs devoted to the strategy of government having the 
power to call an election when it chooses.
<P>
	I wrap up by saying that I support the bill. It puts power back into 
the hands of the Canadian people, a concept the Reform Party 
believes in very strongly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly agree this is a topic worth discussing. The member 
opposite who proposed the bill should be congratulated.
<P>
	I listened to the level of the debate. Some members are railing at 
a shadow they do not appreciate, known as the House of Commons. 
They are not looking at its historical perspective in the sense that 
parliament is an old institution that has evolved with time. Change 
is necessary and change occurs in parliament, but change does not 
always happen in the way or at the speed we want. In the thousand 
years parliament has existed change has in fact occurred.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On Clause 1
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Chairman, it is very 
important through this committee of the whole and through the 
questions we have prepared for the minister that we determine the 
constitutionality and the enforceability of this bill and whether this 
clause and the allied clause which it creates, that is criminal 
organization and criminal organization offence, are enforceable 
and not hollow pieces of legislation. I have some concerns about 
the wording of this section and perhaps the minister can respond.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The first clause refers to a criminal organization which means 
any group, association or body. But group, association or other 
body is not defined in the bill and I do not believe it is defined 
elsewhere in the Criminal Code. Could the minister please tell the 
committee what he meant by the terms group, association or other 
body in the bill? What did he mean when he placed these terms in 
the bill?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Chairman, we intended the dictionary 
definition of group, association or other body. We did not think it 
was necessary to define those terms. We intend them to have their 
ordinary meaning. We also added ``whether formally or informally 
organized'' so we would not need membership cards or a written 
constitution for a group or organization to meet this definition.
<P>
	We are aware from our dealings with the police and others that 
organized crime takes many forms in Canada. It is sometimes in 
the nature of what we refer to as biker  gangs. Sometimes it is far 
less visible, white collar crime or business crime. The conclusion 
to which we came based on the mischief we are aiming at through 
this legislation is that the words group, association or other body
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9969"> 9969 </A></B>
<P>
are sufficient to capture organized crime in the many forms in 
which it appears as long as the balance of the definition was 
satisfied as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Chairman, I 
agree with the minister that the definition is broad enough to 
encompass the groups he is targeting like the biker gangs which 
probably prompted this bill. How will the minister ensure this 
definition does not include other groups that are formally or 
informally organized? It is a pretty broad definition. How do we 
ensure that someone who likes to tip a brown at a biker club is not 
included with the bikers? He may be guilty by association, which is 
something I am sure the minister does not want to happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, this is a definition and does not create 
an offence. To meet the definition a group would have to be an 
organization which has as one of its primary activities the 
commission of an indictable offence punishable by at least five 
years in prison and whose members, any or all, have within the last 
five years engaged in the commission of a series of such offences.
<P>
	We are not talking about benign organizations. In the last few 
days I have heard the comment that this definition might sweep up 
well meaning groups like environmental groups or labour 
protesters who in order to make a point may break the law as an act 
of civil disobedience.
<P>
	The section with the definition does not create an offence. It 
simply defines the term criminal organization. It is a group, one of 
the primary purposes of which is to commit serious criminal 
offences and whose members, or some of them, have within the last 
five years done just that. We are not talking about a sewing club or 
an environmental group that pickets to protest the government's 
policies. We are talking about people who are dedicated to crime 
and who have formed a group for that purpose.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, I would like to know if the 
definition would include such groups as the FLQ.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Again it is difficult to know what one knows about 
the FLQ. If the FLQ or any other group meets the definition, it 
would be included. If there is a group which is dedicated to the 
commission of serious criminal offences and has as one of its 
primary purposes to do that and has members who have done that 
over the last five years, then it would be included in the definition.
<P>
	Do not forget that the definition does not create an offence; it is 
simply part of the framework that establishes access by the 
investigating police to certain techniques that might not otherwise 
be available. It  creates a framework in relation to penalties for 
those who are convicted of offences that were carried out to 
benefit, or under the direction of, such organizations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, what is meant by a primary activity 
as contained in clause (a): ``having as one of its primary activities 
the commission of an indictable offence''? What is a primary 
activity? How is it defined? What is meant by that term? It goes on 
to say: ``the commission of an indictable offence''. Does that mean 
that in order to have an organization declared a criminal 
organization there has to be indictable offences committed and 
convictions registered?
<P>
	Perhaps we could deal with this one question at a time. Could the 
minister tell the committee what he means by primary activity?
<P>
	We could then go back to the number five, where a criminal 
organization must constitute at least five people. Why was five 
chosen? What happens if one of them dies? Is the organization still 
classified as a criminal organization? If one of them goes to jail, 
what happens then? Why was the number five picked in this case? 
Perhaps if the minister could answer that question first, I will 
follow into clause 1(a) and the other questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Those are good questions.
<P>
	I will deal with the number five first. When we were preparing 
the legislation, and indeed over the period of time when we were 
looking at the scourge of organized crime and trying to determine 
the best course for dealing with it, we looked at statutes in other 
parts of the world. Some of them were of no help because they were 
in countries with different constitutional traditions and they had 
approaches that would clearly not be appropriate for Canada.
<P>
	In some American jurisdictions, we found some helpful 
precedents. When it came to defining what a criminal organization 
or what a criminal gang was, they almost invariably used a number, 
sometimes three and sometimes five. We inquired into it and 
concluded that the reason is that you have to start somewhere and 
pick a number.
<P>
	At the end of the day there is an element of arbitrariness. It could 
have been three, it could have been five. At one time I was looking 
at the prospect of two or more. The concern with two or more is 
that it could be a husband and wife team who are engaged in a 
crime spree and might be considered a gang. That was not really 
intended.
<P>
	We came to five as a reasonable accommodation in that we 
wanted to have a sufficient number so that there was a group, not so 
small that it could be a couple or a couple with a friend, but not so 
large in number that we were going to end up with groups creating 
subgroups in order to escape the definition. The number five is 
intended to reflect our policy objective of capturing linkages 
among people, more than just a couple of  friends, so that there is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9970"> 9970 </A></B>
<P>
critical mass for a group but not so many that it becomes 
impractical to enforce.
<P>
	The second question my friend asked had to do with primary 
activities. Again we did not define that term. We would be happy 
with the dictionary definition.
<P>
	We expect that a court is going to require a prosecuting crown to 
establish on the evidence that one of the primary activities of a 
particular group was to engage in serious criminal offences and that 
is not going to be easy. The crown attorney is going to have to 
produce evidence of past criminal conduct, statements or 
circumstances which would lead the court to conclude that in the 
common sense definition of the term, one of the real reasons for the 
group, one of its fundamental purposes, one of its chief 
preoccupations and one of its reasons for being is to commit 
serious criminal offences.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	For example, members of a motorcycle gang might say that their 
purpose is to ride motorcycles and engage in discussions about the 
size and performance capabilities of their motorcycles. That is one 
primary activity. However on the evidence the judge would be 
invited to conclude that another of their primary activities was the 
commission of offences because of what they had been doing and 
what had been brought before the court. In each case it will be for 
the court to conclude on the evidence on a common sense test that it 
was one of their primary purposes.
<P>
	The third question put to me by the hon. member has to do with 
whether one needs to formally establish a fact of conviction in 
order to satisfy the constituent elements of the definition, that is to 
say that in the preceding five years any or all of the members have 
engaged in the commission of a series of such offences. We used 
the term commission of offences rather than referring to conviction 
so that it would not be necessary to file a formal certificate of 
conviction.
<P>
	It will be open to the prosecuting crown in each case where an 
effort is made to come within the definition to prove on evidence 
that there was the commission of such offences. That will not be 
easy either. The crown is going to have to establish to the 
satisfaction of the court, and because it is criminal offences we are 
talking about, on evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that indeed 
these people did engage in the commission of such serious offences 
during the relevant period. It is not an easy definition to meet.
<P>
	That is why I have a degree of confidence in responding to 
people who express the concerns: Are you not casting the net too 
wide? Are you not going to catch up in this well intended 
legislation those who are not so bad and those who you never 
intended to catch but who might be committing acts of civil 
disobedience? I do not think so.
<P>
	What we are creating here is a significant hurdle for the 
prosecuting crown in that exceptional case where we are dealing 
with organized crime and we have to prove on the evidence the 
elements of primary purpose, the element of numbers-five-and 
that on the evidence to the criminal standard of proof, they have 
engaged in the commission of a series of serious criminal offences.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister has not answered the 
question about an organization and the consistency of a group of 
five. What happens if one of the group can no longer be termed 
within that definition and there are only four? That four then loses 
that definition. Does this not encourage organized criminals to 
break down into cells of four, cells of less than five and continue to 
carry on their nefarious activities?
<P>
	We are concerned that we have not had witnesses to debate both 
sides of this issue and exhaust any flaws that they might see within 
the bill. Would the justice minister give us an example of how a 
criminal organization would be determined? What is the process? 
Do we wait until someone is arrested for a criminal offence or 
convicted of a criminal offence and then build the other four people 
around that individual? How is that done? Once that organization, 
whether it is Hell's Angels or some other organization, is deemed 
to be a criminal organization, is it or any group of five deemed to 
be a criminal organization forever?
<P>
	I would like the justice minister to address these very significant 
aspects of concern. It is from the viewpoint of whether or not this 
particular definition is enforceable or applicable. It is so nebulous 
that we may have difficulty ever having the courts determine that 
an organization is a criminal organization.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> This is an unusual procedure and the member 
may wish to look at Standing Orders 100, 101, 102 and 103 which 
deal with amendments in committee of the whole.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, what must be remembered is that the 
objective is not to deal with groups on the margin who may have 
three or four people committing crimes. The objective is to get 
tools into the hands of the police so they can gather evidence in 
relation to organizations that pose a serious risk to the safety of the 
community and that are engaged on a systematic basis in the 
commission of serious offences throughout the country.
<P>
	The hon. member asked me about groups subdividing into cells 
of four in order to escape the strict terms of the definition. In my 
view if any such thing happened, the court could and would simply 
look beyond the artificial subdivision to the existence of the larger 
group on the facts and would not permit such a ruse or artifice to 
interfere with the enforcement of this law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9971"> 9971 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, just because a given biker gang which is 
internationally known and internationally active creates subgroups 
of four members each and gives them a different name would not 
protect them from this law. The court would be able to look at 
evidence of the reality behind the artifice and would be able to 
conclude that the group or association was broader than just the 
four members and would apply the law as such.
<P>
	Let me get to the hon. member's broader question which has to 
do with how this law works. This law works in two fundamental 
ways.
<P>
	First of all, for the first time it establishes a formal framework 
which defines organized crime. That framework provides access by 
the police, if they are investigating such a phenomenon, to 
investigative tools which would not ordinarily be available: 
wiretaps with a different standard; extensions of wiretaps which 
would otherwise not be available; prolonging the period after 
which notice of a wiretap has to be given, which in other cases 
would have to be given sooner. Access to income tax information is 
another investigative technique or tool which would not otherwise 
be available to the police.
<P>
	That is the first thing it does. It establishes a new category of 
organized crime. If the police are investigating it, they can do 
things they would not be able to do if they were investigating other 
kinds of crime.
<P>
	The second thing this legislation does is it establishes different 
consequences for organized crime as opposed to other kinds of 
crime. Penalties are more severe. If a person commits the same 
crime but does it in association with, for the benefit of, or at the 
direction of organized crime, then the consequences will be more 
significant than they otherwise would be.
<P>
	The proceeds of crime legislation will apply to the crime. 
Beyond that, the court can not only seize the proceeds of the crime, 
it can also seize the instruments used to commit it. If a truck is used 
to drive explosives from point A to point B to plant them for the 
gang, the truck can be seized if the evidence shows it was an 
instrument used in the commission of the crime.
<P>
	Those are the two fundamental things in the bill. There are 
others. The first is that it establishes something called organized 
crime. For the first time in our Criminal Code it creates that 
category. It provides for special tools for the police when they 
investigate this category of crime which is very, very difficult to 
do. There are also special consequences including harsher penalties 
and application for the proceeds and instruments to be seized. 
Those are the two items.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	There is another element my friend asked about which I would 
like to speak to briefly. He asked how we prove it or how it works. 
For example, if police forces thought they were investigating a 
gang and wanted to have access to these provisions, and say, for 
example, they were  applying to the electronic surveillance board 
or wiretap board and wanted to be relieved of the obligation of 
proving it was a last resort as we proposed they should be able to, 
they would have to show reasonable grounds to believe that what 
they were investigating was an organized crime offence, that a 
criminal organization was involved and that these sections should 
pertain to that investigation. They would have to do that on proof. 
They would need to have evidence before the court to satisfy the 
reasonable grounds test and they would get the warrant under those 
circumstances.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, if in order to avoid being 
designated a criminal organization groups did break down into 
four, the onus of proof would still remain to connect the groups. 
The onus of proof as contained in this section is still there and is 
still in force. The onus upon the crown would be just as onerous or 
difficult.
<P>
	With respect, my question has not been answered. I do not know 
what we do when we drop one of the five and it is now four. What 
happens to that designation?
<P>
	Perhaps I could ask a straightforward question. How long does 
the designation of criminal organization rest upon an organization?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, I should have said this earlier. I heard 
my friend last time talk about a declaration in relation to a criminal 
organization. Although he now uses the word designation, may I 
say that neither applies.
<P>
	We are not saying: ``Judge, here is the Allan Rock group. Would 
you please declare it a criminal organization so that from now on 
any time we are investigating the Allan Rock group we can have 
access to these tools and penalties''. I do not want to hear my friend 
tender evidence that there is such a group, because I would claim 
that my privileges were being abused.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is right behind you, Allan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> There is my Allan Rock group. It is not a declaration 
or a designation. It is a question of fact in each case. If there were 
only four members the act would not apply. If the group artificially 
subdivided to make it only four, as I said earlier I think the court 
would look past that artifice. If there really are only three or four 
people committing crimes, we have made the choice of five; it 
would not apply.
<P>
	It is not as though we will ask the court to declare a certain group 
criminal and it is criminal for five or ten years thereafter. Every 
time someone brings an application for a search warrant, every 
time someone alleges the participation in a criminal organization, it 
will be necessary to prove afresh that there is a criminal 
organization involved. That depends on evidence. As a practical 
matter it may get easier the third, fourth or fifth time because the 
court will be able to look at evidence amassed on the earlier 
proceedings. Nonetheless, it will be a question of fact in each case 
for the court 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9972"> 9972 </A></B>
<P>
to be  satisfied that we are dealing with a criminal organization. 
Then the consequences would flow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, we have not gone further than 
subsections 1(a) and 1(b). I understand the whole thing is in clause 
1, right down to clause 2. We are dealing with not only what we 
touched upon but the criminal organization offence and the offence 
related to property.
<P>
	To what extent has the department gone outside to get advice and 
consultation regarding the constitutionality of what we have 
addressed so far, which is the criminal organization in subsections 
1(a) and 1(b)?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, careful consideration has been given 
within the department to the constitutionality of the bill and each of 
its elements. It is difficult to answer about the constitutionality of 
subsection 1(a) because it is part of the whole.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I am able to tell the hon. member that we looked very carefully at 
the constitutionality of Bill C-95, those sections which create 
offences and those sections which modify existing sections of the 
Criminal Code. We are satisfied it is constitutional as being 
consistent with the charter. That results from careful assessment of 
all elements of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, to what extent were crown 
prosecutors and defence counsels beyond the justice department 
consulted as to the viability of the bill in their opinion?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> To a considerable extent. The process that resulted in 
the bill started in February 1996. At that time the solicitor general 
and I began looking at different available approaches to help the 
police investigating organized crime.
<P>
	We conducted a seminar with police forces from across the 
country in February 1996 and received an extensive factual 
briefing about the nature and extent of organized crime in Canada, 
including biker gangs but not just biker gangs.
<P>
	Through the period last summer and into the fall we in the 
department looked at possible approaches through legislation. In 
September of last year we had a national forum on organized crime 
to which we invited defence counsels, crown prosecutors, 
criminologists, business people, experts from the RCMP and 
representatives from other countries. Alan Borovoy was kind 
enough to come the conference as well.
<P>
	We canvassed a wide range of people including civil libertarians. 
We canvassed a wide range of approaches trying to identify just 
what mischief we were after and how best within the Constitution 
to tackle it. That in turn gave rise to specific recommendations. 
Further work was done in the department over the winter.
<P>
	When the government of the province of Quebec asked us in 
March for legislation to help with the biker gang problem in 
Quebec, that request accelerated work already under way. Indeed it 
had been under way for some extended period.
<P>
	Since March we have had further discussions with 
representatives of various viewpoints in the criminal justice 
system. We took the concepts in Bill C-95, sat down and discussed 
approaches with defence lawyers, crown prosecutors, police 
officers, police chiefs, provincial attorneys general, provincial 
solicitors general and ministers of public security.
<P>
	We were alerted to some concerns. We went to the Canadian Bar 
Association and to le Barreau du Québec. Sometimes we made 
changes or adjustments in the legislation because of what we were 
hearing. All the while we were conducting our own assessment of 
its constitutionality.
<P>
	Is it possible to have further study? Of course. It is always 
possible to have further study. We do not have a monopoly on 
wisdom or on knowledge. I am sure the hon. member will bring to 
our attention today some useful insights with respect to the bill.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member and committee of the whole that we 
have done a pretty thorough job in going to stakeholders in the 
criminal justice system to look at the bill through their eyes to 
anticipate objections and concerns that might be expressed. We 
have made changes to adjust to their concerns in some cases. Based 
on that overall survey we were satisfied it was good policy and 
good law and therefore we put it before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> I am looking for information concerning any 
objection or concern raised about either the constitutionality of the 
sections we have dealt with or the enforceability of them. I am 
primarily concerned about both issues, but enforceability is very 
important to me.
<P>
	Bill C-27 deals with child sex tours. Renowned legal minds tell 
us that although it looks good and it sounds good it is practically 
unenforceable.
<P>
	What objections, if any, did the justice minister receive with 
regard to concern over the constitutionality and the enforceability 
of what we have covered so far?
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, I do not know that concerns were 
exactly expressed about the sections we have looked at so far. 
Certainly concerns were expressed about the overall bill. It is not 
hard to find those.
<P>
	Alan Borovoy, for whose views I have the highest regard, 
expressed concern about whether the bill is over broad, whether the 
definitions of criminal organization are too sweeping so that we 
will catch in our net those who should not be there and do not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9973"> 9973 </A></B>
<P>
deserve to be called a criminal organization. I have answered that 
to some extent in my answers to the hon. member's questions. By  
the way, we took respectfully into account the views of Alan 
Borovoy and others who were concerned about over breadth.
<P>
	For example, in one of the many drafts we added five-year 
minimum penalties for the indictable offences included in the 
definition of a criminal organization. We are elevating the 
seriousness of the crime, a series of which they have engaged in, by 
stipulating it is only crimes punishable by the maximum five years 
in prison that will qualify for the definition. We are getting past the 
trivial to the more serious kinds of crimes.
<P>
	Speaking more directly to the hon. member's question about 
enforceability and whether it will be of practical benefit, police 
forces were very directly involved in the process I have described 
since February 1996. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police 
gave us its written proposal on what it thinks we ought to do about 
organized crime in Canada. We looked at it carefully. We 
concluded that at least in its present form it is not constitutionally 
valid, and we told the association that. We said we would keep 
working on it and that we regard Bill C-95 as the beginning of a 
process, not the end.
<P>
	We will keep working on it. We also told police forces what we 
thought we could do in the short term based on the research done 
over the last several years, especially in the last 18-month effort. 
We sat down with them with these proposals. Last week the House 
could see for itself the degree and nature of support in the police 
community. It was very strong. Chiefs of police believe they will 
be able to use these tools.
<P>
	The vice-president of the National Association of Chiefs of 
Police, Jacques Duchesneau, is the director of the police services in 
Montreal. He was closely involved in the development of the 
proposals. We gave him an outline of the proposals. He responded 
with his ideas. We had a dialogue. Last week he welcomed them as 
a very good start in terms of helping police forces with practical 
tools in their difficult task of tackling organized crime.
<P>
	If we ask the experts, the actual police chiefs in the field, that is 
where we get the best evidence on the question of whether the 
proposals are useful and effective. I am able to report the police 
community has been strongly supportive of the proposals and 
believe they will be of value.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, did the police chiefs indicate they 
would support reducing the number from five to perhaps three?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, I do not recall that having been a 
matter of discussion. We looked at the possibility of three. The 
California statute refers to three. If the hon. member feels strongly 
about it I would be happy to have his views.
<P>
	It will not make or break the bill. If the hon. member thinks it 
would be an advantage to say three, I find it difficult to argue 
strongly against him. Picking the larger  number of five signals to 
my mind more clearly what we are after, the larger group starting to 
become a network. If the hon. member has strong views about it I 
would be happy to hear him and his rationale.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the member wish to make an amendment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Not unless it will be supported by the government. 
I would be prepared if there were support. We do not have the 
testimony of the witnesses. We can only go on what the minister is 
able to recall in terms of consultation.
<P>
	I am concerned about the enforceability of the section. If it 
would make it more practical in terms of enforcement to reduce the 
number to three, I would be prepared to make the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> The member is asking the minister if the 
government would support the amendment.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, yes. To the extent there has been 
public comment on these proposals, my impression is that some 
have been saying it should be more than five, not fewer than five. 
There may be witnesses before the other place when the bill gets 
there who will say that we should be increasing the number and not 
decreasing it.
<P>
	At least for the moment I would like to reserve our position. 
Perhaps we can come back to this issue after we have had a longer 
time to think about it and I have a chance to speak to my officials 
about it.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. member finished asking questions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Yes, Mr. Chairman. Inasmuch as this section is not 
unlike the conspiracy laws that are on the books, I would be 
prepared to move an amendment to reduce the number from five to 
three.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Would the member be kind enough to provide 
that amendment in handwritten form?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, once we move beyond this can we 
come back to these various sections to make amendments?
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> If the clause is approved as it is then it is too 
late to make an amendment. However, if the member wishes to 
make an amendment it can be debated and then voted on or perhaps 
there will be unanimity on the amendment.
<P>
	We can defer clause 1 if that is the wish of both sides.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, then I will not make that 
amendment at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Chairman, I have 
some questions for the minister. I have been listening to try to not 
cover the same ground the hon. member for Crowfoot has covered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9974"> 9974 </A></B>
<P>
	I am concerned about a number of issues. It is from that 
perspective that I approach this legislation. I am concerned, as the 
minister is, about the impact of this legislation on law-abiding 
groups. I am also concerned about the importance of us passing 
a law recognizing there is an immediate problem in the province 
of Quebec with this issue. It is a serious issue. The police are 
asking for more powers to deal with group criminal activity.
<P>
	I still feel that if it goes too fast, if a bad law is passed, it will be 
worse than no law. I have heard the minister say this on occasion, 
especially with reference to the victims bill of rights when 
answering the hon. member for Fraser Valley West. The minister 
explained why he would not proceed forward with that issue. There 
is that point of view.
<P>
	The minister would like to avoid legislation that would allow for 
the following situation: Somebody from one of these groups 
commits a crime, the case goes before the courts and then either the 
person gets off scot-free on a technicality or the supreme court 
nullifies the court decision in six months or so. Time spent now is 
time well spent versus wasting taxpayers' dollars and a horrendous 
and embarrassing situation before a court somewhere down the 
road after this law goes through.
<P>
	Starting with clause 1, the major issue the minister and the 
justice department want to cover is the definition of a criminal 
organization. That is a huge starting point. Personally I feel the 
definition is too restrictive and will avoid capturing those groups 
that sometimes tend to start criminal activities and then grow to 
huge numbers.
<P>
	The minister may be addressing the problem from the wrong 
point of view. If we argue for larger numbers, by that time the 
groups have already committed a lot of crimes. It might be better to 
look at it from the point of view of the smaller number with the 
knowledge that a group has the intent to commit criminal activities. 
The group is associated for that purpose. I have no problem with 
the word association in this first definition.
<P>
	I have a problem with the term group. I know that group means 
three or more. The minister said today in testimony to the member 
for Crowfoot that it is the ordinary meaning. The ordinary meaning 
of group is three or more, not five or more. If a group of four or 
more commits a crime this law does not apply. Therefore, the 
surveillance, the wiretapping and the income tax investigation 
cannot be done. That is restrictive if the purpose is to nip things in 
the bud.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	I am submitting this argument for consideration for the 
amendment that may come later from the member for Crowfoot. 
He talked about lowering the number to three. I would argue and 
support three.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Would it be agreeable to defer clause 1 until 
later on?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> I think we may want to defer the amendments on 
clause 1 but there is further debate from several others here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I have a comment and about three or four questions. I 
wanted to build the framework of where I am coming from, much 
like the minister has in his response so that we better understand 
what he is trying to do. I think that is important. I do not mean to be 
wordy like a normal politician is. I am trying to do my job 
effectively here. However, I happen to be a wordy individual so 
please bear with me.
<P>
	First, that is my argument, rationale and reasoning to possibly 
look at lowering the number because if the minister says ``ordinary 
meaning,'' a group means three or more. In light of that and 
because the minister was a lawyer and worked in the courts, is there 
any previous precedent that would contradict any of those three 
words that he uses in his definition and that would exclude his five 
or more? That is one assurance I would like to have.
<P>
	Second, in terms of the impact on law-abiding groups, about the 
Rock biker gang to which he symbolically referred, are we 
prejudging? Will this law prejudge the Hell's Angels and Rock 
Machine as criminal organizations de facto when this bill is 
passed? Are there people already known to the government and the 
police who have committed criminal acts punishable by five years 
or less within that group presently? If so, why have not one of the 
over 800 sections in the Criminal Code that are there to help police 
officers in the performance of their duties been used to put these 
people before the courts to try them for the acts that their group has 
done?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> First, Mr. Chairman, I full agree with the hon. 
member, this is time well spent. I am very happy to have this 
interchange with hon. members about this bill.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to a problem in Quebec as having 
inspired the bill. While the issue takes centre stage in Quebec 
because of the open warfare between certain gangs there now, it is a 
problem throughout Canada that we are addressing. I spoke with 
the chief of police in Vancouver in the course of consulting when 
we were drafting the bill and he was telling me about the problems 
in Vancouver with gangs and organized crime. Indeed, a serious 
criminal offence had been charged that very week involving a 
member of a biker gang in Vancouver.
<P>
	I have spoken with attorneys general in Manitoba and Ontario, to 
the chiefs of police in Halifax, Toronto and Ottawa who have all 
told me the same thing. This is not just a Quebec issue. It so 
happens that the most spectacular aspects of the problem are 
evident there now with the bombs that have gone off and the lives 
that have been lost. However, we are dealing with a pan-Canadian 
issue, not just Quebec.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. member have any further 
questions?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9975"> 9975 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Chairman, the minister did not answer the two 
questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> I will answer those questions now. I should not pause. 
I should just keep talking straight through and not look as though I 
am going to stop.
<P>
	There are two questions to answer in particular, the first one 
about lowering it to three. I am not aware of any court decisions 
that would bind us about the definitions of groups, organizations or 
associations. As I said earlier, we are happy to consider lowering it 
to three. Even as we speak there are people out there watching this 
and people in the justice department who are intensively examining 
the proposals that are being made to see if there are any other 
things we should say so we can add to this discussion. Before this 
process is over we will have a position for you on your suggestion 
that we lower it to three.
<P>
	In your second question you asked us about the impact on 
law-abiding groups. I say that if there is a group out there that has 
as one of its primary activities the commission of indictable 
offences for which imprisonment of five years or more is provided 
in the code and which has as members people who have engaged 
over the last five years in the commission of a series of such 
offences, then they are not law-abiding groups and, by definition, 
law-abiding groups are excluded from the application of that 
section.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	My friend also asks if we will prejudge certain organizations or 
gangs, the so-called clubs. No, we will not. The very thing that the 
attorney general of Quebec asked me for I simply could not give, 
which is to say that membership alone in a certain group called X is 
an offence and that there be a schedule to the act with the names of 
the groups on it which indicate that those people are all criminals 
and, therefore, they lose certain rights and we can do certain things. 
We said that we will not do that. We cannot do that.
<P>
	Instead, we said that we would talk concepts instead of people. 
We will talk about teams and ideas instead of the names of groups. 
We will give a description in the criminal law. If there is a group 
which has as one of its primary purposes the commission of serious 
crimes and if that group has a membership which has engaged in 
the last five years in a series of serious crimes, that is a criminal 
organization. That does not create an offence, it just describes what 
a criminal organization is.
<P>
	We then went on to say that if a person commits a crime to 
benefit a criminal organization, that is more serious than it would 
otherwise be because this is a particular mischief we are trying to 
root out of our society.
<P>
	That is not to say that particular groups are automatically 
deemed to be criminal when we pass this bill. The reality is that the 
crown attorney will have to  tender evidence in each case: that this 
person is doing this for the benefit of a criminal organization, that 
gang X is a criminal organization because it is borne out in the 
facts. The court will have to be persuaded that they fall within the 
definition.
<P>
	The last question my friend asked was why is it that the 800-odd 
sections in the very thick and complete Criminal Code have not 
succeeded to date in achieving all of this?
<P>
	Organized crime, as I have learned from the police, presents a 
unique challenge in investigation. The police techniques typically 
are that an informer is sent inside, an officer is sent in under cover 
or they try to persuade someone in the organization to turn and 
become their informer. Also they solicit bits of information from 
people who are prepared to talk. In organized crime, particularly 
some of the groups which are active in Canada today, the police 
cannot infiltrate because the groups require that in order to become 
a member or be admitted to the inner circle that person has to 
commit a serious crime to qualify. It is an initiation. Police cannot 
do that.
<P>
	Second, those who are inside, who police sometimes try to turn 
to become informers, realize they will face the death penalty if they 
are caught. That is a serious disincentive to providing information 
to the police. Similarly, there is an element of intimidation of those 
who might otherwise give information.
<P>
	The fact is that the police find it exceedingly difficult to 
investigate these groups based on the powers in the code. That is 
why the police have been asking for the kind of tools that are 
contained in this bill, which we believe will make a difference in 
these exceptional cases.
<P>
	I hope that responds to the questions which my friend asked.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Chairman, the minister did address the questions 
I asked.
<P>
	It is like I am acting as a director of a huge public corporation, 
the Government of Canada and, with due diligence, I am making 
sure as a director that the right questions are asked. I think that is 
what we are all trying to do here.
<P>
	The minister said that this is not specifically Quebec related. We 
all know that the leader of the Bloc Quebecois and the justice critic 
for that party have been asking questions on this issue since 1995. 
March 1995 was the first time a question was asked in the House of 
Commons on this issue. At that time the minister indicated that the 
code had enough tools, as he has done until recently. A political 
perception might be that this is being rushed through for a 
pre-election purpose to build up and shore up popularity in a 
province in which the Prime Minister may or may not have the 
proper poll numbers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9976"> 9976 </A></B>
<P>
	I did not create those stories. I did not allege those charges. 
They are very well documented in all the press and media. That 
has made me very concerned that we not rush this legislation 
through in such a way that we do not show the Canadian public 
that we are trying to provide good governance. It is the Minister 
of Justice and his department which has that responsibility. I make 
an analogy to the victims bill of rights where the argument used 
was not to proceed. That addresses the answer. I just wanted to 
make a comment on the minister saying it was pan-Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	With respect to criminal organizations consisting of five or more 
or three or more, they will not declare in writing their intent. It is 
like gun control. I hate to touch on it, but criminals who need 
handguns, rifles or shotguns for the purposes of committing crimes 
will not register them because it would lead to a quicker trail to 
them. They will get one illegally and commit the crime anyway. 
We will see if gun control will reduce crime. We will also see if this 
definition of criminal organization will reduce warring activities 
across the country.
<P>
	With this preamble and setting the stage, if we now define 
criminal organization which up until now has not been defined in 
the Criminal Code, what different powers will it give police 
officers that they do not have now under the 800 sections?
<P>
	As I understand the law, if they suspect somebody of committing 
a crime or they suspect somebody of being guilty of something, if 
there is suspicion and sufficient evidence, police officers can 
obtain warrants. Search and seizure are available. Surveillance is 
available. Wiretapping with a judge's permission is available, as is 
requesting tax records of somebody who has committed income tax 
fraud. I am the revenue critic. I know how heavy, hard and strong 
tax avoidance audit groups work. They do a darned good job. I 
know the powers they have.
<P>
	Now we are defining criminal organizations. Will it give police 
forces that much more power when they already have the same 
powers on an individual basis?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> I believe so but, more important, the police believe 
so.
<P>
	It is helpful to have the advice of those who are actually in the 
field. It certainly was on gun control. We had the support of the 
chiefs of police and the Canadian Police Association. They 
believed it would make a difference in terms of community safety. 
I know the hon. member voted for Bill C-68. He must have come to 
that conclusion. I know how carefully he thinks through positions 
before taking them.
<P>
	The member referred to this being our opportunity for due 
diligence. I do not want him to think for a moment that I do not 
welcome the opportunity to discuss these features of Bill C-95 with 
my colleagues. I welcome the chance to have their views. As I said 
earlier, I am sure we  will learn from the incite they bring to the 
process. We need this kind of examination and I welcome it.
<P>
	What will the bill give police forces that they do not already 
have under the existing Criminal Code? Why do they think it will 
be important to them in their fight against organized crime?
<P>
	At the moment if police officers want to get a wiretap they have 
to prove a number of things to a judge first. Among those they have 
to prove on evidence that every other kind of investigative 
technique either has been tried and failed or if it was tried would 
fail because of the nature of the investigation. That takes police 
officers to the point of having to swear an affidavit or other form of 
particulars of what has already been done, go through the list of 
alternative methods and satisfy the court on evidence that it is a last 
resort in the investigation of a certain crime.
<P>
	The bill would remove that burden. It would simplify the process 
of getting a wiretap if the police officer is investigating criminal 
organization offences. Similarly with warrants. Returning to 
wiretaps, it would relieve police officers of a paper burden. We are 
not saying we should allow free access to intrusive methods 
because it is administratively difficult for police. We are saying we 
should make that change because when investigating organized 
crime it is almost always obvious that it is a last resort for the 
reasons I have already given. It is very difficult to investigate.
<P>
	We are taking a burden from the police which we think is undue 
in the circumstances of offences of this kind. Some say if it is all so 
easy to establish they can establish it to the satisfaction of the judge 
and nothing is lost. We are trying to recognize the unique character 
of these offences in the way investigative tools are available to 
police officers. If we have the courage to conclude on the facts that 
it is almost always the last resort, then let us say it in the criminal 
law and not have the police go through the empty process of 
establishing it. It sends a signal as well.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, police officers have told me that they get wiretaps 
and the day after they start the paperwork to prepare for the renewal 
because they only get it for 60 days. They tell me that in the context 
of an organized crime offence it is absurd because those 
investigations take an exceptional period of time. They have to put 
together bits and pieces of conversations and relate them to other 
information. It is a very complex process. They almost always need 
the wiretap for longer than 60 days.
<P>
	In the bill we are permitting the court to provide the wiretap for 
an extended period so that the police will be using their resources 
investigating crime rather than busily working at paperwork for the 
extension application.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9977"> 9977 </A></B>
<P>
	Similarly notice of the wiretap has to be given after the wiretap 
is finished to people wiretapped so that they know it and can take 
proceedings. We have extended the period during which they can 
give notice in these cases because some of the investigations go 
on for an exceptional period of time.
<P>
	At the moment there is a very narrow category of offences for 
which access to income tax information can be gained. That is as it 
should be. Income tax is filed on an undertaking with the Canadian 
people. It is implicit the information be kept absolutely 
confidential by Revenue Canada. We do permit it at the moment for 
a very few offences. Officials will know the sections. Basically 
they deal with drug offences.
<P>
	What we have proposed is significant. It is to extend the category 
of access to tax information to assist in investigations into 
organized crime offences. They cannot just walk in and take the 
information out of a file. They have to go before a judge, get a 
warrant, establish to the satisfaction of the judge that a criminal 
organization offence is being investigated, and that they need the 
information and it relates to the investigation. Then the warrant can 
be given and can be limited to such information as the court thinks 
is appropriate. Nonetheless it is an important breakthrough in terms 
of giving police more information to fit the puzzle together as to 
who has what, what are the proceeds of crime, what money is being 
laundered or what illegal activity is taking place?
<P>
	Similarly we are proposing for the first time to extend the 
proceeds of crime legislation beyond drug offences and the like to 
organized crime offences. It is not only the proceeds. Cash can be 
taken from their desks during the arrest. It can be instruments as 
well possibly including real estate if it has been fortified or 
modified to facilitate the commission of an offence. That is a very 
important point.
<P>
	We spoke to the mayor of St. Nicolas or other communities 
where there are headquarters of organizations of great concern to 
the citizens. We can imagine a gang setting up in a municipality 
somewhere, taking over a house, fortifying it, setting up barriers so 
that the police could not raid it, putting concrete in front and 
surveillance cameras on top, modifying it and selling drugs out the 
back door or using it to store explosives or some other such thing. 
If the real estate is modified or fortified to facilitate the 
commission of criminal offences, the real estate could be regarded 
as one of the instruments of crime and could potentially be seized 
after conviction for an organized crime offence. That is an 
extremely important tool.
<P>
	The bill includes serious increases in sentences for crimes 
committed in association with or for the benefit of criminal 
organizations. I could have explosives illegally on my person and I 
would be subject to a maximum of five years in prison. If I am 
doing it for the benefit of a  gang, if I am delivering the explosives 
to a gang or have planted them for the gang, whether or not I am 
part of the gang I could face up to 14 years in prison. Why? 
Because we are targeting organized crime which in turn is targeting 
us, our families and our children. That is why.
<P>
	That is not only important because it reflects society's 
denunciation of organized crime activity. It is also an important 
tool for the police that may be in a position of having picked people 
up, arrested them and charged them. Then they have a potentially 
serious sentence facing them. Police officers can say they are 
prepared to discuss with them the charge they will be brought 
before the court on or what submission they will make to the court 
in relation to the sentence if they co-operate by providing them 
with information they need. It is a very important tool for police 
that should not be underestimated.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Then there is the so-called peace bond provision which is not 
there now. It will let police officers bring someone before the judge 
and say they have reasonable grounds to fear the person will 
commit a criminal organization offence.
<P>
	They can ask the judge to look at the evidence, at the people he 
associates with, at what he has done in the past, at what the wiretap 
has turned up and at all the other circumstances. Then they invite 
the judge to conclude there is a reasonable basis to fear the person 
will commit a criminal organization offence. They can tell the 
judge that he has committed a number of them in the past and is 
still with the same group of people. They can ask the judge to look 
at what he has said publicly and privately.
<P>
	In those circumstances the court can impose for up to a year 
conditions on the person's liberty such as prohibiting him from 
communicating with other members of the group. This would 
seriously undermine the ability of the leadership of groups to carry 
on their business. The police believe that is also a valuable tool.
<P>
	I take the member's point. I should have to satisfy him that what 
we are proposing here is not only lawful but will be effective. I am 
able to report from my dealings with the police, the crown 
attorneys and the attorneys general of the provinces that we have a 
collection of measures. They are not enough in and of themselves 
but they will make a difference. They will make it that much easier 
for the police to tackle this dreadfully difficult problem.
<P>
	We will be back in the future with more proposals. This is only 
the first phase of what we will do. Organized crime is a menace in 
the country. I do not think most of us have an appreciation for what 
a serious threat it is to the economy and future of the country.
<P>
	It is a good start. These measures will make a difference for 
police and that is why we are here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9978"> 9978 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Chairman, I have one final question. I would 
just rephrase a good start to a fresh start because I feel it is a fresh 
example of co-operation between all parties. In any event, because 
of the nature of the amendments to the Criminal Code the concern 
is that they not be thrown out by some future supreme court 
justice.
<P>
	There is a lot more to discuss in the bill. Why does it have to be 
done by Friday of this week? Why can we not take two to three 
weeks? We fast track bills through the House at second reading, 
report stage, third reading, over to the Senate and back, with 
exception of the blood bill of last year. Why can we not take two to 
three weeks from today and do it a little more slowly for the sake of 
not infringing upon the civil liberties of honest, law-abiding 
citizens, groups, associations or other bodies?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> We have asked for all-party agreement to deal with 
the bill now. My hon. friends have been kind enough to agree. We 
are dealing with, as I have said, a process that has been methodical. 
For some time we have been working at it, but it has been 
accelerated by reason of the request of the Government of Quebec 
for help in the present circumstances.
<P>
	Over the last couple of years there have been almost 50 people 
killed in the gang war in Quebec. I met last week with Mrs. 
Desrochers, whose 11-year old son, Daniel, was killed in August 
1995. He was walking down the street in Montreal on an errand for 
his mother. The police believe one of these gangs detonated an 
explosive that was intended as another offensive in their gang war. 
A piece of shrapnel blew across the street and took the life of the 
11-year old boy.
<P>
	I met with Mrs. Desrochers last summer in my office. The hon. 
member for Hochelaga was kind enough to introduce me to her. 
She asked how much longer she must wait before something was 
done about it. I told her we were working on it and the police were 
working on it. She met with me again last week. She said she 
wanted the bill in place and she wanted the police to have these 
tools. The most important thing to her was that the bill might help 
the police to find the people who are responsible for her son's 
death.
<P>
	There are few more eloquent explanations of why we are moving 
quickly on the bill. I think of that grieving mother. I think of that 
11-year old boy who lost his life. I think of a gang war that 
continues. We do not know from day to day where another bomb 
might be found or where it might be exploded. The criminal law is 
not something that can react on an hourly basis either to judicial 
decisions we do not like or crises that arise in terms of crimes in the 
country. It is an instrument that should be brought to bear in those 
circumstances where we feel as parliamentarians it can help in a 
lawful, practical way.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	This is a problem of long standing which is of significant 
concern to our second most populous province. It has asked for our 
help and our urgent action. We have produced a bill we think is 
lawful and which will make a difference. It is under those 
circumstances we have asked that its adoption be expedited.
<P>
	I am sensitive to those who say that greater care should be taken 
and a longer look should be taken at this bill. It may be that the 
other place may have its own ideas too about when and how the bill 
is considered.
<P>
	If it does become law in the next little while, I can see us saying 
that we will commit to monitoring its progress, to reviewing its 
operation, to seeing what we have learned from it in operation. I 
have discussed this matter with officials. They think it may need a 
period of a couple of years or three years before we are able to look 
meaningfully at what we have learned from it by the time the 
wiretaps are in place and there is some empirical data by police 
across the country.
<P>
	I would be happy to say to the hon. member that the government 
will return within three years with a statistical assessment of how 
this bill has operated, what the effect has been, what judicial 
decisions have been reached under the bill, whether there have 
been challenges to its validity, what the police say about how 
valuable this is as a tool in their hands, what changes might be 
desirable from a policy or practice point of view. That would be 
useful. It should be done anyway, but I would be happy to 
undertake to the member that the government will do so if he would 
find it of assistance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I respect the example the minister gave me about the 
11-year old boy and his mother, and the need to move quickly. That 
is no different from the pleadings and representations made to the 
minister by Debbie Mahaffy in terms of having a victims bill of 
rights, victims impact statements and things like that being clearly 
identifiable in the law.
<P>
	Is the minister sure that he is not being pressured by a pending 
election when he rushes forward with this bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, it is a good question. The Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General holds a place apart in any cabinet. He 
is a politician by definition but he has another responsibility as 
well: to be the guardian of the Constitution and the rule of law.
<P>
	He or she is there to focus issues of principle on questions of 
politics, to borrow a phrase from Ian Scott who served with such 
distinction as Attorney General of Ontario for five years. I can tell 
the hon. member that I have considered that question at every stage 
of this process. I can tell him with honesty that in my view this is 
good law. It is needed. It is good policy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9979"> 9979 </A></B>
<P>
	I can tell him that if the request from the province of Quebec 
had come under different circumstances at a different time, I 
would respond in the same way. Within two days of getting a call 
from the minister of public security, I was in Quebec City to meet 
with him and 14 mayors of the region because I was aware of the 
depth of their concern and the extent of the problem.
<P>
	I promised to look immediately at the proposal they gave to me. 
I did and I concluded it was unacceptable, but I also put something 
else on the table. I said: ``Here are tools that we think are legal but 
that will make a difference''. I solicited the involvement of others 
in the process I have already described in terms of consultation.
<P>
	What we produced is before members now in Bill C-95. It is an 
urgent response to a very difficult and serious problem. I believe 
focusing issues of principle on questions of politics is the right 
thing to do.
<P>
	Two years ago, members were kind enough to look carefully at 
Bill C-104 which had to do with adding DNA testing to the 
criminal law. We went through a similar process. I was here in this 
chair in committee of the whole, on clause by clause study for Bill 
C-104.
<P>
	We passed that bill in a day. It went on to the other place and was 
adopted very quickly. It became law. Again, it did not go through 
the long, extensive process that we associate with legislation. We 
did it because we came to the common view that here was 
something that was needed and was not already in the criminal law. 
There was a case to be made that it was going to make a difference 
to police inquiries so we went ahead and acted quickly. There was 
no election pending; it was not as though the House was going to 
rise and we were all going to go on the hustings. It was two years 
ago, in the middle of our mandate.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	My point is that there are times, quite apart from elections, when 
the need arises and circumstances require that we act quickly. I 
believe this is one of those cases. As a general rule, as I said in 
connection with Bill C-104, it is better to take the extended period. 
On this bill, with the facts and with this law we are in a position to 
act quickly and it is in the public interest to do so.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Would the member indicate whether he wants 
this clause deferred until the end of all of the clauses?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Yes, but there are more parts to this clause that I 
would like to discuss with the minister if that is in order, Mr. 
Chairman.
<P>
	The DNA bill came about as a direct result of the member for 
Wild Rose assuring the justice minister that he would have our 
support if they moved forward on that bill. It was as a result of that 
initiative that the DNA bill came forward because it was clear, 
simple and straightforward.
<P>
	With regard to this bill, a little 11-year old boy died two years 
ago. There is no question in my mind that we had enough time to 
bring this bill forward and give it the due diligence it should have 
had. I am still concerned that we have not had witnesses from both 
sides. I would like to hear from prosecutors and ask them some of 
these questions, those who stand in the courts each day and have to 
bear the weight of providing evidence to bring forward the 
conclusion that they want. I would like to hear what they have to 
say.
<P>
	I appreciate the time we are taking but it is not the same as 
having witnesses come forward with the various perspectives that 
this bill should have before we go forward with it. We are here 
because we do support the thrust of this bill.
<P>
	I am concerned with the vagueness of some of the terms we have 
dealt with. I want to deal with more of them. There is a vagueness 
that is left to the courts to interpret. We know what happened with 
Bill C-41 on the conditional sentencing issue. Even the justice 
minister himself admits that rapists should not be walking free, yet 
that is the manner in which that law is being interpreted and 
administered by judges across the country.
<P>
	When we say we will leave some of these definitions or these 
words to be defined and interpreted by the courts, we have had 
unpleasant experiences in the past that I do not think are in the best 
interests of society.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I would like to turn to (b) of that first clause at the 
top of page 3. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>any or all of the members of which engage in or have, within the preceding five 
years, engaged in the commission of a series of such offences;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is another word without definition and that is ``series''. 
What does that mean? What did the justice minister mean when he 
placed that word within this statute?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, we intended it to have its ordinary 
meaning. I would be happy if a court would look at the ordinary 
dictionary definition of that term when it comes to interpreting it 
and applying it.
<P>
	May I say it is quite common in legislation, not just justice 
legislation but bills in general, that Parliament does not define all 
the terms that are used. We could scarcely do that because we 
would never get out of the definition section. Even if we were to do 
so, the definition sections themselves are open to interpretation by 
the courts. The courts will have the last word on all legislation; that 
is just the way things work in this democracy.
<P>
	What we intended was to communicate the idea that where 
members engage over the last five year period in more than one of 
these criminal offences and indeed a series, then it should catch the 
definition of criminal organization. We are not talking here about 
an isolated event. We are not talking here about an exceptional  
event. We are talking about a series of events and therefore we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9980"> 9980 </A></B>
<P>
giving the court the nature of the organization that we have in 
mind.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, if the justice minister means that a 
series is more than one, that clarifies it in my mind, but I do not 
read that definition anywhere in the bill. What does a series mean 
to the various judges across the country? Would the justice minister 
be prepared to define ``series'' as more than one?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, I said the dictionary definition should 
govern. Perhaps we should have that before us. I could ask one of 
my officials to provide me with a copy of the dictionary definition 
of ``series'' and we could read from that.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the member have a further question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, I would like to wait until the 
minister has responded to that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I have a question and a comment. Earlier, I was relieved 
when I heard the hon. member for Calgary-Centre, because I was 
afraid we were getting into something close to a filibuster. That 
would have been disappointing, I must admit. But the hon. member 
was most reassuring, and I know his reputation for style and fair 
play. I really had the feeling that the three parties had reached an 
agreement to ensure that the bill would be passed as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	I am grateful to the minister for recalling what happened in 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. The minister knows how concerned I 
am about the whole issue of organized crime. I have two 
comments, since I will not speak again on this bill because I really 
want us to proceed as quickly as possible.
<P>
	I had an opportunity, for which I thank the minister and his 
officials, to ask some questions during a briefing session. I imagine 
the same opportunity was offered to our Reform Party colleagues. 
During this session I was able to discuss technical aspects of the 
bill.
<P>
	So I would appeal to all members of the House to let us proceed 
as quickly as possible. I also want to explain to my Reform Party 
colleagues who are very close to the police community that three 
major demands made by police associations across the country 
have been documented in a report.
<P>
	I would be delighted to table this report which is about the 
management of the proceeds of crime in Canada, if the House were 
to give its unanimous consent. One of the document's main 
recommendations is that there should be aggravating 
circumstances when an offence is committed in relation to 
organized crime. I understand  why this provision found its way 
into the bill, and the minister can confirm my statement.
<P>
	My question to the minister is as follows: Could he ask his 
officials to make a list of the offences covered by this bill, so that 
we have a better understanding of the legislation? I do not know 
whether departmental employees have already done so. I do know 
that there is a reference to all offences punishable by more than five 
years imprisonment, and these are mainly offences already 
included in the Criminal Code. However, to give all members of 
this House a better understanding of the legislation, it might be 
useful if the Department of Justice promised to distribute this list 
before we finish our business or by the end of this week. I think it 
would be very interesting for all members to have this list.
<P>
	Finally, I want to make one last appeal to have this bill passed 
with all due dispatch, and I can assure the minister he will have our 
full co-operation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, in the definition the reference is to 
offences for which there is a maximum of at least five years 
imprisonment as a punishment. It is for indictable offences with 
that consequence. It is not only in the Criminal Code but in other 
federal statutes as well. I am not sure if it would be helpful to 
provide that list because it is very long.
<P>
	In terms of penalties, the Criminal Code is divided into a 
series-to use a word-in which there are groups of offences 
punishable by six months, two years less a day, two years, five 
years, ten years, fourteen years, and life. Those are the distinctions 
in terms of Criminal Code penalties.
<P>
	Those offences punishable by a maximum of five years on 
indictment make up a very considerable group both in the code and 
in other statutes. I do not know that it would be helpful to have that 
list. What we are trying to do here is give the court a sense of the 
degree of seriousness to which we are looking when we say that 
someone is involved in a criminal organization. Therefore we have 
picked those offences which have the maximum of five years, 
which are up on the scale. They are not six months or two years 
plus a day or two years, they are in the medium range of 
seriousness and beyond. These are significant offences.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	In response to the question put by my friend from Crowfoot on 
the issue of series, I am reminded as I look at the Oxford concise 
definition of series that the element that would be missing if we 
used two or more, rather than series, is the element of successive or 
the temporal relationship between the offences. In other words, if a 
person committed both offences in the same day, both having to do 
with the same event, for example, robbery and assault, that would 
be more than one but they would both be in connection with the 
same event and would not  capture the notion of series in the sense 
that there would be successive occasions on which such events took 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9981"> 9981 </A></B>
<P>
place; a person committed a crime in February but also committed 
the crime in October and so on.
<P>
	As we look back over the five year period the notion of series is 
to connote not only a number, more than one, but that they were 
successive, in temporal relationship, one to the other, and there was 
a pattern which demonstrated that on more than one occasion the 
person had engaged in that criminal conduct. That is what series 
gives us that two or more would not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, I do not know if that is going to 
make this any easier to establish without a definition more 
definitive than what I just heard from the minister.
<P>
	The clause indicates what a criminal organization offence is. I 
ask the justice minister whether the criminal organization offence 
applies to youth gangs. I do not see that anywhere in the bill. I 
wonder why this bill is not applicable to youth and, in particular, 
why the definition of criminal organization does not apply to youth 
gangs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, it does. It applies to anybody who is 
subject to the criminal law, anybody 12 and older. If there are 
13-year olds, five or more of them, who formally or informally 
organize themselves into a group which has as one of its primary 
activities the commission of an indictable offence for which a 
maximum of five years imprisonment is provided by Parliament 
and any or all of whom have engage in a series of such offences 
over the last five years, regardless of the age of the participants, 
they could be found to be a criminal organization. A criminal 
organization offence could be committed regardless of the age of 
the participants so long as they are subject to the criminal law 
sanction being 12 years of age or older. There is no distinction here 
in terms of age.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, perhaps the justice minister could 
explain why under the Young Offenders Act it is only murder that 
carries an offence greater than the three years. How would this new 
sentence apply without a transfer to adult court?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, the Young Offenders Act is only the 
jeopardy to which the individual young person is subject, but the 
offence itself is punishable in the Criminal Code by five years or 
longer. If the offence itself is punishable by a maximum of five 
years on indictment, then it meets the definition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, I would like to be clear on this. If 
the justice minister is saying that the definition of a criminal 
organization applies to young offenders and also that the criminal 
organization offence applies, that is different from the legal 
opinion we have received. It was on short notice, nevertheless it is 
different.
<P>
	When I look at this, from my understanding there is no penalty 
under the YOA that exceeds three years. The  person who was 
charged for manslaughter, the young offender who was involved in 
the torture death of Sylvain Leduc, received the maximum penalty 
that could be received under the YOA of three years. That means 
that individual, for that offence, does not fall within the category of 
having committed an indictable offence with a penalty of five years 
or more. That person, with that record, would not fall within the 
category or definition.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, I do not agree. In reality if the offence 
carries under the Criminal Code a penalty that is indictable with a 
maximum of five years or more, then it falls within this definition. 
The fact that an individual offender, because of the Young 
Offenders Act, would be subject to a lessor penalty because of their 
own age is beside the point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, I want to make this clear. Is the 
justice minister saying that the young offender who was convicted 
of manslaughter in the Sylvain Leduc torture death and was granted 
or given a three year maximum penalty allowed under the YOA 
falls into one of these categories as a person who has been involved 
in an indictable offence with a penalty of at least five years 
imprisonment? Is that what the minister is saying?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, we have to unravel that and put it 
another way. I think I have the member's point but I do not think 
we can relate it to that particular crime. It was not alleged that there 
were other crimes.
<P>
	If there is a group of five or more persons, formally or 
informally organized, having as one of their primary activities the 
commission of indictable offences under the Criminal Code 
punishable by a maximum of five years or more, and any or all of 
whom have engaged in a series of such offences over the last five 
years, they do not fall out of the definition for reason only of their 
age, that they would personally be subject to a maximum of three 
years under the Young Offenders Act. My officials take that view 
and I do as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, in order to make it clear for the 
record as well as for those who may be listening, for this young 
individual who was sentenced to three years maximum for 
manslaughter under the YOA, if it could have been established and 
this bill had been in force prior to the death of Sylvain Leduc, could 
he have been charged under this new criminal organizational 
offence?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, this statute is for criminal 
organizations. I do not know enough about the facts of the case. 
The member keeps referring to that one case. I would prefer not to 
talk about a case that is still before the courts.
<P>
	We are not dealing here with one person committing one offence 
on an isolated basis. We are talking about criminal organizations 
which are five or more people dedicated ruthlessly to a life of crime 
and committing a  series of such offences over the last five years. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9982"> 9982 </A></B>
<P>
Then we are talking about criminal organizations and criminal 
organization offences.
<P>
	One person committing one offence on a specific occasion is not 
intended to be caught by this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, this person is alleged to have been 
a member of Ace Crew, a gang, involved in drug trafficking and in 
the kidnapping of at least two people, one of whom was tortured to 
death. If this bill predated the commission of that offence, could 
that young individual have been convicted and sentenced under this 
new charge, this new offence that has been created, the criminal 
organizational offence?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Why could he not? If the minister is saying these 
two new definitions, criminal organization and criminal 
organization offence, would apply to youth gangs, and it was 
alleged this person was a member of a youth gang, why would it 
not apply to this young individual who got only three years for 
manslaughter if this bill had predated the offence? He has said that 
it would not apply. I do not understand.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, the first thing I will do is expressly 
decline to discuss the case of Sylvain Leduc. I think it is wrong to 
talk about that case because it is before the courts.
<P>
	Let me then go to a broader level of generality and talk about a 
gang of youths engaged in a series of criminal acts over time. As I 
have already said to the member, if there is a group, association or 
other body consisting of five or more persons, whether formally or 
informally organized, one of whose primary activities is the 
commission of indictable offences under the Criminal Code or any 
act of Parliament punishable by a maximum imprisonment of five 
years or more, and whose members, any or all, have engaged over 
the last five years in a series of such offences, then that would be a 
criminal organization and it would not fall short of the definition 
only because members were below the age of 18, so long as they 
were 12 years of age or more. The determination of the predicate 
offences would be in reference to the penalties provided in the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	The fact that the Young Offenders Act put a cap of three years as 
the maximum for any individual because of their age alone would 
not disqualify them from the definition if the other elements were 
present. I said that earlier and I cannot say it more clearly than that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, the justice minister has certainly 
confused me on this issue. Would a young offender have to be 
raised to adult court for the indictable offence that has been 
committed before this new bill is applicable to him?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, if the crown were seeking the 14 year 
penalty then it would have to seek transfer to adult court. If it were 
content to seek a maximum of three years, the matter could be dealt 
with in youth court.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, there seems to be an anomaly here 
that youth gangs could still be sentenced under the Criminal Code 
and that this additional sentence which will be served concurrently 
under this new section can be applied only if the individual is tried 
in adult court. Am I correct in saying that? Is that my 
understanding of what the justice minister has told the committee?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, as with all young offender matters, if 
the crown wants penalties under the Criminal Code to apply, it has 
to seek transfer of the young offender from youth court to adult 
court. It does not change the nature or the character of the 
organization. It permits the police to make use of the provisions. 
But if a person is going to be sentenced as an adult they first have to 
be transferred to adult court.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, if I gather what the minister is 
saying, at least the penalties cannot apply to young offenders unless 
they are transferred to adult court. Is that true?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, yes, as in every other instance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, if the court decides on this reverse 
onus that the justice minister brought in with Bill C-37, that the 
individual should not be tried in adult court, then they are immune 
to this law.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> No, Mr. Chairman, but the penalties that can be given 
are limited to those provided in the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> If we want to split hairs, then I will put it this way. 
If the judge says that the young offender has to be tried in youth 
court, then he is immune to the penalties provided in this new 
section. Is that right?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, as in every other case, if the court 
decides not to transfer the young person out of youth court, then the 
Young Offenders Act penalties apply.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, in Bill C-37 we took the most 
serious crimes of violence and changed the transfer provisions. We 
said in Bill C-37, which is now the law of this land, that if one is 16 
or 17, namely at the upper range of the age limit covered by the 
Young Offenders Act, and is accused of one of the most serious acts 
of violence-and we included murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault-then that person will be 
tried in adult court unless the person can satisfy the burden of 
showing to the satisfaction of the judge that it is consistent with the 
public interest that they be tried in the youth court.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9983"> 9983 </A></B>
<P>
	That was to demonstrate that we are not going to tolerate serious 
crimes of violence from young people and we are going to react 
to it with swift and certain punishment.
<P>
	If the youth is transferred to adult court, then that youth is of 
course subject to all the adult penalties. In connection with Bill 
C-95, that is the 14 years for explosives, for example, the 14 years 
for the participation in the criminal organization offence, that is the 
extended period where the youth cannot apply for parole, that is 
consecutive sentences if the youth is sentenced for other offences 
as well. If the youth is transferred to adult court, that youth faces 
those very significant sanctions. But as in any other case, if the 
prosecuting attorney does not seek a transfer-of course, that is up 
to the provincial crown attorney-or if the court says it will not 
transfer the youth, then that youth is subject to the Young Offenders 
Act in youth court and the maximums under that statute apply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> It is pretty clear that young offenders who are 
gang members, simply because of the transferability of some of 
these offences-and it is a narrow series of offences that Bill C-37 
covers-that this new offence does not apply in youth court. It only 
applies in adult court. On the penalty, what difference does it 
make? Unless it applies to adults who are using youths, as they did 
in the Ace Crew organization, that gang that led to the torture and 
the death of at least one individual, and the individual was left in 
youth court and received only a three year penalty for 
manslaughter, which would have been much higher had he been 
transferred to adult court.
<P>
	It is very clear then that this new penalty and by and large the act 
itself, does not apply to anyone heard in youth court.
<P>
	I would ask the minister this question. If an adult was charged 
for committing an indictable offence, and the punishment was 
more than five years, and it could be proved that the individual was 
a member of a group, association or other body, and the other four 
people that made up the organization were youths, would the 
definition still apply?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Yes, in my view it would.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> All right. Then I will move on to the offence 
related property which is the final grouping. The justice minister 
touched on it in his earlier testimony. I would like him to advise the 
committee the difference that this will make over the laws that 
presently exist. Could he enlighten the committee on the change 
that this new bill brings in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, is the hon. member's reference to 
offence related property?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, at the moment the criminal law 
provides that in certain categories of crime, the court can seize and 
forfeit the proceeds of crime. Indeed, in some circumstances the 
court can make an order, even before conviction, that the property 
be tied up or suspended, that the accused person be deprived of its 
use or operation in the period pending trial.
<P>
	We have taken over such things as ski chalets under the 
provisions of that law where it has been possible to prove that the 
proceeds of the crime can be traced into assets.
<P>
	In Bill C-95 the ambit of the proceeds section have been 
extended so that they cover criminal organization offences as well 
as the offences to which they apply at present. However, we have 
done something else and this is the first time it has been done. We 
have extended the powers of the court to include the 
instrumentalities of crime. This has been under discussion for 
many years in Canadian law. It has never before been done.
<P>
	This means that you can not only seize the money that is made 
from the crime or the property to which you turn it but you can also 
seize the property used for the purpose of committing the crime. If 
an organized crime syndicate is using boats to take contraband 
across the border, using trucks to drive explosives to the scene of 
the crime, using a building, especially fortified or modified, to 
facilitate the commission of a crime, then the court will be 
empowered to order the forfeiture of that property as an instrument 
of the crime as well as the proceeds which would be in keeping 
with the practice in Canada to date.
<P>
	We believe this is going to give the authorities an important new 
tool to take from the criminal organizations those assets which they 
use to commit their crimes and to provide a way of shutting them 
down by depriving them of the very tools they need to carry on 
their nefarious trade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, I have one final question. I want to 
go back to the youth application. In light of what the justice 
minister has told the committee with regard to the manner in which 
this new bill is applicable or not applicable to young offenders, 
would he consider an amendment to the YOA that would extend the 
transfer to adult court of any offence the penalty of which holds a 
maximum penalty in the code of more than five years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, I would want to see that in detail to 
consider it. Perhaps the hon. member would be good enough to let 
me have that proposal over the period we take for question period 
so that we can look at it and consider its implications. I am not 
quite sure that I understand what the hon. member has in mind but I 
am sure that by discussing it with him over that period we  can 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9984"> 9984 </A></B>
<P>
develop a better understanding of it and provide him with an 
answer.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Further questions? With respect to clause 1 
again?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Yes, Mr. Chairman. I do thank the minister for this 
opportunity to question him. I quite enjoy this kind of give and 
take. I think this committee of the whole is a very useful provision. 
People watching on television and going through the <I>Hansard</I> 
proceedings will see that there is a lot of value in the give and take 
between the minister and opposition members.
<P>
	I want to reiterate a problem we have. The Quebec chiefs of 
police asked for legislation like this back in 1994. We are probably 
five days away from an election call and now, because we want to 
be good folks here on this side, we find that we have to pass the bill 
in a day because if we do not the bill will not become law before the 
election. That is unfortunate because it taints an otherwise honest 
attempt by the minister to address a serious problem. It also taints it 
with that feeling like this is another one of those photo ops in the 
last week before the election, which is too bad.
<P>
	However, I take the minister at his word that this has been in the 
works for a long time. It is just too bad that we are forced to deal 
with it at the 11th hour. I believe it is going to throw out a lot of 
questions and comments on this bill that were unnecessary. I have 
all kinds of newspaper articles that state that politics are coming 
before good legislation. I am sure the minister does not need that 
on his resume. It is unfortunate that it has happened.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	To continue on that same line, I remind the minister that 10 days 
ago some amendments on sentencing provisions of Bill C-41 and 
Bill C-45 had to be brought in. Things slip through when we are in 
a hurry. Again we agreed to do that in a hurry to allow the minister 
to correct some imperfections in the bills. Even Bill C-68-about 
which we consistently chastised the minister-the first set of 
regulations that came down were all withdrawn and reintroduced.
<P>
	All those are signs of things done in haste. I hope the minister is 
right that this bill will stand the constitutional challenge and will do 
what he wants it to do. But things done in haste this close to an 
election run the risk of not being done properly.
<P>
	This is not a huge and long bill but it amends many sections of 
the Criminal Code. Some received the bill Friday or even this 
morning. We had people who worked on the weekend. Many of us 
tried to find out exactly what the bill would mean with 
consequential amendments and all that stuff. It was very difficult to 
do.
<P>
	I have a couple of questions for the minister about this. Am I 
right that in the first part of the definition of  criminal organization 
where it consists of any body consisting of five or more persons 
that persons refers to anybody older than 12 years of age? Is that 
what I heard the minister say?
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> The time for question period is upon us. We 
will have to continue again with clause 1 after question period.
<P>
	(Progress reported.)
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is almost 2 p.m. We will begin statements by 
members.

	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Grantham Lions Club of St. Catharines was given its charter on 
May 2, 1952 and is celebrating its 45th charter night later this 
month.
<P>
	Since 1952 the club has worked to promote the principles of 
good government and good citizenship, to be of service to those 
less fortunate, to provide a forum for discussion and to encourage 
service minded citizens to serve their community.
<P>
	The results of these worthy objectives include the development 
of one of the finest sports parks in the city of St. Catharines and 
assisting programs and organizations like the Cubs and the 
Beavers, local hospitals, the Ina Grafton Gage Home, support and 
assistance for the visually and hearing impaired and much much 
more.
<P>
	The Grantham Lions Club has been a key community organizer 
and supporter over the last 45 years in helping our youth, our aged 
and our less fortunate. As we celebrate this important milestone for 
the club, two club members are of special mention. Charles 
Boyagian and Lee Nichols are charter members of the club. I 
congratulate them and all club members on their excellent work, 
their dedication to the community and their true spirit of giving.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
health minister explicitly stated in the House that Bill C-7, then 
reintroduced as Bill C-8, was a narcotics bill and that it did not deal 
with natural health products.
<P>
	However, the Liberals then declared vitamins, minerals and 
herbs with any therapeutic value to be drugs. Now, without any 
evidence that these products are unsafe, the Liberals are actively 
removing vitamins, minerals, herbal and natural extracts that have 
been on our shelves for  years. In addition, Canada Customs is

arbitrarily seizing natural health products at the border or refusing 
their entry into Canada.

<P>
	Under the new rules, companies must provide these products are 
safe beyond a shadow of a doubt. Only the big pharmaceutical 
companies can afford to market their products under these rules.
<P>
	The bottom line is that what is taken off the shelf in the public 
interest is put right back on in an official bottle at double or triple 
the price.

<P>
	The textile industry is an excellent example of a sector that has 
restructured and has aggressively pursued new product markets 
worldwide. In fact, industry exports have almost tripled since 1989.
<P>
	National Textiles Week, which is organized by the Textiles 
Human Resources Council, is an excellent example of partnership

Other events during the week will feature open houses, school 
visits and press conferences.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government is ahead in its fight against the 
deficit, but it has not been as successful in reducing its own 
expenditures.
<P>
	If we look at the figures we see that, between 1994-95 and 
1997-98, Ottawa cut its internal expenditures by only 9 per cent 
and not the 19 per cent promised in the 1995 budget.
<P>
	According to Treasury Board's latest release, federal 
expenditures, excluding transfer payments, will reach $50.2 billion 
in 1997-98, or $8 billion more than predicted two years ago.
<P>
	In the meantime, 54 per cent of spending was cut by reducing 
transfers to the provinces. Cash transfers for health and social 
programs dropped by 35 per cent.
<P>
	Federal government revenues and departmental expenditures 
exceed forecasts, while the debt service is lower than predicted. In 
fact, the only prediction of the Department of Finance that has 
come true is the one concerning transfers to the provinces. The 
federal government has definitely reduced its deficit on the backs 
of the provinces and the unemployed.

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, later today I will be presenting a petition with over 1,700 
signatures opposing the cutbacks to the CBC. This is a small part of 
a petition which was started by a single individual in B.C. and now 
has over 36,000 signatures and continues to grow. There has been a 
groundswell of grassroots support from every province and 
territory.
<P>
	The petition started from the outrage over the Liberal Party's 
failure to honour its 1993 red book campaign promise to maintain 
stable long term funding for the CBC. It also started from an anger 
against the Liberal Party's shortsightedness in dismantling the 
single most effective institution supporting Canadian unity by 
promoting communication and celebrating the unique values, 
strengths and aspirations of Canadians.
<P>
	Another $100 million in cuts are scheduled for next year. For the 
sake of the future of Canada as a free, independent and democratic 
nation, they must be stopped.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	After years of discussion between Quebec and Ottawa on the 
important issue of manpower training, an agreement in principle 
has finally been reached and was signed this morning by the two 
governments.
<P>
	For 32 years, premier after premier in Quebec made the same 
request, over and over again. Ottawa dragged its  feet until an 
election was imminent and has now, for the second time, signed a 
manpower agreement, as it did in 1993, when the parties were 
Bourassa and Campbell.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister tell the House what has changed since 
the famous statement in which he said Quebec was being 
capricious when Premier Johnson asked for the patriation of 
manpower training? Is it because he almost lost the referendum or 
because an election is imminent that the Prime Minister has 
suddenly become so flexible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I wonder why there is such a difference between the position of the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois and that of the Premier of Quebec on 
this issue. I think the Premier of Quebec and the Prime Minister of 
Canada were very pleased when they signed this very important 
document on manpower this morning.
<P>
	So I wonder why the Bloc Quebecois House leader is 
complaining about this great achievement of the federal 
government and the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with all due respect for the hon. member, he may not be 
talking about the same agreement. Perhaps that is the problem.
<P>
	In July 1965, Premier Jean Lesage, who was not, as far as I 
know, a sovereignist, already wanted Quebec to have full 
constitutional authority over manpower training, not an 
administrative agreement, but full constitutional authority.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that an administrative agreement 
is only a first step, that Quebec is not getting back its jurisdiction 
over manpower training and the agreement in principle signed this 
morning in an almost friendly fashion is far removed from the 
initial request made by Premier Lesage in 1965?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I just want to repeat the facts. What the Premier of Quebec said this 
morning was the exact opposite. He accepted this agreement with 
great pleasure, and I wonder why the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois in this House is at odds with the position taken by the 
Premier of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am astonished that someone with the hon. member's 
experience is surprised that Quebec members do not take exactly 
the same position. In Quebec, we are used to watching the 
federalists, and they do not necessarily take the same line they do 
in Quebec City. This has happened before.
<P>
	He said he was surprised, but I am not sure he listened to the 
same press conference. Of course Mr. Bouchard is  pleased, of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9989"> 9989 </A></B>
<P>
course he signed the agreement, and of course it is a first step, just a 
first step in the right direction. But a very small step.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	We can hardly say this is a great step for mankind, as they said 
when they walked on the moon. This is a small step. So we should 
get the facts straight. The jurisdiction remains with Ottawa. We are 
still bound by an administrative agreement. We are not sovereign in 
this respect.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister tell the House why Ottawa did not, as 
requested by Quebec, do a full transfer of jurisdiction over 
manpower training, which after all would only reflect the 
Constitution?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, </B><B>Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the leader of the Bloc Quebecois in the House just made a very 
important admission. She admitted that she does not want to 
separate from Canada but only wants to amend the Constitution.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	For weeks, the official opposition and event organizers have 
asked the Minister of Health to change his anti-smoking 
legislation. Each time, they met with refusal. On the eve of federal 
elections, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health are 
promising that by the end of 1997 they will introduce a bill to 
amend the anti-smoking legislation, which would meet 
international standards on sponsorships.
<P>
	How does the government explain its decision now, on the eve of 
elections, to promise amendments to the legislation on tobacco 
industry sponsorships, when these amendments were proposed by 
the Bloc Quebecois and all rejected by the government in 
committee and in the House?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have to keep in mind that the tobacco legislation is a very 
comprehensive and very effective piece of legislation. It puts 
restrictions on the price, on the product, on the place and even the 
promotion. This will be effective in curbing smoking in this 
country.
<P>
	With regard to the letter that I have provided to the individuals 
she has referred to, the hon. member is very much aware that both 
in the House of Commons as well as in the other place I have 
indicated to groups across the country that I am prepared to consult 
in a very meaningful way and if necessary, as I indicated in the 
letter, changes will be made.
<P>
	I do not think the hon. member should prejudge what those 
changes might be.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, everyone 
remembers the broken promise to scrap the GST.
<P>
	Now that we know the worth of this government's promises, 
could we also know, before the elections, the amendments the 
minister intends to make to this legislation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am sorry that members of the Bloc have decided to be partisan on 
this issue.
<P>
	Let us keep in mind that on second reading members of the Bloc 
were in favour of the bill. But when it came to third reading they 
voted against the principles of this bill, thereby doing a flip-flop in 
terms of their position as it relates to tobacco.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member and to others that one should not 
venture into the field of prejudging amendments, whether they be 
in the form of regulation or thereafter.
<P>
	We have to embark on a period of consultation. That is part and 
parcel of the bill and it is part and parcel of what I will do in the 
future.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the finance minister, record high bankruptcies in 
Canada in January are a good thing.
<P>
	If he thinks it is such a good thing he must be laughing himself 
silly over the 78 months in a row of unemployment over 9 per cent 
in this country. The 800,000 people out there who are moonlighting 
just to put food on the table must be a real knee slapper for the 
finance minister.
<P>
	Can the finance minister explain to Canadians his hare brained 
theory of how record high bankruptcies, record high debt, record 
high unemployment and record high taxes are good for the 
Canadian people? Let us hear the Liberal logic on that one.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
would probably advance the cause of the Reform Party a bit more if 
it were able to cite people accurately and not create straw men on 
the premises of its questions.
<P>
	Of course nobody ever said that bankruptcies were a good thing. 
What I did say was that business bankruptcies were down and the 
normal procedure is that personal  bankruptcies decline following 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9990"> 9990 </A></B>
<P>
business bankruptcies. As a result of that, it may well be that we are 
seeing light at the end of the tunnel.
<P>
	I have also said very clearly that the high number of personal 
bankruptcies in Canada, the United States and in most western 
countries is in fact a source of considerable concern. Most people 
think they are due not to high levels of unemployment, as the hon. 
member is alleging, and the same situation exists in the United 
States, but that they are due to a very high use of credit.
<P>
	The member opposite clearly did not understand what I said. 
That normally happens with this member. The member is 
incredibly eager but I will give him an opportunity because I must 
say that there is nothing I enjoy more than responding to his 
questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to contribute to the minister's pleasure.
<P>
	The finance minister says that Canadians should be managing 
their debt better. That is what he said. Do they really need to take 
advice from a minister who has added $100 billion to the Canadian 
debt in the past 3.5 years, someone who has sprinkled armouries 
around the country like Johnny Appleseed over the past week and 
who has doled out hundreds of millions of dollars in pre-election 
goodies?
<P>
	How does the minister have the nerve to lecture Canadians on 
their debt levels when after this past week he has practically worn 
the numbers off the national credit card? Where does he get the 
nerve?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the very high level of household debt that exists in Canada is a 
direct result of the recession, 1989 to 1992. What we saw was that 
personal debt rose, disposable income dropped and Canadians 
found themselves, as a result of policies largely recommended by 
the Reform Party, in rather deep difficulty.
<P>
	Since 1993, when we took over, the levels of household debt 
have dropped. The levels of household net worth have risen. The 
levels of household income have stabilized.
<P>
	However, there is one level of bankruptcy in this country that 
shows no sign of getting better, the degree of intellectual 
bankruptcy in the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact 
is under this government we have record high levels of personal 
debt, record high bankruptcies, record high levels of personal taxes 
and record levels of unemployment. That is the Liberal record.
<P>
	Canadians know why that has happened. One of the big reasons 
we have all these problems is the government has driven tax levels 
through the roof.
<P>
	After 3.5 years of doing diddly, after 3.5 years of shrinking 
incomes and after 3.5 years of rising debts, can the finance minister 
explain to voters why they should be  masochistic enough to have 
that done to them for another four years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think it was two weeks ago that the hon. member's expression was 
rinky-dink, now it is doing diddly. I want to congratulate the 
Reform Party on its extensive vocabulary.
<P>
	If the hon. member would like to know the Liberal record 
perhaps I could remind him. In the month of February 
manufacturing shipments rose. In the month of February housing 
starts rose 24,700 units. Real merchandise exports increased by 1.3 
per cent. The nominal merchandise trade surplus increased by $2.5 
billion. The real net worth per household rose 2.7 per cent. Gross 
domestic product up again, unemployment down, employment up 
and retail sales increases. That is the Liberal record and we will 
stand behind that.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I remind hon. members not to use props during

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	According to national defence department estimates, it will cost 
$242 million to decontaminate 21 of the 42 American radar bases 
on the DEW line. It is therefore likely that it will cost $484 million 
to decontaminate all the sites. We know that the United States will 
pay $100 million in damages to Canada for decontamination of 
these military sites.
<P>
	By burying the waste, as the Inuit claims it is doing, instead of 
decontaminating it, which would eliminate all toxic substances, but 
which would also be more expensive, is the government merely 
trying to save money?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the work that 
was to be done following the departure of U.S. military forces was 
considered, at the time, to be normal and reasonable. Obviously, 
the Government of Canada recognizes its obligations with respect 
to the environment and we recognize that we must take all means 
necessary to try to clean up the sites to which my hon. colleague is 
referring.
<P>
	I would like to point out, however, that as a general rule the 
American government has never paid any compensation for 
problems that may have occurred following its departure from 
military installations.
<P>
	As for the situation involving Canada, we have succeeded in 
negotiating an agreement whereby the  American government will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9991"> 9991 </A></B>
<P>
pay US$100 million, which is a considerable amount and which is a 
first. Regardless of what the Americans do in this connection, the 
Government of Canada will respect its environmental obligations.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
burying PCBs or other toxic substances, Canada is creating a 
veritable time bomb, which, very soon, will contaminate the water 
table and the fragile habitat in northern areas.
<P>
	Should the minister not immediately impose a moratorium on 
burying wastes until his department has made a complete and 
exhaustive assessment of the environmental situation at military 
sites and found an ecological manner in which to destroy these 
contaminants?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this is a 
phenomenon that several sectors of the government and of the 
private sector must address. It is now recognized that situations 
that were acceptable in the past are no longer tolerable.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has undertaken to do as much as it 
can to protect the environment, both in the north and elsewhere in 
the country. The agreement signed with the United States, which 
has not yet been approved by Congress, will make it possible for us 
to do some of the work.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the sites to which the hon. member is 
referring are not the only locations where there is a problem. The 
Department of the Environment, the provinces and the federal 
government are aware that there are several locations in the country 
facing the same problem.
<P>
	While it is not just up to the Department of National Defence, I 
would like to reiterate that the Government of Canada will do its 
utmost in all circumstances to ensure the integrity of the 
environment in a contemporary situation such as the one with 
which we must contend and in the situations she has raised today in 
the House.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week the separatist government and the Liberal Party of Quebec 
affirmed or claimed that Quebec alone can determine its future 
regardless of English, aboriginal or other minorities in that 
province, regardless of what the rest of Canada thinks and 
regardless of the rule of law as stated in Canada's Constitution. Mr. 
Johnson went so far as to say: ``It is our right in Quebec to take over 
ourselves, our development and our destiny''.
<P>
	During debate on Bill C-95 earlier today the attorney general 
stated that he is the guardian of the Constitution and the rule of law. 
Has he communicated to Mr. Johnson and to the separatist 
government in Quebec that last Wednesday's rhetoric is 
unacceptable to the government and will not be acceptable in the 
coming election campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have shown over the period of 
the last period of years that to this government, actions speak 
louder than words. We have done better than talk about this. We 
have referred to the Supreme Court of Canada fundamental 
questions about the constitutionality of the position taken by the 
Government of Quebec which claims that it can proceed entirely 
without reference to the courts and the Constitution.
<P>
	We believe that is wrong. As a result we have put to the Supreme 
Court of Canada in a reference questions to determine the answer: 
Can the Government of Quebec unilaterally act to separate from 
the rest of the country without reference to the Constitution?
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	We believe it cannot. We have put our position before the court. 
We have done the responsible thing with respect to the 
Constitution. We have asked the Supreme Court of Canada to rule 
that the Constitution applies throughout this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps the minister should get his Quebec counterpart to join in 
the intervener stage to see if he could come to some agreement on 
that plan.
<P>
	We are promised by the leader in Quebec that by 1998 we will 
have another referendum and that he will be going to the people at 
that time. Has the justice minister decided what he will do if such a 
thing occurs to ensure that the question is fair and that the 
unilateral declaration of independence does not have any weight in 
Canadian law?
<P>
	We are unwilling on this side of the House to let the Quebec 
separatists manipulate the question, set the agenda and destroy the 
country-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Sit down.

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9992"> 9992 </A></B>
<P>
	On April 10, the official opposition brought up the tragic case 
of Suzie Robitaille, whose children are still in Egypt, having been 
abducted by their father nearly two years ago. In this case, as in 
many others, the government is dragging its feet, even though one 
of the children is seriously ill. We have learned that Canada is 
currently involved in negotiating a bilateral agreement with Egypt 
concerning child abduction.
<P>
	Does the minister commit to making signature of the bilateral 
agreement with Egypt conditional upon the settlement of cases in 
dispute, in particular the one concerning the children of Suzie 
Robitaille?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first let me clarify that negotiations are under way. 
Officials are in Cairo right now negotiating a new consular 
agreement with Egypt that would allow us to have a better set of 
rules, disciplines and initiatives to protect Canadian rights.
<P>
	Unfortunately, Egypt does not adhere to the Hague convention 
with respect to the abduction of children. It has not signed that 
covenant. Therefore, we have no standing in international law that 
would require Egypt to return the children.
<P>
	We will continue to work as actively as we can with Egyptian 
authorities and impress on them the necessity to give Mrs. 
Robitaille her rightful place in court, to make sure that she has 
access to the children and, if at all possible, to adhere to the 
Canadian judgment, which is to return the children.
<P>
	We will continue to do what we can, but we are limited by the 
fact that Egypt has its own laws and we must work within that legal 
framework. However, I can promise the hon. member that we will 
continue to work very closely with Mrs. Robitaille to do whatever 
we can to help her in this very difficult situation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
a law. Egypt is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, and is not respecting that convention.
<P>
	Given the health status of Mrs. Robitaille's eldest child, which 
continues to deteriorate, can the minister, at the very least, 
implement emergency repatriation measures for this seriously ill 
child?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I intend to be in contact with my counterpart, the 
Egyptian foreign minister, within the next day or two to make these 
representations.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the justice 
minister has advised Mr. Sheppard of Calgary, Alberta that he will 
not be compensated for the loss of his private property. The justice 
minister's order in council which prohibited Mr. Sheppard's 
firearm forced this Calgarian and thousands more Canadians to 
turn over their property to local authorities without compensation.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Justice seize property that was legally 
acquired and lawfully held without compensation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in Bill C-68 the government took 
steps to take off the market those handguns which are small, easily 
concealed and cheaply manufactured. They are called Saturday 
night specials in the United States and they account for more police 
killings than any other form of firearm in that country. We also 
took off the market some military type assault weapons.
<P>
	The government does not believe that Canadians want a country 
in which people can have access to military type assault weapons 
and Saturday night specials.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the justice 
minister failed to answer the question. Yes, he has taken this 
property from Canadians, but the question was why he has not 
compensated them. That property was legally acquired and 
lawfully held.
<P>
	How can he say that he stands for the rights of Canadians when 
he takes their property from them without compensation? How can 
he do this? Will he answer the question?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows full well 
that, when we passed orders in council which took guns out of the 
hands of people, we compensated them for the cost.
<P>
	For those that were prohibited, they were grandfathered. People 
were allowed to keep them and use them for the rest of their lives 
and to sell them to others in the same class of ownership.
<P>
	The real difficulty this hon. member has is that he and his 
members are against gun control. The Reform Party, the 
Conservative Party and the NDP are against gun control.
<P>
	The time will come in the not distant future when the people of 
Canada will have the opportunity to express themselves on the 
subject. On that occasion, this member, the other members of the 
Reform Party, the Tories-wherever they may be-and the NDP

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	On a number of occasions, we have called for the federal 
government to set up a fund to compensate for the negative effects 
of the closure of the St. Hubert military base and we have insisted 
that the region be treated just like other Canadian communities, 
where bases were closed, like Cornwallis, for example, which 
received over $7.5 million.
<P>
	Could the minister confirm today his government's intention to 
provide compensation for the closure of the St. Hubert base?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, when the 
military bases were closed or reduced, in certain regions, 
evaluations and analyses were done to assess the economic impact 
on the region.
<P>
	Obviously, there were a series of closures that had significant 
impact. The hon. member mentioned Cornwallis, for example. In 
my province, however, the military base at Chatham was closed at 
a cost of 1,000 civilian and military jobs.
<P>
	I think that, in all the reductions we have faced at national 
defence and in the Canadian forces, we have been as fair as 
possible and have applied similar criteria, as circumstances 
dictated, across the country, including in St. Hubert.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder whether the minister does not intend to use the upcoming 
campaign to announce the payment of compensation, which we 
estimate at several million dollars, for the loss of 1,400 jobs, when 
all we want is for the government to give St. Hubert what it is 
entitled to.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is true that a 
number of communities were affected by the restructuring, and 
reduction in the number of military facilities across the country.
<P>
	However, I think the Government of Canada made a major 
contribution in the St. Hubert region. I was there about ten days 
ago, and I saw the facility the Government of Canada set up in St. 
Hubert. We would have much preferred to have that, in northern 
New Brunswick, rather than limited economic spinoffs as the result 
of the closure of the Chatham base.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is a 
very important day for Canada and the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	As my colleague has said, today we have officially announced 
the historic labour market agreement in principle with Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	We must consider how many years the discussions have been 
going on. There is a consensus in Quebec on labour market 
development. The importance of the agreement is considerable in 
that some $3 billion will be transferred to Quebec over the next five 
years. It will have immediate benefits for workers in Quebec.
<P>
	I think we can say this is an historic occasion. We hope the 
agreement will be completed very soon and the active measures of 
the employment insurance system will go toward helping 
employees and employers put people back to work in the province 
of Quebec.

could benefit all Canadians? Why has that bill not received the 
same high priority he is giving to the anti-gang legislation?

<HR>
<B><A NAME="9994"> 9994 </A></B>
<P>
peals of laughter extending across the country from sea to sea to 
sea as he tried to change the lamentable position of his party at the 
last minute. His party is against gun control and always has been.
<P>
	The hon. member asked about victims. I can do no better than to 
point to the record of the government time after time, whether it is 
through amendments to the code on sentencing or the gun control 
bill. I well remember the day when the victims came to this 
building, having lost loved ones to crimes of violence committed 
by firearms, guns in the hands of people who should not have had 
them. They asked us to pass Bill C-68 to provide for the 
registration of all firearms, a bill and a plea to which his party 
turned a deaf ear.
<P>
	I say to him, his colleagues in the Reform Party, the 
Conservatives and the NDP that they will have to answer to the 
Canadian people in coming months why they did not listen to the 
pleas of victims and join with us to adopt meaningful gun control.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
nothing wrong with asking the government to compensate people 
for confiscated property that was lawfully obtained. The minister 
can stand there and say people are laughing about that. People are 
upset the government would take their property without 
compensation.
<P>
	In terms of the anti-gang legislation, if the minister would give 
the same priority to the victims bill of rights it would have much 
greater impact not just on gangs but on everybody across the 
country.
<P>
	Why will the minister not admit he is playing election politics 
prior to the election and has no intention of ever passing the victims 
rights bill?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what draws laughter is the pretence 
by members of the Reform Party that they are not against gun 
control. We all know they are and they are going to pay the price 
for it, as are the Tories and the NDP.
<P>
	As for the hon. member's question, he talks about victims rights 
as though they are something that can be achieved by writing out 
something on a piece of paper and calling it a bill of rights.
<P>
	Let me tell him something about victims and their rights. Last 
week I was in Montreal and I met a woman whose 11-year old son 
was killed by a bomb explosion on the streets of Montreal. The 
Reform Party does not like to hear this because it is truth and 
reality as opposed to rhetoric and superficiality.
<P>
	That woman whose 11-year old son had been killed in the gang 
war asked me as the Minister of Justice to do everything I could to 
get Bill C-95, the anti-organized crime bill, through Parliament so 
that the police would  have more tools to try to find the people who 
killed her son.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	That is what we should do to achieve victims rights and that is 
what the government has done to achieve victims right. We have 
passed meaningful legislation that makes a difference instead of 
just talking a good game.

reassure the House that, if the former Singer employees take their 
case to court, our department will proceed with all due speed. I 
have asked my colleague, the Minister of Justice, to act

proceed with all due speed, as will my colleague''. This is not the 
case at the moment. The average age of these people is 80 years.

Normally, a defence takes a while to produce, and the federal

Mr. Speaker, the Liberals have bungled their responsibility for 
grain transportation. Grain shipment delays have cost prairie 
farmers almost $100 million this year alone due to demurrage 
charges and lost sales. The Liberals have created a cash crunch on

that we are on the verge of an election call.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

indicated a short time ago, it has made certain recommendations 
with respect to initial payments. Those recommendations are in the 
normal course under consideration at the present time.
<P>
	The hon. gentleman will know that under this government we 
have dramatically shortened the response time to that kind of 
recommendation from the Canadian Wheat Board. Under our 
predecessors recommendations sometimes took several months to 
be acted upon. In the case of this government we have shortened 
the time to a matter of a few days when the consideration is 
completed.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board will announce the result in the 
ordinary course taking into account the very important 
consideration that one would not want to put the guarantees in 
jeopardy, which is a matter of very significant concern to the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in light of the fact the Liberal government is currently 
attempting to paper over 3.5 years of failures in a frantic 
pre-election flurry of deal making and vote buying the minister of 
agriculture has the cloak of secrecy around which the Canadian 
Wheat Board operates, allowing him to use the timing of increases 
and interim prices for political purposes.
<P>
	The crop year is nearly three-quarters complete. Will the 
minister of agriculture announce any increases in interim prices 
prior to the pending election, probably this week? Or, is he saving 
his announcement as yet another Liberal election goodie for during 
the campaign?
<P>

know-he may have missed it in his dramatic search for hyperbole 
and overblown rhetoric-that I do not make these announcements. 
The Canadian Wheat Board makes these announcements in the 
ordinary course of events. As rapidly as the Canadian Wheat Board 
is in a position to do so and taking into account all relevant 
circumstances the announcement will be made, election or no

Ping, the Chinese minister responsible for the transition in Hong 
Kong. We brought to his attention our concern about the proposed 
changes. Those changes have not been made yet. They are still 
being considered by the Hong Kong legislature.
<P>
	We have certainly made our views known. We think a maximum 
amount of consistency must be maintained in terms of freedom of 
the press, the right to demonstration and the right of political 
parties to maintain their autonomy.
<P>
	We are making all efforts to ensure that both the Chinese 
authority and the Hong Kong authority know exactly where Canada 
stands.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberals promised to scrap and abolish the GST.
<P>
	Instead of scrapping the GST as it promised, the government has 
not only expanded the GST into the harmonized sales tax in the 
Atlantic provinces but is now charging Canadians outside Atlantic 
Canada the expanded tax as well.
<P>
	Effective April 1 the new Liberal postal tax grab means that 
Canadians across the nation will now pay Atlantic Canada's 
harmonized sales tax, an additional 15 per cent surcharge, on 
parcels and courier mail sent to the three Atlantic provinces with 
the harmonized sales tax.
<P>
	My question is for the minister responsible for Canada Post. 
Why are all Canadians being forced to pay the 15 per cent HST on 
parcels and courier mail sent to Atlantic Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member ought to know, a sales tax has always been paid by 
recipients in provinces where the tax is imposed. There is no 
change in this.
<P>
	What change has been brought in is that Atlantic Canada has 
been given a tremendous opportunity to lower its costs so that its 
small and medium size business can create jobs. At the same time 
Atlantic Canadians have been given a lower consumer cost on a 
vast range of goods from refrigerators to automobiles. It is very 
clearly an important part of the rebuilding of the Atlantic Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	That is why Atlantic Canadian premiers are going across the 
country. It is something Atlantic Canada and its premiers can be 
proud of.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> No props, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Jong:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government in the red book in 
1993 promised multi-year funding. What kind of long term stable 
funding results in hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts? How can 
government members face voters and claim that the red book 
commitment has been honoured without at least blushing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister announced recently 
that there will be stable funding for the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation. This is an opportunity for the CBC to start looking at 
how it fulfils its mandate, to look at how it does things more 
effectively and efficiently.

question is directed to the Minister of International Cooperation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some of my constituents are concerned about the lack of food, 
medicine and affordable energy in Bulgaria. The country recently 
elected a coalition government to replace the previous unstable 
communist regime. Can the minister tell me what Canada is doing 
to help alleviate the humanitarian instability in Bulgaria?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since 1992 the federal government has provided some $2 million of 
assistance to Bulgaria. As well, a few weeks ago Canada agreed to 
activate a $10 million untied line of credit which can be used for 
the purchase of, among other things, Canadian wheat and other 
commodities. We feel this would be truly beneficial to the people 
of Bulgaria. Canada has also supplied election observers to 
Bulgaria and we intend to continue to do so.
<P>
	As of yet the Government of Bulgaria has not made an 
international appeal for humanitarian aid. Nevertheless we have 
extended the line of credit I have just described.

	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour to present the 64th report of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, on the business of 
supply.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The work on the business of supply was undertaken by a 
subcommittee which I had the privilege of chairing. I want to thank 
the members of the subcommittee for their dedication and hard 
work on an issue which has very little public profile and not much 
more in this House but which touches on the very core of 
Parliament's responsibility to tell the government how and how 
much money it may raise and spend.
<P>
	I also want to strongly recommend to the House that this report 
be brought to the attention of the members of the 36th Parliament 
for consideration. The procedure and House affairs committee has 
already agreed to ask House officials to draft amendments to the 
standing orders based on this report.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-407, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am introducing a bill to amend the 
Canada Elections Act to address the situation I encountered last fall 
in which a private company tried to launder its corporate 
contributions to the Liberal Party by asking its employees to donate 
directly to the party and promising to reimburse the employees the 
full amount of their donations.
<P>
	This practice hides the donations of companies which have a lot 
of influence with the government. It puts unethical pressure on 
employees who do not wish to support the political party of the 
company's choice and it rips off the taxpayer because donations 
from individuals receive higher tax exemptions than corporate 
donations.
<P>
	Elections Canada agrees that this practice needs to be prohibited 
in the act and I hope to receive the support of all members for this 
proposal.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two 
petitions to present on behalf of my constitutions.
<P>
	In the first the petitioners are asking for the federal government 
to remove the GST and other tax on reading materials. They urge 
Parliament to remove the GST from books, magazines and 
newspapers. They ask the Prime Minister to carry out his party's 
repeated promise to remove federal sales taxes from reading 
materials.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGEOFCONSENT">AGE OF CONSENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the second 
petition is from constituents who are upset with some recent court 
decisions on the age of consent. They are asking that the age of 
consent be raised to 18. They say the majority of Canadians believe 
that the age of consent laws are designed to control adults who 
want sex with minors.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners pray that Parliament will amend the 
Criminal Code of Canada to set the age of consent at 18, with the 
exception of husband-wife relationships, so as to provide 
protection from exploitation and abuse.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
petition from almost 50 people in the riding of Peterborough who 
are concerned about the immigration tax.
<P>
	Whereas the federal government has imposed an immigration 
tax of $975, whereas this tax is discriminatory with respect to 
perspective immigrants from developing countries where the 
average annual  income is sometimes even less than the amount of 
the tax, and whereas this tax is particular odious when it applies to 
refugees who are among the most destitute of our immigrants, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9998"> 9998 </A></B>
<P>
petitioners call on the government to appeal this immigration tax 
immediately, particularly in the case of refugees.

so I support this petition.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
first petition comes from Delta, B.C. The petitioners draw to the 
attention of the House that our police officers and firefighters place 
their lives at risk on a daily basis as they serve the emergency needs 
of all Canadians.
<P>
	They also state that in many cases the families of firefighters and 
police officers killed in the line of duty are left without sufficient 
financial means to meet their obligations.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to establish 
a public safety officers compensation fund to receive gifts and 
bequests for the benefit of families of police officers and 
firefighters killed in the line of duty.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition comes from my riding of Mississauga South.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that managing 
the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to assist families that choose to provide care in the home 
for preschool children, the chronically ill, the aged or the disabled.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
final petition is from Amherst, Nova Scotia.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that the 
consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems or 
impair one's ability, and specifically that fetal alcohol syndrome 
and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent preventable 
by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers 
and other of the risk associated with alcohol consumption.

to responsibly raise their children according to their own 
conscience and beliefs and to retain section 43 of Canada's 
Criminal Code as it is currently written.

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the privilege of introducing a petition with some 
1,700 signatures.
<P>
	The petitioners point out that effective April 1, 1997 about 33 
per cent of CBC radio and TV programming, both national and 
regional, will be lost. This is because of insufficient financial 
resources due to the Liberal Party's failure to honour its 1993 red 
book commitments.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to immediately 
restore CBC funding to the promised level of financial support 
which existed as of January 1, 1994 so that the cutbacks and the 
layoffs at the CBC can be rescinded.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to present a petition on behalf of 60 of my constituents 
who are concerned about the GST on reading material.
<P>
	The petition reads that the GST is the first federal tax in 
Canadian history to apply to the bible and other reading material.
<P>
	Taxing reading material is unfair and wrong. Literacy and 
reading are critical to Canada's future. Removing the GST from 
reading material will help promote literacy in Canada.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners urge Parliament to remove the GST 
from books, magazines and newspapers.

another 25 signatures from Calgary.
<P>
	These people draw to the attention of the House that section 43 
recognizes the primary role of parents in raising and disciplining 
their children, that the federal government is under pressure from 
various sources including the UN to change section 43, that the 
removal of section 43 would strengthen the role of bureaucrats and 
weaken the role of parents, and that the government now continues

go toward the Canadian military is an infringement of the freedom 
of conscience of those who object to participating in military 
activity.

	The petitioners ask Parliament to establish peace tax legislation

MacLellan, born as a Canadian citizen, was kidnapped by her 
father on October 27, 1996 and taken to Bermuda; whereas the 
mother, Marguerite M. Kopaniak, holds a custody order awarded 
by the Supreme Court of Ontario which found that the father, Peter 
R. MacLellan, is in contempt of said court; and whereas Bermuda 
is not a signatory to the Hague convention, thus eliminating the 
generally adhered to rules to return abducted children to the 
country of original jurisdiction, the petitioners call on  Parliament 
to take action to have the Bermuda authorities recognize and 
honour the Canadian jurisdiction over this child and cause for the 
child to be returned to Canada into the care and custody of the 
mother.

	The House resumed consideration in committee of Bill C-95, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code (criminal organizations) and to 
amend other acts in consequence, Mr. Milliken in the chair.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> House again in committee of the whole 
on Bill C-95. When the committee was interrupted at 2 p.m., clause 
1 of the bill was under consideration. Is there a desire for further 
consideration of clause 1?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Chairman, when the committee rose at two 
o'clock, questions had been put to me by the member for Fraser 
Valley East. In fairness to his questions, it may be best that I record 
my responses now. I can do so very briefly.
<P>
	The hon. member asserted that the chiefs of police have been 
asking for this legislation since 1994 and here we are five days 
before an election call with the bill.
<P>
	First, I do not think that any of us knows when there will be an 
election nor should our actions in the House be based on those 
calculations. We should act as we see it in the public interest, and 
that is what the government is doing.
<P>
	Since at least 1984, the chiefs of police and the police 
community in general have been asking Parliament to give them 
more effective tools to deal with organized crime. The fact that the 
government has listened to the police community saying it needs 
more tools is evidenced by this legislation which has not been 
developed over the last few weeks, but rather emerges from the last 
18 months of methodical preparation and consultation.
<P>
	On March 21, senior ministers of the Quebec government invited 
me to a meeting at which they told me in the presence of some 14 
municipal mayors that they wanted us to accelerate the work which 
was already under way to deal with organized crime. It was in 
connection with that we completed the work we had started 18 
months ago and produced Bill C-95.
<P>
	The hon. member made reference to some newspaper stories 
about how law and politics may commingle. I dare say that these 
issues should not be determined on the basis of the volume of 
newsprint that is generated for one side or the other. Not only do I 
think that the hon. member might find that the volume is very much 
in favour of the government acting decisively to save lives through 
this legislation, I also think we should make our own judgment. As 
parliamentarians it is our duty to do so.
<P>
	We are here today to consider in detail the clauses of the bill. I 
welcome the opportunity and I think we should use our time in that 
way.
<P>
	The hon. member also made reference to some sections in Bill 
C-42, which he said had slipped through the House. I want to assure 
the hon. member that nothing slipped through in Bill C-41. Bill 
C-41 was a comprehensive reform of the sentencing laws in the 
Criminal Code. Among other things it provided for conditional 
sentences, another alternative available to sentencing courts in 
appropriate cases. It did not slip through. It was considered over 
many years and was the subject of broad public comment. It was 
concluded as a strategic decision by the Parliament of Canada to 
provide sentencing courts with a useful alternative.
<P>
	The fact that the section has been amended through Bill C-17 
ought not to discourage parliamentarians. A wide variety of 
legislation can be improved through amendment after experience is 
gained with it. That is exactly what happened with the conditional 
sentencing provisions of Bill C-41. We have now made it clear 
through an amendment, to which all parties agreed, that before the 
courts award a conditional sentence they should have regard not 
only to whether the person might be a danger to the community 
which was the original test, but also all of the principles that 
traditionally govern the determination of sentence, including 
repudiation, deterrence, denunciation and protection of the 
community.
<P>
	Nothing has slipped through. Legislation was enacted by 
Parliament to achieve a purpose. I think it has now been improved 
with the amendment we all agreed on and which forms part of Bill 
C-17.
<P>
	The hon. member then turned to the substance of Bill C-95, and 
he raised questions in relation to the definitions and whether the 
definitions are appropriate for the purpose we are trying to achieve 
with this legislation. I suggest that they are, that they have been 
designed and drafted to catch those who have dedicated their lives 
to the commission of serious crime as a career and who are acting 
in groups for that purpose. That is exactly what we are intending to 
achieve with the definitions that we have chosen.

<P>
	The hon. member made reference to victims. As I said earlier 
today, if we really want to serve the interests of victims, not just 
talk about it with a so-called victims bill of rights-most of which 
deals with provincial jurisdiction anyway-but if we want to cut 
through the rhetoric and get to the results, if we want to set aside 
the slogans and get to the substance, if we want to go beyond the 
symptoms and deal with the sources of the problem, then we should 
look at what Bill C-95 does for us.
<P>
	Last week I met with a victim, a woman who had lost her little 
boy to the gang wars in the Montreal area. He was an 11 year old 
whose innocent life was taken because he was at the wrong place at 
the wrong time, walking down the street on an errand for his 
mother. She is a victim. She is asking Parliament for help. She met 
with me last week and asked me to do everything I could to have 
this bill enacted so that the police would have the tools they could 
use in an effort to find those responsible for taking the life of her 
little boy.
<P>
	Here is something we can do for victims that will mean 
something. It is not just an empty rhetorical flourish to capture the 
newspaper headlines but substantive action that will improve the 
criminal justice system so that we might have fewer victims in the 
future. That is a much more laudable objective and it is for that 
purpose we have introduced Bill C-95.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Minister, I find it very refreshing to hear you in the debate on this 
bill saying that your department has been working on it for 18 
months.
<P>
	However, I find that rather strange, because barely four weeks 
ago the Prime Minister was saying that it did not come under his 
jurisdiction and that he was washing his hands of it. I am very glad 
though that the government changed its position and agrees that it 
is within its jurisdiction to legislate in this area.
<P>
	I would like you to convince me about one thing, because I heard 
you speak on a number of occasions, and when I look at the 
definitions and the wording of the bill, I see that we do not perhaps 
agree on an important point. I wonder if you would tell me clearly 
what clause in this bill applies to the leaders, since you say to the 
press that the bill deals with the leaders?
<P>
	I must say, at the outset, that this bill is a step forward and the 
government is going to do everything it can to get it passed. The 
step you have just taken is something we have been asking for since 
1995. What the government realized just now, we have known 
since 1995. However the government failed to act.
<P>
	Had it acted in time, we would not be considering this bill one 
week before an election call, even though you say you do not know 
the date. Let us not bury our heads in  the sand, we are adults and 
we can see what is going on both in this House and outside it. I do 
not understand why the government did not act faster. That having 
been said, Mr. Rock, where exactly in the bill does it refer to the 
leaders, since, the way I understand it, according to the definitions 
in the bill, a crime has to be committed?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> The hon. member will address the 
Chair, even if we are in committee of the whole.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Chairman, earlier the minister spoke 
directly to someone for 15 minutes and you did not call him to 
order. I will address my remarks to him through you, Mr. 
Chairman.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> It is because you are a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Yes, it is because we are in the Bloc 
Quebecois that we are called to order as the Liberal member across 
has said. However, I will address the Chair, because I am pleased to 
do so.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How sad.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>Earlier we listened to the Liberals, and we 
made no disparaging remarks. I would ask you, Mr. Chairman, to 
ask the members opposite not to make any disparaging remarks 
either, and we will get along just fine.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Chairman, I would like to have the minister tell me where in 
the bill the leaders are mentioned, because, according to the 
definitions in the clause under study and in the subsequent clauses, 
an individual must have committed an offence. We know perfectly 
well that the leaders are not the ones committing the crimes, but 
rather their subordinates.
<P>
	I would like to know from the minister where the bill deals with 
the leaders and how he intends to implement these clauses, if it 
does.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Yes, Mr. Chairman. First, I must respond to the hon. 
member's comment that everyone has been waiting a long time for 
the government to take action on this matter. In fact, we have been 
working on it for a long time, for years. We have heard the views of 
chiefs of police and of police forces throughout Canada. We have 
studied the entire issue and we have acted in consultation with and 
with the backing of police forces.
<P>
	A few days ago, here in the House of Commons, the Prime 
Minister said that responsibility for dealing with this problem did 
not rest solely with the federal government. The provinces also 
have a responsibility, under the Constitution, for the administration 
of the justice system.
<P>
	Everyone knows that there is no miracle solution. People know 
that an answer will not be found overnight. We must all do our part.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10002"> 10002 </A></B>
<P>
	With Bill C-95, the federal government has begun to do its part. 
Now, provincial authorities must ensure that they give police 
officers and counsel the resources they need, and do their part as 
well.
<P>
	In my opinion, we will only be able to move forward if both 
levels of government work together. That is the position taken by 
the Prime Minister, to which the hon. member referred during oral 
question period here in the House.
<P>
	The hon. member is asking me the following question: What 
clauses apply to leaders of gangs and of organized crime? My 
answer is that all the clauses in the bill have this objective. All 
aspects of the bill can be used to prosecute gang leaders. For 
example, we have suggested changes to augment and improve the 
methods of investigation used by police forces against leaders and 
members of gangs and of criminal organizations.
<P>
	The same applies to the clauses dealing with the proceeds of 
criminal activities and the means used to carry out those activities. 
It also applies to the sentences proposed in the bill. They are 
tougher and are aimed at leaders as well as members.
<P>
	Finally, one clause will deal with the order to keep the peace and 
will give the court authority to make an order limiting an 
individual's freedom if the court is convinced there is a reasonable 
fear that the individual might commit a crime described in the bill. 
This is a very valuable tool against leaders of organized crime.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	We discussed this particular aspect with police forces and I can 
say today, in response to the hon. member's questions, that they 
found this a very useful approach, particularly with respect to gang 
leaders.
<P>
	So, this bill provides for a whole range of measures, and 
concrete and specific stages for improving the Criminal Code, for 
giving police forces very useful tools against organized crime in 
general, but in particular against leaders of organized crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Chairman, I think the minister either did 
not understand my question or could not find the clause.
<P>
	I realize that according to the bill-and now I am going beyond 
clause 1, because this goes further than clause 1-the individual 
must have committed a criminal offence. As for ``possession 
without lawful excuse of an explosive substance'', we do not see 
the leaders going around with sticks of dynamite in the trunks of 
their cars. And as for ``possession in association with a criminal 
organization'', the person who manufactures explosive substances 
or has them in his possession is not one of the leaders either.
<P>
	Among all the offences the minister included in Bill C-95, not 
one has a direct impact on the leaders, not one, otherwise the 
minister would have told me which clause.  Even if we consider the 
definitions at the very beginning under ``criminal organization'', it 
says ``having as one of its primary activities the commission of 
indictable offence''-we know that the dirty work is not done by 
the leaders. We do not see the mafia bosses installing dynamite. 
Neither do we see the leaders of biker gangs installing dynamite 
and doing all these things that are harmful to society.
<P>
	I do not understand the hon. member opposite who says it is not 
enough, who says he has the support of Canadian chiefs of police 
and all police forces in Canada and in Quebec and who tells me that 
in Quebec, people are very satisfied with this. Sure, we are very 
satisfied, but once the minister got going, he should have done 
more. It is not true that all chiefs of police and all police forces say 
that this bill mainly affects the leaders. This is a misrepresentation 
of the truth, because this is not what is happening in Quebec. It is 
not the opinion of the people who commented on this bill.
<P>
	I realize this is a step forward, but that is not enough. I again 
want to ask the minister to show me which clause in the bill refers 
specifically to the leaders, to those who are responsible for the 
biker gangs, those who do the planning, who give the orders for 
jobs in Quebec or elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	The minister said in the House earlier that he met the mother of 
young Desrochers. According to this bill, the police is given 
additional powers to carry out investigations and to try and find out 
who installed the bomb and why. Unless I am mistaken, the person 
who ordered this particular job, the leader who was behind all this 
is not affected by Bill C-95, and correct me if I am wrong. So I am 
asking the minister where in Bill C-95 we can find the provisions 
that affect leaders.
<P>
	Even so the bill is a step forward. Before, there was nothing. 
Thanks to the Bloc Quebecois, the government decided to act. The 
minister says he has been working on this for 18 months, but we 
have been asking questions for at least two years about this issue. 
He said there was no problem, that the police had all the elements 
they needed to conduct their investigations, and so forth.
<P>
	And then all of a sudden, he told us he had been examining this 
aspect for 18 months, probably very secretly, because he never told 
us he was looking into this. He even said that the Bloc Quebecois 
was mistaken and that it wanted to make political capital with an 
issue like this. By the way, I think it is odd we are considering this 
bill one week before an election is called.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	So again I want to ask the Minister of Justice who he is very 
knowledgeable on the bill before us, to tell me exactly where this 
clause is. I also have legal training. I am a lawyer, and I will 
understand. Let him say which clause it is. I see no clause that deals 
specifically with leaders. And this is one of the weaknesses of Bill 
C-95.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10003"> 10003 </A></B>
<P>
	I am very anxious to hear the minister say specifically which 
clause concerns the leaders. Is it in a definition? Is it under a 
particular offence? Where is it? I wish someone would tell me 
exactly where we can find the clause that affects the leaders. After 
that, I may have another question for him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, I do not claim that this bill represents 
everything we need to fight organized crime. It is just the first step. 
It is one bill to start things off. It is the first phase in our work. 
There is much yet to be done, but it is a very good start, a very 
valuable start.
<P>
	The hon. member has asked which clause applies to leaders of 
organized crime. As I said, the entire bill can be used against them: 
wiretapping, search warrants, changes to regulations for obtaining 
search warrants, access to tax information-very important for the 
crime kingpins-the fruits and instrumentalities of crime, harsher 
sentences, reversal of the burden of proof for bail, recognizance to 
keep the peace. All of this can be used directly against the leaders. 
As I said, those on the front line, that is to say, the police forces, 
agree that these measures will be highly effective in attaining this 
objective.
<P>
	Another important point is that these measures can be used 
indirectly against the leaders. In other words, if, using these 
investigative means, a person can be found who worked with a 
group in an act of gang violence or is associated with a gang and if 
that person can be accused of an offence under our bill, with a harsh 
sentence of 14 years to be served consecutive to all of the other 
sentences, we have an indirect means of obtaining evidence against 
the leaders. The police forces have told me that, with such a tool, 
they can get information out of an accused in exchange for a 
reduced sentence, if they act as an informant and help the police in 
their investigation.
<P>
	Directly or indirectly, this bill gives us concrete and effective 
means to investigate and put an end to organized crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, what the minister just said 
about harsher sentences, bail and peace bonds clearly applies to 
gang leaders. That is not the issue.
<P>
	The issue is: Where, in the bill, are the additional powers given 
police authorities so they can get to the leaders of these biker gangs 
or criminal organizations?
<P>
	If it makes the other side react, it is usually because we hit a 
nerve.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Once these leaders are grabbed by police, they will indeed be 
subject to the provisions on harsher penalties, bail and peace bonds. 
I agree and I have no problem with that. However, the bill does not 
give police officers more power to go after these leaders.
<P>
	Let me go back to the example provided earlier by the minister 
himself, the case of the Desrochers boy. It is not the leaders who 
went out and put the bomb under the vehicle that exploded. The 
leader simply told one of his henchmen: ``Mr. X is starting to get on 
my nerves. I want him out of the picture. Do what you have to do''. 
The leader gives the order to his henchmen who then go out and set 
off the bomb. However, under this bill, it is the person who sets off 
the bomb who will face the harsher penalty, who will have more 
difficulty getting bail, who will be slapped with a peace bond or 
what have you. It will not be the leaders.
<P>
	I will ask the question for the third time, and I promise it will be 
the last time. If the minister does not mention the specific clause, 
then it is because the clause does not exist. I will be convinced of 
that beyond a reasonable doubt. Will the minister tell me exactly 
where in the bill are these additional powers given the police to go 
after the leaders? Because if we do not go after the leaders, we may 
end up having more hit men in jail, but the leaders will always be 
able to find others to do the job for them.
<P>
	For the last time, I ask the minister: Where, in this bill, are the 
provisions that specifically target gang leaders? All the provisions 
on offenses clearly stipulate that they must have committed the 
offence. So before the minister tells me which specific clause of the 
bill provides for such powers, he must answer this question: Does 
he agree that those who commit such offenses are usually not the 
leaders, but their henchmen?
<P>
	If the minister answers yes to that question, maybe he can tell me 
where in the bill are the specific provisions targeting gang leaders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, since the question was repeated, I 
have to repeat the answer. As I have already pointed out, we have 
taken all the measures needed to deal with gang leaders. Even in 
the question he put, the hon. member provided us with an example. 
He said that the explosive charges are not set by the leaders, but by 
those who help the gangs.
<P>
	As the hon. member mentioned, it is necessary for gang leaders 
to communicate with others to let them know where to set the 
explosive charges. So they must be able to contact their members 
or their associates.
<P>
	First of all, we improved the Criminal Code provisions 
concerning electronic surveillance to make it easier for the police 
to monitor and record communications between gang leaders and 
their members. So the changes relating to electronic surveillance 
can be used to catch the leaders.
<P>
	Then we have a peace order that can prohibit a gang leader from 
contacting another person. If the leader does so anyway, he may be 
charged for violating the order. The bill provides for a prison term 
in such cases. So, all of these clauses and all of these measures can 
be used against gang leaders.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10004"> 10004 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	We do not need one specific clause dealing with leaders. All of 
the bill's provisions empower the police. So, I have to repeat 
myself, because I already have answered this question. It is the 
same question, so I have to give the same answer as before.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Chairman, 
just before question period I posed a question to the minister and 
probably as a classic mistake gave him and his department all kinds 
of time to put together a long political type of an answer in which 
he charged back that the Reform Party was not interested in 
specifics. He knows full well that if the Reform Party had not 
agreed to go to this procedure of committee of the whole, if we had 
not agreed to fast track this bill, it would not have a snowball's 
chance of becoming law.
<P>
	Of course we are interested in specific proposals. The minister 
knows that. I am interested to know how he picks one bill over 
another.
<P>
	This bill will likely become law tonight. I am not thrilled with 
the process. I still think it is a lousy process not to have a day or 
two in committee to hear witnesses and consider amendments.
<P>
	That being said, I am interested to know how the minister chose 
this bill for fast tracking. He has our agreement to do it. We are 
here today to do that. Why for instance did the minister not choose 
to fast track the DNA legislation also or instead of this bill? What 
was his criteria in picking this bill as the premier bill to get through 
before the election?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> First, I undertake that the answers I give will be no 
more political than the questions I receive from the party opposite. 
Before two o'clock I had to listen to a question that was steeped, 
that indeed was suffused in partisan rhetoric and so it was 
necessary for me to respond by setting the record straight.
<P>
	This bill will not be law tonight because it has to go to other 
place. It may be passed in this House today and if it is, I think we 
will have done a real service.
<P>
	The hon. member asks about the priority of bills and why the 
DNA bill is not going forward at the same pace. As the solicitor 
general made clear when he tabled that bill, the DNA legislation, 
Bill C-94, covers some matters which are still truly controversial. 
There are real debates in policy and in law about the better course 
to pursue. The solicitor general has chosen to ask the committee to 
consider that bill after first reading and before adoption in principle 
by the House so as to leave open to parliamentarians the 
opportunity to question the basic approach suggested on the main 
issues in that legislation.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association has its own viewpoint as to 
how the bill should operate and when samples should be taken and 
the rules of access to samples in the  data bank. If we speak to civil 
libertarians or women's groups we receive very different 
responses. Questions arose the very first day when the bill was 
tabled that demonstrate the extent to which there is controversy on 
those subjects. In relation to the DNA legislation, Bill C-94, there 
are still important policy issues to be canvassed and resolved.
<P>
	In relation to this legislation, the proposals are of a different 
order. Here we propose specific, concrete, practical changes to the 
Criminal Code that will take existing investigative techniques 
which have been part of our criminal law for generations and 
change access to those techniques in the unique circumstance of 
investigating organized crime.
<P>
	We also have a definition of organized crime which has been 
carefully crafted to encompass the most serious offences 
committed over an extended period of time and a group which is 
dedicated to that serious kind of crime.
<P>
	We have resorted to traditional criminal law techniques such as 
increasing sentences, providing that membership or association in 
organized crime is an aggravating factor in determining the 
sentence.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	There is also an elaboration of an existing peace bond provision, 
through proposed 810.3 in a way that builds upon sections that are 
already in the Criminal Code and which have been tested for some 
time. The same can be said of the fruits of crime and the 
instrumentalities of crime.
<P>
	Whereas in DNA we are embarking on a brave new world with a 
technique which has been in place in only three other countries that 
we know of, with Bill C-95 we are building upon existing 
mechanisms and existing laws, elaborating on them to meet a 
specific threat, the threat of organized crime.
<P>
	I think this is far more appropriate for the disposition of the 
House. It could very well be that the other place will hold hearings. 
As far as I understand it, it intends to hold hearings. If the hon. 
member wants an occasion to hear other voices, I believe the other 
place will provide that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Chairman, this is a free question which the 
minister can bat out of the park.
<P>
	Some people will say that once again this is a bill that is catering 
to the headlines: ``Liberals under attack on Quebec''. They must do 
something and therefore they are responding with this bill today 
because it is a Quebec issue and that is the reason for the bill 
coming forward now in its present format.
<P>
	What does the minister say to those critics? Does he say that this 
bill is not a Quebec bill? Does he say that it is a Criminal Code bill? 
I am practically putting the answer in his mouth. Is that the answer? 
Is this a Quebec bill, or is this just a bill whose time has come?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10005"> 10005 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, perhaps the best way to respond to 
that question is to use an example that the hon. member will find 
relevant from his own personal experience.
<P>
	Three weeks ago I spoke with the chief of police and the mayor 
of Vancouver. I told them of our intensified work in seeking to craft 
legislation which would provide police with better tools in their 
fight against gangs and organized crime. Chief Canuel and Mayor 
Owen enthusiastically encouraged me in my work and asked for an 
opportunity to comment on the proposals we had under 
consideration.
<P>
	Chief Canuel told me of incidents in Vancouver involving gang 
activity, involving organized crime. He reminded me that the need 
for this legislation is as great or greater in other parts of the country 
than it is in Quebec. The mayor of Vancouver took the same 
position. When I spoke to the Attorney General of British 
Columbia, the hon. Ujjal Dosanjh, he was most constructive and 
enthusiastic. He encouraged me in this work. He asked me to work 
quickly, as did colleague attorneys general across the country.
<P>
	I received a letter from the Vancouver police department 
proposing specific measures to be included in this bill. We were 
able to include five or six of the specific proposals that the chief in 
Vancouver said he would find very important in his work.
<P>
	This bill does not concern a specific province. It does not 
concern a particular place. The bill seeks to address a problem 
which can be found in various forms throughout this great country. 
It is an affliction which we have to deal with in every province and 
in both territories. One of the enduring values of the legislation is 
that it will put useful tools into the hands of police forces 
throughout Canada.
<P>
	Let the headlines say what they will. Governments are always 
either before or after elections. If something is introduced within 
six months of an election, it is branded as a cynical ploy. I would 
rather remember the image I have in my mind of the mother with 
whom I met last week in Montreal who lost her son in a gang war. 
She said to me: ``Put aside politics. Get this legislation in place. 
Give the police the tools. I want them to find the people responsible 
for taking the life of my son''.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	That has nothing to do with elections. It is doing something 
meaningful in criminal law to help a victim, to help police and to 
try to achieve a common objective, which is to rid the country of 
organized crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> I agree with the minister that the legislation needs to 
be passed. Of course we will support it. The minister knows that. 
We are happy to do that, except for the reservations I mentioned 
earlier.
<P>
	I am interested, however, in the motion the House passed more 
than a year ago regarding distinct society. It might be called the 
distinct society motion. All legislative branches would treat 
Quebec as a distinct society and keep that in mind when they are 
drafting legislation. That was the instruction that came from the 
House, or words to that effect.
<P>
	When the minister is drafting legislation does he take the distinct 
society clause into consideration? Did he have it in mind when he 
drafted the bill? The minister has been instructed to do so. I would 
be interested to know what impact it had on the legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> This is not one of those ways in which Quebec forms 
a distinct society within Canada. This problem is not unique to 
Quebec. It is found throughout the country. The legislation speaks 
to a problem which is pan-Canadian. I wish sometimes the problem 
of organized crime was confined to a particular area but it is not.
<P>
	In February 1996 the police sat the solicitor general and I down 
and took us through virtually a full day's briefing on the state of 
organized crime. We heard from the Criminal Intelligence Service 
Canada, the RCMP and the organized crime committee of the 
chiefs of police. They talked about the different forms in which 
organized crime is found whether it is in Atlantic Canada, in 
Ontario, on the prairies or on the west coast. It is remarkable the 
number of forms in which corruption, intimidation and violence 
can be found, all in a ruthless effort to squeeze profit out of 
innocent people and to victimize others.
<P>
	This is not something distinctly associated with one province or 
one area of the country. It is a problem which is Canada wide and 
requires a Canada-wide solution if we are to deal with it. That is 
why the legislation is of general application.
<P>
	I spoke with the chiefs of police in Halifax, Toronto, Ottawa and 
Winnipeg. I spoke with the attorneys general of Manitoba and 
Ontario. In all those conversations I was encouraged in this work. 
The methods we were looking at struck a responsive chord because 
all those law officers know we are not dealing here with a distinct 
Quebec issue but with a scourge that afflicts the country as a whole.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> I do not deny that. I confirm that. I affirm the 
minister's statements. I am sure he would have support for that.
<P>
	I was merely trying to establish whether that distinct society 
clause the House past more than a year ago had any effect on 
drafting legislation, especially when it was at the request of the 
Quebec government. I agree with the minister that it is a 
country-wide problem. Like most problems in the country it does 
not lend itself to the distinctiveness of any one province. It needs to 
be addressed in a Canada-wide way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10006"> 10006 </A></B>
<P>
	The question I left with the minister just before question period 
concerned a clarification that criminal organization means any 
group consisting of more than five persons. If I understood his 
argument before question period, persons are anybody over the age 
of 12. Is that what will be applied in this case, or when is a person 
a person in this law?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Person will have its usual and ordinary meaning.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	As I said before in the first segment of this committee meeting, 
the definition and the measures contained in Bill C-95 apply to any 
group of persons consisting of those who have engaged in the 
commission of serious indictable offences over the last five years 
and where the group has as one of its primary activities the 
commission of those offences. There will be no exemption from the 
definition by reason of age.
<P>
	The criteria are dependent upon offences in the code which are 
indictable and punishable by a maximum of five or more years 
imprisonment. That does not disqualify young offenders. Anyone 
who meets that definition will be covered. As I said in answer to 
the questions put by the hon. member for Crowfoot, it may be that a 
particular accused because of the Young Offenders Act will face 
the jeopardy governed by the Young Offenders Act. That does not 
mean that Bill C-95 does not apply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> That is the point people want to know about. Young 
offenders are being used as mules in the drug trade. It is commonly 
done in the west. People want assurances in that regard. There 
could be a group of five of which only one is of legal age. However 
it would still cover that person.
<P>
	We could call it a gang. We could get the guy who is living off 
the avails of and corrupting youth. We could charge him under all 
kinds of jurisdictions. Even if no one in the gang is of legal age, we 
could still use the legislation for enhanced wiretap accessibility and 
all the other good things the minister mentioned.
<P>
	I assure the minister that out west organized crime is often made 
up of largely under age people. That is the shame of it. Two or three 
kingpins frequently use young people because they get off with 
lighter sentences or with immunity if they are young enough. That 
has been documented on the west coast and I am sure across 
Canada.
<P>
	People need assurances that it will cover groups even if they are 
not of legal age.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> That is exactly what we intend. In relation to my 
interpretation of the act, I invite the member to look at section 20 of 
the Young Offenders Act as an example of what I am talking about. 
It relates to young persons being found guilty of offences for which 
the  punishment provided by the Criminal Code or any other act of 
Parliament is imprisonment for life.
<P>
	In other words, section 20 of the Young Offenders Act speaks 
about offences provided for in the Criminal Code for which the 
punishment may be more than that which can be given under the 
Young Offenders Act. It does not mean the offences do not apply to 
young people. They certainly do. It simply means that if a person of 
that age is charged, they are transferred and the maximum 
contained in the Young Offenders Act applies.
<P>
	I know the situation described by the hon. member is true. I have 
spent evenings travelling with the youth gang section of the 
Winnipeg police force. I went out in their cars with them. I watched 
while they cruised the streets. I listened to their explanations of the 
kinds of crimes they investigate. I walked the beat with police 
officers of the Edmonton police force. I spent an evening on the 
streets of Vancouver with members of the Vancouver police force, 
sometimes driving and sometimes walking along the streets and the 
back alleys of downtown Vancouver. I saw for myself the extent to 
which young people are tragically caught up in crime and all too 
often at the direction of older people.
<P>
	I spent time driving through the streets with the Calgary police 
force, seeing young people involved in unlawful activity and too 
often under the direction or encouragement of older people.
<P>
	I well recognize the same could be said of Toronto, Halifax, 
Quebec City and Ottawa. In each of those places I have travelled 
with the police in their cars to watch them at work and to see for 
myself very troubling, very serious situations.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	Our intention with this statute is to catch the kind of case to 
which the hon. member has referred. The investigative tools will be 
available to police officers looking into groups that involve people 
under the age of 18 to see if they are engaged in the commission of 
offences for which penalties are described under the Criminal 
Code. That is the intention and based on this wording I believe that 
is the effect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Chairman, we are 
talking about serious offences, offences that carry a minimum 
penalty of over five years.
<P>
	The minister has provided that kind of penalty in Bill C-68. That 
means a group of hunters or a group of farmers or a group of people 
who own firearms like .22 calibre gopher rifles and do not want to 
register them fall within that category. I suppose they could be 
designated as members of a criminal organization if there were five 
of them.
<P>
	If their primary activity could be determined to be failure to 
register their firearms and challenging the gun law in court, it could 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10007"> 10007 </A></B>
<P>
be considered to be a series of  offences. Would they fall into the 
category of a criminal organization?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, it is remarkable, no matter what the 
subject, how the hon. member somehow finds a gun in it 
somewhere. Such is his dedication and his passion of commitment 
to opposing gun control in Canada. It is regrettable.
<P>
	I happen to think the hon. member is completely out of step with 
the vast majority of Canadian people who want to see us take 
military type assault weapons off the street. I think the vast 
majority of Canadians support the fact that we banned the future 
sale and import of most cheaply made handguns called Saturday 
Night Specials that have killed so many police officers in the U.S. 
We do not want them in Canada.
<P>
	The majority of Canadians support gun control which gives 
police officers the tools they need to take guns out of the hands of 
people who should not have them. It is regrettable that no matter 
what the subject, the bill, the measure or the objective, the hon. 
member will find some way to bring it back to his passionate 
commitment to oppose gun control which is so broadly supported 
in the country. It is odd and curious, but it is something I have to 
live with. In living with it let me do the best I can to respond to the 
question in which the hon. member has laboured to make firearms 
somehow relevant to anti-gang legislation.
<P>
	I do not think the example given by the hon. member could 
possibly be. I suppose we could invent facts to make it happen, but 
he is talking about individuals acting on individual occasions and 
not respecting the law passed by Parliament. I hope all Canadians 
would respect the law passed by Parliament. He may know some 
people who do not or will not. That is interesting.
<P>
	Let us get back to what Bill C-95 is all about. Let us get back to 
what the anti-organized crime bill is all about. It is all about those 
who band together in groups or associations to ruthlessly dedicate 
their lives and their efforts to profit at the expense of others and 
sometimes at the expense of the lives of others.
<P>
	It is about giving police tools to deal with those who would put at 
risk the lives of families and of children by battling over turf for 
illegal drug distribution. It is about finding a way to deal with 
hardened criminals, career criminals who over the last five years 
have committed a series of serious criminal offences and are 
committing indictable crimes punishable by five years or more in 
prison.
<P>
	This is the hard core of organized crime in Canada. They are at 
war right now in the province of Quebec. The cost has been 
measured in human lives, in the peace of mind of communities. I 
met people from towns and cities in Quebec who are not able to 
take their children for a walk down their own street, who tell me 
they are  afraid to go to parks in their towns and who feel their 
communities are under siege.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They live in fear in their communities. This is unacceptable in 
Canada. The conditions described by the people who live in these 
towns and villages in Quebec cannot be tolerated. I met with the 
mayors of some of these communities. They told me straight off 
that these conditions were unacceptable, and I agree with them. 
That is why we took action. We have now done our share to amend 
the Criminal Code and to propose measures that will help our 
police forces fight these offences.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is what this bill is all about. As much as the hon. member 
might use his creativity to imagine ways to make his opposition to 
gun control relevant to an organized crime bill, it is interesting, 
creative and mildly amusing. It is even charming in a way because 
the hon. member has made such a career out of it. However, it is 
hardly relevant, not helpful and it is broadly off the point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, what is regrettable is that the 
justice minister, in creating that bill, placed the maximum penalty 
of 10 years for a person knowingly failing to register their .22 
gopher rifle. That is what he has done. He has gone to great lengths 
in his answer to suggest that this is not an issue that should be 
raised and overlooks the fact that he has created such a severe 
penalty that it makes anyone who chooses to challenge that law in a 
court, like the three provinces and the territories are doing, come 
under at least the eaves trough of this bill.
<P>
	That is what is regrettable as far as the justice minister's 
response is concerned. Some concerns were indicated in some 
newspaper articles about how the bill may be applied in such a way 
that it was not meant by the justice department or justice minister 
to be applied. We have good evidence of that kind of legislation 
going through the House and Bill C-41 is a good example. He, by 
his own admission, did not expect the conditional sentencing to be 
used in the manner that allows rapists to walk free.
<P>
	We have to look at the minister's rationale in this when he 
suggests that we do not have to worry about this. Maybe he does 
not have to worry, but as representatives of the people of this 
country and as the guardians of their rights when it comes to 
legislation like this, it is very appropriate that not only do we 
examine this bill but its ramifications as may occur through the 
interpretation of the very clauses of the bill and the terms that lie 
undefined.
<P>
	I would like to ask the justice minister the following question. 
There have been over 60 gang related murders in Quebec since 
October 1994 to 1995. Eighty gang  members were arrested and 
charged for some 200 offences. Outside of the extension of the 
wiretap laws which may help the investigating peace officer to 
investigate a murder, how is this bill going to help those 
investigating police officers apprehend those responsible for these 
murders, including those who set the bomb off that killed the little 
11 year 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10008"> 10008 </A></B>
<P>
old boy? How is this bill going to help other than perhaps the 
extension of the wiretap laws?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, the hon. member has told me that he 
and his colleagues in the Reform Party support this bill. I hope he 
has a better understanding than he has indicated of how the bill is 
going to help.
<P>
	When you have a medical problem you go to a doctor. When you 
have a legal problem you go to a lawyer. When you want to know 
what will help the police in what they are doing to combat crime on 
the streets you go to the police. That is what we did. We went to the 
police.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I spoke with Chief Duchesneau, the director of the Montreal 
Urban Community Police Department. I met with Chief Richard 
Renaud from Quebec. I met with a dozen chiefs of police and 
directors of police departments three weeks ago in Hull. I talked 
with police forces about their needs and about the changes that 
could be made to the Criminal Code to give them better tools to 
fight organized crime. Most of the measures contained in Bill C-95 
were proposed by police officers. They have been working with us 
for months to find ways to deal with this problem.
<P>
	The police themselves think that these measures will improve 
the law and help us arrest and prosecute those responsible for the 
murders referred to by the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We did not develop these proposals in a vacuum. We did not 
develop them in the absence of practical advice from the police on 
the street. We worked very closely with the police community in 
devising these measures. We have given the police tools that will 
help them.
<P>
	The hon. member asks how and he referred to wiretaps. Far more 
than that is given by this bill. It is permitted to seal up information 
on which warrants are obtained in order to protect the 
confidentiality of informants, in order to protect the lives of 
informants, in order to make it easier for police to derive 
information from third parties to help them in their war on 
organized crime.
<P>
	It is provided that, under certain circumstances, with court order, 
investigating officers can get access to income tax information in 
the course of investigating organized crime. That is a rare event. To 
the present, Revenue Canada and Finance, because of the 
traditional  confidentiality of income tax information, has 
permitted access to investigating officers only in a limited category 
of cases. We propose to expand that to include the participation 
offence in organized crime.
<P>
	The legislation will permit the seizing not only of the proceeds 
of crime but any property used to help commit organized crime, 
including real estate if it is fortified or modified to enable or 
facilitate the commission of those offences.
<P>
	The legislation provides for stern, stiff prison sentences for those 
who engage in organized crime. Let me make that point clear so 
that the hon. member sees the full force and effect of these 
provisions.
<P>
	Not only the leaders that the hon. member for the Bloc was 
asking about, but members and even strangers to the group who are 
enticed for cash, for example, to transport, to store or to place 
explosives on the part of a criminal organization, these stiff 
sentences will stand in the way of anyone who is complicit with 
organized crime.
<P>
	The onus on bail applications for those arrested on organized 
crime offences are reversed. The court in sentencing for organized 
crime offences and for explosives offences committed in 
connection with organized crime are required not only to impose 
the stiff sentence but required that it be served consecutive to any 
other sentence the person is then serving or to which they may be 
required to serve as a result of other infractions.
<P>
	The police, with the authority of the attorney general of the 
province, will be given the powerful tool of seeking a judicial 
restraint order where there are grounds on which a judge can 
conclude that there is a reasonable basis to fear that someone will 
commit an organized crime offence.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	That is determined on the civil balance of probabilities and not 
the criminal beyond a reasonable doubt. The court will be 
empowered to make an order limiting the liberty of that person, 
requiring that person to comply with conditions that are 
appropriate, that may, for example, prohibit one member of such a 
group from communicating with others.
<P>
	These are powerful and important tools that the police welcome. 
If the chiefs of police believe that these tools will assist in their 
efforts against organized crime, if those who are on the ground 
dealing with these problems day after day who have developed 
expertise, who have experience, believe that these tools are 
powerful and useful, to be a first step, to be the first phase, 
establishing a framework to which can be added more in the 
months and years ahead, then I say we should conclude that not 
only in our own judgment but based on the advice of those who 
know from their own experience that this bill is going to make a 
difference out where it belongs, in the real world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10009"> 10009 </A></B>
<P>
	Before I conclude, in answer to the hon. member's question, 
he referred to registering guns. In a pattern that has become all 
too distressingly familiar over the years, as he has returned with 
his remarkable attachment to his opposition to any form of gun 
control, the hon. member seeks to instil the hysterical reaction 
which he seeks in others by overstating his case.
<P>
	The hon. member knows full well that if someone fails to 
register the garden variety .22, we have provided not in the 
Criminal Code, but in the firearms act, for a remedy which falls far 
short of the draconian consequences to which he has referred. The 
hon. member takes a hypothetical case and attaches to it the most 
extreme result.
<P>
	I think the country is on to his pattern of activity by now. Just in 
case there is anyone out there who has not seen the hon. member at 
work in the past on this subject, for the record it should be noted 
that he has once again misstated the case in order to encourage over 
reaction to legislation that he has been opposed to from the outset 
because he just does not like gun control.
<P>
	As I say, it is regrettable he is so out of step with the vast 
majority of Canadians. I guess that is something he is going to have 
to live with.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to reassure 
Reform members. Everyone in the House knows that the distinct 
society motion agreed to has never been used to pass any 
legislation whatsoever. It is a meaningless motion, and Quebec as a 
distinct society is in no way at issue in Bill C-95. In this regard, I 
must say that the minister is right. The problem of gangs does not 
exist only in Quebec, but is spreading and is also very present in 
Ontario and in the other provinces of English Canada.
<P>
	That having been said, my other comment concerns the answers 
the minister has given to a number of questions. Several times, he 
said it was unacceptable that people should be afraid to walk on the 
street in towns in Quebec, that, in Canada, mothers should be afraid 
to let their children go outside, and so on.
<P>
	I am very pleased that the minister has said this in the House, and 
that he has also admitted that it was urgent to act in such a situation, 
given that, I remind you, we have been asking the minister to act 
for two years now. I congratulate him on having seen that what the 
Bloc Quebecois was calling for made good sense and on 
introducing legislation along the lines of what we have pointing out 
for at least two years.
<P>
	But what strikes me is that the minister said several times that 
this is a first step. It is a step in the direction of what police forces 
have been calling for. It is a first step. He has repeated this at least 
ten times since oral question period.
<P>
	My first question, and later on I will have another, is that, while 
they were drafting such a bill, why did the minister not take more 
than that one step?
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Why did the minister not go a bit further regarding leaders, 
among other things, and regarding the demands made by Quebec 
City and certain mayors as well that the minister met with? I am 
very happy that he met these demands because, once again, it was 
the Bloc Quebecois that really backed him into a corner, so he 
decided to go to Quebec City. The air in that city did him good, 
because when he came back it was an urgent matter. Before he left 
for Quebec City, there was no rush. So this is an extremely 
important point. The air in Quebec City did the Minister of Justice 
a lot of good.
<P>
	Given that he himself admits it is a first step, and it seems to be a 
small one because he has mentioned it so many times, why did the 
minister not decide to take more steps in the fight against crime?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock: </B>First of all, Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out 
that, as a government, we have acted promptly and effectively in 
response to the demands, not only from the Government of Quebec, 
but also from police forces throughout Canada, with respect to 
organized crime.
<P>
	Not only have we reacted with Bill C-95, now before us, but we 
have also passed Bill C-17. When I was in Quebec with my 
counterpart, Quebec Minister of Justice Paul Bégin, he asked me to 
act to fight organized crime in the Criminal Code, and also to get 
C-17 through rapidly, which we did. That bill is now in the other 
place.
<P>
	We also passed Bill C-8 against the drug and narcotic traffickers. 
These are very valuable measures for the police forces, including 
the organized crime squads.
<P>
	But with Bill C-95, we decided not to go with the option whereby 
mere membership in an organization would constitute a criminal 
offence. That proposal came mainly from Nr. Bégin and the 
Government of Quebec, who asked for an amendment to the 
Criminal Code making mere membership in a criminal 
organization a criminal offence. The idea, I presume, was to have a 
schedule to the legislation which would list the criminal groups and 
gangs
<P>
	We looked seriously at that option. We studied the consequences 
and concluded that such an approach would be unconstitutional; it 
was neither desirable nor necessary to go beyond the law or the 
legal framework to have an effective and durable bill. We therefore 
decided on other measures, which are now in Bill C-95.
<P>
	We are convinced that our approach is valid and constitutional. It 
is very important to me to avoid raising false hopes. For us, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10010"> 10010 </A></B>
<P>
adopting a measure such as the one proposed by Mr. Bégin, only to 
have the courts toss it out in six months, would be an approach that 
would raise  false hopes among Quebecers and Canadians. So we 
found a response or a valid approach to this situation.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member asks why we went no further. In my opinion, 
this bill is the start, the first phase in our legislative response to 
organized crime. Without a doubt, we are going to find the other 
approaches in the months and years to come. For the moment, 
however, the measures before the House are valid, constitutional 
and also, I believe, effective.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Chairman, what I understand is that they 
are introducing the first phase because they do not know what to 
propose in the further phases. The minister has just said so. I 
understand.
<P>
	What I do not understand however is when he says that it was 
quick and effective. Again, I remind members that we have been 
asking the government to introduce this bill for two years now.
<P>
	The same thing can be said about Bill C-17. The minister spoke 
about it three or four times. I remind him that this bill had been 
introduced back in 1994. The Bloc Quebecois had to threaten the 
government to propose anti-biker amendments in order to get the 
minister to bring that bill back to the House and have it passed.
<P>
	There is another point I want to raise with the minister. The 
government of Quebec and the Bloc Quebecois raised on several 
occasions the issue of crime proceeds and money laundering in 
Canada. Again today, a newspaper mentioned that legislation on 
money laundering is very difficult to implement because there are 
so many loopholes. Reference is made to Canadian policemen; they 
must be the ones the minister says he has met several times. I also 
met several chiefs of police and policemen in Quebec, who told me 
almost the opposite of what the minister has been telling this House 
for the last little while, in particular about the legislation on money 
laundering, about which they were almost unanimous. I have even 
talked to judges and attorneys general of Canada. So, we read in the 
paper this morning that the police in Canada would love to have 
half or even one quarter of the measures that exist in similar 
legislation in the United States.
<P>
	As for the whole issue of anti-biker or anti-gang or anti-crime in 
general, we in the Bloc Quebecois have said repeatedly that stricter 
legislation is needed on money laundering.
<P>
	I realize that Bill C-95 contains provisions concerning the 
seizure of real property or other property. I know that Bill C-95 is a 
step forward. However, this is nothing compared with what chiefs 
of police have been asking for years in the way of legislation on 
money laundering.
<P>
	While the minister was at it, why did he not add some 
amendments on money laundering, in order to make this activity 
more difficult in Canada? Now we are known as  the drug 
trafficker's paradise. We already knew that Canada was a tax haven 
for money laundering. The minister should realize there is some 
urgency in this case as well, and even the Bloc Quebecois would 
have liked to see him pass legislation to deal with this.
<P>
	As far as money laundering is concerned, when we talk to the 
police, they say that between 20 and 30 billion dollars are 
laundered annually. A judge of the Quebec Superior Court told me 
it could be as much as 50 or 60 billion dollars.
<P>
	Again, considering the urgent nature of these demands which, I 
think, we made very clear to the government, the same way we did 
in the case of anti-biker legislation, I want to ask the minister why, 
when he was working on this bill, he did not introduce legislation 
to make it well nigh impossible to launder money, an activity that is 
today a disaster for the economy? And tomorrow it will be even 
worse for Quebec, for a sovereign Quebec, but for Canada as well.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, the hon. member mentioned his 
interest in the issue of money laundering. As I said before, we 
already adopted Bill C-17. In this bill, sections 27 to 39 deal with 
money laundering. Most of the improvements mentioned by the 
hon. member have already been passed in Bill C-17.
<P>
	Of course we need more. As I said before, we do not see Bill 
C-95 as the last phase of our efforts but as an initial step. So let us 
start with the first step, and then in a few months or a few years we 
will propose other measures, but for the first time, this bill will 
provide a legal framework for dealing with organized crime.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Chairman, we have 
here another term that is not defined. Would the justice minister 
tell us what he means by the term explosive substance in clause 
2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Chairman, I believe the relevant section of the 
code is section 82 which provides for the original offence. The code 
also contains the the definition of explosive substance. It includes 
anything intended to be used to make an explosive substance; 
anything or any part thereof used or intended to be used or adapted 
to cause or to aid in causing an explosion in or with an explosive 
substance; and an incendiary grenade, fire bomb, molotov cocktail 
or other similar incendiary substance or device and a delaying 
mechanism or other thing intended for use in connection with such 
a substance or device.
<P>
	That definition has been in the code for some years. It has been 
the subject of jurisprudence. It is well known in the courts. We used 
it in this section, intending it to have the same meaning it always 
had for many years.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in accordance with subsection 54(3) of the act to extend the present laws of 
Canada that provide access to information under the control of the Government of 
Canada, Chapter A-1, of the Revised Statutes of Canada 1985, this House approve 
the reappointment of John Grace as Information Commissioner, to hold office until 
December 31, 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform 
Party is prepared to accept the motion of the parliamentary 
secretary on the basis that the Information Commissioner is 
approved not only by the House of Commons but by the Senate. 
That process being in place is a good precedent for other persons 
appointed by government into a variety of positions.
<P>
	Mr. Grace was appointed on July 2, 1990 and his term will expire 
on July 1, 1997. Certainly it would be of benefit to extend it to the 
end of the year.
<P>
	In principle the other 2,000 appointments that are often 
considered as patronage appointments by government should 
receive some kind of scrutiny just like this appointment. That 
certainly would make for a better understanding by the general 
public and would most likely bring forward a better quality of 
person.
<P>
	John Grace, the current Information Commissioner, has been 
extremely fair and diligent and has served Canadians well. We are 
prepared to move and support the extension of his term for six 
months.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank all 
the members of this House, my colleagues from all parties, for 
agreeing to pass this bill today. The Reform Party, the Bloc 
Quebecois, all the parties have co-operated in allowing the 
government to pass this bill today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is a reflection of the importance all members of the House 
place on the effort to give police forces the important tools they 
need in combating organized crime.
<P>
	The House has joined together today to clear the way for the 
adoption of legislation which I believe and contend is both valid 
and effective in helping the police achieve the objectives we all 
share.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, we believe that all our proposals will help the police 
achieve their goal, which is to stop criminals.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We believe that these proposals to fight organized crime will 
help police put out of business those whose business is committing 
crime in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have proposed a new approach to fighting gang activity by 
criminalizing participation in a criminal organization and adding to 
the Criminal Code a new definition of criminal organization 
offence. But this new offence does not outlaw membership in a 
criminal organization. In fact, combined with the new definition, it 
provides the basis for the implementation of new investigative 
procedures and Criminal Code provisions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We propose this new approach to fighting gang activity by 
creating the offence of participation in a criminal organization; not 
criminalizing mere membership, but rather creating a new 
framework by establishing a new category of crime, allowing 
police access in that category to exceptional methods of detection 
and investigation, providing for tougher penalties and sending the 
message that we are devoting specific efforts to battling organized 
crime.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10014"> 10014 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have proposed giving the police new powers to seize the 
proceeds of crime in relation to a criminal organization offence 
and, with prior judicial authorization, have access to tax 
information regarding the activities of criminal organizations.
<P>
	We are adding to the Criminal Code new offences and new 
sentences regarding the use of explosives as part of a criminal 
organization's activities.
<P>
	We are adding to the Criminal Code new sentencing provisions, 
especially with respect to parole eligibility as relates to certain 
criminal organization offences.
<P>
	We will allow measures to be taken in support of police 
surveillance of gang activities.
<P>
	Concerning criminal organization leaders, a new power is being 
given to sentencing tribunals to preserve peace by preventing them 
from engaging in their illicit activities.
<P>
	To us, this is a first step in the right direction, and more will have 
to be done to put organized crime out of business and put an end to 
gang activities.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that, although the pace has picked up these 
past four weeks at Justice Canada, these proposals were in fact 
nearly two years in the making. During this past year, the Solicitor 
General of Canada and myself had discussions with the police 
community and held a national forum on organized crime eight 
months ago. These proposals are the result of this thorough and 
systematic review.
<P>
	I also want to say that, even though biker wars have been raging 
primarily in Quebec, this phenomenon is also a problem in other 
regions of the country. According to the RCMP, biker gangs are 
active everywhere in Canada.
<P>
	I had long discussions with police chiefs from various Canadian 
cities, with officials from the Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police, and with my colleagues, the provincial attorney generals. In 
my opinion, the proposals in Bill C-95 are an initial commitment to 
fight organized crime across the country, and not only in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In my conversations with chiefs of police and attorneys general 
throughout the country in this past period and particularly while we 
have been drafting and preparing Bill C-95, I have been impressed 
at the unanimity among law enforcement officials throughout 
Canada about the need for specific legislation to deal with 
organized crime.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	I spoke with the president of the Canadian Police Association 
who urged me to deal with this as a national issue requiring a 
national solution. I spoke with the chief of police in Vancouver who 
told me that there are  motorcycle gangs active on the criminal side 
in that city. I spoke with the chiefs of police in Halifax, Ottawa, 
Winnipeg and Toronto, and to a person they have urged us to 
proceed with this legislation so that they may have these tools 
available to confront issues that arise in their own communities.
<P>
	I have spoken with the mayor of Vancouver. I have spoken with 
the mayor of Winnipeg. I have spoken with the attorney general of 
British Columbia, the attorney general of Manitoba, the attorney 
general and the solicitor general of Ontario to discuss these 
measures with them. In each case I have found only enthusiastic 
encouragement for us to pursue this course.
<P>
	This is not an issue that exists only in one province. Organized 
crime is a scourge that afflicts this country from coast to coast to 
coast. We must through legislative means as well as by all other 
means available see that we treat it with the seriousness that it 
merits.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of course, improving the legislation is only one weapon in the 
arsenal that we must deploy to fight violence associated with 
criminal organizations and organized crime. All the provinces have 
a major role to play, since the Constitution provides that the 
administration of justice comes under their jurisdiction. The 
provinces must allocate adequate resources, so that police officers 
can do their job, and so that, when people are arrested, they are 
prosecuted by specialized crown prosecutors expressly mandated 
for that purpose.
<P>
	At the federal level, there is a need to co-ordinate the fight led by 
police forces across the country. Organized crime is a national 
concern which requires national measures. That is why the solicitor 
general agreed to table in Parliament an annual progress report on 
the fight against organized crime, and on the situation across the 
country. The solicitor general also announced that he will set up a 
national committee and five regional co-ordination committees to 
address police concerns regarding the need to co-ordinate measures 
to enforce the act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I must say that I am very much indebted to those who consulted 
and worked with us in the preparation of this legislation. I am 
speaking first of all about those mayors of municipalities in 
Quebec who met with me.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the past three weeks, I met with the mayors of Quebec to 
listen to their concerns, discuss various approaches, and assure 
them that the federal government intends to take action.
<P>
	I also met with Quebec's chiefs of police, who worked with us to 
identify concrete and efficient measures, which we included in Bill 
C-95. I also want to mention the Barreau du Québec, which 
co-operated with us by  reviewing our bill and expressing its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10015"> 10015 </A></B>
<P>
concerns about certain clauses. We listened and we sometimes 
changed our approach in order to deal with these concerns.
<P>
	I also want to thank officials from the Société des avocats de la 
défense de Montréal and, finally, my Quebec counterparts, Paul 
Bégin and Robert Perreault, the Minister of Public Security.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I truly enjoyed co-operating with the Quebec ministers and their 
officials. We worked constructively and we welcomed ideas and 
proposals. We accepted a number of them, but it was not possible to 
include every suggestion made by Mr. Bégin. However, the various 
levels of government worked together to make sure we have 
legislation that will help police forces do their work.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the province has a responsibility to make sure 
adequate resources are provided to police officers and to crown 
prosecutors.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have also to thank the Canadian Bar Association, 
representatives of the Criminal Lawyers' Association and 
representatives of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association who 
worked with us in our preparation of this legislation.
<P>
	I do not pretend for a moment that we have addressed all the 
concerns that they have expressed. I know there are many among 
the groups that I have mentioned who have concerns about some of 
the aspects of this legislation. They were good enough to give us 
their commentary and to react to some of the proposals that we 
were considering. Because of their commentary and their reactions, 
our reference has to that extent been enriched. I am grateful to them 
for the time they took in that consultation.
<P>
	I commend to the House this legislation which the government 
believes will improve the criminal law of Canada, will give the 
police the tools they need to fight a particular, a specific and a most 
difficult scourge, that is organized crime. Difficult to investigate, 
tough to prosecute, but one of the greatest challenges we face in the 
criminal justice system is to take on organized crime in a serious 
minded way. This legislation represents a good first start in that 
regard. I commend it to the House, expressing all the while my 
gratitude to colleagues for collaborating with the government in 
this effort.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I really feel that today we are experiencing the British 
parliamentary system at its best, with the opposition co-operating 
and the government taking action.
<P>
	You will recall that, in August 1995, a tragic and totally 
unexpected event-there had been no warning sign-happened in 
the riding of  Hochelaga-Maisonneuve when an 11-year-old boy 
walking back from the toy library, a very popular place in my 
community, was killed for being in the wrong place at the wrong 
time.
<P>
	I must say that since that event, people have been mobilizing, 
first in my community, and then throughout Quebec and Canada. I 
am very grateful to the minister; I recognize that when dealing with 
an issue such as this one, there is no room for partisanship among 
MPs.
<P>
	I thank the justice minister and his assistant, David Rodier, as 
well as Yvan Roy, who bent over backwards to keep the dialogue 
going on a number of legislative measures we thought had to be 
looked at in order to come up with concrete solutions to fight 
organized crime.
<P>
	Before going any further, I would also like to thank my 
colleague, the member for Berthier-Montcalm, our justice critic, 
who has been very active and perceptive in supporting the need for 
an antigang law.
<P>
	We must be very clear with our fellow citizens. Nobody in this 
House claims that Bill C-95 will solve all the problems. None of us 
believes that passing this piece of legislation will eradicate 
organized crime. But what we are saying is that today we are 
sending a very strong message to the community as a whole to the 
effect that neither the official opposition nor the government will 
give up on this scourge.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	One could ask what is organized crime and how come that 
phenomenon has grown so much over the past few years. I would 
like to propose a definition that is commonly used by police forces 
and to remind viewers that whenever we speak about organized 
crime, we are referring mainly to four elements.
<P>
	First, there are the proceeds of crime. Naturally, the purpose of 
organized crime is to make money. The second element is power, 
control over a specific territory. Then come fear and intimidation. 
The fourth and final element is corruption.
<P>
	You could say that organized crime does not exist in every 
society and you would be right. Some specific, precise conditions 
are required for organized crime to thrive in a society. There are at 
least four conditions which make cities like Montreal, Toronto, 
Calgary and Winnipeg, and the maritimes, good locations for 
organized crime.
<P>
	For organized crime to thrive, it needs a wealthy community 
where it can make money. That is why we talk about corruption in 
the third world, but in those countries, organized crime is quite 
different from its usual manifestations in urban environments.
<P>
	In order for organized crime to take root somewhere, it needs 
convenient access to major routes. Since it is an import-export 
trade, organized crime in Canada is concentrated in major centres 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10016"> 10016 </A></B>
<P>
across the country. For  organized crime to prosper, it needs a free 
society, a society without dictatorial powers and oppression.
<P>
	Fourth, and probably the most important, is that, to prosper, 
organized crime needs a society where there are rights, charters and 
bureaucracy. We know full well-that is what police officers told 
me, and probably told the Minister of Justice also-that the 
greatest ally of organized crime is the charter of rights and 
freedoms, which has given it some immunity. It has been a 
powerful tool for organized crime.
<P>
	Once these conditions are met, organized crime proceeds in 
phases. Operations of organized crime and its representatives have 
three different phases. The first one is control of a territory. Control 
of a territory is gained by intimidation, by generating fear. Such a 
territory becomes the exclusive turf of a particular group.
<P>
	After you control a territory, you get into money laundering. I 
will come back to the importance of money laundering for 
organized crime. I should mention that money laundering in 
Canada accounts for about $20 billion, invested in legal or illegal 
activities.
<P>
	Once money has been laundered, it can be invested in legal 
enterprises. In Montreal, to give you an example that I know very 
well, organized crime has invested mostly in restaurants, bars and 
the like, although I do not think this is unique to Montreal. I know 
it is the same in other communities.
<P>
	So, we welcome the minister's bill. We agree that, as hon. 
members and as legislators, we cannot give up, that, we must 
assume our responsibilities and take action on such an important 
issue.
<P>
	Of course, we would have preferred to have this debate much 
earlier, because, as Bloc members, we have been pleading with the 
Minister of Justice for two years to look into what is going on in 
Canada's big cities.
<P>
	Today, we have a bill and we will co-operate. I say to the 
Minister of Justice that, if I can be of any help, wherever he wants 
me to speak or whatever he wants me to do, he can count on my full 
co-operation, because, once again, partisanship has no place in 
such an issue.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I would like to mention an extremely troubling fact. We have 
known for three months now that organized crime has changed the 
way it operates. Criminal organizations must not be 
underestimated, they are intelligent, well organized, and they have 
many means at their disposal to carry out their activities.
<P>
	In the past, these organizations used to limit their operations to 
60 days. They were active in counterfeiting and they could detect 
wire tapping devices, and they were aware that, when their lines 
were being tapped, the warrant could not go beyond 60 days.
<P>
	In that sense, I find the measure the minister is providing in the 
legislation most appropriate, making it  not only easier to get 
warrants to authorize wire tapping, but also not necessary to prove 
that it is used as a last resort and the only investigative tool 
available to the police. It will be a lot simpler and easier to get such 
a warrant.
<P>
	However, I must say that the way bombs are made now, the way 
explosives are handled by both major gangs, and I am referring of 
course to the Rock Machine or the Hell's Angels, is that these 
people now put in devices to make sure that the bombs will 
explode. The police had come to be able to identify which gang the 
bomb came from by the way it was made, and the way the 
explosive device was put together, the way the bomb was 
assembled often gave an indication of which group was responsible 
for it.
<P>
	To counter that, criminal organizations began to equip explosive 
devices with a timer so that no bomb ever misfire.
<P>
	The reason I am telling you this is obviously not to scare people 
but to make them understand that organized crime and its various 
manifestations are not something transitory that will go away and 
that we will not have to worry about a few weeks down the road. 
The justice minister is right to put forward such a bill because 
organized crime is a permanent fixture.
<P>
	Even though we passed Bill C-61 on the laundering of the 
proceeds of crime, organized crime has prospered.
<P>
	I think the measures being proposed here will be relevant and 
effective in helping police forces conduct investigations more 
quickly and produce much stronger evidence. Ultimately, attorney 
generals will be able to dig up evidence and initiate legal 
proceedings. Criminals will stand trial and we will be able to 
dismantle or at least shake up the higher echelons of organized 
crime.
<P>
	This bill contains 10 specific provisions I would like to explain 
to the people listening to us.
<P>
	First of all, the essence of this bill is that it creates the new 
offence of participation in a criminal organization. The bill 
provides that any offence for which the punishment is five years in 
prison or more will be deemed a criminal organization offence. 
Indeed the minister has cast a wide net. The bill covers drug 
offences, possession of stolen goods, influence peddling, and all 
other criminal organization offences.
<P>
	This is a judicious bill that defines criminal organizations as any 
group consisting of five or more persons. I tend to agree with this 
number. I know that Reform members have suggested that this 
number be reduced to three. But I think that, given the way 
organized crime works, we will be able to meet the objectives of 
this bill while maintaining this number at five.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10017"> 10017 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	So a new offence has been created. The minister did not agree to 
the request made by the Quebec government to add a provision on 
crime by association. Since the beginning of this debate, the 
minister has been extremely reluctant to create a crime by 
association. I do respect the legal arguments behind his position.
<P>
	I think we could have created a crime by association, which 
would have been in compliance with both section 1 of the Charter 
and the legal guarantees in sections 7 to 14 of same. What is 
important however is not to determine if I was right, if the minister 
was right, or if the Quebec government was right, but to dismantle 
any known criminal gangs.
<P>
	So, a new offence is created. New provisions concerning 
explosives have also been added. That was also something the 
Government of Quebec had requested. The bill says that any person 
who possesses, uses, or handles an explosive substance for the 
benefit, in total or in part, of a criminal organization is guilty of an 
offence, under aggravating circumstance, and liable to 
imprisonment for 14 years.
<P>
	I think it is very important to understand how crucial this 
provision is, because as we know, explosives are very often used to 
commit crime, especially by biker gangs.
<P>
	This will now constitute an aggravating circumstance. This 
notion of aggravating circumstance is already included in the 
Criminal Code, since, a few years back, we had section 718.9 
modified to add a number of factors that, taken into consideration 
by the judges, lead to tougher sentencing.
<P>
	If a criminal offence is committed by an organized gang, this 
will be considered an aggravating circumstance, especially when 
explosives are used. I think this is an extremely positive measure.
<P>
	Judges will also be given the possibility of deferring or 
postponing parole, or restricting eligibility to parole. It will be 
possible for them-and this is quite clear in the bill-when an 
individual is sentenced for gangsterism, to order that 50 per cent of 
the sentence must be served before the individual can be eligible to 
parole.
<P>
	I think this measure is extremely important because it 
encourages informers. One of the extremely modern ways to fight 
organized crime is to encourage informers to come forward. 
Nobody in organized crime will ever confess, agree to testify or 
co-operate if he or she knows that three, four or five months down 
the road, the person he or she informed against will be free to make 
trouble for them.
<P>
	Measures like postponing parole or aggravating circumstances 
are very important measures because they favour informers, which 
is a key weapon, often used, to track down organized crime.
<P>
	Another extremely important measure I talked about a little 
earlier is that it will be easier to obtain a warrant for electronic 
surveillance. Nowadays, electronic surveillance is a last resort 
measure. One has to demonstrate to the satisfaction of a judge that 
this is the ultimate way to conduct investigations.
<P>
	Thanks to the provisions of this bill, it will be easier to not only 
get authorization to proceed with electronic surveillance but also to 
extend the warrant as much as up to one year. This is extremely 
important.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Another clause will make it easier and faster to obtain search 
warrants, for which one needs evidence, of course. The judge will 
always have to be satisfied. The bill contains an extremely 
interesting and original provision which provides for the forfeiture 
not only of the proceeds of crime, but also of vehicles used to 
commit offences. For example, if a truck is used to commit a crime, 
it could be confiscated. If a building is used-because the bill also 
applies to buildings-it could be confiscated.
<P>
	At present, there are provisions in a number of laws which allow 
for the forfeiture of property, but it is always done by a court order 
and it always pertains to property deemed to have been used in 
laundering of proceeds of crime. We will now be able to confiscate 
not only property used for the laundering of the proceeds of crime, 
but also property, such as a vehicle, used to commit a crime.
<P>
	Another extremely interesting provision is that the judge will be 
able to issue an order to keep the peace, to refrain from seeing 
certain persons, from leaving the country, a judicial order against a 
person if there is sufficient evidence that that person will take part 
in the commission of a crime by a criminal organization. In other 
words, it is a preventive measure. The price of not keeping the 
peace could be an offence punishable by fine or imprisonment.
<P>
	The final measure the minister referred to concerns information 
and provides that the solicitor general will table an annual report on 
organized crime, on what progress has been made, where organized 
crime is active and, obviously I hope, on suggestions for fighting it.
<P>
	It is overall an interesting bill. It combines a number of measures 
called for by police and the Government of Quebec, particularly 
with respect to explosives.
<P>
	We must nevertheless realize today that we as parliamentarians 
have become aware of what is going on in organized crime because 
people have taken action. Some of them are fellow residents in my 
riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, including the mother of young 
Daniel Desrochers, Josée-Anne, who circulated a petition and who 
used every public forum to awaken parliamentarians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10018"> 10018 </A></B>
<P>
	I think that whoever we are and wherever we sit in this House 
we owe a debt of gratitude to Josée-Anne Desrochers. The police 
also acted and created CAPLA, the Comité d'action politique pour 
une loi anti-gangs. There was all sorts of pressure. As well, there 
was my colleague, the member for Berthier-Montcalm, who took 
the lead in this matter and very early on spoke to the minister on 
a number of occasions. He was very stubborn, obsessive and 
persevering, I would say. It helped, because his efforts were not 
in vain. The proof is that today we have legislative measures.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Here are a few indications of the scope of organized crime, 
showing how its effects are felt throughout society, and how 
important it is for us, as legislators, to be extremely vigilant.
<P>
	In 1992, the underground economy was estimated at 5.2 percent 
of the gross national product, some $36 billion. That is in 1992 
dollars. In today's dollars, those numbers would be a lot higher.
<P>
	The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates that annual losses 
associated with unrecovered stolen vehicles-which is also one 
aspect of organized crime-amount to $293 million; $293 million 
per year for stolen vehicles. A pretty considerable sum.
<P>
	In 1994, Canadian chartered banks estimated their losses due to 
fraud at $143 million. Within organized crime, there is a sort of 
specialization. Some groups have become expert in what we call 
counterfeiting bank notes and putting them into circulation. I think 
this is a specialty of Asian groups, who have become quite expert at 
it. In 1994, the banks reported they had lost $143 million because 
of fraud.
<P>
	The most interesting number comes from very knowledgeable 
people in the field-the police forces-and concerns the income 
generated by organized crime, which is estimated at $20 billion. 
The figures for revenues from crime are close to the figures for the 
Canadian deficit. How much is the Canadian deficit? My colleague 
for Berthier-Montcalm, who follows these issues closely, could 
tell me the exact amount, but I believe it is $19 billion. The 
Canadian deficit is about $19 billion while revenues from crime 
total $20 billion per year. Is it possible, as legislators, to remain 
idle when confronted with this fact? I think not.
<P>
	However, despite all the good things I said concerning the 
government-and believe me, this is extremely 
circumstantial-the fact remains that it could have done much 
more. We made representations to the government. So did other 
groups, that is police forces and other people involved. We know 
perfectly well that the next step will certainly be the laundering of 
money. We know that. The fact that Canada is a money laundering 
paradise is very well known. Canada is extremely liberal on that 
matter. This cannot go on.
<P>
	I must tell you the police community made a very important 
demand, that is the obligation for the major chartered banks to 
report any suspicious transaction over $10,000. This is extremely 
important for those who investigate to be able to trace back the 
origin of suspicious transactions. Right now, chartered banks must 
keep a record of all operations that they think are suspicious, but 
they are under no obligation to report them.
<P>
	I think it would have been worthwhile to include a legal 
provision specifying that failure to report such operations may be a 
punishable offence. I am convinced that banks would have 
co-operated, because the Canadian Bankers Association has taken 
some internal measures to detect dubious transactions, but all this 
must become an obligation.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Police officers had also asked that $1,000 bills be taken out of 
circulation. Is there anyone in this House naive enough to think that 
ordinary people walk on the street with $1,000 bills in their 
pockets? Mr. Speaker, if I you were to do a survey in this place, I 
am sure that very few of us-including yourself, the pages, the 
members of this House and the people in the gallery-would have a 
$1,000 bill in their pockets.
<P>
	We know full well that the $1,000 bill makes it possible for some 
people to carry large amounts in their pockets and we know for sure 
that the $1,000 bill is a boon to organized crime. The Canadian 
Police Association has asked that the $1,000 bill be taken out of 
circulation, and that is something that will have to be considered.
<P>
	Here is another extremely important demand: I was telling you 
earlier about the need to have banks divulge dubious transactions 
of more than $10,000, and I think that must not be restricted to the 
banks. Casinos could also be included in that list, as well as travel 
agencies and all those businesses trading in luxury items that may 
eventually be infiltrated and help us trace the criminal chain of 
command.
<P>
	These are some measures we are suggesting. I think the justice 
minister will welcome them. I want to remind him that the reality 
of organized crime is not temporary. It is a huge threat. To this day, 
organized crime has managed to poison the life of entire 
communities, and I am thinking of course about the eastern part of 
Montreal with what happened in the riding of 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, but it is not only the eastern part of 
Montreal that is deeply affected by this reality.
<P>
	This reality is also a daily concern for the people of 
Saint-Nicolas, who have mobilized to fight this problem. Is it 
acceptable that bunkers can be built in urban centres, near 
residential areas, and that people can openly and publicly make 
money through illegal means and disturb the peace within our 
communities? I think not.  As parliamentarians, we have a 
responsibility to do everything in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10019"> 10019 </A></B>
<P>
our power to stop these people, to hold them accountable, to send 
them to prison and to launch investigations.
<P>
	Too often, over the past few years, I heard people say that it was 
the police's fault, because they did not build good cases. I took part 
in public debates, open lines and television shows where the easy 
argument that was used was: ``If the police did a better job, it would 
be easier to fight organized crime''.
<P>
	I think this argument does not withstand scrutiny because each 
time a police force wants to press charges, there are prosecutors 
and lawyers who study these cases to see how well the evidence 
would stand up in court, to determine if it could be challenged or 
not. It is not just about police resources; it is also about the 
Criminal Code and giving the courts the interpretation tools they 
need.
<P>
	I am not saying that adding police resources is not a good thing. I 
am thinking of course about the Carcajou squad, in Montreal, and 
GRICO. It is indeed a good thing. When, in a special squad, you 
have the means to shadow individuals, the more people you have in 
your squad, the easier it is not just to build solid cases but to act 
quickly.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	There is something that must never be forgotten. You know how 
devious the whole field of law is. You know the effect one decision 
can have on case law and how it can change the course of law. I 
know that my colleague, the member for Berthier-Montcalm, 
who is a lawyer, one of the best I would say, but not a criminal 
lawyer, is aware of the 1992 Stinchcombe ruling. How did this 
affect case law? It meant that, with respect to disclosure of 
evidence, the public prosecutor is obliged to file, before the trial, 
all the elements that contributed to the evidence.
<P>
	This means that all information regarding a tail, personal notes, 
videotaped material, everything that contributed to the evidence 
must be handed over to the defence. This is fraught with 
consequences, because it forces those building cases to be 
extremely imaginative, extremely innovative in order to outwit 
their opponents from one trial or investigation to the next.
<P>
	On the whole, I think this is a bill that deserves our support. As 
the opposition, we are going to co-operate. We did so today. We 
have acted very expeditiously.
<P>
	I say again to the minister that, whatever we can do, whatever 
forum he would like to send us to, whatever demonstration we can 
take part in to ensure that this bill is passed before the imminent 
election that you know will see us back here as the official 
opposition, just as we are now, we will co-operate.
<P>
	If the minister wants us to make representations to the other 
House to help things along, we are prepared to do  so because we 
have known for several months that partisanship has no place in 
this issue of organized crime. All my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois agree with me that, when public safety is at stake, when 
the tranquillity of entire sections of the community are threatened, 
we have a responsibility to act quickly, not to be complacent.
<P>
	That is what we have done as the official opposition and that is 
what we will continue to do in the coming days.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we heard 
quite a bit about this bill today in committee of the whole. I would 
like to point to something that was not discussed. Underlying the 
whole question of the new authorities and powers granted in the bill 
is the fact that the government and the justice system have failed to 
deal adequately with the trafficking of drugs. They have failed to 
deal with it to the point where it is now so lucrative that the biker 
gangs are warring over who will control it.
<P>
	What has happened over the last 30 years? Our laws have 
become too soft. The tools have been taken away from our law 
enforcement agencies to the point where drug trafficking is so 
absolutely lucrative that gangs are killing one another over the turf. 
That is what the turf war is all about, the right to control drug 
trafficking.
<P>
	What does that say? That is something that has not been 
discussed. It is a sure indication of the failure of the justice system 
to protect our families and our children, to protect every Canadian 
citizen from that kind of influence.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	If we go into any public school in this country, particularly high 
schools, we can see evidence of what the justice system has failed 
to do, which is to protect our children against those people who 
would kill in order to make a profit from drugs. They are turning 
our society into bedlam.
<P>
	There is drug trafficking in my little city of Camrose. The 
children in the high schools are becoming addicted because the 
government and those before it have eroded the criminal justice 
system. Laws have been changed. The tools have been denied to 
law enforcement agencies to the point where we are not fighting 
what we should be fighting, we are fighting the fact that two groups 
of criminals are fighting over who is going to control the $20 
billion drug industry in Canada.
<P>
	It is a shame. It is a disgrace. That has not been touched on in this 
debate. It is something people across the country know about. They 
are talking about it. They are sending petitions to their members of 
Parliament about it. They are writing to us about the general 
climate which allows crime to flourish.
<P>
	When this bill was introduced we knew it could not be passed 
with the election looming. We knew it could not  be brought before 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10020"> 10020 </A></B>
<P>
committee and have witnesses come forward on both sides of the 
issue so that we could understand if there are flaws and weaknesses 
in the bill. Those weaknesses are on both sides: weaknesses 
concerning the police and weaknesses in that it might encroach on 
the rights of innocent people. We knew that we would not have the 
time to do that, so we had to agree in order to give the police some 
degree of enhancement of their operations against criminals. We 
had to rush the bill through.
<P>
	I talked to some of the police chiefs and others in criminal 
justice enforcement. They told me that they need this bill, not 
because it contains such powerful tools for them, but because for 
the first time we are introducing into the criminal justice system 
laws dealing with organized crime.
<P>
	I asked them if this legislation would enable them to solve the 
offences which are occurring, the bombings and the murders, they 
were not sure it would. When I asked that question at least one of 
them quickly changed the subject and pointed to some of the 
positive aspects of the bill with which I agree.
<P>
	The extension of wiretapping could have been done two, three, 
four or five years ago. It should have been done 10 years ago. Then 
there could have been investigations into drug trafficking and 
organized crime. It would have given the police the tools they 
needed to prevent the spread of drug trafficking.
<P>
	The peace bond is a good idea. That could have been brought in 
years ago as well. It could have been brought in to deal with 
organized crime for the very purpose for which it is being brought 
in now. It was not brought in. Why? I do not know.
<P>
	The access to income tax records could have been brought in 
years ago for the specific area of organized crime.
<P>
	Then we have offence related property. In other words, we are 
enhancing the powers of the police and the state to seize the avails 
of crime, but that will only come after an accused has been 
convicted of a criminal organization offence. Let us look at the 
possibility of anyone ever being convicted under this new offence 
that will allow the police and the state to seize the avails of crime. 
How easy is it going to be?
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	First, someone has to be convicted of an indictable offence 
carrying at least a maximum five year penalty. Then the crown has 
to establish that the individual was part of a crime organization. 
Four others will have to be brought into the picture to show that 
they were associating and one of their primary objectives was to 
commit this kind of crime and that there had been a series of crimes 
committed by one or more of the group.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you understand the law. You are a lawyer. You 
understand exactly what I am talking about when I say to 
Canadians: Do not hold your breath expecting reams of convictions 
under this new offence. It is not going to happen.
<P>
	I hope my prediction is wrong. It reminds me a little of Bill C-27 
where we passed this wonderful law that is going to discourage 
pedophiles from going to other countries to have sex with young 
children. How is the child sex tourism bill going to be enforced?
<P>
	We had legal minds appear before the committee on Bill C-27 
and they told us that it is a wonderful looking bill and that part of it 
sounds good and might make people feel safer and more assured 
that the state is doing something about what is happening in other 
countries by the pedophiles from Canada, but how is it to be 
enforced?
<P>
	When I look at the enforceability of this new section, I have 
grave concerns. Those concerns were not alleviated as a result of 
my discussion with the police chiefs to whom I spoke. They 
pointed to other aspects of the bill and the fact that for the first time 
legislation was being introduced into the Criminal Code dealing 
with organized crime and they hoped in the years to come it would 
be expanded on.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is former governments were supposed to 
stand on guard for this country. Every Wednesday we sing our 
national anthem. We promise in that anthem that we stand on guard 
for thee, Canada and for the citizens who live in this country.
<P>
	But have they stood on guard? No, they have not. As I said 
earlier, drug trafficking is so widespread and the police so unable to 
deal with it, now we are hoping for laws that will be able to deal 
with the consequences of our laxness in this area. Murders are 
being committed, innocent people are dying, the criminals are 
killing one another off in order to gain control over an illicit traffic 
that should never have developed to the extent that it has. It has and 
we are facing that now.
<P>
	I listened to the debates, as short as they were, on this bill. No 
one, neither the justice minister nor anyone on the government side 
nor from the Bloc side addressed the underlying cause of the 
situation that has brought about Bill C-95. Why not?
<P>
	Have we embraced it? Have we given up? Is the next step to 
legalize hard drugs? Is that the next step? We see some people 
advocating the decriminalization of soft drugs. Is that what we are 
coming to? We have taken powers away from the police over the 
years, lightened the offences. Why? People say too many people 
are incarcerated. The jails are full.
<P>
	The justice minister attacks us and criticizes us for not 
supporting some of his bills. We support this bill. We do not know 
everything about the bill that we should know  but we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10021"> 10021 </A></B>
<P>
supporting it. We support good, sound initiatives by this 
government.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	We support it today and we have in the past. The justice minister 
has attacked us and criticized us for not supporting some of his bills 
such as Bill C-41.
<P>
	We are going to go across the country telling the people in the 
forthcoming election why we did not support Bill C-41. That is 
because of the alternative measures that are being extended to 
violent offenders, the conditional sentencing that is now being used 
by some judges to allow rapists and violent offenders to walk free.
<P>
	That is why we did not support Bill C-41 and will not support it. 
We have asked over and over again for the justice minister to bring 
in a simple amendment that would deny the courts the power, the 
tools, to allow violent offenders to walk free through this 
conditional sentencing clause. He refuses to do it.
<P>
	Therefore we will not be taking this to the people in this 
forthcoming election, we are taking it to them now and we are 
showing very clearly that we are prepared to support good 
legislation but will not support legislation like the Bloc does that 
allows violent offenders to walk free. We will not support that.
<P>
	A Reform government will repeal that bill and we will plug the 
hole that allows the courts in this land to send rapists back on the 
street after they destroyed the lives of their victims. When we look 
at this bill and we look at the whole gamut of the justice system and 
where we have arrived, the justice minister has become so partisan 
in his answers today that I saw no reason to go any further.
<P>
	In the forthcoming election the people will be examining his 
laws. They will be examining his attitude. They will be examining 
his response to victims and they will vote accordingly.
<P>
	This government will be weighed and it is going to be found 
wanting. Certainly anyone who examines the bills that have come 
through this House over the last 25 or 30 years knows that 
something has gone wrong. They do not have to examine the bills 
at all, they simply have to see the consequences of what has 
happened to our society where two gangs of thugs are fighting over 
the turf of the illicit drug trafficking that has occurred in this 
country.
<P>
	Our criminal justice system has allowed that to happen. If it did 
not happen, we would not be asking for this kind of a bill. We 
should have had these tools in the hands of the police years ago. We 
brought in a charter of rights and freedoms that now can be used as 
a shield by many of these people in this illicit trafficking that is 
destroying the lives of our children, destroying the undergirdings 
of society.
<P>
	Therefore we have asked the justice minister and we have asked 
this government to protect the rights of  victims, to protect the lives 
of our children by bringing in reasonable, common sense laws, by 
giving back to the police the powers and the discretion to use those 
powers in a manner they think is in the best interests of society.
<P>
	I do not know why we do not see a proper response or a better 
response by the Liberal government and this justice minister. I 
cannot understand that. We came to the House in 1993 with a 
promise from the government that it was going to work more 
co-operatively, it was going to change the way we did business 
here, more free votes and that kind of thing. We were willing to 
give it a chance and we have supported every measure we thought 
was for the benefit of society. Yet the justice minister will stand in 
this place and accuse us of not supporting a bill like Bill C-41 
which allows rapists to walk free.
<P>
	I do not understand that. It seems the only thing some of the 
people on the other side understand is a message in neither of the 
official languages; it is an <I>X</I> on a ballot at election time. We will 
see.
<P>
	We will let the people judge whether they feel society is safer 
than it was before, whether they are better off economically than 
they were before and whether this government deserves another 
mandate. Will we see. It will be up to the people.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	I heard today from the Prime Minister on television, from the 
justice minister, and it bothers me so much, the pretence that they 
do not know when the election is going to be called.
<P>
	If an election were not evident or imminent we would not be 
rushing this bill through without having witnesses. All the people 
the justice minister suggested to us he has consulted we should 
have heard from. We should have had their opinions. The members 
of the House, through our committee, should have had those 
opinions placed on the record so we could determine whether this 
bill should have been amended and if so in what areas. We should 
have had that opportunity.
<P>
	The justice minister pretends that he does not know when the 
election is going to be called. When they have their war rooms all 
rented and up and running, when they have everything on the move 
and he says to this House, as the Prime Minister said on TV two 
days ago, he does not know when the election will be called, it 
sounds to me like their GST promise again.
<P>
	We will be asking the people of this country in the election that 
will be called within a week or so to weigh the legislation and 
weigh their own circumstances as to whether they feel safer in 
society, whether their economic situation has improved or 
deteriorated. If they feel that the government has done a good job, 
it deserves another mandate. If they do not then we are asking them 
very clearly to look at an alternative that will listen and will be 
guided by the will of the majority so that our Minister of Justice 
can go to Saskatchewan and can talk  to the gun owners, the 
<P>

<P>
law-abiding, hardworking taxpayers, stand in front of a crowd and 
not be concerned.
<P>
	He can come to Dauphin, Manitoba where I was last Saturday, 
where 450 people turned up to learn what? More about Bill C-68. 
Imagine that, after two years. They are still punching holes in the 
air out there over what they consider to be a horrible injustice. It is 
a piece of legislation directed at them rather than at the criminal 
use of firearms.
<P>
	We will support this bill. I am hoping that we are not missing 
anything. The justice minister heard from people on both sides of 
this issue. I am hoping there is nothing that has been held back 
from us in terms of their cares, their worries or their concerns. I am 
hoping that this bill will do the job we all want it to do.
<P>
	It is really unfortunate that we would allow the drug trafficking 
situation to get so well entrenched in this country and so expansive. 
We feel it now in every school. We feel it in every community 
across this country. The absolute proof of that fact is we now have 
two bands of thugs fighting over the turf to control this.
<P>
	I lay the responsibility clearly on the shoulders of past justice 
ministers, past Liberal and Tory governments that had an 
opportunity to do something about it but did nothing. Now the wolf 
is at our door and we think this bill is going to solve it. I hope it 
does but I am not holding my breath in the expectation that reams 
of convictions under this new bill will occur.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am extremely pleased to speak at this stage on Bill C-95. 
As my hon. colleague for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has just said, 
we have co-operated throughout the day and the Bloc Quebecois 
proposals are what accelerated the process of getting Bill C-95, an 
aAct to amend the Criminal Code (criminal organizations) and to 
amend other Acts in consequence, passed as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	For us in the Bloc Quebecois, this is not just a matter that has 
been debated here for the past week. It is a very important subject. 
From the start, the Bloc Quebecois has been highly aware of the 
problem, because it is very much present in Quebec. As far back as 
1995, we tried to convince the minister of the importance of 
legislation on gangs, of anti-biker gang legislation, of legislation to 
fight the scourge of organized crime.
<P>
	You will recall that the Bloc Quebecois had to question the 
government on several occasions sine 1995, that we in the Bloc 
Quebecois, the official opposition, had to make speeches in this 
House in order to convince the minister. Press conferences had to 
be held.
<P>
	On several occasions, the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve met with the police chiefs. He even 
played a lead role in a pressure group lobbying for action to finally 
be taken in this area, for the passage of legislation against the biker 
gangs.
<P>
	You will recall, as well, that we even applied to the Speaker of 
the House for an emergency debate to be held on the whole matter 
of motorcycle gangs, organized crime and money laundering. You 
will recall that we were told there was no emergency. In 1993, the 
Bloc Quebecois promised its electors to give them real power and 
to defend their interests and it kept asking the federal government 
to take action, to do something that would put an end to this 
scourge.
<P>
	Though we are not responsible for introducing legislation, 
because we do not have the millions of dollars and the hundreds of 
lawyers who work in the Department of Justice-our means are 
very limited-we proposed in 1995 and later in private bills some 
definitions and means that would allow us to really go after 
organized crime and gang leaders. We proposed that in good faith 
to the government. We tried to force it to do what it is expected to 
do, and that is to legislate in its own jurisdiction.
<P>
	But that was not enough. We had to have bombs. How many 
bombs went off in Quebec before the minister decided to take 
action? There had to be murder attempts. We had to find dynamite 
across Quebec. There had to be murders. There were marches in 
Saint-Nicolas, demonstrations by mayors and public pressure. 
Some innocent people were injured. Members will also recall that 
young Daniel Desrochers was killed in that gang war.
<P>
	I remember very well that one day I asked the minister what he 
was waiting for to legislate. He kept saying there was no rush and 
that no legislation was necessary. The same day, we had six 
incidents connected with the biker war. Bombs exploded, someone 
was killed, a Molotov cocktail was thrown into a restaurant in 
Quebec City. Dynamite was found in Longeuil. There was a 
shooting in Saint-Nicolas. And the minister said there was no rush.
<P>
	Do you know what convinced the minister that perhaps he should 
do something? It was when we threatened to amend Bill C-17 
which been languishing in the House for at least two or three years, 
to amend it and include anti-biker provisions. The minister decided 
to act.
<P>
	More than that, after repeated questioning in the House, the 
minister decided to go and see for himself the problems they had in 
Quebec City. Fortunately, the air in Quebec City had a very salutary 
effect on the Minister of Justice, since he came back saying there 
was some urgency. There are those who fell from their horse on the 
road to Damascus and there are others who went to Quebec City to 
realize that action was urgently needed on the whole issue of the 
biker gang war in Quebec.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10023"> 10023 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	So the minister came back from Quebec City saying this could 
not go on, a situation where people stayed home because they were 
afraid of being shot, because they were afraid of the biker war that 
was going on in a number of municipalities in Quebec.
<P>
	The problem is not recent. Back in 1982, a municipality, I think 
it was Sorel or Tracy, asked both levels of government to intervene, 
to pass legislation to help them fight what was starting to come to a 
head, in other words, all the bunkers being built and all the 
organized crime connected with all this.
<P>
	The government of the day failed to act, and today's 
government, the Liberal government opposite, was not doing 
anything either. It took the members of the Bloc Quebecois, who 
are here solely to look after Quebec's interests, to make them 
understand that there was a problem and that immediate action was 
required.
<P>
	As I said earlier, we worked together to help the government get 
the bill passed as quickly as possible, in view of the fact that 
everyone knows elections are in the wings. We need only listen to 
the Prime Minister and his wife if we have any doubt at all. 
However, what surprises me today is that the Minister of Justice 
says this is just a first step.
<P>
	We are delighted the Minister of Justice has taken this course, as 
we have been pointing it out since 1995. We would have liked a bill 
that went further in fighting crime, but we accept the bill as it is. 
We will pass it in the hope that we can someday amend it as we 
would like in order to reach the goal we set ourselves.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice says it is a first step, a first stage. I asked 
the minister why, since he said that it was a first stage, a first step, 
he did not decide to go further. Quite candidly he told me that he 
will continue to look into this matter and see what he can do. 
Finally, he does not know what to do as the second, third and fourth 
stages.
<P>
	I encourage him to reread the entire private member's bill my 
colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve introduced. I also 
suggest he reread the letters I wrote him in 1995 providing certain 
definitions in order to get to the leaders. Perhaps then the Minister 
of Justice will include a second stage, which we will soon have in 
another legislature. I hope that the Bloc Quebecois will be as strong 
then in order to defend Quebec's interests. I expect the minister 
will continue to move in the direction of the claims we made in this 
matter.
<P>
	I can tell you right off two points the minister should consider 
for the second stage: the leaders and money laundering. On three 
occasions today, I asked the justice minister, who says that his bill 
goes directly after gang leaders, to show me where in Bill C-95 I 
could find something that dealt directly with gang leader. On three 
occasions he answered that it did so in a global way, that  the bill 
had to be looked at in a global way. The minister never told me 
precisely where to look, and I will tell you why. It is because there 
is nothing in this bill which really deals with gang leaders. True, it 
is a step forward; true, it gives greater powers to the police; true, 
these are things the Bloc Quebecois had been demanding; true, we 
are satisfied and happy, but this bill does not go as far as we would 
have liked it to go.
<P>
	I would invite the minister not to misinform the public, but to 
tell what is truly in the bill; one thing that is definitely not in it is 
provisions dealing directly with gang leaders.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Among the definitions that the minister has put in this bill, there 
are certainly good ones. This is the first time that a criminal 
organization and an association have been defined. These are 
things that we have been asking for in the House since 1995, and 
we were told that it was not appropriate, that it could not be done.
<P>
	Of course, we are very happy to find that in a bill. This is a step 
forward. The Bloc Quebecois has helped the government, has 
contributed to the drafting of a new provision that had never been 
seen in Canada. Thanks to the Bloc Quebecois and its repeated 
representations, the government was convinced to proceed. We are 
very happy about that.
<P>
	However, although a gang and an association have been defined, 
the provision is drafted in such a way that it is still related to an 
individual, to the committing of a crime. We know full well that it 
is not the gang leaders who do the heavy work. It is not the leaders 
who set the bombs that exploded. It is not the leaders who gunned 
down an individual. It is not the leaders who threw a Molotov 
cocktail in the restaurant in Quebec City or who hid the dynamite 
sticks in Longueuil. It is not the leaders, but people who work for 
them and who get orders from them. How can we catch the leaders 
if the bill only helps us catch those who do the work and not those 
who order it?
<P>
	On three occasions, the minister has been unable to answer this 
question, simply because the Bloc Quebecois is right. This bill does 
not reach all the way up to the leaders, and something will have to 
be done about that very soon. If we are to put an end to this plague, 
we must deal not only with the ordinary members, but also with the 
leaders.
<P>
	Another issue that would have been very easy for the Minister of 
Justice to address in the bill, as we repeatedly asked him, is money 
laundering. As you know, Canada has the dubious honour of being 
the G-7 country where the most money is laundered every year.
<P>
	According to the statistics and to judges and law enforcement 
officers, it is estimated that between $30 billion and $60 billion is 
laundered in Canada every year. Some judges say $60 billion, while 
law enforcement  officers say between $30 billion and $40 billion, 
based on how much they have seized, which represents about10 per cent of all the money laundered in Canada. Given that they 
seize approximately $3.5 billion, $4 billion or $5 billion per year, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10024"> 10024 </A></B>
<P>
they estimate money laundering to represent approximately $30 
billion, $40 billion or $50 billion.
<P>
	But regardless of the exact amount, even it were only $20 billion 
per year, as my hon. colleague said earlier, this is about as much as 
Canada's annual deficit. It is a awful lot of money.
<P>
	To cover all the bases and provide a comprehensive solution to 
the problem of biker gangs, organized crime and money 
laundering, provisions dealing with these specific issues could 
have been included in Bill C-95. For instance, the production and 
distribution of $1,000 bills could have been prohibited. Canada 
may be the only country in the world where such large 
denominations are used. According to our information, no country 
in the world has banknotes worth as much as $1,000. As we know it 
is not every John Doe that walks around with a wad of $1,000 notes 
in his pocket.
<P>
	My notebook, here, has less than 30 pages, but if it were a wad of 
$1,000 notes, I would have $30,000 in my hand. It is easy to carry, 
to pass from hand to hand. Money laundering is easy. We could 
simply prohibit that. It would have been very easy to include in Bill 
C-95 a provision about that. It would have been easy also to include 
in Bill C-95 provisions requiring financial institutions to report any 
dubious transaction of $10,000 and more. It would have been easy 
also to require casinos, travel agencies or any other groups which 
are paid or see carried about huge sums of money of $10,000 and 
more, to report such facts.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	One judge told me that, because of the current state of the 
legislation, he was unable, despite the bank's co-operation, to find 
guilty of fraud an individual who went to the bank to deposit a 
hockey bag full of money. He came in with the bag which he put on 
the counter saying he wanted to deposit some money. The bag held 
about $1 million in $50, $100 and $1,000 notes.
<P>
	Even if the bank did co-operate and even if the police did its 
work, there are so many loopholes in the Canadian legislation that 
the judge was not in a position to convict this man. Everybody goes 
around with bags full of dollars. Everybody does that in Canada. 
Oh, sure.
<P>
	It is total nonsense. It makes so little sense that on the very day 
when we are dealing with Bill C-95, we read this headline in a 
newspaper: Thanks to the weakness of our legislation, Canada is a 
paradise for traffickers. This news report says exactly what we 
have been repeating for two or three years: our legislation is 
ineffective.
<P>
	The report says that the Canadian legislation on the laundering 
of money has so many loopholes that it is  extremely difficult to 
enforce. The Canadian police, and even those the justice minister 
brags about meeting a couple times, are dreaming of the day when 
they will have half or even only the quarter of the provisions 
existing in the United States.
<P>
	In Canada, we have to prove beyond any doubt that the money is 
the proceeds of criminal activities. In the United States, the onus is 
on the accused. Why did the minister not take the opportunity, with 
Bill C-95, to amend this legislation, when the government can 
count on the co-operation of all parties in the House to have 
legislation with teeth, and legislation that would meet the demands 
of many groups and political parties, like the Bloc Quebecois or the 
police association?
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that this is a step in the right direction, 
but I would have liked the minister to listen more to the official 
opposition, the Bloc Quebecois. He did not agree 100 per cent with 
the Bloc, which would have been hard for him to do in this election 
period. However, I think the Bloc Quebecois made some 
remarkable progress here and will continue to fight and will still be 
here, after the next election, to ask the government for some 
amendments to this legislation, in order to meet the needs and the 
demands of Quebecers in this area.

	<I>After the taking of the vote:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair assumes the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester did not vote both ways, that he intended to 
vote the second time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am voting with the government 
as usual.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the motion lost.
<P>
<B>(1905 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Carleton-Gloucester 
mentioned that he voted with the government, but of course this is a 
free vote and I would think that he would understand that under a 
supposed free vote one has to vote one's mind.
