</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-393, an act to amend the Competition Act, 
1998 (negative option marketing). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to give first reading this 
morning to this bill which would amend the Competition Act to 
deal with negative option marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective and the thrust of this bill is to prohibit certain 
financial institutions, including broadcasting and 
telecommunications undertakings and companies to which the 
Insurance Companies Act applies, from charging money to their 
regular clients for the provision or sale of a new service 
without the expressed consent of the client. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that this dovetails with a report released by 
Industry Canada under the office of the consumer which identifies 
negative option marketing as being the area in which a number of 
industries have targeted growth.  This is simply intended to 
protect consumers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, just as the 
Minister for International Trade is about to fly off to Paris to 
meet with his OECD compatriots to work hard in the next few days 
on the signing of the multilateral agreement on investment, I am 
presenting a petition on behalf of a number of my constituents 
who are adamantly opposed to the MAI as they presently understand 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They believe that it is an attack on Canadian sovereignty.  They 
believe that it will expand and entrench unprecedented rights to 
transnational corporations and that it will severely limit our 
government's ability to promote economic growth and job creation 
strategies.  They speak to the fact that we are now in court with 
Ethyl Corporation of the U.S. over the fact that we tried to 
improve the environment of Canada and we are being sued over 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also mention the fact that certain clauses will be locked 
in for 20 years.  I could read a long list, but I will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the point is well taken that these folks do not like 
the MAI as they know it and are asking parliament never to sign 
the multilateral agreement on investment in spite of the

petition is from a number of residents in communities throughout 
British Columbia who are hearing rumours about the government's 
intention to introduce a seniors benefit package.  Knowing what 
the provisions were for the last package they are totally 
panicked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They believe there are all sorts of hidden agendas here and are

because it is tax filing time this is what initiated this last 
petition.  A whole number of people feel that our present tax 
system is unfair, unjust and biased in favour of certain 
Canadians at the expense of others.  They are simply asking for 
comprehensive tax reform.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the residents of West Kootenay—Okanagan, I 
present the first in a series of petitions in which the 
petitioners draw to the attention of the House that violent 
crimes committed by youth are of great concern to Canadians, that 
the incidents of violent crime by youth would decrease if the 
Young Offenders Act were amended to hold young persons fully 
accountable for their criminal behaviour and that increased 
periods of incarceration could deter young people from committing 
criminal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the petitioners call upon parliament to significantly 
amend the Young Offenders Act, including but not limited to 
making protection of society the number one priority, reducing 
the minimum age from 12 to 10, allowing for the publication of 
violent young offenders' names, increasing the maximum three year 
sentence for all offences except murder to seven, increasing the 
penalty for first degree murder from a maximum of 10 years to 15 
years, and ensuring parental responsibility.

South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the family, the petitioners would like to draw to

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners also agree with the National Forum on Health 
report which stated that the Income Tax Act discriminates against 
families who choose to provide care in the home to their 
preschool children because it does not take into account the real 
costs of raising children.

pursue tax initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination for 
families who choose to provide care in the home to preschool 
children.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER

<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
following question will be answered today: No. 86 
.[Text] 
<Question No. 86—<B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration please provide: 
(<I>a</I>) the rationale and justification for the right-of-landing-fee 
(ROLF) as it applies to the sponsorship of family members; (<I>b</I>) the 
total revenue collected as a consequence of this aspect of this 
fee since its inception; (<I>c</I>) the location of this revenue item 
within the public accounts for this department; (<I>d</I>) the amount 
spent from this collected revenue on Language Instruction for 
Newcomers (LINC) and an item breakdown on the use of this funds; 
(<I>e</I>) an outline of the accounting process in place to ensure proper 
use and distribution of this fund for LINC; and (<I>f</I>) any studies or 
documentation that may identify the LINC program is not 
duplicating English as a Second Language (ESL) program? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B>  (a) The introduction of the right of landing 
fee, ROLF, by the government in February 1995 was in response to 
extensive public consultations held by the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada, CIC, in 1994 and to the 
government-wide program review exercise.  During the public 
consultations it was recognized that, if the department was to 
continue to provide an acceptable level of service to immigrants 
in view of the government-wide commitment, a greater share of the 
costs should be transferred from the taxpayers to the direct 
beneficiaries of immigration services.  Further, program review 
made reduction of the federal debt a priority for all government 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government concluded that the acquisition of permanent 
residence and Canadian citizenship had tangible and intangible 
value to the recipient.  This value was derived from access to an 
enhanced economic and social opportunity in Canada as well as 
access to a wide range of programs and services available.  The 
right of landing fee provides partial compensation for the many 
rights and privileges that landed immigrant status confers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The ROLF was implemented February 28, 1995.  Since its 
inception a net revenue, revenue minus refunds, of $458.5M has 
been generated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Family class immigrants 19 years of age and over represent 
approximately 24% of all permanent resident landings in Canada. 
On this basis, total ROLF revenue derived from family class 
immigrants is estimated to be $110.04M. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Citizenship and immigration revenue, including revenue 
derived from the right of landing fee is located in the public 
accounts, details of expenditures and revenues, volume II, part 
I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) All revenue collected by CIC is deposited to the credit of 
the consolidated revenue fund, CRF.  The revenue generated by the 
ROLF does not go directly toward the department's budget.  The 
ROLF revenue assists to generally offset the costs throughout the 
immigration portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The language instruction for newcomers, LINC, was funded by 
$102M in fiscal year 1997-98 from CIC's contribution budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) Please see response for (d) above. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) Under LINC, CIC funds organizations for the provision of basic 
language training to adult immigrants in one of Canada's official 
languages.  In some communities, other levels of government will 
fund language training options also.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on October 28, 1997, I asked Question No. 33 and again on 
December 2, 1997, I asked Question No. 56.  I have asked the hon. 
gentleman opposite on a number of occasions about the placement 
of these questions.  The questions relate to the Oak Bay Marine 
Group, a company owned by Mr. Bob Wright, and a company perhaps 
favoured by the minister of fisheries.  I wonder if the member 
can tell me the status of those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, on December 1, 1997, I asked Question No. 51 which has 
to do with the aboriginal fisheries.  Again it is another 
question which the minister may not be too happy to answer, but I 
would like to know what is happening to my question.

<A NAME="LINK28">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urges the government to act on the recommendation 
of Justice Horace Krever to compensate all victims who contracted 
Hepatitis C from tainted blood. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  According to Standing Order 43(2), I 
would like to advise the House that Reform Party members will be 
dividing their time during the speaking rotation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, some victims of hepatitis C 
from tainted blood arrived on the Hill on Monday.  They asked for 
a debate in the House.  They asked the Prime Minister for that 
very thing.  They sent him a letter saying “Could we please 
debate this?  We do not think it is fair that some individuals 
should be compensated and others not”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition today is providing that debate by using 
our opposition day, a supply day, to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims felt frustrated and angry and in fact impotent, they 
told me, and I, along with other members of my party, am honoured 
to be able to provide that voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's decision to compensate half of the victims is 
based upon some rationales.  I would like to go over those 
rationales and try to refute each one of them in turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first rationale is that the timeframe, 1986 to 1990, was 
unique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second rationale is that if they compensate everyone there 
will be a huge precedent set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third rationale is that the floodgates of medical claims 
would open wide and it would put at risk our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth rationale is that since all 13 governments in Canada 
signed on to this agreement it must be right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In turn, let me address those rationales.  I consider them to be 
debating arguments rather than principle arguments.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timeframe of 1986 to 1990 is an arbitrary legal phoney 
dividing point for the following reasons.  It is very evident 
that regulators messed up; Judge Krever said so plainly and 
clearly.  The special new test the government said was 
unavailable before 1986 was developed in 1958.  I have practised 
medicine in this country and I have used that test for much of my 
medical career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ALT test was by no means new. In fact, as it became more and 
more useful for determining whether or not hepatitis C was 
present in blood, other jurisdictions used it much earlier than 
1986. For comparison, in the United States it was used in New 
York in 1982. It only became a regulatory thing with the U.S. in 
1986 when they said that since everybody was using it they should 
make sure that it was a federal regulation. In 1981 a premier 
official of the Red Cross in Canada recommended the use of this 
test.  It was available and was accepted before.  The date is an 
arbitrary legal date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mean to be really harsh on this but I think that 
decision is despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking on the issue that the floodgates would open, that the 
floodgates would sink our medical system, a precedent is a 
precedent.  Two main precedents have been set on this issue in 
Canada for other medical issues, the thalidomide tragedy and 
compensation for HIV.  I will be specific about HIV because it is 
so close in time and it is from the same contaminated blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no test available in 1989 for HIV.  Compensation for 
all HIV victims in Canada who got HIV from tainted blood was 
offered and accepted.  Has there been a floodgate of spurious 
medical claims because of that?  Of course not.  Canadians' 
compassion recognized that the severe effect HIV had on those 
individuals was a specific medical tragedy.  Hepatitis C was as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister went on to say that other medical 
misadventures like breast implants or obstetrical tragedies would 
be under the same cloak if we were to compensate all victims of 
hepatitis C.  That is wrong. As I said before, I have practised 
medicine.  I had medical malpractice insurance. If I made a 
medical mistake, I would personally be sued for that mistake.  I 
am thankful that never occurred over a 25 year span.  This was 
for personal errors.  If a manufacturer were to make faulty 
medical devices, it would be sued.  The minister's argument is 
absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go to the experience in other countries.  Other 
jurisdictions have decided to compensate all victims of hepatitis 
C.  Ireland comes to mind.  I had a chance to talk with officials 
from Ireland.  Their plan goes back to 1996 when they started 
paying individuals.  I asked them if there had been an outpouring 
of frivolous claims or claims from other areas of medical 
malpractice.  Zero.  Not one single claim.  The argument provided 
by the minister is absolutely ludicrous. It is just a legal 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ireland the officials said that their government tried to 
inflate the numbers of victims to make it look as if it would be 
a huge expense for the Irish public.  That is an interesting 
thing which our government is trying to do.  The Hepatitis C 
Society of Canada has told me that its number of victims is about 
one-third the number the government is trying to foist on us.  I 
do not understand this. The effect of other precedent setting 
compensation packages on the medical malpractice system in Canada 
is one big fat zero and Canadians know that.  Hepatitis C 
compensation would do exactly the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other argument is that since all governments have signed on 
to this agreement, it must be right. 
Every single government in Canada is implicated in this tragedy. 
Krever has said that the provinces as well as the federal 
government are responsible. The federal government takes the 
brunt of this responsibility sadly, but just because 13 people 
rob a bank, does that mean robbing a bank is right?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The arguments fall completely apart.  The regulators in Canada 
failed.  A huge human tragedy resulted.  Canadians were harmed. 
Compensation should be paid to all those individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an escape for the government.  I believe we should always 
try to provide an escape clause for the government.  It knows it 
has made an error in this.  Here is how it can save face, look 
compassionate and say that it has listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A compensation package for everyone should be based upon some 
principles.  First it should be non-adversarial. They should not 
have to go to the court.  Second, payment should be based on 
showing a direct connection between hepatitis C and a blood 
transfusion.  That involves some scientific evidence. Third, 
there should be the ability to return in a non-adversarial sense 
if the disease worsens.  Finally, there should be the ability to 
go to court if an individual is unsatisfied with the compensation 
package.  They should not be forced into taking a compensation 
package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These principles give victims dignity and virtually all the 
funds go to the victims, not to lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the Prime Minister saying that the vote coming 
from this supply day opposition motion is a vote of confidence, 
that is another feeble excuse to give his backbenchers the 
ability to vote as they should. Surely the Prime Minister as an 
experienced politician knows this.  There is a very specific 
reference in clause 168 of Beauchesne's saying that the standing 
orders have completely deleted the ability of a confidence motion 
to follow upon the debates from a supply day motion. It is plain 
to see.  I am going to table this so that the Prime Minister can 
read something he should have known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we ask, and this is something that is sincere and honest and 
open, is for the government to look at this principle. If the 
government is absolutely certain that there should be no 
compensation for any other victim of hepatitis C, let members 
vote freely.  If the government will do that, the victims who 
came to Parliament Hill on Monday, those individuals who felt 
impotent and alone and hurt by this government decision will say 
that they have had the debate and their day in the House of 
Commons of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my plea.  That is my wish.  That is my hope.  I 
challenge the Prime Minister to allow that to happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the member for his work on this issue.  Everyone in this 
House knows he has taken a leadership role in this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from the moral persuasion that we use in this House from 
time to time, what else can we do to convince other members on 
the government side that this vote has to be won? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to prove to Canadians that we are a compassionate 
country.  In my opinion, this is probably the worst travesty in 
the history of health care in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from moral persuasion, what can we do in the next number 
of days to ensure that this very important vote is won on the 
floor of the House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, moral persuasion is 
sometimes a powerful persuasion. The persuasion I see as the most 
effective is the persuasion of the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a few days now between this debate and when the vote 
will take place.  I simply ask the victims who have suffered to 
go to their MPs. 
I expect them to come to me with their faxes and their letters, 
but best is for them to look their members of parliament in the 
eye and express what this disease has meant to them.  Look them 
in the eye and ask “Do you agree with giving compensation to 
some and no compensation to others?”  When that happens I do not 
care what the Prime Minister says. I do not care what the Prime 
Minister does.  An individual in their heart will have to say “I 
do not believe it is fair to turn some out on the street”.

not for me nor is it for the member who also has had a profound 
interest in this issue.  This is for people who have been harmed 
by a public system.  Those victims will not go away. The 
government will have this hanging around its neck for the rest of 
this term unless it says that it made a mistake. The government 
does not have to lose face.  We are not going to vote its members 
out of office for this but if they continue with this, their 
offices are at risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to seek a comment from the member 
particularly with respect to the matter of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reaffirm the interpretation the member gave to 
the standing orders. When considering an opposition day motion, 
for a decade now opposition day motions have not been 
procedurally speaking matters of confidence. A long time ago we 
changed the rules so that precisely what the Prime Minister is 
trying to create in the context of this opposition day motion 
would not occur.  In days before that rule change, members would 
always vote according to which party they belonged to, which side 
of the House they belonged to because these motions were 
considered to be matters of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not matters of confidence and can only be made matters 
of confidence in two ways.  First is by the leader of a party 
declaring it so and second is by the members of that party whose 
leader has declared it to be so abiding by that particular 
declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member's opinion on this. This is a 
perfect opportunity for members of the Liberal backbench to say 
“No, we are sorry Mr. Prime Minister but we think this should 
not be regarded as a matter of confidence”.  It is not part of 
the government's platform.  It is not part of the government's 
budget.  It was not in the throne speech.  It was not in all that 
which might be legitimate we argue might be a matter of 
confidence.  It is an entirely separate issue on which parliament 
should render a judgment unhindered by the confidence convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would join with the hon. member in calling upon Liberal 
backbenchers to seize this moment to make parliamentary history 
and say from here on in that we do not accept that these kinds of 
things will be needlessly made matters of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr Speaker, the member is quite an expert 
in the rules and I claim not to be such an expert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read from the rules.  On December 20, 1984 the House 
removed references in the standing orders which described votable 
motions on allotted days, that is today, as questions of 
confidence.  That was removed.  They are not questions of 
confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commit to the Prime Minister that I and my party will not make 
this an issue of confidence.  The government will not fall on the 
basis of this.  It cannot fall. If the Prime Minister says it is 
a matter of confidence, I think he is making a grave error.  I 
once again strongly encourage him to allow members of parliament 
to vote with their hearts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a privilege to speak to this issue.  I am going to cover 
the issue of confidence and exactly why this government is 
incorrect on this issue.  I am going to refer to another issue 
which happened in this House almost two years ago today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue we have before us today is actually one of integrity, 
fairness and leadership.  I was raised to believe that you had to 
pay for your mistakes and be responsible for your actions. I 
think such is the case for the federal government on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of compensating people who have contracted the 
hepatitis C virus because of receiving tainted blood, further as 
a result of government actions, must be dealt with in a fair and 
just manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that today we are dealing with a health minister 
who has failed to answer the call of the victims of hepatitis C. 
Two years ago that same health minister was the justice minister 
who was asked to come into the House on the call of some other 
victims.  That is when the Reform Party tabled a national victims 
bill of rights.  Of course we all know what happened to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same minister stood and said “Yes, we all care about 
victims.  We are really concerned about victims and we will do 
something about this.  We will develop a national victims bill of 
rights”.  Today what do we have?  Nothing, zero, nil.  Just a 
bunch of rhetoric.  It is ironic that it comes from the same 
individual who is now the health minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have no victims rights and we have no hepatitis victims 
getting compensation.  Is that familiar or what?  We are looking 
at the same instance where the heat was on the government by 
victims of crime all across the country.  It bent, took it into 
the House of Commons and said something would be done.  The heat 
went off and it was dropped.  It is so typical.  Canadians often 
wonder why they lose confidence in the people sent to Ottawa. 
This is exactly why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read something that is very interesting about the issue 
of confidence.  Two years ago, when I dug back into the 
<I>Hansard</I> debates, I asked a question of the very same 
minister who was then the justice minister on a supply day, which 
is rather ironic, as it is today: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today the justice minister said he was willing to support 
the Reform Party's efforts to develop a national victims bill of 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also indicated there would be a free vote on that issue today 
at 6:30 p.m.  Could he confirm it? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's response was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer of course is that when there are resolutions, as there 
are today involving victims rights, members of this party vote as 
they see fit.  I already told the House this morning that I am 
going to be voting in favour of the resolution because I share 
the objectives expressed by the hon. member.  I expect that other 
members of the government side will vote as they see fit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the identical issue.  It is about rights.  It is a 
supply day.  It is about confidence in a vote, and yet two years 
ago the same minister stood in the House and said that was no 
problem.  Today, when faced with an even more compassionate issue 
as far as victims who are in varying need of health care, of 
compensation, the government says it is not an issue of 
confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an issue of confidence and therefore we must vote together 
on it.  I just do not understand what is with this government. It 
does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask my colleagues and those watching today whether this 
is the expectations they have of a minister and a government.  Is 
this what they are wanting, a flip flop as they see fit?  I think 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess one of these days this will come back to haunt the 
government.  The government cannot keep changing the rules as it 
sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk for a moment about the practicality of the 
government and the minister not compensating those who have 
contracted hepatitis C.  The first issue I think about is the 
multimillions of dollars that will be spent by those already 
victimized trying to receive compensation given to others in 
identical circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of logic is there in this?  These people are already 
victims.  Now the government is demanding that these people get 
the same compensation given others by an arbitrary cut-off line. 
They will have to go to court and fight.  Many of them cannot 
afford the bills.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who gets something out of this?  The lawyers will get wealthy, I 
am sure, all across this land.  But what about the victims?  It 
does not make sense.  I would like to see members on the other 
side justify this in those terms.  Many victims of crime call 
that revictimization, and I would agree with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about another issue.  Justice Krever spent four 
years looking into this issue and spent millions of dollars 
trying to find a fair and reasonable answer to the issue.  His 
recommendation after four long years, which I presume the 
government would like to accept, is to compensate those infected 
with hepatitis C; not those over 40, not school children, not 
women, but all those who have hepatitis C.  That is as simple and 
as clear as a bell.  Does this make sense?  Of course it does. 
Then why is there an arbitrary decision to cut a line and say 
that some will and some will not?  Does that make sense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about something even closer to home for many of us. 
The government over the last number of years is well known to 
have blown multimillions of dollars out the door, billions of 
dollars in fact.  It calls this an issue of money.  The 
government asks if it goes down the line and compensates 
everybody, can it afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some other things the government says it can 
afford.  $1.4 million over three years to the Czech municipal 
authorities is okay but compensating those prior to 1986 is not. 
$473,000 to look at an overhaul of the Czechoslovakia judicial 
reform is okay but compensating hepatitis C victims is not. 
$500,000 to reintegrate Malian soldiers back into their society 
is okay but compensating hepatitis C victims prior to 1986 is 
not.  $14 million to provide Canadian built locomotives to 
Senegal is okay but compensating victims of hepatitis C prior to 
1986 is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really think the average taxpayer or the average person looks 
at issues like this and asks “Why is that okay but compensating 
those prior to 1986 is not?  What kind of rationale could a 
government come up with to justify that?”  Is it fair to 
Canadians?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>$450,000 to establish a Lebanese parliamentary institute is 
okay, yet the government does not have the courage of its 
convictions to treat its own Canadian citizens fairly.  It is 
quite shameful actually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has compensated all AIDS tainted blood victims. 
The government has compensated the east coast fishermen for the 
loss of their fishery.  In opposition the Liberal politicians 
before us pressured the Conservatives to compensate all 
thalidomide victims.   Now they exclude, arbitrarily I might add, 
all hepatitis C victims prior to 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand my time is up, but I do have an amendment to the 
motion.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK32">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting after the word “House” 
the word “strongly”.

<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member who just spoke talked about how this would 
force many hepatitis C victims to go to court and how the 
government would use money defending itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he comment on the fact that the government is using 
taxpayers' money to defend itself against taxpayers and the 
position that puts taxpayers in when going to court to defend 
themselves against the government and supplying the money to 
their opponents so they can fight them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have another question if it is appropriate.  I know there 
are certain rules in the House and I do not want to go against 
those rules.  Approaching it from the other side, could the hon. 
member comment on what impact he thinks the speech he just made 
had the single Liberal listening to it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will answer his second 
question first.  It is ironic that all opposition parties raise 
this issue.  We raised it yesterday and for months and months 
now.  Yesterday we gave the government notice in the House that 
there would be a very special debate on the hepatitis C issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The media looked at it.  The rest of the country is looking at 
it.  Ironically I find one Liberal member in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know that this would be of interest 
to all, but I think the hon. member also knows that it is 
improper to refer to the absence of others.  I think that is what 
he is in effect doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  Come on, Randy, tell us who it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have made the argument that the 
member is referring to the presence of one but the effect of 
that, as he knows, is to refer to the absence of the others.  I 
know he would not want to do that.  It would be a breach of the 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I make no attempt whatever 
to say there is only one Liberal in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue concerns everybody in opposition.  This is not 
something where the government can sweep it under the table and 
hope it goes away.  It will just not go away.  It has to learn 
that absence does not make the parliamentary heart grow fonder. 
In fact it is just the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue my colleague asked about was paying the bills 
for this.  This is ironic.  Why is it victims across the country, 
whether it is hepatitis C victims, victims of crime or victims of 
virtually everything in our society, end up footing the bill and 
fighting for rights the government has arbitrarily given to 
others?  The cost will not only be enormous personally for some 
of these people.  There will be the costs to government, court 
costs, judicial costs and the cost of legal aid lawyers.  It will 
go on and on for years.  Yet the government steadfastly says that 
is okay, that it is their problem and not its problem.  It is a 
sad case for victims of hepatitis C. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I stand on behalf of the New Democratic Party and thank 
the Reform Party for its motion today.  I also wish to thank 
publicly all hepatitis C victims and AIDS victims in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I have a slight concern.  I will be corrected if I am 
mistaken, but we certainly do not like the idea of a two tier 
compensation system for hep C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I would like to ask if they believe in a two 
tier health system.  In Alberta Bill C-37 is now about to become 
legislation, which will do erode the public health care system. 
Would the hon. member comment on that?

bring something like that up when we are talking about hepatitis 
C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of health care is another issue that we have gladly 
debated in this House from time to time.  What the NDP should do 
today is focus on a very important issue that is over there, not 
over here.  The NDP would be very wise in this House today to try 
to understand the situation as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have thousands upon thousands of people who have arbitrarily 
been excluded from compensation by a government that cannot 
justify it.  We have victims across this country who have been 
arbitrarily shut out of a system by a government which is wrong. 
The NDP would be very wise to maybe expand its horizons.  The 
House would be better off as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the 
previous two interventions and to the questions and answers 
associated with them.  I am more relieved now that we are back in 
focus.  I thought initially, without being sarcastic, that the 
issue was no longer one as indicated by the motion but rather one 
of wrangling about parliamentary procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that on an issue like the one before us today we 
think in long term vision, we look at the errors of the past, we 
try to reconstruct and go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with the complex issue of assistance for those 
Canadians infected with hepatitis C during a time when the blood 
system could have responded differently but did not, it is 
important to point out that all Canada's governments, the 
territorial and provincial governments of all partisans stripes 
as well as the federal government, have taken decisive actions to 
ensure that such tragic events do not occur again.  It is a point 
that should be kept in mind as we debate the issue over the 
course of this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to keep in mind that public faith and 
confidence in blood safety have suffered as a result of past 
events.  We should not exasperate that.  Canadians need 
reassurance that the blood supply, the blood system today, is 
safe and effective in Canada as it is in any other country. That 
is what I would like to speak about today, the progress made by 
governments to resolve the issue of confidence in blood safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to inform the House on how governments, this 
government in particular, are working together with partners to 
build a new, safe and integrated blood system.  In speaking about 
that progress, I will be speaking about partnership. Restoring 
confidence in blood safety and building a better blood system 
hinges on bringing many partners together to achieve a common 
goal.  Partners and stakeholders are essential to any effective 
national system.  This spirit is our guide in building a better 
blood system where all stakeholders can have confidence that they 
play a role and have a voice that will be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, as elsewhere, governments, consumers, those harmed, 
their families, specialists, scientists and others have all been 
working to ensure safer blood supplies and better systems of 
delivery.

operate the blood system as a part of their health care systems, 
we are well on track with transition plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A transition bureau has already been appointed.  The bureau is 
working hard to ensure that the new Canadian blood services is up 
and operating as soon as possible with a target date for 
September 1998.  Of course many operational details still have to 
be worked out.  However, all those involved are committed to 
making the transition as smooth, as seamless and as safe as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's new blood system is a product of consensus and 
partnership among all key stakeholders.  This is only right 
because the blood system belongs to each one of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By continuing to work together partners and stakeholders will 
achieve a new system in which we can all take pride.  This is not 
just a technical or management exercise.  Rebuilding confidence 
means earning respect and the good faith of blood donors, 
consumers, patients and all our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Justice Horace Krever's commission provided a clear 
assessment for Canadians about what went wrong in the 1980s and 
how we can ensure that it never happens again. Justice Krever set 
a path that governments and stakeholders are following.  The way 
he has shown was drawn from what he heard during the extensive 
hearings of the commission and his careful deliberations on the 
events of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way we can show we have learned from the past is by building 
a system with all the feasible safeguards to ensure the past does 
not happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the course of public hearings of the commission 
consumers, transfusion medicine specialists and management 
experts identified many deficiencies in the old blood system. 
They identified flaws as a lack of systematic, co-ordinated and 
rapid response in the face of emerging safety risks.  They saw a 
lack of accountabilities for safety and governance.  They saw 
rigid financing arrangements that did not reflect the focus on 
priorities of safety.  They observed a fragmentation in blood 
science and research and development.  Governments saw all this 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada took a lead role in bringing provinces 
and territories together to discuss ways to solve these problems. 
We asked consumers and scientists to join in the discussion.  We 
consulted, we listened and we considered options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September at a meeting in Fredericton, Canada's health 
ministers built on the substantial progress that had already been 
made and made a decisive step forward in the creation of a new, 
single agency to manage Canada's blood system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canadian blood services moved a step closer to becoming 
fully operational by September 1998.  That agency will be 
responsible for managing all aspects of an accountable, fully 
integrated blood system.  It is based on four key principles that 
government set out for the new blood system in 1996, principles 
which partners and stakeholders endorsed with enthusiasm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the safety of the blood supply is of paramount importance 
if we want to earn the confidence of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a fully integrated approach is essential if we are to 
have a clear and coherent system in which all participants work 
effectively and co-operatively.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, accountabilities must be clear so that people inside the 
system and outside it know who is responsible for action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the system must be transparent because it needs to 
operate in full view with its windows and doors wide open for 
public inspection.  All those involved in the planning of the new 
blood system will examine his advice carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say a word about Quebec.  So far, Quebec has decided not 
to be a part of the blood system plans.  Quebec is pursuing its 
own efforts to incorporate the blood system operations in its 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ways to collaborate with the Canadian blood system and the new 
blood system can be discussed.  Of course blood and blood 
products used by patients in Quebec have to comply with federal 
regulations for safety and efficacy, the same as anywhere else in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What role does the federal government play in the new blood 
system?  The role is quite different from that of the provinces 
and the territories.  The provinces and territories are 
responsible and accountable for the national blood program.  They 
set funding, broad health policy objectives and ensure the 
overall integrity of the system. The Government of Canada is 
supporting them as they manage the transition to the new system. 
This is very much in keeping and consistent with our role in 
pursuing better ways to improve and enhance the health of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, the government agreed to provide a grant of up 
to $81 million to support the start-up of the new system.  Will 
the Government of Canada play other roles now and when the system 
is up and running?  Of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Blood safety is a priority for the government and the government 
will continue to work to make blood as safe as it can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think it is fair to say that the 
hon. member's time has expired.  It is time for questions and 
comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the motion 
today is pretty specific, to decide whether members of Parliament 
agree with compensating all the victims of hepatitis C as Justice 
Krever suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to the member's commentary and I have not 
heard much on the actual motion.  I would like to ask him a 
direct question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he believe that Justice Krever's recommendation should or 
should not be followed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question 
because it allows me to remind myself and everyone else that the 
motion gives us an opportunity to address the entire issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the member opposite, I was a little dismayed that we were 
not addressing the issues as he presented them or had begun to 
present them but we were talking about procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since he has raised the question of the relevance of Judge 
Krever's impact on the motion today, I regrettably could not 
finish so that I would have satisfied his question prior to its 
being raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the opportunity to do that now.  I want to advise 
him that in dealing with Judge Krever's very comprehensive report 
one must take into consideration the nature of risk in a complex 
biological substance such as blood and blood products.  Canadians 
understand that even when safety is at its highest, the very 
nature of blood means that we can never let our guard down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Krever advised Canadians that because of the nature of 
blood there should never be complacency about safety. How to make 
a safer, better system which is prepared to face new and emerging 
threats to safety is one of the key challenges facing all those 
involved, including governments, scientists, medical and 
technical specialists, patients and donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is a regulator of the blood supply system.  Health 
Canada regulates blood and blood products under the Food and 
Drugs Act and the department conducts national disease 
surveillance. 
Those roles preclude active involvement in the operation of the 
blood system, but as a regulator Health Canada is committed to 
the same high standards of accountability, openness and 
transparency that we expect from the provinces and territories in 
the operation of their blood systems. Canadians deserve no less.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me describe some of Canada's recent efforts to strengthen 
the blood safety system, which is directly relevant to the 
member's question.  First, Health Canada has established a blood 
safety council to advise the government on matters of blood 
safety and to be a source of information and guidance on such 
matters from a national perspective. Consumers sit on this 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the department is working actively with other partners 
to reduce risk of bacterial contamination of blood.  Third, it is 
developing a regulatory framework that will take blood regulation 
forward into the future.  It has an expert advisory committee on 
blood regulations to provide expert input on specific blood 
regulatory matters.  Fourth, disease surveillance capacity 
related to blood safety has been strengthened.  A blood-borne 
pathogens unit has been set up and improvements in field 
epidemiology have been made.  I am happy to say that today Canada 
has a stronger capacity to respond to new and emerging blood 
safety risks as a result of such improvements, improvements 
recommended by Judge Krever.  This is evidence that the 
government attaches great importance to blood safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members want to know that the government is working to identify 
potential new threats to the safety of our blood supply and that 
it is ensuring that never ends.  The government will provide a 
million dollars a year to the Canadian blood services, money that 
will be specifically targeted for blood science, research and 
development. That funding will keep Canadians in the forefront of 
blood science and maintain Canada's position in international 
blood research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members want me to use the rest of the time to point out 
that in the new system Canadians are building, better science 
will be there to support strong and effective regulations.  It 
will be there to help the system meet the highest safety 
considerations and it will be there out in the open for all 
stakeholders to review.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time for questions and comments has 
expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise this morning in support of the Reform motion, 
which states “That this House urges the government to act on the 
recommendation of Justice Horace Krever to compensate all 
victims who contracted hepatitis C from tainted blood.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my leader made me responsible for health upon my arrival 
here in 1993, the tainted blood scandal was one of the very 
first issues I had to look into. I did so with great compassion 
for the victims of this tragedy. There are no words to describe 
what has certainly been one of the worst scandals of modern day 
medicine in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, the Bloc Quebecois has asked more than 100 questions 
about the inquiry into the tainted blood scandal. These 
questions were always intended to advance the inquiry presided 
by Justice Krever. Parliamentarians will recall that this 
inquiry ran into some roadblocks. 
These roadblocks were not always set up by people outside this 
Parliament. The government of the day seemed intent on throwing 
a monkey wrench into the process so as to stifle the tainted 
blood inquiry. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The blood inquiry has gone on for four years and cost $15 
million.  We also know that documents that could have been very 
useful to the inquiry were destroyed and that this did not seem 
to worry the government unduly, because those who destroyed the 
documents have gone unpunished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were also the attempts to block Judge Krever's efforts 
through the courts.  These attempts were never justified, any 
more than the sometimes extreme comments made about the inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1996, the Prime Minister maintained that the law 
prevented him from disclosing documents that included 
transcripts of cabinet deliberations in 1984, the time when 
scientists were sounding warnings about the discovery of a 
dangerous new virus in blood banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being told that only those who contracted the disease 
between 1986 and 1990 are being compensated because, although 
that was when the facts were known, preventive measures had not 
been taken.  We know that there were cabinet transcripts setting 
out the situation as early as 1984, so why were these documents 
not disclosed?  One could suspect that they contained evidence 
that the government was starting to realize back then that the 
hepatitis C virus and other viruses were contaminating blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current program announced by the federal and 
provincial health ministers in Toronto on March 27, the federal 
and provincial governments are going to contribute $1.1 billion 
to a compensation fund for hemophiliacs who contracted the 
disease, but only if they did so between January 1, 1986 and 
July 1, 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fund will also be used to help those individuals infected 
by a spouse or parent during this period, as well as those who 
contracted HIV from a spouse or parent infected by blood or 
blood products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of this amount, the federal government's share will be $800 
million.  The provinces will put up the other $300 million, and 
will contribute an additional $1.6 billion over the next 30 
years for drugs and various forms of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this represents an enormous effort, in these 
times of tight budgets and cuts to federal payments to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program is restricted to victims who contracted hepatitis C 
between 1986 and 1990, because the Red Cross and the governments 
did not take advantage of tests available, in the U.S. in 
particular, during that time.  Prior to 1986, there was no 
effective test for detecting the disease, which was not known in 
the form hepatitis C takes today. The governments therefore 
acted in accordance with what was known at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this program and the governments which signed it 
were in good faith. 
Now, however, with a bit of hindsight, we see certain signs that 
could enlighten us as to the birth of this program and all that 
could be added to it.  We should keep in mind that the provinces 
will have to spend another $300 million, in addition to 
providing all health care services and drugs required, at a time 
when they have just experienced extraordinary cuts to the Canada 
social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Extraordinary cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> As my colleague has just said, these cuts 
could even be called extraordinary.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government, which is also one of the key parties with 
responsibility in this entire affair, turns up with a zero 
deficit and a budget surplus which will probably be $20 billion 
by the end of 1998, I believe that finding a few million dollars 
to distribute among all hepatitis C victims is no big deal. 
Regardless of what may have happened, these people were 
contaminated through blood and need support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since coming to power, the Liberals have reduced the deficit—I 
want to refer to this again and I am going to provide 
figures—mainly by passing the buck to the provinces. Between 1994 
and 2003, this will amount to $42 billion out of the coffers of 
Quebec and the Canadian provinces. 
That amounts to 52% of the cuts imposed, while the federal 
government's share amounts to barely 12%.  This is an eloquent 
first clue as to the financial situation of the governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2003, Quebeckers and Canadians will face an 
additional $30 billion in federal cuts to health care, education 
and social assistance.  The provinces, obviously, are going to 
have to figure out how to absorb them, as it is they who will 
have to bear the burden and not the federal government.  In the 
meantime, the federal government is coming up with budget 
surpluses, and by 2000—and I say 2000 advisedly—the employment 
insurance fund will have accumulated an excess of $25 billion on 
the backs of workers, the unemployed and the sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The representatives of the governments that agreed to compensate 
the victims of Hepatitis C as humanely as possible did not all 
start off on the same footing in terms of their ability to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tainted blood scandal in Canada is a national tragedy, which 
appeals to Canadians' and Quebeckers' sense of compassion.  The 
point of the exercise is not to point the finger, but more 
importantly to provide justice to the victims of a tragedy of 
unprecedented proportions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government prides itself on taking full responsibility for 
the safety of Canada's blood system.  It can and must set up a 
special no fault program.  Then, afterward, the issue of setting 
up a more extensive no fault system should be debated by 
Canadians as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the time being, I invite all Liberal members in this House 
to support this motion to make it clear to the government that 
it has a moral and financial responsibility to correct an 
incredibly unfair situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this issue has 
tragic implications. I have been involved for six or seven years 
for the simple reason that one of my constituents, Mr. Saumure, 
is an innocent victim and is fighting over this issue. I think 
everyone in the House knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was deeply touched by Mr. Saumure's testimony. Two of his 
brothers died of that terrible disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must vote on this motion and anyone who cares would want all 
those who were contaminated to be covered by a compensation 
agreement. After all, they are innocent victims in all this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the initiative should come from the provincial 
health ministers. If the provincial health ministers— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad:</B> Mr. Speaker, could I please continue?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I would ask members to 
recognize the hon. member's right to put his question or to make 
his comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad:</B> Mr. Speaker, if provincial health ministers took 
the initiative, I am convinced that the federal health minister 
could open the door and reconsider the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was rather difficult to get the provinces to approve the 
agreement that was signed. If the Minister of Health rose in the 
House and said he would consider the possibility of compensating 
the other victims, the provinces would most certainly say that 
he should foot the entire bill. This is a fundamental issue for 
everyone concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad:</B> All this shouting is absolutely useless. What is 
needed is a consensus between all governments on this issue. We 
have a bunch of whiners on the other side, the NDP— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member for Gatineau 
has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the NDP's convictions 
are as strong as its shouting is loud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very simple. We need a consensus among all governments on 
this issue. If the provinces take the initiative, I am convinced 
that the Minister of Health will agree to reconsider the whole 
issue of compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I am asking my colleague if she agrees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would say that I am not at 
all in agreement and that I am very surprised by the stand taken 
by the hon. member, who made the headlines today with his 
extreme compassion for all hepatitis C victims and who, 
according to the newspapers anyway, would like to vote against 
his party line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He tells us today that what is needed is the agreement of all 
provincial health ministers, when the provinces have reached 
their limit, as I gave figures to show earlier.  So far, they 
have made an exceptional effort, doing everything they could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the hon. member that, when this same 
government that is forking out $900 million for submarines to 
keep the military happy, that is spending $2.5 billion on 
millennium scholarships that nobody wants, and that is buying 
over $1 billion worth of helicopters, cannot even come up with a 
few million dollars to compensate all hepatitis C victims, I 
hang my head.  It is unbelievable that the provinces are being 
asked to do more, when they must manage the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the intelligence of all members of this government 
and urge them to vote in favour of the Reform motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time allotted for questions and comments

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
given that the Prime Minister has declared this motion, I would 
say contrary to the spirit of the rules of the House, to be a 
matter of confidence, we can already see Liberal members running 
for cover, hiding under any little rock they can find from the 
reality that they are being presented with a compelling case for 
the Liberal backbench exercising the freedom which is theirs, 
both individually and politically, to tell the Prime Minister 
this is not and should not be declared a matter of confidence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can imagine the Prime Minister going to the people of Canada 
and saying we have resigned because parliament did not agree with 
us on our hepatitis C compensation package and we are going to 
have an election.  That is what the Prime Minister said, he was 
willing to have an election over this particular package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can imagine what that election might be like.  I think if we 
were to have an election which in effect would become a 
referendum of a sort on whether this hepatitis C package was 
legitimate and reflected the values of Canadians, the Liberals 
might be surprised to find out just how much of a majority of 
Canadians agree with the views that are being expressed on the 
opposition side here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are suffering from hepatitis C and who contracted 
that because of tainted blood should not be divided into two 
groups, those who qualify for compensation and those who do not 
on the basis of some arbitrary judgment arrived at 1986 as the 
dividing line. We know the use of 1986 as the cut-off date is 
something that could have been argued otherwise by the government 
if it had wanted to do so.  It is not a hard and fast argument 
that the government is making.  We know that the liability issue 
is not as clear as the minister would like us to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ALT test used to screen non-A, non-B hepatitis, as it was 
then called, was developed in 1958.  In 1981 a <I>New England 
Journal of Medicine</I> study recommended this surrogate testing 
to screen for hepatitis C as did another eminent North American 
medical journal in the same year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Krever report on page 638 shows that the Red Cross and the 
federal health department discussed the test in 1981 but rejected 
it due to the expense.  The victims were abandoned then due to 
the cost of prevention and they are being abandoned now due to 
the cost of compensation.  In both cases we have governments 
making decisions, not on the basis of what is right, what is 
morally just, of what reflects the values of Canadians, but they 
are making these judgments with a calculator in their hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we know about the billions of dollars that are 
spent by the federal government, and for that matter by 
provincial governments, on many other things that are less 
deserving than compensation for people who have innocently been 
contaminated and made to suffer as a result of tainted blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the question that was raised by the member for 
Gatineau having to do with what appears to be the Liberal 
argument now that somehow the provinces should show leadership 
with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next month I will have been here 19 years and I have heard a lot 
of spurious arguments in the House of Commons.  But this has to 
be one of the worst I have ever heard, that the provinces should 
pick up the tab and show leadership on an issue of compensation 
for victims who suffered because of mistakes that were made by a 
federally regulated agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This really has to be a line of thought that could only be 
developed by a Liberal backbencher looking for a place to hide 
because of a lack of courage to stand up to the Prime Minister 
and say this is not a matter of confidence, this is a matter of 
doing the right thing and we are going to vote to do the right 
thing no matter what we are told to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely it was up to the federal government to provide leadership 
just on the basis of who was responsible, who was the regulatory 
authority.  The provinces already have the burden of looking 
after the people who are sick as a result of this and are having 
to bear that burden in the context of billions of dollars being 
removed from their health care budgets by the cutbacks that were 
perpetrated by this very government. To turn to those provinces 
now and say they should show a little more leadership on this is 
absolutely preposterous, politically and morally, that the 
federal government should turn to the provincial governments and 
say they should show more leadership when they are not in a 
position to show that leadership because of the very cutbacks the 
federal government has brought about.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We in NDP support and have supported all along the notion that 
the people who contracted hepatitis C as a result of tainted 
blood should be compensated no matter when they were 
contaminated.  We support the Reform Party motion on this and we 
urge the government backbenchers to.  Perhaps it would help if 
all the House leaders of the opposition parties got together. We 
are going to be saying this individually throughout the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make it clear, we do not regard this as a matter of 
confidence.  We do not think that if parliament were to say to 
the Government of Canada that it does not think its compensation 
package is adequate, change it, make it more generous, make it 
more compassionate, that this is something over which a 
government should fall, something for which there should be an 
election call.  The only person making that ridiculous claim is 
the Prime Minister.  He stood in the House yesterday and said 
this is a matter of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fairness, the Prime Minister is acting within the rules of 
the House. The member earlier was talking about the McGrath 
committee in which we recommended that, if implemented, all the 
matters of confidence be removed from the standing orders of the 
House and that confidence be a matter of political determination. 
The Prime Minister is politically determined that this will be a 
matter of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now up to the Liberal backbenchers to politically 
determine, to individually determine whether the Prime Minister 
has made the right decision on this or whether they have an 
opportunity on Tuesday to make parliamentary history, to say to 
the Prime Minister he has made a mistake on the package in the 
first place and by declaring this a matter of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should vote the way they think is right in spite of what he 
said about this being a matter of confidence because when they 
think it over, if the motion were to pass and parliament were to 
express that the compensation package is not good enough, the 
Prime Minister will not see the governor general the next morning. 
The next morning they are going to say that maybe they should 
rethink the package, maybe they should expand it, maybe it should 
be more generous, have a motion of confidence passed in the House 
or simply declare that it was not a matter of non-confidence. 
All these things are possible within the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Prime Minister to see things differently.  I urge 
Liberal backbenchers to see things differently.  They are on 
shaky ground, ethically and politically.  I do not think 
Canadians accept that victims of hepatitis C should be divided 
into two groups, those who were contaminated after 1986 and those 
who were contaminated before 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is putting forward an argument that it is trying 
to be legally cautious.  It does not want to leave itself and 
other governments open to a precedent setting judgment.  We have 
precedents already.  We have the precedent of all people who 
contracted AIDS through tainted blood being compensated no matter 
when they contracted HIV.  Why not pay attention to that 
precedent?  If we are precedent conscious, why not pay attention 
to that precedent?  Why not pay attention to both precedent and 
experience in other countries?  The member for Macleod said 
earlier this has been done in Ireland.  Has there been this rush 
of claims against the health care system?  Apparently not.  The 
government should muster up its moral courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning we were at the prayer breakfast.  Let us ask 
ourselves what would Jesus do in this situation.  Would he say to 
all the people who were sick with hepatitis C that they will 
compensate only some and not others?  I doubt it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to commend my hon. colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona and I 
would like to ask him a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would venture to speculate about 
which way the people of Canada would have more confidence in the 
government:  if the government insisted that it not pay, or if 
the government said it did make a mistake, there was some 
negligence and that it had the moral responsibility to expand the 
package.  Would that perhaps engender more confidence in the 
government than insisting that it was right even when it was 
wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member knows full well the moral dilemma of 
doing what is right.  Everyone makes a mistake once in a while. 
I wonder if the member would comment on that particular issue. 
What does generate confidence?  Is it insisting on a political 
answer or is it insisting on doing what is right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think Canadians would 
have a lot more confidence in their system of government, not 
just the government, and in the political process if they felt 
they were being governed by a process in which political parties, 
and governments in particular, because they are often the ones 
who make the decisions, did not feel compelled to defend to the 
death every last decision that they make no matter how wrong that 
decision may come to be seen or judged to be, even by themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the point the hon. member is making.  Canadians 
would have more confidence, not less, in a government and in a 
political process in which political parties and particularly 
government were able to say that they would truly allow the 
House to judge proposals on their merits.  It must not be declared 
as a matter of confidence or, as is sometimes the case, it is not 
formally declared a matter of confidence, as it was yesterday by 
the Prime Minister, but is informally communicated to the 
members of the government caucus that this is something they 
are expected to be obedient on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians would have a lot more confidence in a system in which 
that did not take place as often as it does.  I think there is a 
place for confidence.  I think there is a place for governments 
to run on certain things and expect people who run with them to 
toe the line.  However, I believe that should be a limited range 
of proposals and things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the Canadian political system is that the range 
is like this instead of like that.  We need to broaden and expand 
the range of issues on which members of parliament can express 
themselves as individuals or as representatives of their 
constituents, however they judge that to be possible.  I believe 
all political parties have a job to do in that respect, but 
governments in particular because they are the ones who make 
decisions that have the immediate effect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for raising the issue of political discussions in this House. 
This is of course the place to have political discussions.  I 
think he perhaps deterred debate a little when he talked 
about procedures and the significance of procedures in the House. 
However, what I think he really wanted to talk about were the 
merits of compensation packages placed before victims for 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could be allowed a moment I would like to present this to 
members of the House for consideration so they can understand 
exactly what it is that 13 different governments in this country 
established after taking into consideration all the health 
priorities, government priorities and concern for each and every 
one of their electorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments came forward with a package to establish a $1.1 
billion fund to compensate victims.  They also stated that 
services would be provided by the provinces over and above the 
normal services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and most importantly, something we should not ignore is 
that there is a third component to this which is that the courts 
must accept all of the deals or go on to what is available to 
everyone right now which is access to the courts for 
consideration of—

Winnipeg—Transcona will require some time to respond and he has 
15 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member did not say 
anything yet and, as was said before, he did not really respond 
to the argument that I was making.  Seeing that he did not 
respond to what I had to say, I see no need to respond to 
something that I already responded to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the 
outset I want to thank the member for Macleod for introducing the 
motion.  I want to tell all members of the House that we will 
definitely be supporting the motion because I think this debate 
on the floor of the House of Commons is overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I am amazed at, and other members have touched on it, 
is the Prime Minister suggesting that this is going to be a 
confidence vote.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  Obviously we 
all know what happens in a confidence vote if the government 
should lose, and I think the government would certainly be in a 
position to lose this one because it does not even have the 
support of its back benches.  What is the Prime Minister doing? 
He is using the big stick to crack the backbenchers into line, 
forcing them to vote against the motion, even though in their own 
hearts most of them would certainly support it.  Some of them 
have been brave enough to say that publicly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just imagine if the government did lose the vote and it decided 
to take it to the people in an election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am thinking of some of the campaign slogans of the 
past, but you are probably old enough to remember this one.  Do 
you remember in 1972 when Prime Minister Trudeau campaigned on 
the theme that the land is strong?  You are nodding in agreement. 
You remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the campaign slogan would be this time, but I 
imagine the basis of the campaign would be:  “We are running on 
this.  We want a mandate from the Canadian people to deny 
innocent victims of hepatitis C compensation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, given your political past, do you believe that 
would be a tenable campaign position? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are absolutely right.  I see you nodding in 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that will probably be the 
only chuckle we will get out of this entire debate because that 
is not a tenable position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effectively we have 20,000 to 40,000 Canadians left outside the 
compensation package.  The government does not know how many 
there are.  In fact, the other day when questioning the Minister 
of Health he stood and admitted the government does not know how 
many people have been locked outside the package.  It could be 
20,000, it could be 40,000, it could be more.  But the victims of 
hepatitis C are innocent victims.  No one in their right mind 
could support that type of position in a country as historically 
generous as Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can imagine what will now happen is that the innocent victims 
will have to go through the courts to get compensation.  They 
will have to go through the legal system to get compensation. 
That is their only recourse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every legal mind in the country and I think every member in the 
House will know that the government's position is pretty weak on 
this one.  It cannot sustain its position in the courts.  It will 
lose its case in the courts.  When that happens the compensation 
package will be much bigger than what the government imagines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is going to put these people through a protracted 
court process.  At the end of the day some of the victims we are 
trying to help today will not be here because some of them are 
very, very sick.  That is the sum of what we have been saying in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is in a very tricky situation.  In the past in the 
House I have accused the Minister of Finance of being the real 
health minister because what is playing out on the Liberal front 
benches is obviously the jockeying for leadership.  I do not 
think it is any secret that the Prime Minister is not going to be 
here forever.  Of course, it will be his choice when he decides 
to open it up to a leadership race, but the leadership race, as 
we all well know, is already unofficially under way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now who we have jockeying for position is the health minister 
and the finance minister, the two we consider to be the front 
runners as unbiased observers of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stands in the House and says “Listen, I went to 
cabinet, I fought the good fight and it is just unfortunate that 
I lost that fight in cabinet”.  Guess who he lost the fight to? 
The finance minister is the guy who is calling the shots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we point across here and put questions to the health 
minister we should in fact be talking to the Minister of 
Finance.  He is the guy who is calling the shots.  Unfortunately, 
the health minister is the weak link in the chain and he is 
taking the brunt of this decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about opening this package up and doing the right 
thing, the honourable thing, and re-examining this package in the 
hope that all victims would be compensated—and we want a 
straight yes or no answer—what does the minister do?  He fudges 
on that answer.  He does not say yes and he does not say no. 
Why?  He does not dare.  If he says “Yes, we'll open it up”, 
zing, he is immediately gone.  He is no longer in the front row. 
He is gone.  He is history.  If he says “No, we're not going to 
open it up”, he is going to have the wrath of 30 million 
Canadians on him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think politics is being played out in the front benches of the 
Liberal Party, on the government side of the House.  That is 
unfortunate because who are the victims in all of this?  They are 
the hepatitis C victims who have been left outside the package. 
That is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I finish I want to remind the House and all Canadians 
that the government found $500 million to bail itself out of a 
botched helicopter deal.  That was just the legal fees.  That did 
not purchase one helicopter.  I will remind the people around the 
country that it was just to buy itself out of a legal problem 
which it created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not stop there.  It did the same thing with Pearson 
airport.  It got into difficulty there and it cost $750 million 
to bail itself out of that botched deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not end there.  The present Minister of Health was also 
the guy who brought in the gun registration bill.  That cost the 
Canadian taxpayers another half a billion dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying that it has a heart and it wants to do 
the right thing.  We have the Prime Minister sitting over there 
nodding in agreement with the health minister.  All the time this 
is playing out on the floor of the House of Commons, the only man 
who is smiling is the Minister of Finance.  That is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the hepatitis C victims and some of the leadership of 
the movement were asking me the other day, when the women from 
Ireland came over to press their case and to show us how it was 
done, what would have to happen in terms of parliamentary 
procedure.  How would we proceed?  What would have to happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said it was very simple.  In a parliamentary democracy the 
Prime Minister, when he enters this House, can rise in his place 
and say “Listen, we know we made a mistake.  The honourable 
thing is to reopen this package and compensate all victims”.  It 
is as easy as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one person in this House who can change it.  He can 
change it on a moment's notice.  He does not have to put his 
caucus or even some of the cabinet ministers, who I know have 
reservations about this deal, through the meat grinder.  He does 
not have to use a big stick to beat them into submission to 
support his position.  All he has to do is do the honourable 
thing, rise in this House, get up on his hind legs and say “We 
have made a mistake.  We are going to revisit this thing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the eyes of the international world, this is going to be a 
black eye for Canada.  You know the history of this country as 
well as I do and probably better, Mr. Speaker.  We know you are a 
student of history.  This country cannot afford in the 
international world to make those types of cold, irrational 
decisions because we have always been a leader in terms of 
humanitarian aid to the rest of the world. 
All we are doing is asking that the same rules apply to us right 
here in Canada.  Let us set the example and do it right here in 
this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, thank you for your patience.  I will entertain 
questions from other members.  Let this debate continue and on 
Tuesday night when we come into the House for the vote, hopefully 
the people on the other side of the aisle will do the right thing 
and support us in support of this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on such a serious topic as this I 
hope you will interrupt me if I engage in shameful partisan 
snipping. What I would like to do instead, contrary to the tone 
of some of the discussion so far, is to ask the member whether he 
has reviewed the facts as they stand before everyone, victims, 
assistants and members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member probably will recall that all victims have recourse 
to the courts.  Very importantly, what is associated with that is 
that no action by the Government of Canada is taken to deprive 
people of an opportunity to seek compensation in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said to the previous speaker, the compensation package 
offered to a group of victims is dependent upon the accord of the 
courts.  There has to be approval by the courts if the package is 
accepted.  That does not preclude any other packages that may be 
sought afterward.  It is an important distinction that makes 
members opposite feel uncomfortable.  However, this is the case 
in a society where we have the rules of process determining 
everything that ought to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member opposite wants to continue to speculate on the 
internal politics of all parties in this House, then that is a 
good way for him to determine the priorities of the people he 
would pretend to represent.  From our side we have put something 
on the table which gives everyone an opportunity to consider it 
thoughtfully, deliberate and to make a decision.  That does not 
exclude anyone.  The rules of procedure allow everyone to seek 
satisfaction.  The Government of Canada does not close the door 
on any of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  Will 
the parliamentary secretary put his question?  He has been going 
on long enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have indicated that I wanted the 
question put or the comment ended. The hon. member for Charlotte. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for your wise 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply it is cruel and unusual punishment for members to sit on 
this side of the House and listen to the parliamentary secretary 
rant on.  He never addresses the motion before this House, which 
is compensation for the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to take his minister's own words and remind him that 
the minister stood in this House last fall and this spring, in 
fact just hours before the compensation package was announced, 
and led all of us to believe that the government was going to do 
the right thing.  He said he did not want these innocent victims 
to have to go through a lengthy and expensive protracted court 
procedure.  We took the minister at his own words just hours 
before the compensation package was announced and he knowing full 
well that they would not be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the Canadian people to stay tuned on Tuesday 
night and watch their members of parliament as to whether or not 
they will support this motion.  We will support this motion 
because it is the right thing to do.  We want all victims of 
hepatitis C compensated.

question.  I know the member has been very complimentary in terms 
of his support.  Specifically maybe one of the members could tell 
me exactly what he was asking because I was lost in the 
conversation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Perhaps the hon. member could repeat 
his question more briefly.  We have very limited time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Charlotte had mentioned that the finance minister was running the 
health department. Today in the paper there is an announcement 
that David Dodge, a member of the finance department, is now the 
deputy minister of health. I would like his comments on that 
appointment please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we have all 
argued in this House that the decisions being made by the 
government in relation to this compensation package were made by 
accountants and lawyers.  The human factor has to enter in here. 
I would rather see the minister bring in a psychiatrist, 
psychologist or counsellor of some sort rather than bean counters 
and more lawyers. The minister does need some administrative help 
but I think he needs more counselling than what he is probably 
getting. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this Liberal government has consistently stated how proud it is 
that Canada is the number one country in the world, the best 
nation in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like in a rhetorical fashion to ask a question of the 
Minister of Health if he is watching on CPAC today.  If he were 
one who contracted hepatitis C in Canada and watched all the 
other hepatitis C victims get fair and generous compensation, in 
other jurisdictions in the world as well, would he still believe 
in view of that comparison that Canada was the number one country 
in the world, the best nation in which to live? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to speak of the oppression and injustice and how 
these hepatitis C victims feel.  They feel not like citizens of a 
first rate nation, the number one country in the world, but more 
like those of a third world country not having the compassion for 
innocent victims, especially when those innocent victims have 
been made so by the negligence of the government's regulators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt numerous letters, e-mails, correspondence and fax 
messages have been received by other members of parliament, as 
they have been by the Reform official opposition health critics. 
I would like to read into the record a couple of letters.  I will 
read one in full and part of another.  They simply reflect the 
outpouring of grief, the lament and great sense of injustice and 
oppression felt by these people who have contracted hepatitis C 
and those who contracted it before 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter was addressed to me: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing to beseech you to assist me in influencing the 
[health minister] to reconsider his position on the scandalous 
treatment of hepatitis C victims in his patently unfair 
compensation package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contracted hepatitis C while having a kidney removed in June of 
1983.  At that time, testing was indeed available for non-A, 
non-B hepatitis, testing which was not, however, being used in 
Canada. The date chosen, 1986, is entirely arbitrary.  Germany 
began testing in 1981, the United States in 1986. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it rather interesting there was no new information, that 
nothing new entered the equation from 1981 to 1986 in terms of 
information that was not available in 1981.  It is rather 
interesting as well that this government sometimes rants and 
rails at the American health care system yet chooses in this

The government is allowing the American practice in this case to 
dictate Canadian policy.  There is no other good scientific 
reason for so doing. The letter continues:

Nanaimo, B.C. who was infected with hepatitis C through tainted 
blood.  In her letter she asks whether the health minister would 
accept this compensation package if he were infected himself.  It 
would be an interesting question if the minister were here on 
this occasion, but he is not.  But if he were here and if he were 
one of those infected before 1986, would he accept being excluded 
from the compensation package?

would have.  It is sickening.  It is disgusting to hear that ring 
in our ears again and again, a track record like that.  The

of those people.  The minister needs to acknowledge that he has 
scarred the human side of what government is meant to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Krever reports, the Red Cross was aware that non-A, non-B 
hepatitis was getting into the blood supply as early as 1978. The 
Red Cross rejected recommendations from its own people to 
implement surrogate tests in 1981, the ALT test that has already 
been referred to, and the 1984 anti-HBC test. A 1995 study in 
<I>The Lancet</I>, a prestigious and well respected medical 
journal, later revealed that the combined used of these two tests 
would have lowered the incidence of post-transfusion hep C by as 
much as 85%.  From 1986 to 1990 the Red Cross was aware that the 
U.S. was using surrogate testing but did not implement or 
authorize its use in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has admitted the government's direct 
liability yet he refuses to compensate.  This reflects the 
continuing moral failure of this government.  The health minister 
is the Prime Minister's hired gun, a lawyer using cold legal 
arguments to exclude victims who deserve compassion.  The 
government meets flood and ice storm tragedies, “acts of God” 
for which it is not responsible.  But this is the worst public 
health tragedy in Canadian history, for which the government is 
responsible, make no mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister says that he wants to keep the matter out of 
the courts but he is ready to drag up to 40,000 sick people into 
court. The heath minister is prepared to spend millions of tax 
dollars to battle victims in court which will force sick people 
to use their remaining strength and financial resources to fight 
for what is rightfully theirs.  The health minister is 
hypocritical in compensating some hepatitis C victims while 
compensating all AIDS tainted blood victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1992 the feds have spent more than $3 billion to help 
40,000 fishermen who were thrown out of work, as they ought to, 
but the Liberals cannot bring themselves to help dying people, 
not people out of jobs.  That is reason enough to help them. 
These are people not only out of jobs but out of their lives. 
They are dying people. 
When in opposition the Liberals called for compensation of all 
thalidomide victims, all HIV victims through tainted blood. 
Earlier the government compensated all who had urea formaldehyde 
foam insulation in their houses. Mr. Klein reversed his stand 
against compensating victims for sterilization programs in 
Alberta.  Mr. Harris changed his mind with respect to Ontario's 
Dionne quintuplets.  Why can the federal health minister not do 
the honourable thing, save face in some manner, do some 
supplementary program and compensate all victims?

Ireland did give generous compensation to its victims.  But we 
have to wait four years in Canada, the supposed number one nation 
in the world, for that.  It has already taken three years. How 
many more years will victims have to wait?  If Ireland, a nation 
one-tenth the size of Canada, can afford to be generous to its 
victims, why cannot Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister says he wants to save the government money, 
but there are three class actions for $5 billion against him 
already and more to come.  If he really wants to help taxpayers 
he will settle out of court.  The health minister claims if we 
compensate hepatitis C victims we would have to settle others, 
like victims of faulty breast implants. But those companies have 
settled with 16,000 Canadian breast implant victims for $900 
million.  Each company owned up, faced responsibility and settled 
out of court.  Why cannot the health minister do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hepatitis C victims say the government's number of 40,000 is 
probably deliberately inflated.  The Red Cross says half of that. 
What is the real number?  There are number games being played to

he doing that? The government should be giving compensation to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise today on behalf of the constituents of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla to participate in this opposition motion to 
see that all victims who received tainted blood receive 
compensation as the Krever commission indicated was appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very discouraged by what I am hearing from the government 
side today, in particular from the parliamentary secretary who 
has been sent here to do a task, which I understand completely. 
But the task has been sent to do is to say that all victims do 
not and should not receive fair and adequate compensation because 
of the tainted blood they received through no fault of their own. 
I think this position is not a position that is held certainly on 
this side of the House and certainly by a majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January an Angus Reid poll concluded that 87% of Canadians 
agree that all victims of hepatitis C who received their blood 
through blood transfusions through no fault of their own should 
be compensated.  This is not the position the Government of 
Canada has taken though.  It has decided to take a very legal 
position, a position that could be argued is an accounting 
position.  It certainly has not looked at the moral obligation of 
a government when it comes to compensation for these victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the parliamentary secretary speak about the future of 
the blood system. Those are all good things.  All Canadians hope 
that now the new system will be a better system and a good system 
so that we do not have to worry about that system.  I thank the 
parliamentary secretary for talking about the future of a blood 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to talk about today is the future of people. 
In particular I would like to talk about the future of a young 
person in my riding who is 13 years old.  His name is Chase 
Makarenko.  Chase is an interesting young fellow. At two and a 
half years of age it was discovered that young Chase had 
leukemia.  He required extensive chemotherapy and many medical 
procedures.  In 1987 his family was advised that he would need a 
blood transfusion.  Note the date, 1987.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leaves young Chase out of the compensation package.  I 
would like the government to explain to Chase and his family why 
they are not included in this compensation package.  It was not 
Chase's fault.  It was not the family's fault.  It was a system 
that was regulated and controlled by the Governments of Canada 
that tainted the blood he received.  Now Chase has an uncertain 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the futures we are talking about today, like young 
Chase who is 13. What does it mean at age 13 to find out that you 
have hepatitis C?  Has anybody every considered the fact that you 
cannot a mortgage anymore?  You cannot get a loan. You cannot go 
to the bank and go into business like other Canadians who do not 
have hepatitis C.  Has any body considered that?  Has the 
government considered that?  I do not think so. If it has it has 
disregarded it.  It has chosen to take a very firm position on 
this legal point and a date.  It wants to draw a line in the 
sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat in this House and heard the Minister of Health say, before 
they announced the compensation package, that he did not want to 
see the victims of hepatitis C, of tainted blood, to spend their 
lives in court wrangling, going before judges and pleading their 
case.  Now we are hearing that young Chase Makarenko, a 13 year 
old who received poisoned blood through not fault of his own, to 
get compensation will have to spend time in court.  I do not 
understand that.  I would like the government to explain that to 
me. I have been sent here by the people of my riding to get 
answers from this government and to ask questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with the hepatitis C victims of Okanagan—Coquihalla last 
week.  I have a lot of questions.  I have a lot of heart 
wrenching stories.  The Minister of Health does not want to meet 
with those victims.  The Minister of Health does not want to meet 
with young Chase Makarenko from Peachland, B.C. who finds himself 
in this unenviable position.  It is a sad day for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very sad day when we can say to the producers of maple 
syrup that they deserve compensation because we had an ice storm. 
It was a tragic event and maybe they should receive compensation. 
I am not arguing that.  We have seen so many things like the Red 
River flood.  Do those people deserve compensation?  Yes.  But 
does 13 year old Chase Makarenko of Peachland not deserve 
compensation?  I would argue and debate with anyone who wants to 
debate it with me that he does. So do the other victims who 
received poisoned blood.  It was not their fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to think about Chase and the other victims 
who unfortunately do not fall into the compensation package 
outlined by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I would like to read the letter I received from 
Mrs. Makarenko: “I ask you, would you like to step in his shoes 
or try to walk for the next 13 years with him?  I would rather 
doubt it.  You would not be able to understand or handle the 
pain, the suffering, the questions, the uncertainty, the medical 
procedures, the discrimination and the costs.  I believe each and 
every one of you would pass on this gift of life”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then she does the most amazing thing.  She thanks the 
parliamentarians and the government for the time we took to read 
her letter.  She says it is greatly appreciated.  She ends with 
thank you and a signature.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I find, as usual, that a debate 
on such a sensitive and emotional issue requires very careful 
reflection.  I am moved, as I am sure all other members are, by 
the example of Chase and others.  I have a very close friend in 
my riding who is a cause for some serious concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the debate would be helped along by recalling a couple 
of things.  If I am wrong perhaps the member opposite will 
correct me.  First, the offer that is proffered for victims to 
consider is based on the acceptance that those who were infected 
at a time when governments could have done something different 
and did not, that this is a case where they ought to then come 
forward with a package similar to the one that we have addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, perhaps in this specific case it might be worthwhile to 
remember that 1987, if I heard the member correctly, is a date 
that is included in that particular package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order. If the member has a question he should get to the 
question instead of going into all this material he never got 
through before.  If he can preface his remarks and get to his 
question, I think that is the point of the questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know you will accept 
that this is a time for questions and/or comments.  I wanted to 
reflect on the date that the member gave us in his presentation. 
It was a good presentation and one that deserves consideration by 
all members.  I was trying to be helpful by giving an indication 
that 1987 falls within those parameters.  If I did not hear that 
correctly or if there is an error then it might be helpful to the 
people concerned to correct that.  I do not mean this to be 
trivial or partisan.  It is an important thing to keep in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Madam Speaker, the question again goes to 
the problem that the government is having with dates.  The point 
here is that the date does not matter.  It is arbitrary.  It is a 
legal argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the parliamentary secretary, who has been sent here to 
be a marionette today for the minister, for again stressing my 
point that the date does not matter.  Young Chase was infected in 
1987.  Does it matter if he was infected in 1986, 1985, 1984 or 
1980? Why should it matter?  Can he explain that to me? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we heard from a medical doctor on this side of the House 
who said that he has practised for some 25 years.  He said there 
was testing available in 1958.  Why did the government not choose 
to take 1958 as the date?  The fact is it is an arbitrary date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question the member as well on the government's inflated 
figures of some 50,000 people.  The member wants to ask me 
questions about a date I gave him.  We have questions to ask him 
about the dates he has given us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
how does the member who has just spoken feel about the fact that 
the government would rather give grants of millions of dollars to 
replace tobacco company sponsorship than compensate the victims 
of its own negligence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Madam Speaker, I touched on this point a 
little in my presentation.  It seems other things that would 
appear to be more politically sensitive in the lives of Canadians 
have more importance to the government and the parliamentary 
secretary.  It is a terrible shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope to see the government move like the Irish 
government did.  Now would be the time to do it because this 
government's decision is wrong.  It is just wrong.  It is morally 
wrong, but it has the power, the opportunity and the ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My arguments today focused on a young person who is in a 
terrible situation.  The government should reflect on such 
people. Members of the Liberal Party should reflect on such 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday night when everyone stands to vote the majority of

could have responded better with appropriate risk reduction 
measures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the blood supply in general there can be no 
doubt of the government's continuing strong commitment to 
resolving the problems associated with Canada's blood system and 
to restoring public confidence.  We fully understand the need to 
take appropriate action to rebuild public confidence in the blood 
supplies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any solutions must be governed by three principles.  First, the 
safety of the blood supply must always come first.  Second, a

That means we need an effective system of accountabilities, 
management structures and processes that control the safe supply

Canada's blood supply, it is important that we discuss thoroughly 
the details of the new system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions have been raised about the role of the regulator 
during the transition of responsibilities for governance to the 
Canadian blood services.  Let me review some of the basics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulator's role is to set the standards for safety of the 
blood system and to ensure that they are met.  Over the past 
several years Health Canada has taken decisive action to improve 
blood safety, and blood safety will continue to be a priority for 
the department in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is involved in strengthening standard setting and 
inspection of the blood system, in improving the development of 
test kits used in blood safety and in facilitating public health 
intelligence with an emphasis on bettering blood science.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These are urgent matters and Health Canada fully recognizes that 
urgency.  It has therefore made a strong commitment to give such 
evaluations top priority.  Health Canada has undertaken a major 
initiative to improve the surveillance and investigative capacity 
of Canada's public health system.  Blood science and blood borne 
infections, old and newly emerging ones, are at the forefront of 
this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is building the capacity to answer basic medical

“safety is an absence of risk”.  He also said “safety is an

in which all Canadians can have confidence.

now and in the future. 
What we are talking about is compensation for the victims who 
were infected through a system that was supported by the federal

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member.  Can he stand in the House 
today and say that he does not believe the victims before 1986 
should be duly compensated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he knows, as all members of the House know, and indeed as all 
Canadians know, this is a very difficult decision.  This is a 
very tough decision.  This is a decision fraught with a great 
deal of emotion.  It is clear that it strikes at the heart of all 
Canadians.  We very much appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is, though, on tough decisions like this one sometimes 
tough decisions have to be taken.  An issue like this one 
sometimes requires that tough public policy decisions be taken in 
a manner that I think is fitting with what the majority of 
Canadians believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the hon. member's question I simply want to say a 
tough issue like this one sometimes requires tough decisions but 
is in the interest of the broader public policy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the motion before us states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urges the government to act on the recommendation 
of Justice Horace Krever to compensate all victims who contracted 
Hepatitis C from tainted blood. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion raises fundamental questions and merits careful and 
thoughtful analysis, but let me say at the outset that as a 
physician before I became a member of parliament I share the pain 
and anguish of all patients with hepatitis C.  In fact I have 
always shared that philosophy as a medical doctor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compensation package announced jointly by the federal, 
provincial and territorial governments last March 27 for 
Canadians infected with hepatitis C through the Canadian blood 
system from January 1, 1986 to July 1, 1990 amounted to $1.1 
billion: $300 million from the provinces and territories and $800 
million from the federal government.  The federal contribution 
represents 73% of the total compensation package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me at once say that the government has not abandoned 
hepatitis C patients infected before and after this period, just 
as we would not abandon other patients whose diseases are also a 
result of treatment procedures, which always carry elements of 
risk.  Our health care system will continue to look after them as 
the various levels of government across the country are committed 
to deliver the health care service we are proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to be imaginative and perhaps we can challenge 
the Medical Research Council of Canada to conduct focus research 
to accelerate the discovery of a treatment for hepatitis C, to 
challenge our medical scientists and to provide them with the 
resources to do the particular type of research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that provincial and territorial governments 
across the land will not sit idly by.  They will be challenged 
even more to hasten their positive considerations of enhancing 
home care and pharmacare programs that will benefit hepatitis C 
patients as well as all other patients suffering from any type of 
illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us suggests that we should adopt the 
recommendation of Justice Krever to implement a no fault scheme 
for this group of patients with hepatitis C.  Let me call to the 
attention of the House that Mr. Justice Krever made this 
recommendation for hepatitis C patients not because he did not 
care or neglected other non-hepatitis patients.  Mr. Krever in 
fact made this recommendation for hepatitis C patients only 
because, as he said in his report on page 1045: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge the force of argument made by among others the 
Pritchard Report that it is difficult to treat blood related 
injury compensation differently from compensation for other 
health care injuries.  Given my terms of reference, however, it 
is not for me, here, to consider for any injuries other than 
those that are related to blood therapy.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from this statement by Justice Krever that what 
Justice Krever was suggesting was a no fault scheme not only to 
compensate patients with hepatitis C but also non-hepatitis C 
patients as long as their diseases are a consequence of tainted 
blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this morning I heard arguments from the opposition that 
it will not open the floodgates as though they were arguing that 
let us not worry about the other kind of patients.  Let me state 
very clearly that even Justice Krever would like a no fault 
scheme for all those other types of patients without 
hepatitis C. Justice Krever said so in his concluding statement 
also on page 1045 in chapter 39 entitled “Financial Assistance 
For Blood Associated Injury” of his report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend that, without delay, the provinces and territories 
devise statutory no fault schemes for compensating persons who 
suffer serious adverse consequences as a result of the 
administration of blood components or blood products. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will note from that quotation, and we in this House 
have a duty to particularly make this observation, that Justice 
Krever's challenge for such a plan is addressed to the provincial 
and territorial governments.  He did not include the challenge in 
the challenge to the federal government as quoted in his report. 
The basis for this argument is to reduce the impact of blood 
related tragedy on Canadian citizens “to give some thought to 
the question of appropriate relief for those affected by the 
inevitable events”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am inclined to support such a recommendation.  I am persuaded 
that in our current legal system the primary mechanism for 
compensating someone who has been harmed through the fault of 
others is a civil action for damages and that those in breach of 
duty to exercise reasonable care resulting in harm are negligent 
and therefore have a duty to pay.  That civil tort process is a 
lengthy one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must underscore again that Justice Krever's recommendation is 
for all types of patients, not only hepatitis C patients who 
suffered injury as a result of the administration of blood 
components or blood products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House has not made a policy decision on this fundamental 
recommendation of Justice Krever.  To make a no fault policy 
change only for hepatitis C patients, desirable as it might be 
from my perspective or from the perspective of others, is 
premature and would be unthoughtful of other non-hepatitis C 
patients equally injured by the blood system and perhaps injured 
by treatment procedures other than through the blood system. We 
have not in this House held that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members opposite would only be respectful and listen to the 
debate I am quoting from Justice Krever hopefully they will gain 
some pearls of wisdom.  When they are worried about the rationale 
of this debate they begin to distract me but they cannot distract 
this member of parliament because the truth speaks for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot be selective for hepatitis C patients only because 
this is the group of patients who have captured the public 
consciousness at this time.  Where were they before?  Did we hear 
from the opposition before on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me come to the testing of blood donation for alanine 
aminotransferase, ALT, as noted in Justice Krever's report, 
volume I.  The use of ALT to reduce the incidence of 
post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis, most of which would 
later prove to be what we now know as hepatitis C, by 40% was 
first reported by the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> in 
April 1981.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in June of the same year the Krever report stated: “The 
United States National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's ad hoc 
committee on ALT testing recommended against the implementation 
of ALT testing in favour of further study of its efficacy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only in February 1986 in the same report that: “The 
United States Food and Drug Administration's blood products 
advisory committee recommended that all blood donations for 
transfusion be tested for both ALT and anti-HBc, an antibody to 
the core of the hepatitis B virus, as surrogate, that is 
substitute, tests for non-A and non-B hepatitis”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, since my colleague shared his time with me and he 
only used seven minutes, perhaps you can give me the additional 
three minutes beyond my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also note from Justice Krever's report that it was only 
in July 1984 that the German regulatory authorities required that 
all products distributed for use in Germany be manufactured from 
ALT tested plasma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consideration of ALT testing in Canada had not been ignored. But 
Justice Krever noted in his report the editorial in the December 
1984 issue of the <I>Annals of Internal Medicine</I> by Dr. Alter 
and Dr. Holland who were investigators in the United States 
National Institute of Health study, and I quote from his report 
on page 642: “They did not, however, endorse the recommendation 
that ALT testing be implemented, and they said that the true 
efficacy of surrogate testing could be proved only by a 
randomised trial that compared tested and untested blood.  By 
1986, however, no such study had been undertaken”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get unanimous consent to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, my 
colleague is a medical practitioner from days of old, as I am. He 
has chosen to look at the specific issue of the ALT testing, when 
it was and when it was not available.  That is a debatable 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's main argument for not going down this road is 
that a precedent would be established that would cause an 
outpouring of frivolous medical claims.  Since the precedents of 
HIV sit in front of Canadians and since the precedents of 
compensation for thalidomide sit in front of Canadians, does the 
member see any evidence of an outpouring of frivolous medical 
malpractice claims because of those compensation programs or can 
he find any evidence in international experience of such a 
precedent setting case showing an outpouring of frivolity when it 
comes to medical malpractice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Madam Speaker, when I develop 
public policy and participate in that process, a more fundamental 
question is not whether because there will be no floodgate of 
other cases we can do this for this group of patients. A more 
fundamental medical question requiring the utmost humanity is to 
consider all patients equally whether they seek damages or not. 
That is why the recommendation of no fault by Justice Krever to 
me is persuasive.  But my submission is that the motion before us 
is premature because it is only focused on a group of patients, 
not on all other patients equally harmed by blood treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medical situations are complex and require a rational basis at 
all times.  It is always a tenuous balance between risk and 
benefit.  So I must say that the scientists of the day face a 
serious dilemma.  But let me say in reply to the question that 
the compensation package announced by the territorial, provincial 
and federal governments is a response based on careful, sensitive 
and thoughtful considerations of all the facts and information at 
hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that no value of compensation can extinguish the pain and 
agony of all patients, whether they are included in the 
compensation package or not. I share their pain and their 
anguish, as my medical colleagues and other members of Parliament 
do. But I remain confident that they will understand this 
announcement was based on a public policy that is thoughtful and 
careful and fair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, the motion before us pre-empts a thorough and careful 
debate on the whole issue of a statutory no fault scheme for 
compensating persons who suffer other serious consequences as a 
result of the administration of blood components or blood 
products as recommended by Justice Krever or, for that matter, as 
a result of other treatment, not necessarily blood components or 
blood products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in specific response to the question of my medical 
colleague, now a colleague in parliament, it is not so much the 
worry about the floodgate of cases, important as it may be.  We 
should consider all patients, even those without hepatitis C. 
For the opposition to now say we must compensate patients with 
hepatitis C because they suffered blood related injury, but not 
those other patients— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member from Reform asked him a pointed question. 
In the interest of time, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Prime Minister should give a pointed response so that other 
colleagues can ask questions as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Madam Speaker, if the member was 
listening he would have understood that I was answering the 
question pointedly.  The question can be answered pointedly in 
the context of the greater whole.  We cannot be simplistic in 
medicine.  I understand his difficulty, but unfortunately the 
member was trying to be simplistic in his approach.  Life is not 
a simple entity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I wish at the outset I could say it is a pleasure to 
rise today to address this issue.  I am afraid I cannot.  In 
fact, it is a bloody disgrace what has happened in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has made what it deems a firm decision and is 
sticking to that position.  I certainly agree with my hon. 
colleague from the NDP who raised the point of order that the 
hon. parliamentary secretary has decided to finish his speech 
instead of addressing the question so aptly put to him by my 
colleague from Macleod. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too had intended to ask the parliamentary secretary a 
question.  The hypocrisy of the hon. member is incredible.  Back 
in 1993— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. On a very sensitive issue like this, I was told in high 
school that in the rules of debate when you become personal you 
have lost the argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not think that is a point of 
order.  I think it is a matter of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I was about to point out 
when the parliamentary secretary intervened with his bogus point 
of order was that when he sat as vice chair on a special 
subcommittee he was quite effusive on the fact that all victims 
of HIV, regardless of when they contracted the disease, should be 
compensated.  Now he stands in his place today with a completely 
different story because the victims happen to have hepatitis C. 
If that is not hypocrisy I do not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sitting in this Chamber and listening to the debate today, I 
have heard about all the legal and bureaucratic answers that I 
care to.  It is at times like this that I am convinced there are 
far too many lawyers sitting on the other side, too many lawyers 
concerned about the many legalities, concerned about setting a 
dangerous precedent, concerned about the dollars and cents.  They 
are worried about the bottom line rather than being willing to do 
what is right, because this is the right thing to do. 
This government damn well knows it.

Saanich—Gulf Islands, I do not have a lot of time left for my 
presentation today.  However, in the time I have left I would 
like to read into the record just one of the many letters that I 
have received as the member of parliament for Prince 
George—Peace River.  I believe that this particular letter 
speaks for the tens of thousands of innocent hepatitis C victims 
whose only fault was that of trust.  They trusted that the blood 
system in Canada was safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter was written on April 21 of this year.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hill, 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing to express my appreciate for the article you wrote 
for the <I>Alaska Highway News</I> on April 20, 1998 titled 
“Grits' health care policies a bloody disgrace”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 26, 1997, I found out that I was infected with 
Hepatitis C from blood received after the birth of my son on 
September 27, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My life has not been the same since.  Each day is a challenge, 
dealing with extreme pain, exhaustive fatigue, constant 
medications and the frustration of being forced to change my life 
because I can no longer live the active lifestyle I enjoyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides the physical manifestations of Hepatitis C, many people 
are unaware of the emotional havoc such an illness wreaks.  It 
has been a constant strain on relationships with my family and 
friends.  I daily face my partner's pain and frustration at 
watching my physical health deteriorate and my emotional battle 
with the frustration of feeling so angry and helpless over my 
lack of control of how this disease is affecting my life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October, I had to send my 15 year old son to live with his 
father in Vancouver because I am concerned about him having time 
to adjust to his new living situation while I am still alive. 
I have talked to him about the pride and joy I felt at his birth 
but it breaks my heart to still see him feeling guilty, like his 
birth is causing my death.  My 18 year old daughter has moved 
back in with me to help provide physical and emotional support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother, who lives in Manitoba, can't speak to me on the 
telephone without crying.  Her faith and prayers have been an 
inspiration to me.  My brother died of cancer on October 26, 
1997.  I held his hand as he died, him promising to be there to 
meet me on the other side soon.  I miss the close relationships I 
had with my sisters.  They have stopped confiding in me because 
they feel I can't handle any more “on my plate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have learned that learning you have Hepatitis C is difficult 
for many others to handle.  I am blessed with supportive close 
friends but other friends and acquaintances don't call any more. 
I am sure you are quite aware of how fast “word of mouth” 
travels in a community the size of ours.  I also realize that 
many people are ignorant and afraid of Hepatitis C and its 
transmission.  But that isn't much consolation for the pain of 
feeling like a “leper”, when others in the community cross the 
street to avoid being close to you or put themselves between you 
and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that is enough, without the feelings of being a burden to 
family, worrying about how I can financially manage yet another 
trip to Vancouver for health care, how my children will manage 
their further education without my support and the constant sense 
of frustration at no longer being able to work, for the financial 
and self-esteem benefits of feeling like a contributing member of 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Peace River area, we also have to contend with the 
expenses of travelling to major centres for medical care.  I am 
trying to see the bright side of that, by knowing I can see my 
son when I have to travel to Vancouver for medical care.  My 
limited income because of my inability to work and the expenses 
of my travel have prevented me from being able to pay for his 
travel to visit Fort St. John during his Christmas holidays and 
Spring Break. 
I had no choice in this situation.  I have joined a class action 
lawsuit because I have been forced into a situation of having to 
fight for compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to also express my sincere appreciation of your speaking 
up for my compensation rights when I feel my weakest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you wish to truly represent me in Ottawa, please continue to 
push for compensation for ALL Hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And if you have a chance to speak to [the Health Minister], 
please ask him to explain to my children how come their mother's 
life is not considered as valuable as another's.

my home here in Ottawa and, while she agreed to let me read this

her name be kept confidential out of respect for the privacy of

watching this debate today.  Every day it seems they hear from

phone, fax, e-mail and drop by my constituency office.  There is 
nothing that they nor I can do to really help these victims. 
They certainly lend a sympathetic ear and I try to be the voice 
of those victims in Ottawa.  Other than that there is precious 
little we can do to ease the suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that it is up to the people on the other side of 
this House to do something to ease that suffering.  It is up to 
the health minister and the Prime Minister.  When the vote comes 
down on this motion to compensate all the victims that have 
received this terrible disease through tainted blood, it is up to 
the backbench Liberals to break ranks and vote with their 
conscience and with their heart.  For God's sake vote for these 
victims.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to commend the member for Prince George—Peace River on a great 
speech.  He is absolutely right, in terms of the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Prime Minister who is in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is simply this.  It brings out the 
worst in members of parliament when they are not allowed to vote 
freely on an issue which rests solely on the conscience of the 
member.  I want to remind the Canadian people, and I know the 
member for Prince George—Peace River knows this, that the 
parliamentary secretary when he was a member of the health 
committee in 1993 wrote a dissenting report recommending that an 
inquiry into the tainted blood scandal be launched.  That was 
done.  Justice Krever has reported and now the parliamentary 
secretary is denying the very thing he supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess in the real world we would call that swallowing yourself 
whole.  The parliamentary secretary swallowed himself whole on 
this one.  Unfortunately that is because the Prime Minister is 
holding the big stick over him because he happens to be the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister of Canada.  Sadly, 
there are only about two of them who showed up today to debate 
this:  the parliamentary secretary to the health minister, who is 
waving the big stick over him, and the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member for Prince George—Peace River to 
comment on the presence of these two and the outrageous defence 
of the indefensible.  Perhaps the member could comment on that.

be on the speech of the member who has just spoken.  I think, in 
this case, the hon. member for Charlotte, with great respect, did 
refer to the speech of the hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley

</I></B></P><P align=left>We can clearly see today by the comments which have been made 
and by the speeches, some great speeches, where people's hearts 
are on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can continue to display the hypocrisy it 
displayed in the past.  It can continue to hold firm to this 
position of two tiered victims of tainted blood, or it can do 
what is right.  It has the opportunity to do what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister in his speech 
suggested that to compensate all hepatitis C victims who got 
their disease from tainted blood is premature.  That is what he 
said, not once but two or three times during his presentation.  I 
would like him to face some of these victims, look them in the 
eye and tell them that it is premature.

Speaker, I commend the hon. member for his wonderful speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have is that the new deputy minister for health 
apparently will be Mr. David Dodge.  I am quoting directly: 
“There are more important things here than money”.  Will he not 
agree that obviously this government has boiled this entire 
compensation package down to resources and finances only? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the kind comments 
of both colleagues who commended me for my speech, but I would 
like to note for the record that almost my entire speech 
consisted of a letter from a young mother in my riding.  It is 
she who should get the credit, not myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is quite right.  In the column that I wrote in the 
local papers in my riding I alluded to the fact that this 
government can find millions of dollars to cover up its 
ineptitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can find, for example, $500 million for the cancellation of 
the EH-101 helicopters; $60 million in an outright lawsuit 
decision for the Pearson airport cancellation; $2 million because 
it decided to go on a witch hunt against a former prime minister 
and it had to pay his legal bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is example after example that the opposition and the 
general public can find where the government seems to be able to 
find hundreds of millions of dollars, but it cannot compensate 
all the victims.  It is worried about a precedent?  Do what is 
right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime

would like to seek unanimous consent in the interests of fairness 
and justice.  Since they alluded to my name, Mr. Speaker, can 
they provide me with a two-minute response to their questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry, there is no consent. 
That disposes of the point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
would like to express that you as the Speaker begin to rule on 
these bogus points of order, including my own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have always been mindful to get up 
and make a ruling after hearing a point of order, bogus or 
otherwise.  The hon. parliamentary secretary is seeking to do 
what the hon. member just did, that is, to make some interjection 
in the debate under the guise of a point of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today on behalf of the constituents of Saanich—Gulf 
Islands to speak on this very important issue brought forward by 
my colleague the member for Macleod. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been following the debate in my office.  We have heard a 
lot of heart wrenching testimonies.  It is very important that we 
listen to them but that we also listen to our moral conscience, 
listen to our constituents, and do what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have letters which I am going to bring into the debate, but I 
am going to start off with what needs to be done as right.  I am 
really frustrated at what this government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read from an article in the April 23 issue of the 
<I>Toronto Star</I>.  These are the tactics the Prime Minister has 
brought himself down to in this debate, and I say has brought 
himself down to: “the Prime Minister declared a vote on a Reform 
Party motion expected early next week to be a vote of confidence 
in his government”.  What he is really doing here is bringing 
out a big hammer.  He is telling all of his backbenchers that 
they will do as they are told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This vote has been declared a whipped vote by the government.  I 
got that from one of the Liberal members. A whipped vote means 
the government will pull every single stop to make sure that 
every single member votes with the government.  I do not believe 
we will see any members on that side vote against.  There will be 
a few who will have the courage to stay out of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members are forced to vote against the wishes of their 
constituents and against their own moral conscience, when they 
are ordered, not told but ordered how to vote, that is called a 
dictatorship.  That is exactly what the Prime Minister is doing 
in this situation.  He is ordering his members what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really ironic and this is just a coincidence, but where is 
the Prime Minister going to be when we vote?  Where is the Prime 
Minister going to be next Tuesday?  He is going to be in Cuba. 
How ironic. The Prime Minister is going to be in Cuba and he is 
dictating to his members on how to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Prime Minister believes in democracy.  He has 
expressed that to us and I believe that he does.  But I think his 
tunnel vision on this issue is so narrow that he does not even 
realize he is dictating to the worst extremes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from some of the Liberal backbenchers how 
frustrated they are with the government.  For the government now 
to pull all the stops out and force this issue is absolutely 
wrong.  It goes against all the principles of democracy, people's 
own moral conscience and the wishes of members' constituents to 
be ordered for political reasons by the Prime Minister. To do 
this is absolutely dead wrong.  They will have to look at 
themselves in the mirror, as will the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get on to the issue of the hepatitis C victims.  I want 
to quote from Justice Krever's recommendations: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now, our treatment of the blood-injured has been 
unequal—.  Compensating some needy sufferers and not others 
cannot, in my opinion, be justified. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how much clearer we can get than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know an arbitrary date has been drawn in the sand.  From 
everything that I have read, there was a test available.  I have 
heard members on the other side argue that the United States did 
not start their testing until 1986.  My question is since when 
especially in our health care system, do we have to follow the 
lead of the United States?  We make decisions on our own.  That 
is absolutely the worst kind of argument and it shows the 
government is grasping at straws. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read parts of a letter.  I will not read the entire 
letter because I do not have time.  A constituent, Mrs. Betty 
Back of Victoria, wrote this letter to me.  In 1997 the Red Cross 
told her that she had hepatitis C.  She writes:  “This came as 
quite a shock because I did not know I had been given a 
transfusion”.  Because of the complications from a hip 
operation, Mrs. Back had to undergo numerous operations between 
1983 and 1997.  She raised the point that she has no idea when 
she was infected.  She has no idea when she was injected with 
poisonous blood, none whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I quote: “I don't know what our government proposes to 
do.  There should be no guidelines as to if a person was infected 
in the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s.  I have hepatitis C and I got 
infected from a blood transfusion.  There is no cure. 
Transfusions were meant to save lives, not kill them, and kill it 
does.  No one but no one should be discriminated against”.  That 
is exactly what this government is doing.  It is cutting her off. 
There will be no evidence to indicate when she got hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her point is exactly what we are debating.  We cannot just draw 
a line in the sand.  We know these tests were available.  The 
evidence is out there.  In my research I have seen different 
dates. All kinds of dates are thrown in here.  My conclusion is 
that in the early eighties, at least 1980 or 1981, without 
question there were tests available and other tests were 
available before that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that all four opposition parties have left the 
partisan politics out of the issue. They are doing what is right, 
members from one corner of this country to the other. I know 
there are members from the other side who would wish to join in 
that as well, but of course they have been dictated to by the 
Prime Minister.  They have been ordered.  I see the smiles.  To 
me that is more serious in itself than the issue we are dealing 
with. Today I spoke to one of the members who explained the level 
of orders they are receiving on this. The Prime Minister is 
concerned.  He is treating this as a confidence vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about confidence votes.  I agree with the Prime 
Minister that this is a confidence vote but not in the same way 
he means it.  I am not suggesting this will bring down the 
government at all.  This is a vote about the confidence of the 
people of Canada.  The Prime Minister has an opportunity to do 
the right thing.  It is never ever too late to right a wrong.  He 
could come into the House today and say “We have made a wrong 
decision here and we are going to correct it”.  I hope he does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Prime Minister is following this debate and listening 
to the arguments.  If he is, I am sure he will have to do that. I 
do not see how anybody could not follow this debate and not come 
in and correct that wrong.  That is the only way he will gain the 
confidence of the people of Canada. This is about confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is losing that confidence.  It is related not 
only to the hepatitis C issue and the government's failure to 
compensate some victims, which would be the right thing to do, 
but also to the issue of democracy. If the Prime Minister 
continues to run a government that dictates instead of allows the 
people on that side of the House to represent their constituents, 
they will be receiving calls all weekend on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to reconsider.  I ask the Prime Minister to 
make the right decision so we can support him on this issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a brief comment.  Forgive 
me if I again try to shed a little elucidation on the issue at 
hand today.  I am sure members of the general public watching 
this debate are not finding the focus on the internecine party 
and partisan issues very helpful or productive to the discussion 
at hand. 
One could wonder whether parties that vote en bloc are being 
disciplined to a vote but others are being coerced into a vote. 
I do not think that is very helpful to the debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What might be worthy of understanding is that all victims are 
still capable of accessing the social safety net that is there 
and is enhanced for everyone. I refer specifically to additional 
health care services that will be provided for all those who are 
victims. Second, there is the Canada pension plan disability 
component that addresses urgent and immediate needs.  Third, 
there is always the procedure which I mentioned earlier on that 
have not been abrogated, that have not been limited, that have 
not been dismissed which is the opportunity of every victim and 
his or her family to proceed either individually or in class 
before the courts for compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of those avenues have been restricted or diminished. It is 
important to keep those things in mind to frame the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health 
again rambles on and babbles on instead of asking a direct or 
pointed question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order.  I know the hon. member means 
well by his point of order, but the fact is that this is a period 
for questions and comments. The hon. parliamentary secretary is 
making a comment and he does not have to ask a question in 
questions and comments. While I appreciate the hon. member's 
point I think in fairness the hon. member is entitled to complete 
his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite prepared to divide the time on the five minutes that 
is allowed for questions and comments but at the beginning of the 
period only one member rose and that was the parliamentary 
secretary. So I am giving him the floor and I will ask him to 
conclude his remarks in due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  As I was saying, Mr. Speaker, it is 
important for all members who want to be productive and 
instructive for all who are watching this debate to give a sense 
of direction and focus as to which aspects of what I have just 
described as the avenues available for all victims they object 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have pointed out that the legal route is always there.  Nobody 
wants to curb those rights. There have been none diminished. 
Second, the social safety net which we have worked hard to 
reinforce, restructure and solidify is there for each and 
everyone and will be enhanced in these cases. Third, one very 
specific component is the disability function of the CPP which 
will address a most urgent and immediate need for those who 
precede that first option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offer we have on the table I might remind all members that 
came after much discussion and debate with all partners is one 
that must in the end be supported by an independent arbitrator, 
i.e. the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members on the other side of the House are objecting to 
people coming forward and in the spirit of co-operation trying to 
resolve the most urgent problem that is directed to the period in 
time when governments could have acted differently and did not, 
then I think they should identify those and say so. They should 
do that rather than engage in what has become the prattle of what 
will happen on procedural motions in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will respond to the points 
brought forth by my friend on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, he said we are being coerced over here.  If you 
believe that, then go back and speak to your Prime Minister and 
we will have— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order.  I urge the hon. member to 
address his remarks to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the first point I make. In another one he has suggested 
that there is money in the system.  What he is really suggesting 
is that we should download this on to the provinces.  Again, this 
government does not want to face up to the responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most appalling thing I find in his remarks is the suggestion 
that these innocent victims who were given poisonous blood 
because of the negligence of this government go through the 
courts to find resolution.  The government is willing to spend 
millions and millions of dollars to defend its position, which I 
find incredible that it is even doing so now, in the courts. Why 
not compensate them?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has already been admitted that they were wrong.  The Prime 
Minister has said, yes, they accept that there was wrongdoing. 
They have admitted that, but they want to go to the courts.  He 
is suggesting that the courts are the proper avenue for these 
people, that the courts should decide what is fair.  They are the 
ones that should be advocating this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that a parliamentary secretary would suggest 
such a solution.  It is absolutely unbelievable to suggest that 
these people should go to court.  It is absolutely shameful. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, with your permission I will be splitting my time with 
the member for Brossard—La Prairie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Minister of Health and the ministers responsible for 
health in every province and territory have been handed one of 
the most difficult decisions anyone in government has ever had to 
make.  It is a task that members of the official opposition 
should be grateful they will never have to make.  The ministers 
had to look into the eyes of people who contracted hepatitis C 
from the blood system before 1986 and say to them “You will not 
be receiving compensation for your suffering and the suffering of 
your families”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision addresses a time when Canada's blood system could 
have reacted differently.  But governments could not have 
protected the people who received blood tainted by hepatitis 
before 1986 any more than they could have protected the very 
small number of people, for example, who are unaware that they 
are allergic to anaesthetic and die on the operating room table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has argued that the Minister of Health made 
this decision because he does not care about human suffering. 
The Reform Party has tried to suggest that the Minister of Health 
lacks sympathy for all the people who suffer from hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same Reform Party that has championed two tier 
medicine.  This is the same party that wants one health care 
system for the wealthy and another health care system for low and 
middle-income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also not forget that this is the same Reform Party whose 
leader has labelled groups representing battered women as 
“special interest groups” and refused to even meet with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the people who are questioning the integrity and the 
compassion of one of the most decent human beings sitting in this 
House of Commons, the Minister of Health.  It is one more cruel 
irony in this tragic course of events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize for the partisan tone of these remarks, but one of 
the things that makes me most uncomfortable about this whole 
debate is the political opportunism of some members of the Reform 
Party on this issue.  While we feel deep sympathy for those who 
were infected before 1986 we must recognize that governments 
cannot compensate for every harm suffered by all individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like other Canadians, I have confidence in Canada's health care 
system.  I trust that doctors, nurses and other practitioners are 
well trained and will do the very best they can with the 
technology of the day.  But when I go into the hospital I go in 
with the knowledge that nothing is 100% guaranteed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1977 I had a Caesarean section and a beautiful baby was 
delivered.  I went into shock, lost a lot of blood and was given 
a choice between taking blood or taking an iron infusion.  I was 
articulate and coherent enough to take an iron infusion, but had 
I been unconscious the doctors would have given me a blood 
transfusion.  I have lived until today to watch that daughter 
grow up.  Medical technology at the time could not possibly tell 
me whether blood was dangerous or not, but I would have been more 
than pleased to take the extra 21 years.  That is the risk we all 
take when we undergo severe and traumatic occurrences in the 
hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of compensation for harm caused through the 
health care system is complex.  It requires a thorough and 
thoughtful debate.  The decisions we make today regarding 
hepatitis C will have serious implications for the future of 
public health care in Canada.  When is the government responsible 
when Canadians become sick?   There should be a clear connection 
between the harm suffered and the inaction of governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Testing for hepatitis C was not done in Canada until seven years 
after a reliable test was available and used in the United 
States.  The compensation package is an acknowledgement of 
responsibility for the government's inaction at that time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments cannot protect Canadians from infections they are 
unable to detect.  Therefore, governments cannot accept financial 
responsibility when people become sick from these unknown, 
insidious diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can government do for innocent victims?  Government can 
provide the best possible health care to Canadians.  It can put 
more money into medical research in order to help victims but 
also to prevent a tragedy like this one from occurring again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I applauded the finance minister when he increased 
funding for the Medical Research Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to encourage the federal and 
provincial health ministers to move forward on pharmacare 
initiatives so that those who suffer from hepatitis C and other 
diseases will not have to worry about the cost of drugs that will 
help them manage their illnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier in my remarks, I hope that the Reform Party, 
which is sponsoring this motion, will follow through on what it 
has started.  I hope it will now recognize that Canadians 
sometimes become ill through no fault of their own.  When that 
happens they require the best possible health care regardless of 
their ability to pay.  I hope the Reform Party will join me in 
encouraging the government to ensure all Canadians have access to 
affordable prescription drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, many members of the official opposition have 
referred to their experiences in talking directly with Canadians 
infected with hepatitis C and with their families.  I have also 
spoken with the victims of this tragedy.  Some of the people I 
have spoken with will not be compensated because they were 
infected before 1986 and after 1990.  I feel deep sympathy for 
them as individuals.  When I talk with the parents of those 
children who are sick I cannot help but think of my own children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as a legislator and as a government member I know that 
we have to make a decision that is fair and that is in the best 
interest of all Canadians.  The decision that was taken by health 
ministers of all governments, representing four different 
political parties, is right and it is appropriate.  It 
acknowledges a time when something could have been done to reduce 
the number of infections and was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who will not be compensated, we owe to them what we 
owe to all Canadians:  universal and accessible health care and a 
commitment to continually strive for more new and better ways to 
deliver health care more effectively and more efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether this be a free vote, a whipped vote or whatever it is, 
my conscience is clear.  I look forward to the vote on Tuesday. 
I will have no difficulty supporting this health minister's 
decision and the decisions of the health ministers across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This health minister has more integrity and soul in him than all 
the members of the opposition.  I have no difficulty supporting 
his decision. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member 
has said that the impetus for our motion is a partisan one.  It 
is not very often in this House of Commons that we get unanimity 
from the opposition benches.  Therefore, I would like to pose a 
question to her.  Since she says that my motives are partisan, 
what does she have to say about the other opposition members on 
this side of the House who unanimously have asked for a free vote 
on this issue; not a confidence vote, but a vote from the heart 
instead of a vote from partisanship?  What does she have to say 
to that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
answer that question.  All through history we have seen parties 
when they are in opposition and when they are in government. When 
in government the party has to make tough decisions based on the 
best interests of the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the party is in opposition it is very easy to criticize. 
It is very easy to wave a flag and support supposedly downtrodden 
people.  However, when in government the party has a sincere 
responsibility to make the right decisions based on all the 
information, based on what can be delivered and based on what is 
right for the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be in opposition is, in fact, a joyous location when a 
controversial subject comes up because that party does not have

the wonderful birth of her child last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government of the day is not willing to compensate those 
40,000 who will not be receiving compensation for hepatitis C, is 
she also recommending that they also try the CPP route?  Is that 
what she is recommending along with the parliamentary secretary? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to get 
too personal here, but I am 51 years old.  If I had a baby last 
year that would truly be a medical feat.  Just to clarify, I am 
not super woman.  I had that baby 21 years ago and she is a 
delightful child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My belief in the medical system in this country and the system 
of proper medical care would indicate that we have a first-class 
medicare system in Canada.  For those who have not been 
compensated, my sincere hope would be that all provincial 
governments and the federal government would put as much money as 
possible into research on treatments, as was demonstrated in the 
last budget.  We must continue to make the medicare system 
accessible to all, despite their economic status.  We must also 
be extra sensitive to those who are suffering from hepatitis C to 
make sure that the best drugs are available to them.  We should 
be in constant contact with the pharmaceutical companies and 
encourage them to do the best they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the system in this country is there.  With a 
little bit of extra prodding we can make sure there is no one out 
there suffering because of lack of funds or lack of access to 
medical care.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just 
want to remind the member that responsibility for the safety of 
the Canadian blood supply system rests totally and absolutely at 
the door of our national Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that, on questions and answers in this House over the last 
few months the minister has repeatedly stated that he did not 
want to see a lengthy, expensive, protracted legal case for these 
innocent victims.  He said that he wanted to see a package that 
was compassionate and fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member square that with what the party wants to do? 
On Tuesday the Prime Minister was cracking the whip, holding the 
big stick over them, forcing them to support something which they 
know in their hearts they cannot.  Have the Liberals not 
swallowed themselves whole on this issue of compensation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very 
interesting juxtaposition of ideas.  I have to straighten out in 
my mind what he wants me to respond to.  I think what he wants me 
to respond to is the concept of the whipped vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Minister of Health has come up with government policy.  It 
is not an unusual step for the government to vote on government 
policy in a whipped fashion.  There is great exaggeration out 
there in the minds of Reform Party members about the disaffected 
Liberals in the backbenches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the Ontario caucus, which has 101 members.  We all 
pretty well have faith in the decision.  I am sure we will all 
come in on Tuesday and vote with the government because it is the 
right thing to do, not because we are whipped.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard—La Prairie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
the federal, provincial and territorial health ministers 
announced the formula they had decided upon to provide 
assistance to hepatitis C victims, they did not do so lightly. 
Much thought had been put into it. They looked at the moral, 
systemic and human implications, but only after careful 
consideration did they reach a decision. There were indeed many 
aspects to take into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that, unfortunately, today still too little is 
known about hepatitis C. 
Even if the scientific community is doing its best to keep 
expanding the knowledge base, we are still at a stage where we 
cannot even predict with any certainty how an infected person 
may react.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that hepatitis C is very different from HIV, although 
both can be transmitted through the blood. People with hepatitis 
C are not sentenced to die, and many continue to lead a 
completely normal, functional life without feeling any 
debilitating effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we are now able to identify the virus much better than 
before and the accuracy of screening tests is improving by the 
day, which makes the blood supply system increasingly safe. But 
we are always seeking to know more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have looked to other countries to see if we could learn 
anything from them. 
We have looked at what they have done to resolve hepatitis C 
problems caused by their own blood supply system. We did not 
learn much in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have found that, while most countries had made similar 
decisions under similar circumstances with the tragic results 
that we know, most did not take the same approach we took. We in 
Canada have taken action to prevent any harm to our fellow 
citizens that we could prevent, and we did so cautiously in 
consideration of all that was involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was recently compared to other countries for its approach 
to resolving the hepatitis C crisis. I can think of Ireland in 
particular. In recent years, Ireland introduced its own 
assistance plan for hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada officials travelled to Ireland to see how the 
Irish proceeded, and to understand why and how that formula was 
adopted. They found that the Irish formula was tailored to 
Ireland's very specific circumstances, and that it would not 
suit Canada's circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hepatitis C tribunal was set up in Ireland after some 1,500 
young mothers contracted the disease, in the seventies, when 
they were given a blood product called anti-D, which had been 
exposed to hepatitis C, although at the time hepatitis C was 
still unnamed and was called non-A and non-B hepatitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anti-D product was used as a preventive treatment for new 
mothers and thus caused harm, even though it had been used 
without serious problems for quite a while. Most of the cases 
can be traced back to a unique plasma donor, making it clear 
that the blood in question should never have been used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people infected with the anti-D product continued to give 
blood, since they had no reason to change their habits. This led 
to even more people being exposed through the blood supply 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, another blood supply system from another country also 
experienced problems of its own. The formula used by Ireland 
regarding its blood supply problems is quite specific, so much 
so in fact that no other country has used it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking back at what we did based on what we now knowwe reviewed 
the blood system that Canada had in the eighties. We concluded 
that various measures could have been taken to avoid hepatitis C 
cases. We looked at what was done in the United States, even 
though most of the other countries were in a situation similar 
to ours. 
If we could turn back the clock, I do not think anyone would 
adopt the risk management method Ireland did in connection with 
its blood system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ireland was far slower to adopt international scientific risk 
management methods in connection with its blood system. 
Moreover, many western countries, including Canada, adopted that 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Ireland never inaugurated the indirect screening test, 
that country's blood inquiry tribunal never faulted it for not 
doing so. Had Canada followed the Irish risk management method, 
it would have inaugurated the specific Hepatitis B screening 
test a year and a half later than it did. There would have been 
even more cases of infection.  This is precisely what happened 
in Ireland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Care must, therefore, be taken when seeking examples to follow. 
The two types of government activity, the concern for health and 
safety as opposed to the compensation of people let down by the 
health system call for two very different types of comparison. 
The scientific community constantly distributes information on 
the international level.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have followed the US example in 1986, but we did not, 
nor did most other countries.  Normally, issues such as public 
health, and more specifically the monitoring of diseases and 
safety, are addressed from a totally different perspective, for 
instance, than health care, which is generally based on a 
national vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore far more common for a national government to 
follow international scientific models than any other type of 
policy or initiative from some specific society, which reflects 
that society's specific history and way of looking at things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We quickly understood that the situation had to be addressed 
within the Canadian context and that we could not simply apply 
policies from elsewhere and expect them to work here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we copy the policies and methods of another country, 
especially when we have no guarantee they would be really 
effective here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said that social programs are not easily exported. 
Canadians continue to say they do not want a health care system 
like that of the United States, and President Clinton learned a 
few years ago himself that Congress had reservations about a 
single-payer universal health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because there are limits to the types of comparisons 
that can be made between Ireland and Canada, their system of 
health care and their way of dealing with the damages caused by 
the blood system. 
Sometimes it is useful to make international comparisons, but 
more often than not, it is not appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canadian ministers of health announced that they wanted 
to settle claims for compensation by victims of hepatitis C, I 
pointed out that it would be a reasoned approach. This approach 
led us to concentrate on the period between 1986 and 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that, in all fairness, we must not make a distinction 
between the harm done by the blood system and other types of 
harm caused by the Canadian health care system as a whole, a 
problem of this magnitude warrants thorough debate and, to be 
quite honest, I do not think such a debate has been held yet.

hope he did not say what I think he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He just told me that a person who has contracted hepatitis C can 
live a normal life.  The riding of Brossard-La Prairie is not far 
from my riding on the south shore.  A former manager in my 
riding, a man who is 6'1” and weighs 200 pounds, now spends his 
days in bed because of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the member is interested in coming to my 
riding next week and meeting this man, so that he might learn 
something and not give us this sort of nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Mr. Speaker, what is unfortunate in this kind 
of debate is when it slips into sensationalism that has nothing 
to do with the fundamental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not say that nobody suffered with hepatitis C, or that 
there were no after-effects.  What I said just now was that a 
substantial number of those with hepatitis C did not suffer from 
after-effects that would prevent them from living a normal life. 
I would like my remarks to be interpreted accurately, instead of 
being used so obviously to make political hay.

hard facts.  Let us look at reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case is prevalent all across Canada.  It does not miss 
anybody's constituency.  I wonder how the hon. member would 
respond to a cold, hard situation.  Here we have two people in 
the same town both given blood transfusions in the same year. One 
person contracted hepatitis C and the other has HIV.  One will be 
compensated and the other will not.  All through the same blood. 
All through the same causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can members opposite possibly say to the people of Canada 
that this one is this way and that one is that way?  This is a 
problem for the people over there.  They are not dealing with 
realities. 
They come in here with a canned speech and read it off.  They 
stay to the party line.  They are not thinking with their hearts. 
Their hearts do not tell them to snub this person living on this 
side of the street and that another person will get compensation. 
They do not have an answer to that question.  I have been 
listening to them for four days on this issue and they have not 
answered that question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B>  I would like to have a chance to 
answer.  One has to do with the responsibility of the government 
with regard to what could have been done and was not done.  One 
has to do with a much broader issue, the no fault issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first part, time and again not only the Minister of 
Health but many of my colleagues have explained the reasons the 
ministers of health throughout the country agreed to limit the 
period from 1986 to 1990.  However, in terms of no fault, I refer 
my colleague to the Krever report on page 1044. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read it because I think it is being interpreted in a very 
dubious way.  The Krever report is simply saying, as it states on 
page 1044: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend the creation of a no-fault scheme for blood-related 
injury. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then a bit further on it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and territories of Canada (not the federal 
government) should devise statutory no-fault schemes that 
compensate all blood-injured persons promptly and adequately— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate we are having here concerns a no fault philosophy 
that ought to be debated first and foremost, if we follow Krever, 
at the provincial and territorial levels. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a sad day that we have this debate in the House today 
because of the decision of the Minister of Health and the fact 
that he has created two tiers of victims in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to perhaps turn the page to 1045 in 
the Krever report and read this statement: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now, our treatment of the blood-injured has been 
unequal—.  Compensating some needy sufferers and not others 
cannot, in my opinion, be justified. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how the members of the government can stand in their 
places today and argue the fact that there should be two tiers of 
victims:  those who are compensated and those who are not.  It is 
shameful.  I know there are several hepatitis C victims watching 
this debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just do a quick summary of what we have heard so far 
today.  We have heard from members on the government side canned 
speeches from the minister's department and misdirection.  They 
will not deal with the fundamental issue or question of the 
motion being put that there should be compensation for all 
victims of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a non-partisan issue.  All members of the opposition 
parties—colleagues in the Conservative Party, the Bloc Party, 
the NDP and the Reform Party—are in unison when they say to the 
government that it is wrong.  Canadians know.  The government 
knows it is wrong on this issue.  In fact there is nothing wrong 
with being wrong if one does something about it. 
If a person admits a mistake and moves on people have honour and 
respect for that.  If a person stonewalls and says there is no 
problem, deflects and will not stand in league, the people of 
this country have no respect for that.

disappointed at the position the government is taking.  I was a 
member of that party for a good number of years.  It seems to me 
that one of the hallmarks of Liberalism, one of the things that 
has permitted the Liberal Party to remain in office for so long 
over such an extended period of time is that for so many years it 
was a party that cared for the disadvantaged in Canada. 
It was a party that went to bat for innocent victims.  It was a 
party that believed in fairness, equity and compassion.

and Liberal members opposite that rank and file Liberal members 
right across the country are phoning and telling me that they are 
ashamed of being Liberals given the position of the government 
with respect to this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mere fact that this government would force innocent victims, 
some of whom will be gravely ill and others dying, into court in 
order to receive compensation and some compassion is shameful.  I 
hope the Prime Minister will look into his heart and ask himself 
how he would react if a member of his family were an innocent 
victim of the tainted blood system in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ireland government has shown the way to compensate innocent 
victims.  It has provided generous compensation for all victims 
of hepatitis C. How could a small country like Ireland have such 
a huge heart when a prosperous and large country like Canada can 
be so heartless when it comes to compensating innocent victims? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague

would be my hope, as I know it is the member's, that Canadians

showing compassion and heart and showing that it cares for all 
the victims of this tragedy.

marks the 70th anniversary of the beginning of one of the most 
revolutionary legal battles ever to be undertaken. On this day in 
1928 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that women were not 
persons under the British North America Act.  As you can imagine 
women across the empire were disturbed by this decision and as 
such they took their fight to the British Privy Council. Today we 
proudly celebrate the final decision made by that body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the efforts of individuals such as Senator Emily 
Murphy, women across the commonwealth were granted the status of 
persons.  As a result, in Canada today men and women enjoy equal 
societal privileges, protection and status under the law. Despite 
that, there are still many places in the world that women are 
treated as second class citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we must continue to work to secure positive, civil 
and legal development in nations that have not yet been liberated 
by the effects of enhanced personal freedom and true gender 
equality.  Indeed it is our duty to lead by example.  Canada is 
and has always been a world leader in these areas.  I am proud to 
support—

medical research to levels comparable with other industrialized 
countries and restore its $3.5 billion cut to the health care

<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
some issues are just too big for partisan politics.  Moral 
questions are bigger than any party.  They are bigger than any 
prime minister.  Questions like abortion, capital punishment or 
euthanasia.  The question of abandoning hepatitis C victims falls 
into this exact same category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask a question of the government, not as one MP to 
another but as one human being to another.  Let me ask the 
Minister of Health why the government will not let its MPs vote 
according to their conscience on this motion of compensation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is very simple.  The Reform Party is asking members 
of the House to vote non-confidence in the policies of the 
government and non-confidence in the policies of the 10 
provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government and the 10 provinces have joined together 
in a decision on policy and the Reform Party is asking the people 
of the House of Commons to vote against that decision. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is simply nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member for Cambridge has said that he would vote 
with the victims on this matter, not against the government, and 
he is absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give the Prime Minister and all of his MPs my personal pledge 
that the official opposition will not treat this as a confidence 
motion.  In fact the opposite is true.  We will congratulate the 
government and say that it is doing what is right, that is the 
issue of compensating victims.  That is what we care about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask if the official opposition is not treating this as a 
confidence motion why should the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, why is it that in almost every vote in the House on 
government measures, and with one or two exceptions on private 
members' measures, the Reform Party has voted as a single group? 
Let us have some explanations on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not simply a matter of what the hon. lady says at this 
time.  It is a matter of what a vote amounts to in a fundamental 
way.  She is asking and her party is asking members of the House 
to vote against not only the federal government but all the 
provincial governments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is not our view on this.  The government House Leader, in the 
1993 red book, included these words: “Parties in this House must 
have ample opportunity to place before parliament their 
alternatives for free and open debate and decision without 
artificial applications of non-confidence doctrine”.  He went on 
to say that opposition motions should not be treated as 
confidence motions unless they were explicitly advised of such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I want to ask the government to do the right thing and 
answer this question.  If the official opposition is not treating 
this as a confidence motion why should the government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, can we turn things around and if members of the 
opposition say a measure is a confidence measure we could totally 
ignore the way they are speaking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they are saying does not make sense.  In so far as putting 
measures before the House for free and open debate, that is 
exactly what is happening today.  That is what is happening on 
every measure.  Let us have the debate.  Let us have the vote. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, which 
Liberal said this: “When there are resolutions, as there are 
today involving victims rights, members of this party vote as 
they see fit?”   That was the current health minister in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was talking about exactly the same type of motion in the 
House, an opposition motion.  Just what caused him to change his 
tune? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member knows that debate was about something completely 
different. It was about the criminal justice system and the 
rights of victims before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all that these hon. members have said today and in the past 
about this issue there is one question with which they refuse to 
come to grips because it is the most difficult question of all, 
namely, can we sustain public health care in the country if we 
make cash payments to all of those who are harmed, regardless of 
fault, through risks inherent in the health system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They will not come to grips with that question but Canada's 12

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Deputy 
Prime Minister, the House leader and the health minister all know 
that this is not a confidence vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a vote about whether or not every victim of hepatitis C 
from tainted blood should receive fair and just compensation.  I 
can hardly believe that they will hang their whole process on a 
vote of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody, not a single party in the House, will treat this as a 
confidence motion.  I have given the government my personal 
guarantee of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then shall the government cause this to be a confidence 
motion? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Windsor West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. minister has just made a real revelation.  The uniting of 
all the parties, not just of the right but of the NDP, has 
suddenly taken place.  This is something the press should grasp. 
It is a big revelation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day we are being asked to vote against the 
position of the government, a considered position taken as a 
matter of discussion and agreement with all 10 provincial 
governments.  The hon. member is asking us to vote against 
Premier Klein of Alberta, against Premier Harris of Ontario, 
against Premier Filmon of Manitoba and against all other 
provincial premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  When members ask questions courtesy would

you to do so.

Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, we learned that the government would be favourable 
to a tax deal for subsidizing professional sports teams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the heritage minister find it normal, when millions of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr.

however, have some respect for a House subcommittee on which all

one member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
too have great respect for the committee, but certain statements 
have been made by certain people on the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, we welcomed olympic athletes here who managed to win 
medals, in spite of meager government funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister of Canadian Heritage justify her 
government's thinking of subsidizing professional athletes, who 
earn millions yearly, when it provides amateur athletes who 
bring back medals a mere $5,700 annually, on average? 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Quebecois has become.

rather important issue.  We know the entire community in Quebec 
City was upset to lose the <I>Nordiques</I>.

that a House committee, comprised of government and opposition

question is also for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. ambassador to Canada recently said that, if we wanted 
to keep professional sports teams from leaving the country, all 
we had to do was follow their example and provide teams with all 
sorts of funding to keep them home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister admit that the real problem is that this 
American funding of professional sports constitutes unfair 
competition and that the real solution would be to lodge a 
complaint under NAFTA against such competition?

issues.  One thing I know is that the member herself has had an 
opportunity to speak with the former president of the Nordiques 
about possible solutions a little while ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that everyone will work together to find an answer to

the minister does not understand is that there is in fact a

television, before we have finished our work.

their players millions of dollars and that, to top it all, 
refuse to open their books?

today is an exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that we must now give the committee a chance to do its 
work.  We are awaiting the report, which will come out in 
October, and when we have a good report, we will look at the 
results in order to decide to what extent we can work together 
to save hockey teams, because hockey is a sport that was created

Canadians have come to see the health minister as Dr. No:  no to

the hon. member, like others in the House, refuses to come to

should the governments of Canada pay cash compensation to people 
who are harmed inadvertently, without fault, through risk 
inherent in the medical system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her party colleagues in British Columbia and in Saskatchewan did 
come to grips with that question.  Those ministers of health were 
at the table with me, with all ministers across the country.  We 
considered that question.  We concluded that we should pay to 
compensate those who were harmed when it was avoidable, and that 
is what we are doing.  22,000 Canadians were harmed. It was 
avoidable.  They would—

what threats were levied against government members who were 
ready to compensate all hep C victims.  The democracy policy 
should not be driven by threats.  It takes leadership and 
compassion but sadly that leadership and compassion are not 
evident on the government front benches these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Prime Minister not remove the muzzle on his own

</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be easy to write a cheque to everybody who has a claim 
because we all feel personal compassion for people harmed through

running a government, the issue of trying to save medicare in 
this country is how many receive cash payments because they were 
harmed without fault by government.  That is the tough question.

premiums from $2.90 to $2.70.  In the budget 400,000 Canadians no 
longer have to pay tax of any kind and 83% of Canadians saw the 
3% surtax eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for his question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is nonsense and the minister knows it.  According to CIBC 
Wood Gundy economist Jeff Rubin says: “Canadians' tax bills will 
be some $6 billion higher as a result of the cumulative impact of 
the last five Liberal budgets”.  He said that in the wake of the 
last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows taxes are up.  We know taxes are up.  Jeff 
Rubin knows it and Canadians know it.  When is the minister going 
to acknowledge that Canadians have the highest tax burden in the 
G-7 and he has done zip about it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the most substantial tax reduction in the course of the last 
decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the hon. member is right about one thing, government 
revenues are up.  Our revenues are up because over the course of 
the last four years one million Canadians have gone back to work. 
Not only that, but in the last year 453,000 Canadians went back 
to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the truth be told, Canada is now creating more jobs on a

fact, they are lower than in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that we want to bring personal income taxes down and 
we did so in the last budget; 83% of Canadians saw the 3% surtax

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Health has said he is prepared to let class actions determine 
the government's policy on hepatitis C.  This is very worrisome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have already seen the minister's prowess in other 
legal matters.  The Airbus affair and Pearson airport are two 
examples that come to mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Liberal government going to abdicate its responsibilities 
and those of all parliamentarians in favour of a court decision 
or will it allow Parliament to determine policy as it should?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
governments of Canada, including Conservative governments, 
decided to compensate the individuals infected during the period 
between 1986 and 1990, when governments and officials could have 
acted but did not.  It was not the courts, but rather the 
governments that decided and accepted responsibility for the 
1986 to 1990 period.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>INTERPARLIAMENTARY ASSOCIATIONS—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  On Tuesday, April 21 the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley raised a question of privilege concerning the 
government press release announcing the establishment of a 
Canada-China interparliamentary group. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Fraser Valley contended that, in issuing 
this press release, the Minister for International Trade gave 
the impression that this group would be sanctioned and funded by 
Parliament.  He argued that this was a clear contempt of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After hearing submissions from several members, I took the 
matter under advisement.  I am now ready to proceed with a 
ruling on this question of privilege. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of Canadian interparliamentary groups is governed 
by certain administrative bodies within the House of Commons and 
the Senate.  It is not an executive matter to be decided by 
cabinet. Although the government may from time to time make 
recommendations in this regard in the context of Canada's foreign 
policy, these matters do not fall directly within the purview of 
any government department or agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interparliamentary relations are carried on under the 
responsibility of parliament.  There are in place certain 
decision making processes governing their administration.  As I 
mentioned on Tuesday, there are ongoing meetings this week and 
next week concerning these very matters. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1505"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Speaker of the House of Commons who has the 
responsibility to represent the House in its dealings with 
foreign legislatures. For this reason, I feel it is my duty to 
comment on the actions taken by the Minister for International 
Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their submissions many hon. members made reference to the 
fact that actions such as these appear to undercut the authority 
of parliament.  As parliamentarians we should all be aware of the 
differences between the authority of cabinet and that of 
parliament.  In matters of foreign relations, cabinet may enter 
into agreements with other governments while parliament pursues 
relations with other legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament's decisions are taken in light of Canada's foreign 
policy and the interests of all Canadians, but cabinet does not 
dictate the nature or scope of the interparliamentary relations 
of the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In announcing the establishment of a Canada-China 
interparliamentary group and thereby prejudging a decision which 
has yet to be taken, the minister clearly overreached his 
authority. I am somewhat disappointed that a minister of the 
crown in acting with such haste may have prejudiced the very 
outcome that he wished to bring about.  Such disregard for the 
administrative competence of parliament does nothing to enhance 
its prestige on the international stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have expressed their frustration over other 
announcements by the government which appear to bypass the 
authority of the House.  As I have been reminded, this may have 
taken place on more than one occasion during this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is reason for legitimate concern since it appears that a 
pattern is developing in spite of cautions which have been made 
from the chair.  My duty however is to confine myself to the 
jurisprudence which exists and governs the operation of 
privilege. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the preoccupation over these matters, I would suggest that 
this particular issue must be handled through a different 
avenue, namely the Board of Internal Economy, which holds 
statutory responsibility for such matters.  I noted during the 
discussion on April 21, 1998, five of the hon. members who 
intervened were members of the Board of Internal Economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the board has been seized of this matter and pronounced 
itself on it, I wish to advise this House that there is no 
officially recognized parliamentary association with China. 
Consequently there can be no interim chairman either from the 
House or from the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret having to make this statement so publicly.  I trust 
that our Chinese friends will understand that this situation is 
strictly an internal Canadian matter relating to the basic tenets 
of our primary law. Indeed I trust that our Chinese friends will 
have a better understanding of our parliamentary democracy as we 
pursue this dialogue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  Have you referred the issue to the 
Board of Internal Economy?  Do we table a motion in this House at 
this point in time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  This motion has been referred to the Board 
of Internal economy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  I have only been here for four years. 
I have never seen this done.  I was ready to make the appropriate 
motion which I thought was necessary if the minister had been out 
of turn, to refer this matter to the procedure and House affairs 
committee. If it is being referred to the Board of Internal 
Economy, that is your decision.  My question is, is that a 
debatable motion or is it just a decision that you have made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is not a debatable motion.  I decided 
that it was not a point of privilege for the reasons I gave. I am 
sure if the member reads over my decision he will see the reasons 
therein. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  The Board of Internal 
Economy while having jurisdiction and authority grounded in law 
is not a body that is open to the public.  It is not a body that 
is open to members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem to me that a matter that is rightfully before the 
House can be referred anywhere and you would require an order of 
the House for that to happen.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, in your decision you have found a prima facie case 
of breach of privilege.  The only thing you could do in my 
respectful submission is to allow the hon. member to put the 
appropriate motion and the matter should go based on 
jurisprudence to the appropriate committee of parliament which is 
open to the public and which is open to members of parliament to 
call witnesses.  That is the appropriate way.  It is not the 
appropriate way to simply sweep this matter under the carpet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, I thought that it was reasonably 
clear.  I have ruled that it is not a prima facie case of 
contempt.  I believe that this falls under the Parliament of 
Canada Act, under the purview of the Board of Internal Economy. 
That is the ruling I have made at this point. This point should 
sit where it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Again, I have never seen this done.  Could you quote for 
me what section of Beauchesne's or whatever you used to base that 
ruling on?  As far as I know this has never been done before.  If 
something is wrong, we have always referred it to that committee. 
I have never seen this done before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is there could be an argument that not all members 
are represented at the Board of Internal Economy.  For example 
independent members are not.  Since it was seized by the House, I 
am not sure how the board can deal with that.  I am interested to 
know how that is done or under what rules it is done.  I have 
never seen it done before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, as a general rule the Speaker 
does not give legal explanations for his decisions.  I would be 
happy to pursue the discussion of the Parliament of Canada Act 
and this particular matter in private. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did rule that there was not a prima facie case of contempt in 
this particular case.  I would like to let the matter rest at 
this point and go on to the Thursday question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a point of privilege from the member for York 
South—Weston. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with the greatest of 
respect, you made a decision.  The conclusion is not consistent 
with the remarks in your decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You found that the minister was out of line.  He issued a press 
release.  It was inappropriate.  You apologized.  You commented 
to our Chinese friends that this is purely an internal matter. 
Then you went on to say that it was not a breach of privilege. 
It is inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point of privilege is that independent members are not 
represented on, nor are they permitted to attend meetings of the 
Board of Internal Economy.  One of the complaints the public has 
had is that often the political parties sweep things under the 
carpet to be dealt with in the backrooms of this parliament— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member does not have a point of 
privilege. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to establishing parliamentary associations, I am 
the whip for the NDP.  We were in a meeting last night with one 
of the deputy speakers and the clerks. We were told at that time 
on an issue unrelated to this one that if a new parliamentary 
association is to be formed, it has to come from the members of 
the House to the interparliamentary committee, the committee 
which I am a member of, requesting funding therefor. 
If we did not have the funds we would then forward it to the 
Board of Internal Economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to my independent colleague, he does make a point 
which I think is important, and that is that if it is sent to an 
interparliamentary committee or to the Standing Committee on 
Procedures and House Affairs there is an opportunity for 
consideration of all circumstances around the particular 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying we should do one thing or another, but I was 
informed yesterday the procedure was that it should go before the 
interparliamentary committee first and before the Board of 
Internal Economy second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
again because this is new to all of us I am wondering, in the 
interest of having all members in the House represented at such a 
meeting, is it possible for that one meeting to have the 
independent member present, or is it possible to exchange a 
position such as mine with having him there present? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As a general rule I as Speaker of the House 
represent the independent members on the Board of Internal 
Economy.  If the Board of Internal Economy as a body wishes to 
entertain any other witnesses, it can do so.

vote on Tuesday night on the hepatitis C issue and I just want 
some clarification, Mr. Speaker.  I hope you will give me a bit 
of time here.  I think this clarification would probably best 
come outside question period and outside normal debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want some clarification in terms of what the Prime Minister 
meant yesterday when he said that it would be a confidence vote. 
I am in favour of a free vote and I do not want people to imply 
that I was not.  I feel that this vote has to come from the heart 
and it has to come from the independent judgment of members of 
parliament.

confidence vote on Tuesday night?

provided for a Liberal member would be used by him, I would trust 
that the word given is accepted as being reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They are dying through no fault of their own and yet the

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians put their trust in our national health care system and 
they through its mismanagement are paying the ultimate price.  I 
am referring to the 20,000 to 25,000 individuals who were 
infected with the hepatitis C virus through the Canadian blood 
system prior to 1986 and today are either sick or dying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government has chosen to compensate more than 28,000 
who were infected after 1986, it has chosen to ignore the rest. 
It saddens me greatly that I must participate in a debate of this 
nature, a debate which could have been avoided had the government 
respected the rights of its own citizens.  This is justice denied 
for a group that is rapidly running out of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the health minister and the Prime Minister are decent men 
and are fundamentally good people.  However, on this issue I fear 
they are allowing their legal background to cloud their sense of 
compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask them to reconsider their position and to afford some 
dignity to the thousands whose lives have been shattered.  I ask 
all members of the House to cast their partisanship aside and 
vote to compensate all persons who contracted hepatitis C from 
blood products.  We must act now because compensation and justice 
delayed are compensation and justice denied.  This is especially 
true for thousands who will develop the more acute symptoms 
associated with chronic hepatitis C infection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some notes but I will not read them.  I will speak based 
on what I feel.  I sat here this morning listening to the 
government side.  I listened to the parliamentary secretary who 
talked most of his time about what the blood system of the future 
will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about people who were infected in the past.  Not 
only that, I have a note from Larry Maheu who asks “What about 
victims after 1990 when the blood was supposed to be safe?” He 
was told by his doctor in Sunnybrook Hospital that the blood 
screening was not seriously done until 1993.  What kind of 
situation did we have prior to 1986?  What kind of a situation 
did we have from 1990 to 1993?  What are we talking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then another member talked about how hepatitis C was not serious 
when compared to HIV.  Excuse me, the member should ask the 
people with hepatitis C.  They are sick, and he has the gall to 
say that is not a serious matter, that it is a matter of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the parliamentary secretary says that these people have the 
right to go court.  What is this nonsense?  Of course they have a 
right to go to court if they make the wrong decision.  Is that 
the right decision?  No.  Government members are making people 
who are suffering go to court and suffer again.  They are saying 
that there is compensation for some people and not for others. 
What nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed to see government members skirting the issue.  Time 
after time as I sit in the House I am getting more and more 
depressed.  We now have one Liberal member giving his time to an 
independent member.  I am glad he did that, but we can see that 
he is running away from the issue because he cannot defend 
himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the Prime Minister changing the whole issue and 
saying that this is a confidence vote for the government, so that 
he can make his members vote not according to their conscience 
but according to the threat that they will go into an election.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Macleod said to Liberal members, all we are 
asking for is that they look into the eyes of those who are 
suffering and make a conscientious decision.  We are telling them 
that this is not a confidence vote on the government.  We are 
only asking them to make a morally right decision.  That is all 
we are asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is justifying itself by saying it made this 
decision with 12 other ministers.  Well, yahoo.  As far as I 
know, before I was a member of parliament, this government did 
not listen to the provincial ministers.  Now it is justifying 
this by saying that the provincial ministers have agreed so it 
must agree.  That is not what Canadians expect from a federal 
government.  Canadians expect the government to stand up for them 
and not hide behind what the provinces say.  It is the 
government's responsibility because this is a federally regulated 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us assume for a moment that the Minister of Health's claim 
that nothing could have been done prior to 1986 is correct, 
although I know it is not.  If this were the case then the 
government would not be responsible for the infection of 
Canadians prior to 1986 and, by the government's reasoning, there 
would be no need for compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the principle that if the government was not at fault 
then it would not have to pay.  Then why does the government 
spend tens of millions of dollars to compensate those affected by 
floods and ice storms?  The government is not responsible for the 
weather, yet the government chooses to compensate those adversely 
affected by it.  Maybe there are some politics behind this.  Maybe 
there are more votes to be bought from those people than there 
are from the poor victims of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps a more compelling example is the fact that this 
government has chosen to compensate all tainted blood victims 
from 1986 on.  The government's premise that it is not 
responsible for hepatitis C infection is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An essential aspect of leadership is to acknowledge when you 
have made a wrong decision.  This is the time to acknowledge it. 
Premier Klein did it.  Premier Harris did it.  This government 
can do it too.  It is a matter of compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can this government not look beyond the legal arguments and 
do the honourable thing?  Do not listen to the lawyers, listen to 
the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health is prepared to spend millions of taxpayer 
dollars to battle victims in court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims that the health care system will collapse, 
that this will be a burden on the health care system.  Really?  If 
a small mistake is such a threat to the health care system then 
there is something seriously wrong with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to government members, including backbenchers.  This is 
not a vote of confidence against the government, it is a vote 
that requires us to take a moral stand on a tragic issue.  Let us 
look the victims in their eyes and tell them that they have our 
support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I presume from the final remarks of the member that 
members opposite consider this to be a free vote issue.  I would 
hope that if arguments are presented to them which are cogent 
they would consider voting with the government when it comes to 
the test before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw the hon. member's attention to an analogy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986 there is no doubt that the Red Cross should have done 
something about the blood products because screening procedures 
were available and the whole issue about liability revolves on 
the fact that action was not taken at a time when it could have 
been taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would point out to members opposite that there is a 
clear analogy between having this medical technology available in 
1986 and not using it and not having it available to the victims 
of hepatitis C before 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the hon. member's attention to parallels like the Salk 
vaccine.  Would he propose that those who had polio or who 
suffered from the consequences of polio should have been 
compensated by the government when the Salk vaccine was 
introduced?  Is he suggesting that all those who were suffering 
from the disease before the arrival of the vaccine should have 
been compensated, even though the vaccine was not available at 
the time they contracted the disease? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is exactly the same with insulin.  Diabetes was a great 
killer and a great maimer of people several decades ago.  Insulin 
was discovered by Sir Frederick Banting.  It became available. 
Do we assume that the government is therefore liable to all those 
people who suffered from the disease before the vaccine was 
available or before the medical technology was available to 
address that disease? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Penicillin is a great example.  Penicillin was known and 
available but was not widely used by the medical profession when 
it could have been the answer to all kinds of diseases of the 
day.  Does it mean because penicillin had been invented but was 
not widely available in all medical communities that everyone was 
liable because of something that was not yet in common use? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope they listen very carefully because we are coming to 
exactly the same situation now with antibiotics.  The efficiency 
of antibiotics is deteriorating rapidly.  Are we going to hold 
governments responsible if a specific antibiotic is prescribed 
for tuberculosis but no longer works?  Are we going to hold the 
government liable for a failure of medical technology? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can only be liable when it can affect the 
outcome, when it can make the wrong decision that creates the 
liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as our heart goes out to those suffering who contracted 
hepatitis C before 1986, the reality is that the government could 
not have done anything about it at the time and, therefore, the 
government cannot be held accountable for it, in the same way 
that the government cannot be held accountable for all the polio 
victims and all the people suffering from tuberculosis who will 
not get a result from the vaccine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, after listening to the 
hon. member's question I feel sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are trying to defend something which is not defendable by 
coming up with ludicrous ideas.  What has insulin to do with 
this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a federally-regulated body that had tests, but people 
got infected.  Insulin was discovered.  What has insulin to do 
with this?  Did a federally-regulated body have tainted insulin 
given to people?  Is that what he is saying? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying here is very simple.  We are saying that a 
federally-regulated body could have stopped this infection, 
possibly, had the power to do it and did not do it.  There was 
negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compensation has to be given to everybody who was infected.  That 
is the question.  The motion today is to compensate everybody 
infected with hepatitis C. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this matter. 
It probably will be one of the most significant debates that we 
will participate in during the course of this parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply, the government's position on the hepatitis C 
question represents a betrayal of the Liberal principles and 
traditions of going to bat for innocent people, of going to bat 
for those who are unable to go to bat for themselves, of 
assisting those in need in this country.  Liberal principles and 
traditions have driven Liberal policy for many years.  One of the 
hallmarks of the Liberal Party, I thought, was one of being a 
fair and compassionate party.  Now the government is turning its 
back on innocent Canadians who have been victimized not because 
of their negligence or oversight but because the system failed 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that the small country of Ireland which is one-tenth 
the size of Canada can have such a huge heart and provide 
compensation for all its victims of hepatitis C?  Canada is 10 
times the size of Ireland.  How is it that the Government of 
Canada can be so heartless and cruel?  How is it that a Liberal 
government can take the position it is taking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat as a Liberal member of parliament for 12 years.  I was a 
Liberal for many years before then.  I was a Liberal when Pierre 
Trudeau was the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada and when he 
was the prime minister of Canada.  Pierre Trudeau would never 
have taken the position that this government has taken.  Former 
Prime Minister John Turner would never have taken the position 
that this government today is taking.  Prime Minister King, Prime 
Minister Laurier and the entire list of Liberal prime ministers 
from Confederation on would not have taken the cruel and 
heartless position that this government is taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals have been calling me from across the country.  Rank and 
file Liberals, small <I>l</I> and big <I>L</I> Liberals, are saying 
to me that they are ashamed of being members of the Liberal Party 
when they see their government abandoning disadvantaged 
Canadians.  Why does this government have a heart big enough, and 
rightly so, to compensate victims of the ice storm in Quebec and 
Ontario and to compensate flood victims in Manitoba and Quebec? 
Why does it have the political will, the political wherewithal 
and the heart to help those people, and yet abandon these 40,000 
people?  They are not losing property or chattels.  They are not 
unemployed.  These people will lose their lives.  Their lives 
have been shattered as a result of the negligence of the 
Government of Canada and its agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their families will suffer.  We are not only talking about the 
40,000 people who have been left out, we are talking about their 
families.  Their hopes and aspirations have been shattered.  Give 
them some dignity.  Tell them the government cares.  Tell them 
the government understands what they are going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether any of those Liberal members across the way 
know of any victims or whether they have any family who were 
victimized because of the tainted blood scandal in this country. 
Perhaps if they had a family member or if they themselves were 
inflicted they could understand the pain and suffering that is 
going on out there.  I do not believe this government understands 
the magnitude of the suffering.  It is a Liberal government and 
that is what is most disturbing.  I know that many members across 
the way are deeply troubled by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes matters worse is that Liberal members are being told 
they must vote against the motion because it is a vote of 
confidence. 
What nonsense.  What a bogus position to take.  What does that 
mean?  It means those Liberal members across the way will be 
coerced and threatened by the whip and by the leadership of the 
party.  They will be stripped of their responsibilities if they 
do not toe the party line. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is wrong with politics in Canada today.  Those 
people across the way were elected to represent their 
constituents, to have some compassion, to be the representatives 
of their ridings.  Eighty-seven per cent of Canadians according 
to a public opinion poll agree that all hepatitis C victims 
should be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those Liberal members across the way who are going to toe the 
party line on Tuesday should be asking themselves who they are 
representing.  Are they representing themselves because they want 
to be on a particular committee or they want to be parliamentary 
secretaries or because they want to be cabinet ministers? Are 
they representing themselves or are they representing their 
constituents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they succumb to the pressure of the whip to support the 
government and to vote against this motion, they are not only 
betraying the Liberal Party and Liberal traditions, they are 
betraying their constituents.  There will be a political price to 
pay.  I can assure hon. members across the way of that.  They 
know in their heart of hearts that the right thing to do, the 
moral thing to do, the Liberal thing to do is to compensate all 
innocent victims.  That is what Ireland is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health, Mr. Compassion himself, a man who would 
be prime minister is refusing to show some of that Liberal 
compassion, that Liberal understanding which has made Liberal 
leaders great over the course of this century and since 
Confederation.  He uses instead weak and bogus Bay Street 
arguments for which he was paid a handsome sum when he was a 
lawyer on Bay Street.  He uses bogus legal arguments in order to 
deny innocent victims their rightful compensation.  I say shame 
on him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But is it his decision?  Behind the scenes Liberal members of 
parliament say it is really the finance minister, that he made 
the final decision.  He is the guy that controls the purse 
strings. These are the people who support the Minister of Health. 
The supporters of the Minister of Finance say that no, the final 
decision was with the Minister of Health, that it was his 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really does not matter because ultimately it is the Prime 
Minister's decision.  If he wants to be remembered as his 
predecessors are remembered, as Mr. Trudeau is revered and 
honoured and remembered by Liberals and non-Liberals across the 
country, as are all his predecessors whom he often wishes to 
emulate, he would follow in the true traditions of the Liberal 
Party.  He would open up his heart and provide compensation to 
all those people who are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this government is insisting it be a vote of 
confidence would suggest how bankrupt it is with respect to 
morality.  If it was such a right decision, if it was the correct 
decision, if it was the moral decision, if it was the Liberal way 
of doing things, why has the government chosen to consider this 
or deem it a confidence motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is the right decision, members of parliament on the 
Liberal side would vote for it based on the merits because that 
is the right thing.  They know that the backbenchers on the 
Liberal side of the House know it is the wrong thing. 
The only way the government can ensure Liberal members on the 
backbenches will vote against the motion and in favour of the 
government's position on the matter is by deeming it a vote of 
confidence, declaring it to be a vote of confidence and then 
threatening them like it threatened me. When I decided to vote 
against the budget two years ago the government said publicly in 
its talking points “he voted to defeat the government and on 
that basis he has to be removed from the Liberal caucus”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the same way the government is going to deal with 
members of Parliament opposite.  Over the course of the remainder 
of this day and throughout the course of the weekend the phones 
will be ringing.  The Prime Minister's office will be tracking 
down MPs in their ridings right across the country. They will be 
told that it is a vote of confidence and if the member votes 
against the government's position, if the member votes against 
the leader, the government is going to fall, so the member had 
better be there to vote against that motion. That is wrong.  It 
is immoral, it is unjust and it is unfair.  As I said, it is a 
betrayal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, a previous government, appointed a 
royal commission of inquiry.  The government's position 
challenges the integrity of the royal commission itself. Mr. 
Justice Horace Krever in his report indicated “Until now our 
treatment of the blood injured has been unequal.  Compensating 
some needy sufferers and not others cannot in my opinion be 
justified”.  Let me repeat that:  “Until now our treatment of 
the blood injured has been unequal.  Compensating some needy 
sufferers and not others cannot in my opinion be justified”. He 
is saying that the position of the Government of Canada today 
cannot be justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Krever sat through many months of hearings.  He heard 
witnesses.  He looked into the eyes of suffering witnesses.  He 
heard experts and he came up with the conclusion that to 
compensate some and not others cannot be justified.  That is what 
the government is doing.  It is compensating some and not others. 
Some 69,000 people were infected and only some 20,000 will be 
compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it came to other Canadians who suffered as a result of 
tainted blood, the HIV victims, the government did the right 
thing.  It compensated everyone regardless of when they 
contracted HIV as a result of the blood system.  That was the 
right decision. The government ought to be consistent and do the 
same for all hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the Minister of Health, on April 29, 1996 he had 
this to say in the House:  “The answer of course is that when 
there are resolutions as there are today involving victims 
rights, members of this party”—referring to the Liberal 
Party—“vote as they see fit.  I already told the House this 
morning that I am going to be voting in favour of the resolution 
because I share the objectives expressed by the hon. member.  I 
expect the other members of the government side will vote as they 
see fit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What absolute hypocrisy.  He speaks one way on April 29, 1996 
with respect to a certain group of victims in this country and 
now he and his government are saying that members cannot vote as 
they see fit.  They must vote as they are told, not based on what 
they believe to be right in their hearts, but based on the 
decision taken by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the government today is morally wrong. As the 
debate intensifies, Canadians will express their position in 
clear and certain terms.  The Prime Minister often goes abroad 
and talks about the Canadian way, about how Canadians have 
compassion, how they are understanding and how they are tolerant. 
This is inconsistent.  The government's position is inconsistent 
with the so-called Canadian way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated earlier, the government over the years has seen 
fit to compensate victims whether they be flood victims, ice 
storm victims or unemployed fishermen in Atlantic Canada.  The 
Government of Canada has also compensated Canadians who insulated 
their homes with urea formaldehyde foam insulation.  Remember 
that? I suppose those people lost some monetary value to their 
homes and because of a government decision, the government felt 
it was morally responsible and therefore provided compensation. 
How does the government reconcile these decisions to compensate 
some and not others? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really bothers a lot of Canadians, what really irks a lot 
of Canadians is that this government finds money, some $80 
million, to hand over to Bombardier, one of the most profitable 
corporations in Canada.  Yesterday it announced record profits, 
the most in the history of the company.  People are writing their 
cheques as we speak to the receiver general as they complete 
their income tax forms leading up to the deadline. This is hard 
earned money made by hardworking Canadians and the Prime Minister 
hands over some $80 million to a profitable company. How can that 
be justified?  How can he hand over money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did it contribute to the Liberal Party of Canada?  Does he have 
some friends, family or connections on the Bombardier board?  I 
do not know.  It boggles the mind how one set of standards can be 
applied to wealthy business friends and another set of standards 
applied to poor innocent Canadians who are suffering physically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not dealing with a flooded basement here.  We are not 
dealing with property damage.  We are not dealing with urea 
formaldehyde foam insulation in homes.  We are dealing with 
people who will die.  They will die as a result of having 
hepatitis C, not because of their own negligence, not because of 
the negligence of their doctor. Had it been negligence on the 
part of their doctor, at least there would be compensation 
through insurance plans.  They are going to die.  Many will 
suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A constituent who lives in my riding has written to me.  I will 
not quote from her letter.  I spoke to her a few days ago and she 
knows who she is.  She is on Eileen Avenue in York South—Weston. 
She told me the impact this has had on her family and the 
uncertainty it has created for her, her children and her husband, 
the pain and suffering they are going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, the Minister of Health and the Minister of 
Finance are okay.  They will go home and sleep well.  They are 
healthy.  Their children are healthy.  Their spouses are healthy. 
Do they know what it is like to live with the uncertainty of not 
knowing what the future might bring as far as their health is 
concerned?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the Minister of Finance and to the Prime Minister of 
Canada, in particular to the Minister of Finance.  I would ask 
him to look in the mirror and ask himself what would Paul Martin, 
Sr. do on this issue if he were the Prime Minister of Canada, a 
position that he aspired to and a position that the Minister of 
Finance aspires to. What would Paul Martin, Sr. have done? I 
think he will find that in his heart of hearts he knows that Paul 
Martin, Sr. would have done the right thing.  He would have 
compensated all innocent victims of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not too late for this government to admit it has made a 
mistake, that it will do the right thing and that it will 
compensate all victims. It is not fair that only the victims from 
1986 to 1990 will be compensated.  All victims should be 
compensated.

the House.  What is happening is totally disgusting.  What we are 
seeing is a government that just does not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear the government side saying that it did not know 
before 1986. I believe that in the Krever report it had been put 
on alert in 1981.  Could the member confirm that for me? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is where the 
Minister of Health and the government are being intellectually 
dishonest.  They are misstating fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is tests existed prior to 1986.  Perhaps the tests as 
far as the Americans were concerned began in 1986. But Germany 
and other jurisdictions had tests.  There were mechanisms.  There 
were opportunities available to Canada in order to prevent the 
tragedy that occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless, we should be looking at a no fault system.  We 
should not be looking at laying blame at the feet of an agency or 
government.  We should understand that this is the largest 
medical tragedy in the history of Canada.  We should be focusing 
our attention on providing compassionate and fair compensation to 
those who are suffering or will suffer as a result.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to look at the Irish example, to look at 
the way the Irish government is treating innocent victims. It is 
making generous compensation available to all victims of 
hepatitis C regardless of when they contracted it as a result of 
the blood system. That is the model.  That is the fair and 
compassionate way the government should follow. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this very tragic issue.  I 
sat in utter amazement during question period today as I listened 
to members of the government stand up time after time and put 
their largest possible smokescreen forward to try to divert 
attention away from the fact that we are dealing with the 
government's failure to ensure that people who were getting blood 
transfusions were getting safe blood transfusions. That is what 
we are dealing with here.  The government failed. It failed in 
the regulatory process to ensure that the health of Canadians was 
put first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members have said there is nothing we could do about 
it.  Prior to 1986 we had no means of testing.  We did not know. 
Therefore how could we be responsible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That statement, that premise, is an absolute lie.  I know it. 
The Liberal government knows it.  The Canadian people know it and 
most certainly the victims of the tainted blood know it 
themselves.  They are having to live with it day after day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this government, if it has one ounce of conscience, say 
it will take responsibility for those infected after 1986 but not 
those before?  There is not one substantial piece of rationale 
behind that decision that anyone in the world could ever 
determine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the government has clearly displayed that it is 
morally bankrupt, that it would prefer to talk in legal terms, 
like the Minister of Health is so good at, and talk in dollars 
and cents and try to hide behind some decision it came to with 
the ministers of health of the different provinces.  It thinks 
this somehow is the most important part of this discussion. 
It totally forgets that the most important part of this 
discussion is the people who were infected with hep C, the 
victims.  They are the most important part of this discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can the government not understand this?  The government 
members do understand it.  They know it.  They know that the 
victims are the most important part of this whole issue but they 
will not recognize it because it is going to cost them money, 
because they say they have come to some agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very sad day for Canadians.  It is a sad day when 
victims of hepatitis C who were infected prior to 1986 have to 
watch the Minister of Health, the Prime Minister and the Deputy 
Prime Minister say that prior to 1986 it is not their fault and 
therefore cannot be held responsible.  They have to watch the 
government leaders stand up one after another and tell what they 
know is an absolute lie. Everyone knows that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the facts.  In 1981 the Red Cross rejected a 
recommendation from its own people to implement surrogate tests, 
the ALT test and in 1994 the anti-HBc test.  A 1995 study 
revealed that their combined use would have lowered the incidence 
of post-transfusion hepatitis C by as much as 85%.  In 1986 the 
Red Cross was aware this testing was being used but did not 
implement it in Canada. As early as 1978 the Red Cross was aware 
that non-A and non-B hepatitis was getting into the blood supply. 
It is unfortunate that Red Cross officials did not appreciate 
the significance and the long term implications but they knew it 
was happening.  How can the government deny responsibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this debate we can talk about the impact on the victims 
and about the moral bankruptcy of the Liberal government.  I will 
address something the Liberal government has the audacity to 
stand behind.  It has tried to cloud this issue by saying that it 
is simply a non-confidence ploy of the opposition parties to try 
to bring down the government.  It has said that it cannot allow 
its own Liberal backbench members to vote the wishes of their 
constituents or of their consciences because this must be treated 
as a non-confidence motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from something referring to opposition supply motions 
being treated by the government as non-confidence motions: “This 
completely unnecessary and incorrect interpretation of the rules 
serves only to create greater frustration and partisanship and it 
is urgent that the standing orders be further amended to clarify 
that no opposition motion may be considered a matter of no 
confidence unless it specifically and explicitly indicates that 
it is intended to condemn the government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere in the motion of today is it specifically indicated that 
this motion is intended to condemn the government.  This motion 
urges the government to respect the report of the Krever 
commission.  That is a wonderful statement.  It came from the 
Liberal plan for the House of Commons and electoral reform 
entitled “Reviving Parliamentary Democracy”.  Liberal members 
will want to know who was among the signatories to this report, 
the person who is now their own House leader.  At that time he 
was the assistant House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members have the audacity to say that this is a 
non-confidence motion of some sort and that their members must 
vote with the government on it when in this report, which they 
prepared themselves and which their current House leader worked 
on and was an author to, condemned that very line of thought they 
are putting forward now.  Not only is this government morally 
bankrupt by the way it is handling this case but its members by 
their statements today have displayed the highest form of 
hypocrisy I have ever seen in my life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only one thing can be done on this issue.  This government must 
recognize the victims and award full compensation to all victims 
of hepatitis C, not only those it has put into this convenient 
little window.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a couple of 
comments because as earlier on in the day, the debate has moved 
partially away from the issue at hand and on to political 
tactics.  Political tactics are fine.  They are partisan and 
everybody who watches this debate understands this is a side 
issue that does not have much to do with the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the substance of the motion, I am sure that all those 
following the debate want to be appraised of the issues at hand. 
The last speaker along with the other colleague from his party 
made references to federal responsibilities and leadership on the 
matter of infection.  He will know and he will want everybody 
following the debate to have a full understanding of all the 
players who had a role in the management of the blood system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to make some comments so I could have an opportunity to 
give them a full appraisal of the issue.  He will recall for 
everybody who is engaged in the debate that one of those players, 
the one responsible for administering the blood system, as of 
this coming September will cease to have existed, the Red Cross, 
a venerable institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the provincial authorities responsible for administering 
health care have also participated in this and have put forward a 
package for everyone to consider. I know— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe what I just 
heard. The Liberals themselves purposely moved this whole debate 
away from the issue of compensation.  It was the cabinet 
ministers, the Minister of Health and the House leader, the 
Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister who purposely moved 
this away from a compensation issue to hep C victims to a 
political issue.  That is what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have a full understanding that the Krever commission 
sanctioned and created by the Liberal government reported that 
all hepatitis C victims should be compensated.  The government 
said it was going to accept that report only if it liked it.

<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has really put its foot in it this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A terrible injustice has been done.  I hope that the members of 
this government will understand that they have made a blatant 
error.  I call upon them to recognize that error.  Everyone 
makes mistakes, but they need to open their eyes to the 
injustice here.  They need to say that it is not right for some 
people to receive compensation while others do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my Reform colleague how they can be made to realize that 
they have committed an injustice and a mistake. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the recommendations in the 
Krever commission are very clear.  He did not say compensate some 
of the hepatitis C victims.  He said compensate all of them in 
the same way that he recommended a compensation of all the HIV 
victims.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has displayed a reprehensible attitude on this 
issue.  I hope once again the backbench members of the Liberal 
Party will have enough good sense to look into their hearts and 
conscience and when this motion comes to a vote they will vote 
what they really believe to be the right thing, not what their 
government whip tells them to vote. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is really important to continue the debate on this issue.  It 
seems we have not yet been able to change the government's mind 
on this and we hope to continue to raise the issue until we have 
it convinced it is wrong, that it is dividing Canadians into 
different groups on the basis that the day before yesterday some 
contracted hepatitis C and some did today and so they do not 
qualify for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the federal government commissioned an enquiry to 
examine what happened, to look into the regulation, management 
and operation of the blood system.  It issued a report and made 
some recommendations, among them that there should be 
compensation paid to those who suffered as a result of it.  They 
are suffering.  They are suffering a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have not come to Ottawa for a holiday.  There is no place 
to take a holiday right now.  They are here because they are 
hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not our rhetoric that matters.  It will not betray us for 
what we are.  What betrays us is our actions.  High flown words 
and intentions do not do anything.  It is our actions that speak 
loudly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health said: “We Liberals feel deep sympathy 
for those who were infected prior to January 1, 1986”. That gets 
them nothing.  They cannot take that to the bank. They cannot 
live it in health.  They cannot work because somebody felt sorry 
for them.  They cannot put their children through university. 
Their wife, who may end up being an early widow, that is not any 
help to her.  It is not going to help them to and from hospitals 
and all the expenses. This makes me sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty-seven per cent of Canadians want hepatitis C victims to 
be compensated for loss of health, livelihood, years of life, 
enjoyment and productivity.  Canadians know what is right.  Over 
there they do not know what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do they get from the Liberal government?  Back alley 
brutality.  I think it needs to be made clear just what 
constitutes the government in this country. When I came here as a 
rookie there were seminars held for rookie members of parliament. 
What did they say?  In Canada we have the government within the 
parliament and particularly the government is drawn from the 
party with the most members elected. This time it was the 
Liberals.  The way they are going it will be the last time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be a real good idea if we painted all those 
chairs another colour so that those members of the governing 
party who are not members of the government would be able to see 
who they are and see what their relation is in policy development 
in their party.  That way everybody would know.  Everybody would 
be on the same line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw a couple of parallels since our Minister of 
Health was in the previous parliament minister of justice. When 
gun control legislation came up, what did he do?  He said it is 
the right thing to do.  They set aside money for it. They have 
alienated half the country. 
There is a constitutional challenge on it.  The government forged 
ahead in the face of all that opposition.  It said $85 million. 
Now it is up in the region of $600 million.  This has not stopped 
the government one bit from forging ahead with its plan to 
implement gun control. It is the reason the Liberals lost western 
Canada.  It is the reason that the oppositions combined almost 
equal the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They acted on principle and money was no object. But now when it 
comes to hepatitis C and people have been hurt and they are going 
to be for life disadvantaged because of their illness, what is 
the response?  Now it is political consideration.  We have all 
the provinces on board.  But the government does not have the 
people of Canada on board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it has the provincial health ministers in line just as it 
is trying to line up its backbench supporters, but I bet a number 
of them will vote for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to make this a vote of non-confidence 
that would certainly please us, but it is not to be a motion of 
non-confidence.  As a previous member said, it is a motion to 
move the government to action.  That is what we want to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier when the Liberals were the government they compensated 
people who had the wrong kind of insulation in their homes 
because it might injure their health. there was a statistical 
possibility that it may have injured people's health.  But did 
they know it was a dangerous product when they proposed that it 
be put in people's houses?  Probably not.  Did it matter?  No. 
They removed the insulation and compensated homeowners for what 
was happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to my Bill C-68 comparison, the gun control 
legislation applies not to criminals but to every Canadian who 
owns a gun. But here the government is saying that is too much to 
apply a law to those people who have been hurt by tainted blood 
products.  That is all we are asking.  Target this thing.  The 
government does not have to pay everybody for everything.  We 
want to see some compassion.  There are compelling arguments for 
it and they have been made time and time again today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard bogus arguments raised against it like tainted insulin, 
as if lack of having treatment was equivalent to mistreatment. 
That does not hold water.  I cannot understand where the Liberals 
are going.  As I said, they are not under a vote of 
non-confidence here but they are losing the confidence of the 
Canadian people.  They bring dishonour on this House if they 
enforce party discipline to defeat this supply day motion.  I 
will be ashamed to be associated with this House if it fails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on members from the governing party to join with the 
opposition members in doing the right thing and bring honour to 
this House by supporting the supply day motion next Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust there will be a groundswell of support, that people will 
be phoning constituency offices across this country to show their 
support.  I trust that the ministers' fax lines and e-mails will 
be loaded by Canadians letting them know, that their phone lines 
will be jammed and their mailmen will walk in like Santa Claus 
dumping mail on their office floors.  That is what we want to see 
happen across this country between now and next Tuesday.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say, though, that I am a bit confused and I would like my 
colleague to explain something to me  Since I was elected, I 
have been hearing the Reform Party push the Liberals to cut and 
to cut some more. They are not interested in equity in health 
care or education. Now today we see them calling for equity for 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am completely in agreement with them that everyone affected 
should receive some compensation.  I wonder why we cannot hear 
the same thing from the Reformers in the House about how there 
ought perhaps not to be different policies for the rich and for 
the poor of this country.  That is something we often hear from 
the Reformers. 
They are pushing the Liberals so that we will end up with one 
health system for the rich and another for the poor. The same 
thing goes for education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can my colleague explain why today they have changed their tack 
and want everyone to be treated equitably?  I wonder why they do 
not always support such ideas. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not think the 
member would be trying to make political hay out of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party listens to Canadians.  Eighty-seven per cent of 
Canadians want the victims of hepatitis C to be compensated. Also 
the Reform Party was founded on a set of principles and it acts 
on principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject the hon. member to the left of me making some sort of 
comparison.  This is a policy many Canadians want implemented in 
the country.  Something of this nature is doing the right thing. 
It is acting on principle which is supported by the people of 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I observe that the government is certainly acting on the 
situation in this instance.  However it is controversial and 
there are feelings both ways.  Even on our side there are some 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be anything but a confidence vote now because of the 
rhetoric from the other side.  I allude to a speech by the leader 
of the NDP in which she said that the Canadian government now had 
the opportunity to act with compassion and end the battle being 
fought by the wounded.  Then she said that instead of acting with 
fairness and justice the government has drawn an arbitrary line, 
et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government tries to do the right thing and the rhetoric 
comes from the opposite side saying that the government is acting 
without principle, there is no choice but to treat the motion as 
a confidence motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will just quote his own 
health minister speaking in 1996: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer of course is that when there are resolutions, as there 
are today involving victims rights, members of this party vote as 
they see fit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I already told the House this morning that I will vote in favour 
of the resolution because I share the objectives expressed by the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

was not to help the victim but to unite the right.  Can he 
confirm if that is the case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if this unites Canadians 
against what the government stands for on this issue, so be it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to urge members to vote against the motion 
presented by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is about an agreement announced on March 27 and 
entered into by all of Canada's health ministers, that is to say, 
all 10 provincial governments, the 2 territorial governments and 
the federal government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this agreement say?  On March 27 Canada's health 
ministers announced that the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments were offering $1.1 billion of assistance to Canadians 
infected by the hepatitis C virus during a time when some of 
these infections might have been avoided had the Canadian blood 
system responded differently.  The compensation offered is $800 
million from the federal government and $300 million from the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canada's governments recognize the harm caused to a group of 
Canadians during the 1986-1990 period.  The health ministers from 
all the governments involved representing four different 
political parties agreed it was right and appropriate to offer to 
assist these Canadians because during the period in question the 
Canadian blood system could have taken certain risk reduction 
actions but did not do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When governments provide financial assistance surely it should 
be in situations where government action or inaction resulted in 
harm.  I am told, and I do not claim any expertise in these 
matters, that prior to 1986 there was no consensus in the 
international medical scientific community on how to accurately 
test for the virus then known as hepatitis non-A, non-B, which we 
now call hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is very important is that the motion in effect expresses a 
lack of confidence.  It attacks the decision not just of the 
federal government but of the 10 provincial governments and the 2 
territorial governments.  We are dealing with an agreement made 
by all of them.  This is an agreement in which today all the 
provinces and the territorial governments, as far as I am aware, 
remain part of.  They are steadfast in supporting this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who just spoke suggested that the provincial 
governments were out of touch with their constituents.  That is a 
strange comment coming from a Reform member.  He is attacking, 
and I will be talking about this later on in my speech, the 
government of Premier Klein.  Is he saying that government is 
totally out of touch with the people who elected it?  Is he

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am looking the hon. member

against this motion.  I say that to all members of the House but

stated our position as a party.  We believe in it and we stand by 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have listened to today's debate with great interest but one 
striking feature of the debate in the House today is that among 
those who have spoken in favour of this resolution, not one hon. 
member has confronted the true question at issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The true question is whether governments should make cash 
payments to those who are harmed through no fault of anyone but 
because of risk inherent in the medical system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend in the few moments permitted me to deal with that 
question and to examine it.  In doing so I urge all members to 
put aside the rhetoric, put aside the inflammatory words and the 
high sounding language of fairness and moral duty and instead 
confront the real question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the opposition parties have failed to confront that 
real question.  They paper over that question because it is very 
tough.  It is a very difficult question to answer.  Ministers of 
health of this country came to grips with it some weeks ago and 
we concluded that we had a position on when governments should 
pay cash payments to those who are injured through no fault of 
anyone but because of risk inherent in the medical system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The easy course, naturally, would be simply to pay those who are 
making a claim upon the government. 
Ministers of Health are custodians of Canada's health care system 
and we have a larger responsibility, a responsibility to show 
leadership on these tough questions and confront them directly, 
no matter how difficult they may be.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is larger than just those infected with hepatitis C. 
Hon. members know that every year there are thousands of people 
in this country who are adversely affected by the health system 
through no one's fault but because there are risks inherent in 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week researchers identified what they felt was a source of 
many deaths in hospitals every year because of adverse reactions 
to prescription drugs.  This was brand new research and they said 
the figures in Canada are staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know there are those who have adverse reactions to 
vaccines, anasthetics or to prescription drugs or who have high 
risk births delivering babies with brain damage who will need 
special care for a lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of fault, if it is a risk inherent in life or in 
delivering medical services, where is the obligation of 
governments to pay cash to those who are harmed in that way? That 
is at the root of this difficult issue.   This is not the first 
time we have had to confront that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 governments in Canada, because they were concerned by 
the rates of medical malpractice insurance by doctors and the 
number of claims for compensation, established a commission that 
was chaired by Dr. Robert Prichard who is now president of the 
University of Toronto.  The Prichard commission was made up of 
distinguished Canadians, including the then dean of medicine at 
McGill University medical school, Dr. Richard Cruess, Madam 
Justice Ellen Picard of the Superior Court of Alberta who has 
written a definitive text on hospital and doctor liability, and 
Dr. Gregory Stoddart, one of the leading health policy analysts 
of this country.  What did they conclude?  They concluded in 
their recommendations the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommend the development of a no fault compensation scheme 
for persons suffering significant avoidable health care injuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommend that the general criterion for determining which 
significant medical injuries are compensable under the 
compensation scheme should be the test of avoidability.  That is, 
the principal inquiry to determine if an event is compensable 
should be whether, with the benefit of hindsight, the injury 
could have been avoided by an alternative diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure or by performing the procedure differently. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They specifically recommended that the same test be applied to 
those who are injured through the blood system. That is exactly 
what the ministers of health have done in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We looked back over the chronology of events and asked when was 
it, in all that happened, that these injuries were avoidable. So 
when is it that no fault compensation should be offered?  History 
shows on the balance of the evidence that it was between January 
1986 and 1990 that avoidable element occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true to say there were tests here and there in different 
parts of the world and in different states earlier than that but 
broadly speaking, the evidence of those who know is it was by 
January 1986 that steps should have been taken.  They were not. 
That is when the avoidable injuries occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should governments do about people before 1986?. What 
should we do about the victims who suffered the unavoidable 
injuries by virtue of risks inherent in the health system before 
January 1986?   Among other things we should focus research on 
trying to find ways to treat and hopefully cure the infection.  I 
have asked the chair of the Medical Research Council to take 
whatever necessary or appropriate to focus research priority on 
hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also do whatever we can to minimize risk in the future. 
We will be accepting the recommendations of Mr. Justice Krever in 
terms of the federal watchdog role, putting into place more 
elaborate controls over the safety of the blood system in the 
future. I will be coming back to this House with more particulars 
on the steps we are taking in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must accept responsibility for that period when the injuries 
were avoidable. That is why we are contributing $800 million as a 
federal government to a compensation fund which will total $1.1 
billion, more I hope if the Red Cross joins us, offered to those 
in the category who suffered injuries that were avoidable, 22,000 
plus victims in that category. That was on the agenda because of 
federal leadership.  It was only in the last year that the 
federal government put that agreement together among all the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy today to suggest that we should simply write a cheque 
for all those who demand it.  We are responsible for maintaining 
a public health care system in this country and it will not be 
sustainable if we simply pay cash to all those who suffer harm 
not through anybody's fault but because of risks inherent in the 
system. 
That is what happened here before January 1986.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear the colourful language from the opposition parties 
today, when we hear them talk about our duty to the sick and the 
vulnerable, when we hear them talk about our moral duty, let us 
remember that as custodians of Canada's health care system we 
have no greater duty than to ensure that medicare is going to be 
there for those who are sick when they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no greater moral responsibility than to safeguard 
medicare for the very hepatitis C victims who will require 
treatment as they develop symptoms and their condition 
deteriorates. We have no greater obligation of compassion than to 
ensure that our public health care system remains affordable and 
sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shall not do it if we follow the course suggested by the 
other side because next month or next year there will be others 
who come forward with claims equally as compassionate, with 
demands equally as desirable, equally as emotional and they too 
will want money.  Where will it end?  It will end with 
governments paying out cash compensation regardless of fault to 
all who have an emotional claim and will end with a country 
unable to afford or sustain its health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The moral high ground does not rest with those who urge that 
easy course. The true moral high ground is with those on this 
side of the House with the courage to stand and say we will take 
the tough decision on the difficult question we face.  The true 
moral high ground rests with those in the government who will 
stand in their places next Tuesday and vote against this motion 
not because we are callous, not because we lack compassion, but 
because we are responsible for a public health care system that 
cannot and will not continue if we take the course the opposition 
urges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House to consider the 
implications of this difficult and wrenching dilemma but to 
confront the real question that lies beneath it.  Can we sustain 
our public health care system if we make cash payments to all 
those who are harmed by the health care system, regardless of 
fault, merely because of the risk inherent in the process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Infection with hepatitis C through the blood system was just 
such an inherent risk before January 1986.  As a result I say we 
should conduct research, we should do whatever we can to prevent 
such injury in the future, we should accept responsibility for 
the period when we should have acted, but I oppose this motion 
because it is not the proper policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting to hear the legal arguments from the health minister. 
I note publicly that the minister referred only to legal 
precedents on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I accept his point that government should not pay cash 
compensation to people who are injured when there is no fault. No 
fault, no compensation I accept.  But in this instance can 
anybody convince me that there was no fault, can anybody convince 
Judge Krever, our premier expert on the blood system, that there 
was no fault?  He said it plainer than I could ever say it. The 
federal government regulator failed the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I will say is that Krever is our expert. The health minister 
has turned down his expertise.  He says that the members in this 
House will not vote for this motion because it is the right thing 
to do.  I say the Liberal members will not vote for this motion 
because they are being coerced and forced and pushed into the 
hole.  Argue with that if they will but every single person in 
Canada knows that is true.  If it is not true, take off the whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in view of what the hon. 
member has said, I urge him to withdraw his motion.  If he limits 
the entitlement to cash compensation to those circumstances where 
government was at fault, then he ought to withdraw his motion. If 
he reads the Krever report he will see that the weight of the 
evidence had that it was January 1986 onward that Canada should 
have acted.  Before January 1986 there was no fault on the part 
of government.  The hon. member knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Mr. Justice Krever recommended no fault across the 
board.  We do not accept that.  But the hon. member has just 
conceded the point on this motion and he ought to withdraw the 
motion.

support entirely what the member for Macleod said.  The minister

the doorstep of the Minister of Health.  There is only one 
national Canadian Minister of Health and he is dodging the 
bullet.  He prefers to put the blame on someone else.  However, 
at the end of the day he is charged with the safety of the

cannot dodge that bullet.

the threat or the stick being held over them, or, as the member

intervention is that the hon. member will not deal with the tough 
underlying issue.  He will not confront the question.  I put it 
simply.  When should governments pay compensation?  Should they 
pay cash compensation to those who are harmed through the medical 
system not through anyone's fault, but because of the risks 
inherent in the medical system?  The member will not answer that 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He accuses me of having a legal analysis as if it is some sort 
of condemnation.  The Prichard committee in 1980 was not a legal 
analysis.  It was made up of health care experts who understood 
health policies.  Their recommendation was to do exactly what 
ministers have done in this case, which is good public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will not confront the question because he knows where 
it leads.  It leads to the conclusion that this motion is 
ill-founded and inappropriate.  The very person who moved it, the 
hon. member for Macleod, has conceded that it is without 
foundation.  He has conceded that if there is no fault there 
should be no cash payment.  The history of this matter shows that 
he has just cut the ground out from under his own motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr.

motion about which I and my party are deeply concerned and will 
be supporting on Tuesday night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to refer to what we have heard in this House today.  We 
have heard that people with hepatitis C lead normal lives.  We 
have heard that people with hepatitis C who will not be 
compensated can go the CPP disability route.  We have heard 
unbelievable statements from the other side of the House today 
that the provincial governments should show leadership in 
changing the government's view on hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statements are absolutely unbelievable, coming from 
so-called educated people on the other side whom we call Liberals. 
History will prove that this government is probably one of the 
cruelest, craziest and silliest governments of all time.  History 
will prove me right on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just unbelievable that the Minister of Health can stand 
here and deflect like a stick-handler in hockey.  Unfortunately 
he cannot score.  He never has and he never will.  The 
unfortunate part is that there are 40,000 people and their 
families who are infected by hepatitis C who will not be 
compensated.  He stands there and says they have emotional 
claims.  When people die, when people get sick, when people are 
injured by this disease he says they are basing their arguments 
on emotion only.  He would not know a hepatitis C victim if that 
person lived in his basement.  It is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few questions to ask the minister, if he ever cares to 
answer, in letter form, privately or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree with his parliamentary secretary that people who 
do not have hepatitis C compensation can go the CPP route? 
I know in my riding that hundreds of people try the CPP 
disability route and it takes years to get processed.  In the the 
end, when the tribunal awards it to them, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development can turn around after 90 days and deny the 
claim.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from northern Saskatchewan was in this House and 
presented a compelling question to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.  It was about a young man of 26 years who 
had no legs and was missing an eye.  He was denied CPP 
disability. If an individual of that nature can be denied CPP, 
how in the hell can they stand in this House and tell us that 
people who have hep C can go— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I have no idea how 
he is going to know, but he is not going to know using that 
language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize.  I will 
refrain from using such strong language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only because of my strong feelings on this particular 
issue.  I feel that everybody with hep C in this country should 
be duly and fairly compensated.  With that remark I will end my 
comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened to the debate today with considerable interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously it is an issue that has gripped the country.  People 
are quite aware of the issue now.  They have followed it very 
closely and I think that Canadians are always compassionate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the facts in this case we cannot help but 
support the position taken not only by the Reform Party but by 
all oppositions parties.  I should pay tribute to members of all 
parties who have spoken today in the interests of standing up for 
Canadians.  I say that of members of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back through the chronology.  In October 1993 the 
government appointed a commission.  It appointed Justice Krever 
to look into the contamination of the blood system.  We had an 
interim report in February 1995 and a final report in November of 
last year.  In that report Justice Krever made the recommendation 
that all victims should be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, for instance, that AIDS/HIV victims going back to 1978 
were compensated.  They were all compensated.  Justice Krever has 
made the judgment that all of the victims of hepatitis C should 
also be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to the health minister that it is the justice who 
this government appointed who is making that recommendation.  It 
is not another government, it is his judge who chaired the 
commission to bring forward these types of recommendations.  We 
are simply pointing out that it is the government's own committee 
with its own expert review that has made these recommendations. 
We are simply asking them to listen to Justice Krever's advice 
and to do as he suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only in Canada that this advice has been followed.  We 
have heard over the last couple of days how the Government of 
Ireland eventually had to yield to considerable public pressure 
because of the public's superior moral conscience which forced 
its government to pay compensation to all victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the government to listen to its own conscience and 
to finally come around to the point of view that it must start to 
compensate all victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has drawn an arbitrary line.  It says January 
1986 is the point at which it will start to pay compensation.  As 
other members have pointed out, in other parts of the world 
testing was already under way, going back to 1981, which would 
have detected hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out in response to questions from the health minister 
that when a federal body takes on a responsibility to regulate 
something like the blood system, implied in that is 
responsibility and culpability. 
When the federal government steps in as a regulator the public 
has the right to assume that the government is taking all 
reasonable steps to ensure that it is doing its job, that it is 
getting the best possible information and that it is reaching out 
around the world to find out, in this case, whether or not there 
are tests available to determine whether there are things like 
hepatitis C lurking in blood.  It did not do that and it should 
therefore be culpable.  It is that straightforward.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister wants us to absolve the government of all 
blame.  He is essentially justifying not paying compensation on 
the basis of the tardiness of the regulating agency to use other 
tests that were available around the world.  The regulating 
agency was responsible for not utilizing all the available means 
to ensure that the blood system was safe.  If it did not take 
those steps, then it is culpable.  It is that straightforward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say in response to the health minister's speech of a few 
minutes ago that the regulating agency simply did not do its job. 
It simply did not use all available means at the time, which is 
why Justice Krever ruled that everybody should receive 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I want to go to is the idea of a free vote.  I 
say to the health minister, the former justice minister, that if 
he is so convinced of his position, then allow this issue to go 
to a free vote.  If he really believes that the federal 
government has no more responsibility previous to 1986 then let 
us ask him to put his position on the line with his own members. 
If he really believes in that, let us ask him to put his position 
on the line.  Does he not trust his ability to make a persuasive 
argument to his own caucus?  Let us let the people's 
representatives make that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the House we know that the leaders of the respective 
opposition parties got up and said “We do not view this as a 
vote of non-confidence.  This is not a confidence motion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know the government has spoken in the past.  It has 
written volumes about how it would allow more free votes.  We 
view this issue as a moral issue.  We say that this is an issue 
whereby the public should have the right to be represented by 
their representatives in the House of Commons.  Let us have the 
government now finally put its money where its mouth is.  Let us 
have it actually bring this motion to a free vote in the House of 
Commons on Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there is a three line whip.  People are being called 
back from all over the country.  They are being told to be here, 
not to vote freely, but to vote against the motion, to vote 
against their own consciences, to vote against what their 
constituents are telling them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what theory of representation they believe in, they 
cannot possibly believe in one whereby the government says “it 
is my way or the highway” irrespective of what the public is 
telling them, irrespective of what their conscience tells them, 
especially when opposition party members have said they do not 
view this as a confidence motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude my remarks by saying that if the government truly 
believes it is on the moral high ground here, then let us put 
this issue to members in a free vote.  That is the true test. 
That is the real way to find out whether or not the government's 
arguments have carried the day.  Because if those arguments are 
as persuasive as the health minister thinks they are, the 
government will have no problem carrying just a very few members 
on the government side that it will need to win the vote.

interrupt the proceedings.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>COURT CHALLENGES PROGRAM 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK244">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.)</B>  moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
withdraw all funding from the federal Court Challenges Program. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the Court Challenges Program by way of 
background is an independent corporation based in Winnipeg that 
receives $2.75 million of public money every year.  It 
distributes this money to interest groups so that those groups 
can then argue their views on the meaning of the charter of 
rights and freedoms in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1994 contribution agreement between the program and the 
government, the overall objective of the program is very 
carefully stated.  It says “the objective of the program is the 
clarification of constitutional rights and freedoms”. Note the 
word clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Court Challenges Program was not charged with the task of 
advocating specific interpretations of constitutional rights and 
freedoms.  Its role in this process of clarification was to be a 
relatively minor one having to do with money.  It was to provide 
interest groups with the money needed to present their charter 
interpretations in the court. Obviously, the judges are the ones 
who by their rulings must do the actual work of clarifying 
Canadians' rights and freedoms under the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the Court Challenges Program is that it does 
not know its place.  Its ambitions go well beyond its mandate. It 
is not content simply to handle the money side of things and let 
the courts decide the merits of various arguments.  It has set 
itself up as judge and jury over the interest groups that apply 
for funding. For example it has been very welcoming to groups 
that promote gay rights, socialism and radical feminism.  But 
interest groups that bring contrasting viewpoints to the courts, 
viewpoints which judges need to hear in order to render informed 
decisions are denied funding altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Court Challenges Program thus violates section 8.3 of its 
contribution agreement which says that the program shall fund a 
broad range of individuals and groups.  The program has been 
anything but broad and inclusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of blatant bias is made possible by the lack of 
adequate, unambiguous criteria for funding decisions. It often 
happens that when governments decide to fund interest groups, 
they are unable to answer the question:  On what basis did you 
support one group and not another? In the absence of clear 
criteria, there is no other way for funding decisions to be made 
than in an ad hoc way which leaves too much to the discretion of 
the person who happens to be making the funding decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a 1992 study undertaken at the request of Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs Canada, four researchers concluded that various 
strict procedures needed to be followed in the process of 
determining which groups would receive government funds.  Among 
those procedures was a process for arriving at some fair criteria 
for funding decisions.  It involved four stages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very first stage was that of writing a draft statement of 
criteria.  The second stage was the distribution of that to all 
affected parties, stakeholders.  The third stage was the unbiased 
consideration of comments on those proposed criteria from the 
affected parties.  Last was the publication of the final 
criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The authors write that at a minimum, what seems to be required 
is clearly articulated rules, which are applied equally to all 
with a stake in the activity and administrators who are obliged 
to adhere to those rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Court Challenges Program is a notorious transgressor in this 
regard.  Its criteria for making decisions are extremely vague 
and are therefore susceptible to manipulation by the Court 
Challenges Program's obviously biased decision makers.  Most 
importantly, since the Court Challenges Program can only fund 
cases that deal with equality rights under sections 15 and 28 of 
the charter, the Court Challenges Program decision makers have 
taken it upon themselves to in effect define what that equality 
means when clearly that should be left to the judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that the Court Challenges Program could be as biased 
as I am saying it is?  The reason for such consistently biased 
funding decisions is clear.  The members of the Court Challenges 
Program board of directors and also of its equality panel which 
makes the actual funding decisions are also members of those very 
same groups that wind up getting funded.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very clear conflict of interest.  The organization has 
no checks and no balances that would serve to guard it against 
partisan and biased decision making. Instead the government has 
written these groups a blank cheque by giving them control over 
the organization that disburses public money for charter cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at an example of an interest group that has been 
treated unfairly, in order to highlight the bias at the Court 
Challenges program.  REAL Women of Canada is an organization 
whose approach to women's equality seeks to be sensitive to the 
needs of other members of society, including unborn children. On 
many issues, their view contrasts with that of the Women's Legal 
Education and Action Fund or LEAF for short.  Time and again, 
REAL Women has been denied funding by the Court Challenges 
Program while LEAF has been consistently handed out cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been six court cases in which both groups 
participated on opposite sides of an issue.  In all six of those 
court cases, LEAF's bills were paid by the Canadian taxpayer via 
the Court Challenges Program but REAL Women had to struggle to 
scrape together the necessary funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no logical reason for this inequality and 
discrimination against the group REAL Women.  Regardless of what 
one thinks of the views of this group, it is clear that its 
positions on various issues are representative of the views of a 
large number of Canadian women. How large that number is is not 
my present concern, but it is clear that the Supreme Court has 
regarded this organization as worth hearing in court since it has 
consistently granted REAL Women intervenor status. Yet the Court 
Challenges Program whose equality panel is cut from a different 
ideological cloth than REAL Women has consistently refused to 
grant funding to REAL Women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most shocking is the written response the Court 
Challenges Program gave to REAL Women after the group applied for 
intervenor funding in the Borowski case. Here is how REAL Women 
describe what happened in a letter written this year concerning a 
period in the mid-1980s:  “In its refusal the Court Challenges 
Program stated that our view”—REAL Women's view—“of equality 
was not in accordance with the accepted and current understanding 
of equality both by society and the courts. This was back in 1987 
when the courts had barely dealt with equality issues under 
section 15 of the charter which came into effect only in 1985”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only two years later and the response is that their view or 
understanding of equality does not fit the set understanding of 
equality in society and in the courts.  Two years later. It is 
really quite a far stretch to imagine that it would already be 
that set at that point.  “To add insult to injury, the Court 
Challenges Program enclosed an analysis or critique of our 
Borowski factum written by Rosalyn Curry, a member of LEAF, which 
was opposing us in the case”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine.  The Court Challenges Program wanted an expert to 
examine REAL Women's application for funding and just happened to 
choose a lawyer who was a member of LEAF, REAL Women's arch 
rival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Court Challenges Program is clearly usurping the role of 
judges by deciding whether or not a group's legal arguments have 
merit.  They have appointed themselves the justice system's 
gatekeepers on charter cases of crucial significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is other disputable evidence of bias at the Court 
Challenges Program.  Quite tellingly when the courts have not 
ruled in favour of one of the Court Challenges Program's 
favourite groups, the program's literature subsequently portrays 
that decision as a great setback for justice and equality. That 
makes it clear that the Court Challenges Program is not 
interested in letting judges clarify the rights and freedoms we 
have under the charter, which is their mandate, their reason for 
existence. Rather the organization is itself an advocacy group 
whose true objective is to help its friends in the left wing 
advocacy business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was even acknowledged publicly by one of the funded groups 
EGALE, Equality for Gays and Lesbians Everywhere. In their 
newspaper <I>Capital Extra</I>, they told their readers as 
recently as November 14, 1997 “federal funding for the Court 
Challenges Program means that you have an advocate”.  It does 
not get much clearer than that, straight from the mouth of the 
gay lobby.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to raise a question which I find interesting 
concerning how the Court Challenges Program might fare if it were 
ever itself subjected to a court challenge.  I enjoy thinking 
about this. A 1994 supreme court case dealt with the very issue 
of selective funding of interest groups.  It throws some 
interesting light on the Court Challenges Program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Native Women's Association of Canada argued that the 
government had unfairly denied it funding and a seat at the table 
in the so-called Canada round of constitutional consultations 
that led up to the Charlottetown accord. Four native groups did 
receive direct funding and a seat at the table but NWAC was not 
one of them.  The group argued that its freedom of expression had 
been violated as well as its equality rights under the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some interesting ideas in terms of the judges' 
reasons for their decisions.  Some interesting ideas emerge which 
are helpful to us in our consideration of the motion before us 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court ruled that a government is free to choose its advisers 
as long as it does not base its choices on discriminatory 
grounds.  Writing for the majority, Justice Sopinka said that the 
government must be free to consult or not consult whomever it 
pleases.  There is nothing illegal about a government funding 
some groups and listening carefully to them while totally 
ignoring others.  So far so good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be careful to realize that Judge Sopinka's words about 
the acceptability of bias toward different interest groups 
applies to governments but not to the judiciary.  It would be 
completely unacceptable for judges to want to hear only one side 
of an argument and to completely ignore and not even hear 
arguments from the other side.  If they did so the public would 
lose confidence in the courts pretty quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Court Challenges Program is such an absurd, 
offensive and unjust program.  It may sometimes be acceptable for 
the government to listen to arguments on only one side of an 
issue but the government cannot and should not spend money in the 
hope that the judiciary will be subjected to one-sided 
argumentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can choose its own advisers but it must not 
choose the judiciary's advisers.  However that is the effect of 
the Court Challenges Program. By funding this biased 
organization, the government is meddling in the affairs of the 
judiciary. It is attempting to determine which interest groups 
will be able to press their case in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing which we learn from this supreme court 
case. The court ruled that the government's decision to fund the 
four aboriginal groups but not NWAC, it was not based on 
discriminatory grounds.  The decision was based on a procedural 
preference and not a gender preference.  The NWAC argued that the 
four groups were pushing a male dominated view of aboriginal 
self-government but the evidence did not support this.  It showed 
that the four funded groups adequately represented both men and 
women in native communities and that there were no barriers to 
NWAC's working within those four groups and thus having a voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only were these groups open to working with NWAC but two of 
them gave $260,000 of their government funding to NWAC precisely 
to assist the group in presenting its views.  It is instructive 
that the courts clearly assumed that NWAC's equality rights would 
have been violated had the evidence shown that those four groups 
were biased against women and did not represent the views of 
native women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from Judge Sopinka's ruling that the decision would 
have been different had the evidence shown that the four groups 
hand picked by the government to represent native Canadians were 
hindering NWAC's participation in the aboriginal consultation. If 
we apply Justice Sopinka's reasoning to the Court Challenges 
Program, the program comes up short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the positions advanced by the Court Challenges Program 
are not, and I underline are not, representative of the views of 
the interest groups that have been denied funding.  Second, all 
the evidence shows that the Court Challenges Program is indeed 
biased against the views of many of the non-funded groups.  They 
do not give out dollars to those groups with whom they differ. 
Third, unlike the four aboriginal groups that opened their doors 
to make room for the NWAC to participate in the constitutional 
process, the Court Challenges Program has no interest in working 
with groups it regards as ideologically suspect.  Fourth, unlike 
the four aboriginal groups which redirected $260,000 of their 
funding to the NWAC, the Court Challenges Program has not 
directed any money to groups whose views it does not share.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons I brought this initiative forward.  Let 
me read it into the record again: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
withdraw all funding from the federal Court Challenges Program. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seek unanimous consent of the House to have the motion before 
us deemed adopted and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The question of whether there will be 
unanimous consent for adoption and passage of the motion is not 
up for decision since the motion is not votable.  Is the hon. 
member asking that the matter be made votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Adopted and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to adopt 
and pass this motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to stand in the House and defend the Court 
Challenges Program, anything which assists in putting meat on the 
bones of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that a right in law is not much use to somebody who 
cannot afford it or does not have the means by which to enforce 
it.  To hear members of parliament suggest that having a right 
and having the inability to enforce it is nothing other than a 
taking away justice for those people is surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a modest program which is available only to those who 
are disadvantaged in our society who are contending that their 
charter rights are not being respected to historically 
disadvantaged groups and those who have over time suffered most 
at the hands of the majority.  One would have thought that 
members of parliament would be here to protect those very people 
and to do what they could to ensure their rights are protected 
and enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program is a modest one.  It provides modest support to 
those who have a case to make.  The decision whether to support a 
program does not, as the member for Wanuskewin suggested, mean 
that the Court Challenges Program is doing the job of the court 
or this House.  The Court Challenges Program and the experts who 
are there to dispense these relatively modest amounts are of the 
view that the case is one which is in the public interests to 
debate and one in which the person bringing it forward in the 
public interest is in need of some support in order to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program is unique and fundamentally an important one in the 
sense that it provides the opportunity to generate some 
substantive equality in Canada where that is presently not in 
place. It is limited in funds and it is limited to challenges to 
federal laws, policies and practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask those who would want to throw this program away do they 
not see some benefit in that program. Is their desire to throw 
that program way driven by ideology and not by common sense?  I 
cannot believe that the member who wants to get rid of the Court 
Challenges Program would not be in support of the Court 
Challenges Response in assisting, for example, the Eldridge case, 
a deaf women to assert her right to sign language interpretation 
when she is communicating with physicians in her quest for health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there something wrong with that?  Is there something wrong 
with ensuring that a woman who is deaf and who can only 
communicate through sign language can assert her right to be 
accommodated so that she can be treated as everyone else?  I 
cannot believe that many in Canada would oppose assisting a woman 
in that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither can I imagine that there would be many in Canada who 
would oppose the support to persons of colour who work for CIDA 
and who are asserting that there has been systemic racism in the 
employment practices of that department.  It is not whether it is 
true.  Surely we would want to support those who assert that it 
is true and who are affected by a practice which we would all 
condemn.  Are there many in this country who would say that we 
should not as a society support someone in that quest to 
eliminate racism in a federal government department? 
Those who are saying we should get rid of this program would I 
suppose say that is not a very important question, racism in 
employment practices in government departments.  I contend that 
most Canadians would disagree with that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the case of an Indian woman who is being denied the 
right to participate in band elections?  We hear a lot from the 
Reform Party about the need for accountability in Indian affairs. 
Here is an opportunity to support someone who is trying to ensure 
that there indeed is greater participation, greater democracy in 
Indian band elections.  Would there be many who would 
legitimately complain about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the case of Tracey Smith, an aboriginal woman with 
children in both the United States and Canada?  She is 
challenging immigration policies which prevent her from freely 
crossing the border to be with her children. We hear much from 
the Reform Party about families. Why would we not assist this 
mother to clarify this plainly unfair situation? Why would we not 
assist her so that she can be with her children, her family? I 
find it odd that those who argue so strenuously that they speak 
for families would not assist a mother to be with her children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that few would disagree with the Court Challenges 
Program in its assistance to disabled persons. We know for 
example that immigrant status is generally denied to persons with 
physical disabilities.  We must all have experienced the case of 
members of a family wanting to immigrate to Canada and finding 
they are faced with a choice of leaving their disabled child in 
their country of origin or in another place and coming to Canada 
with the rest of their family or not coming at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should support those who try to resolve those kinds of 
disputes, the kind of thing the Court Challenges Program looks to 
assist a person with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also experienced significant difficulties on behalf of 
our constituents with disability pensions.  I am sure we have all 
seen the unfairness of that system.  Why would we then not 
support the Court Challenges Program when it assists a disabled 
person to challenge the eligibility requirements for disability 
benefits which have adversely affected them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems this program has provided a useful service to 
Canadians.  It has enabled us to ensure that rights contained in 
the charter of rights and freedoms mean something to those who 
otherwise would not have the means to enforce them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many cases in which the Court Challenges Program has 
provided Canada and our society and our community with 
significant benefits.  Take the case of Mark Benner. 
He was born of a Canadian mother and an American father in the 
United States.  Children born abroad of Canadian fathers do not 
have to apply for citizenship. Canadians born overseas of 
Canadian mothers do, which is a plain discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would anybody think it would be undesirable to assist Mark 
Benner in clarifying and changing this situation? Is there 
something justifiable about that discrimination? I think not. 
Would it not be useful then for us as a community and a society 
together to provide some support for that case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case which seems to have raised the member for Wanuskewin's 
ire most of all is that which is being brought and supported by 
the Court Challenges Program by Dr. Ailsa Warkinson from 
Saskatoon regarding section 43 of the Criminal Code.  That 
provision provides a defence to a charge of assault against a 
child victim, that is child abuse, to a parent or a teacher who 
uses reasonable force for the purposes of correction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of cases identified by Dr. Warkinson in which 
that argument, that defence, has been used to gain acquittal even 
in serious assault cases against children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot fathom any reason why anybody would want to be

Challenges Program in trying to do something about a very serious 
problem and, if we are really concerned about children, something 
we should be very seriously concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disturbing to see an obsession with opposition to anything 
governments do overriding common sense and overriding something 
that has been useful to many individual Canadians and to us as a 
society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on this motion today to speak against it.  The 
issue we are debating is of great importance to Canada.  It 
touches the heart of what defines our country.  It deals with the 
core attributes of modern democratic societies. It focuses on the 
ideal of equality before the law which Canada pursues actively 
and for which it is recognized internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is ironic that today of all days we would be debating 
this motion when there is a delegation of members of parliament 
from South Africa touring today. That country has modelled its 
own program after the Canadian program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is the Court Challenges Program, which the opposition 
would like to kill.  This program is a symbol of the Canadian 
commitment to democracy.  It is also a tangible demonstration of 
our progressive Canadian identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House, and I gather members over there as 
well, are proud to have created this program and to have 
reinstated it in 1994 after a previous government discontinued 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government firmly believes that in a free and democratic 
society fundamental rights have to be protected and interpreted 
by the courts in a manner that reflects contemporary society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals reinstated the Court Challenges Program at a 
time of severe fiscal restraint, we made a deliberate choice at 
that time because the government is committed to and believes in 
a Canada where fundamental rights are respected and furthered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April of this year we signed a new contribution agreement to 
secure additional annual funding of $2.75 million for this 
program until the year 2003.  The government stands by that 
commitment and is therefore not supportive of the motion we are 
debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Court Challenges Program was first established in 1978 to 
assist court challenges in relation to language minority rights. 
In 1982 the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms came into 
force, entrenching basic freedoms and democratic, political, 
legal equality, language and aboriginal rights, and the 
fundamental law of the land.  That same year the mandate of the 
program was broadened to include language rights guaranteed under 
the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985 the government expanded the program further to include 
funding for equality rights cases arising under section 15 of the 
charter.  The program has played a significant role in bringing 
before the courts those cases which have helped to define and 
advance language and equality rights guaranteed in the 
Constitution. It has already led to a number of key decisions and 
its usefulness has already been very well established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Examples in the area of equality rights include the Andrews case 
on the overall definition of the concept of equality, the Swain 
case on the rights of mentally disabled people, the 
Tétreault-Gadoury case on the rights of persons over the age of 
65, the Canadian newspaper case involving the provisions in the 
Criminal Code which protect the confidentiality of sexual assault 
victims, and the Butler case concerning the constitutional 
validity of the Criminal Code pornography provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of language rights there were the Forest, Société 
des Acadiens du Nouveau-Brunswick and Mercure cases concerning 
legal bilingualism, the reference re Manitoba in 1985 and 1992 
and the Sinclair case concerning legislative bilingualism, the 
Ford judgment on freedom of expression and the right to use 
languages other than French on public signs in Quebec, and the 
Mahé case on the education rights provided in section 23 of the 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Court Challenges Program was designed to provide access to 
the courts for groups and individuals who would not otherwise be 
able to challenge government policies and practices related to 
constitutional and charter rights. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides a means for enforcing and clarifying the law.  Since 
1985 the program has received over 1,000 applications for 
funding.  The program has funded several hundred challenges and a 
number of them made their way to the Supreme Court of Canada 
where judgments were rendered favourable to the group or 
individual funded in almost half the cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program had some 350 language rights and equality case files 
before it when it produced its most recent annual report in March 
1997.  Clearly there is a need to pursue the program and to 
develop further charter jurisprudence in the areas of language 
and equality rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will be pleased to know that third party evaluations 
have confirmed that the program is well administered by an arm's 
length, non-profit agency with representatives from the private 
bar, non-governmental organizations and academics.  It has clear 
rules and procedures for providing funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program provides assistance only for test cases of national 
significance involving federal and provincial language rights 
protected by the Constitution of Canada as well as challenges to 
federal legislation, policies and practice based on section 2 of 
the charter dealing with fundamental freedoms and sections 15, 27 
and 28 dealing with equality and gender equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding proposals are reviewed by two independent panels:  the 
equality rights panel and the language rights panel.  Members of 
the panel are chosen by independent selection committees after 
consultation with over 300 community groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the selection committees and panels volunteer 
hundreds of hours of work to pursue the clarification of 
constitutional rights all of us have.  They play an important 
role in building a free and democratic society in Canada.  The 
government takes this opportunity to thank them for their work 
and dedication on behalf of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As reflected in its decision of 1994 to reinstate the Court 
Challenges Program the government is committed to advancing 
constitutionally based equality and language rights.  Allowing a 
variety of voices to be heard on these rights is essential to 
maintain the social, economic and cultural vitality of Canada 
that has distinguished our country internationally and that all 
Canadians can be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program plays a pivotal role in ensuring the ongoing 
adjustment of the interpretation of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms in protecting the rights of all Canadians. 
With the support of Canadians the government will continue to 
support the Court Challenges Program in the years to come.  All 
Canadians and all citizens of the world can be proud of this 
accomplishment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the motion introduced by my Reform Party 
colleague.  This motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
withdraw all funding from the Federal Court Challenges Program. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the House immediately that the Bloc 
Quebecois is strongly opposed to the member's motion, having 
given it lengthy and honest consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Court Challenges Program was created to fund legal cases 
having to do with the defence of equality and linguistic rights. 
In moving such a motion, it is evident that my Reform Party 
colleague is unaware of the importance of preserving these 
rights in a society such as ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 15 of the Charter protects the right of every citizen 
not to be subjected to discrimination.  Is there any right more 
important than that of equal recognition for every individual? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A society cannot claim to be free and democratic if it does not 
adequately protect the right of its citizens to be treated 
without discrimination.  With this in mind, we must make the 
necessary tools available so that those whose rights have been 
trampled can demand appropriate redress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members are apparently under the impression that it is easy 
to take a case of discrimination before the courts. 
It is important to know that victims of discrimination think 
twice before launching into a long and costly legal proceeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grounds for appeal against unjustified discrimination are 
not always easily determined.  The line between what is 
considered discriminatory and what is considered a justified 
distinction is sometimes a very fine one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore essential that these people be able to count on 
something like the Court Challenges Program to help them obtain 
justice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program provides financial assistance for cases appealing 
legislation that may deny rights to equality.  It also, and this 
is very important, helps people express their linguistic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I would point out the implication of the recognition 
of language rights.  Section 133 of the Constitution of 1867 
provides for the optional and mandatory use of the French and 
English languages.  Furthermore, the charter of rights and 
freedoms contains certain provisions on protecting the use of 
the official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will claim, and rightly so, moreover, that language rights 
are not sufficiently promoted.  French language services are 
certainly not provided all across Canada.  Language rights are 
as important in a society such as ours as equal rights.  It is 
through language that people express themselves and make 
themselves understood.  Language provides expression to our 
emotions, our dissent, our approval and our feelings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy cannot function properly if the public cannot make its 
voice heard.  Justice will not be served if those who come 
before the courts cannot make themselves understood there in 
their own language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the court challenges program supports people wishing 
to protect their language rights is to preserve the delicate 
balance between the official languages. The program provides 
funding for preparing court cases and for pre-trial research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court challenges program is essential to ensure that 
everyone has access to justice. That said, what explanation can 
there be for the hon. member's proposal that the program funding 
be terminated?  This is incomprehensible.  One would have to be 
very short-sighted and narrow-minded to propose such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In proposing such a motion, the hon. member will certainly 
attempt to find support in the policies of the former 
Conservative government, which had decided to put an end to the 
program, to kill it. 
It is important to keep in mind that the Minister of Justice of 
the day, Kim Campbell, the colleague of future Quebec Liberal 
Party leader Jean Charest, had used the difficult economic 
climate of 1992 as justification for termination of the 
program's funding 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when the federal budget surplus could reach several 
billion dollars, I have a great deal of difficulty understanding 
the hon. member's motion.  I am not, moreover, alone in 
wondering what lies behind the Reform member's proposal.  I 
would invite him to justify it to the members of the Fédération 
des francophones de Saskatchewan, who are this very day here in 
Ottawa calling for their province to become bilingual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a release issued today, the president of the federation said, 
and I quote “The ethnocide of the French-speaking minority has 
always been perpetuated by provincial governments in areas such 
as education, health and social services, while the federal 
government looked the other way”.  In such a context, it is 
completely inconceivable that a member would dare to move the 
withdrawal of funding from this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in its June 1992 report, the Standing Committee on 
Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons—the Bloc was not 
there at the time—concluded that the program played an essential 
role by giving individuals access to the courts. The Court 
Challenges Program has become indispensable to the development 
of equality and linguistic rights case law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois feels not only that funding for the Court 
Challenges Program must be maintained, but that improvement of 
the program would be justified.  I urge my colleagues opposite 
to give this some thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inequality that has existed with respect to historically 
disadvantaged groups is justification for preserving such a 
program.  We must ensure adequate access to the courts and make 
it possible for rulings having to do with the violation of 
equality and linguistic rights in our society to be enforced.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Reform Motion No. 327.  The 
motion, as has been stated, already calls for the government to 
withdraw all funding for the federal Court Challenges Program, 
the program presently administered out of Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was mentioned by the member proposing the motion that the 
money currently available is $2.5 million.  As described by my 
colleague in the New Democratic Party, this is really a modest 
sum when one looks at the overall money spent in the present 
court system relative to what the government spends on a single 
case.  For example, the Airbus case would probably double that 
total budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Court Challenges Program was established in 1968, as 
indicated by the Department of the Secretary of State, to fund 
challenges to federal and provincial language rights protected 
under the Constitution of 1867.  The overall objective clearly 
was to clarify rights and freedoms as protected by the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 the program was expanded to include language rights 
under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  In 1985 the 
administration of the program was vested in the Canadian Council 
on Societal Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 it was moved to the human rights research and education 
centre at the University of Ottawa.  In 1992 admittedly the 
Progressive Conservative government cancelled the Court 
Challenges Program based on the need at that time to cut spending 
and the deficit.  It was subsequently reinstated, as has been 
indicated in the Chamber, by the Liberal government in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is an historical fact that needs to be on the 
record, and that is that the Campbell government was prepared and 
had a platform that called for a reinstatement of a program 
similar to one that was in place.  I will speak to that later in 
my remarks.  Were it not for a slight electoral shift that 
occurred in 1993, which some might call an earthquake or even the 
earth opening up and swallowing us whole, the program would have 
been in place in a somewhat revised form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then and what we have now is a fiscal situation where the 
deficit has been harnessed much through the work of previous 
administrations and those policies that were carried on by the 
current government.  This brings into question the basis of the 
motion questioning the funding and the motivation behind the 
particular program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians have to stop and question the legitimacy and 
the necessity of a program such as this one.  The federal Court 
Challenges Program has been of real benefit in several important 
legal decisions in the country.  The program allows Canadians to 
clarify the Canadian charter rights that exist.  However it was 
not intended to give a perpetual fund for lobby groups, 
particularly lobby groups that may have some spurious intent. The 
suggestion that we should cancel the program outright is the 
usual solution we sometimes hear in the Chamber where we throw 
the baby out with the bath water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion I will be putting forward is that the program is 
necessary, but there are perhaps some improvements that could be 
made.  There has been mention of the fact that the program is 
susceptible to manipulation and perhaps abuse if that money is 
made too readily available.  This can be addressed by having 
assurances in place that a strict criterion must be met, a 
criterion with respect to the cause and the need. That currently 
exists.  As in all situations involving boards and 
administrators, what we have to see is a more diligent approach 
and perhaps a more proactive effort made to ensure that the 
criterion is met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously what the country does not need and what our legal 
system does not need is more spurious challenges to the court. We 
have seen in recent years Canada becoming an overlitigious 
society.  We see the courts called upon daily to rule upon issues 
that seem to me, and I am sure to some Canadians, to be issues of 
common sense that could be applied and settled far from the 
chambers of the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, the Progressive Conservative Party and I 
believe there is legitimate need for a program such as this one. 
The government should remain committed to equality rights for all 
Canadians and should therefore continue to support a program that 
will flesh out or allow a forum for individuals who feel 
oppressed to access resources they might need to pursue those 
rights in the courts. 
I think there can be no other or no more important purpose for a 
fund such as this one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of charter rulings in the courts have been handed down 
in recent years.  These decisions are critical to the operation 
of our justice system and to the operation of Canadian society 
generally. Morals are sometimes shaped there.  Ideological ideas 
are given a forum for discussion. Legal issues are explored in a 
more detailed fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have become a more rights oriented society as a result of the 
charter.  However the charter of rights and freedoms has also 
become an agent of change in this country. Pursuing cases through 
the courts is a critical and crucial part of this avenue for 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court process of course can be very long and arduous.  It is 
a process that at times is beyond the reach and beyond the 
economic capacity of some individuals who wish to challenge 
rights or infringements of their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Calling for a blanket removal of this fund I suggest is not the 
answer.  It was for these very reasons that the original program 
was put in place, to establish test cases which deal with certain 
provisions of the charter.  It does not mean that this program 
should be abused or that charter rights should be brought forward 
at every turn of the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further suggestion one might make with respect to the 
improvement of the federal Court Challenges Program would be that 
one could perhaps look at reducing or in some ways adding to the 
funding by the invitation of other groups in the community being 
permitted to contribute to the fund itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that provincial bar societies might be 
canvassed.  Other civil rights groups that feel strongly that 
this fund should remain in place should be invited to contribute. 
I suggest that this would in fact enhance the present program. 
It would also recognize the importance of ensuring that this 
mechanism which is available for bringing forward significant 
test cases to clarify the charter law would continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party of Canada has always embraced this 
concept. We would put forward the suggestion that we could 
improve and build upon the present program. That is not to say 
there should be more money necessarily poured into it by 
government, but it should be open perhaps to other sources for 
funding.  Adapting the present program is a suggestion we put 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new charter law program might also differ from the actual 
federal Court Challenges Program in that it would be used to test 
federal laws not only under equality of language provisions of 
the charter, but also under fundamental freedoms provisions such 
as those of freedom of speech, conscience, religion and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There does not have to be a trend toward either a left wing or a 
right wing movement or challenges in the court.  It should 
certainly be open.  Again I refer back to the necessity of 
criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tightening the requirements and the criteria would be the way to 
combat some of the suggestions put forward by the mover of the 
motion that have led to the abuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way or a new way of administering the program would also 
have the double advantage of reducing federal funds without 
killing this existing program. The purpose here is not to 
encourage lengthy and costly court cases, but to build upon the 
charter law and the usefulness this program provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before approving any funding for a court case, the program would 
have to satisfy the issue of it being a new and significant issue 
and one of national significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the closing point I would like to make. 
Unfortunately there is an emergence in Canada where courts are 
being called upon ever more to delve into the area of policy.  It 
is extremely important that the parliamentary process and the 
sanctity of parliament in making and passing laws be enhanced and 
always be buttressed by those who arrive in this chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I would just say that the courts should be satisfied 
that they are not the exclusive defenders of the charter.  For 
the reasons I have set out, we cannot support this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
acknowledge your indication of the time and I want to make sure 
my colleague has the opportunity to sum up at the end of the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to follow on the comments of the hon. member who just 
spoke.  I found it interesting that he on the one hand calls for 
accountability through the democratic process and for policy to 
be shaped by the democratic process, yet intertwined in his talk 
is support for the Court Challenges Program.  I found a real 
inconsistency when we look at what is actually going on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My experience prior to coming to this great House was that I 
worked in a business environment and had some exposure to certain 
business practices.  One of the things that is brought to mind is 
the generally accepted accounting principles and practices that 
are norms and structures for the business environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are those principles put in place?  They are there to ensure 
that business processes are structured in such a way that there 
is not even the appearance of a conflict of interest or the 
appearance of misuse.  They protect the processes against any 
kind of misuse. The problem with the Court Challenges Program is 
it does not have that kind of protection for the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the new terms we have heard coined in Canada lately is 
the term of judicial activism.  I see that as the will of special 
interest groups using unelected judges to override the 
parliamentary or democratic process which if successful imposes 
the will of the minority on the majority. This is of particular 
concern to us with this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the charter of rights, and the hon. member who just spoke 
made mention of this, many social policy debates have shifted 
from the political arena and from the democratic process into the 
courts.  My concern and the concern of many of the members of my 
party is that special interest groups are imposing their 
particular positions on the will of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy matters should properly be handled not by taxpayer funded 
special interest groups presenting their cases before unelected 
judges but by common support and elected representatives debating 
and deciding these issues in parliament and legislatures.  This 
is the foundation of our country, the democratic process, yet we 
are seeing it overridden by programs like the Court Challenges 
Program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote an example.  The <I>Lawyers Weekly</I>, in a 1992 issue 
stated that 75% of the Women's Legal and Education Fund, LEAF for 
short, which is known as a feminist activist group, had 
interventions before the Supreme Court of Canada which were 
funded by the Court Challenges Program.  Many of their 
interventions were funded by this program.  The group LEAF 
intervened on a number of cases.  Borowski, Daigle, Lemay and 
Sullivan were all cases dealing with the laws around abortion. In 
these same cases another group, REAL Women of Canada, had also 
been granted intervenor status by the Supreme Court of Canada but 
they were refused funding by the Court Challenges Program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of where one sits on these particular cases or on 
this issue, there is a fairness issue here that is obvious.  Even 
if one is going to endorse this program one would think there 
would be some component of fairness.  But when one side of the 
argument is funded and not the other and it is done in such a 
heavily weighted fashion, there are clearly some significant 
problems with the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of examples which illustrate that certain 
groups with certain ideologies and certain opinions are being 
endorsed and funded by taxpayers.  I liken it to being forced to 
pay someone to beat you up with a stick.  That is what is 
happening to Canadian taxpayers thanks to this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is short so I will move to my concluding remarks 
to ensure that my colleague has time to summarize.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party's position is that we would like to ensure that the 
foundation which built this country, the democratic process that 
gives Canadians an opportunity to shape policy in the public 
arena but not through the court system is what is entrenched. 
Those are all detailed in our policy.  We stand behind them and 
that is what members will see in the House as we represent our 
positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I regret to interrupt the hon. member 
but his colleague has five minutes to reply.  The hon. member for 
Wanuskewin has five minutes, if he wishes to use it, and I should 
advise the House that if he speaks now he will close the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there has been a fair bit of a thread of fallacy that has run 
throughout the speeches that have been made today.  It is the 
fallacy that these cases would not be heard, that there is no way 
they would have their day in court if it were not for the Court 
Challenges Program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to state for the record and for the Canadian public that 
is blatantly false.  It is untrue.  These cases have been, can be 
and will continue to be heard in the courts quite aside from 
court challenges funding.  It is important for language rights 
and equality rights cases to be heard and they can in fact be 
heard without the Court Challenges Program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other means by which, as they say, poor dispossessed 
groups that do not have the resources can achieve resource to 
take issues to the courts.  There are wealthy individuals. There 
are foundations.  There is legal aid as well, which is a very 
good suggestion because it is based on a means test. If those 
people have a valid case they can have it brought forward and 
paid for by the taxpayer in that manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a major problem.  The Court Challenges 
Program in my view is not committed to equality as clarified by 
judges but rather to their own predetermined understanding of 
equality.  They already have this set idea of what is equality. 
Then they only allow in and shunt down the road those who meet 
the particular definition.  As we said before legal aid is one 
means.  There are others, as I have suggested, that could be 
explored as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Court Challenges Program funds interest groups, not 
individuals.  The hon member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar 
referred to Ailsa Warkinson, a lady out of Saskatoon, my home 
city, who had to link up with a group because she had not been 
corporally corrected and therefore was bringing her case forward 
on that basis.  Rather it is an interest group.  It is a group 
with a cause, with an agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also we mentioned before that there were groups.  I read from 
one group that makes the point that “there are many court cases 
in which we did not intervene or initiate simply because we 
lacked the funds”.  They did not have access to the Court 
Challenges Program because they did not meet the definition of 
equality of that biased group which sits on the Court Challenges 
Program board.  These other groups are cut off, shut out and not 
allowed in.  In every case we have been opposed by organizations 
which were funded by the Court Challenges Program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the myth of disadvantaged groups without access 
that have been made much of today.  There are groups that have 
wanted and needed the funding, that do not have the resources or 
do not have the reserves.  They have been put at a decided 
disadvantage because time and time again they have been turned 
away and not allowed any access to the Court Challenges Program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charter recognizes certain disadvantaged groups.  It is 
natural, the myth goes, that they should get funding to help them 
catch up to the rest of us.  If that were the case, both sides of 
the argument need to be heard.  Both sides need to be heard in 
court.  That remains.  We go to court presuming that one side is 
right.  Therefore there is a necessity in a democratic system, in 
a proper judicial setting, for both sides to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague before me mentioned we have had this great beast 
of judicial activism beginning to rear its head in Canada, this 
judicial imperialism, the end run around democracy, usurping the 
supremacy of parliament.  The Court Challenges Program is trying 
to re-engineer society and set the social policy agenda.  It is 
doing an end run around the elected representatives of the people 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If groups with social causes want to push an agenda, if they 
want to push a cause célèbre, they should put a candidate forward 
at election time.  They should get involved in the political 
process and push that agenda as hard as they want.  That is their 
right.  They should not attempt to do it by way of an end run 
around the courts, usurping the supremacy of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously I object to the Court Challenges Program.  I will 
attempt once again to seek unanimous consent of the House to have 
the foregoing motion before us deemed adopted and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
motion be deemed adopted and passed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is no unanimous consent.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>DEVCO 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
after rising in the House on March 16 to ask the government about 
the future plans for Devco I was attacked by the Minister of 
Natural Resources who, when asked by a fellow government member 
about the Liberal position on Devco, the Donkin mine and other 
issues of grave concern to the people of Cape Breton Island, 
resorted to the worst form of heckling and insult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was accused of not thinking of my constituents, but of trying 
to save the skin of the NDP.  Regardless of what the hon. member 
thought my motives to be, it was clear that I had no need to 
worry about saving the skin of my party, as we are all aware of 
the stunning defeat suffered by the Liberal government on March 
24 and of the NDP's rise to official opposition status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the minister and the House would also be interested to 
know that of the seats on Cape Breton Island that went NDP, the 
two with the biggest majorities are in the areas where coal 
mining has been the way of life for hundreds of years.  Those are 
the people who stood on March 24 and rejected the party that has 
hurt them and their communities, which has refused to listen and 
to speak honestly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that this latest political rejection of the Liberal Party 
will be noted by this government and we can now start a new era 
in relations between this federal administration and the people 
of Cape Breton, an era where justified and factually supported 
questions are no longer dismissed as fear mongering, where 
questions are answered instead of questioners being attacked, and 
where the people of my island are treated as equals with those 
from any part of this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that this new era will begin.  As the weeks pass I grow 
more and more concerned that the process of closing down the coal 
industry is continuing with increasing speed.  Since I last spoke 
on this issue, the international coal piers have been closed, 
shutting Devco coal off from the export market for at least two 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy for the government to comment on Devco's inability to 
make a profit, but it should also be critical when the crown 
corporation is cutting itself off from valuable future markets. 
While more and more miners are being placed on indefinite layoff, 
the latest Devco revelation comes in a letter I received this 
week from the tripartite task force on fires and explosions in 
coal mines that expresses grave concerns over the shutdown of the 
coal research lab in Sydney earlier this year.  The lab, which 
was urged to expand its activities in the report on the Westray 
disaster and whose necessity has been reinforced by the recent 
coal mine disasters across the former Soviet Union, was closed 
down despite objections from the industry and from the task 
force, which itself is a government funded body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government body questioning and condemning the actions 
of the government.  More than that, in a copy of a letter from 
1996 included with the pleas to restore funding to the research 
lab, the former chair of the task force talks of how he has been 
made aware of a government plan to shut down the lab if it cannot 
be privatized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The orderly shutdown of Devco continues.  The government 
continues to hide the truth.  Why is this government helping 
Devco to shut down its future by destroying the corporation's 
ability to develop new markets and new technologies?  I have 
asked this question so many times.  I hope you will indulge me 
one more time, Mr. Speaker.  I hope that the government will take 
advantage of the changed political landscape and start a new 
relationship based on open dialogue with the people of Cape 
Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government release its real plan for the future of 
Devco and come clean with Cape Bretoners? 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
my hon. colleague for her intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not her first intervention on this particular issue of 
an allegation of a secret plan to shut down Devco.  I am sure it 
will not be her last, for the simple reason that the hon. member 
has found considerable grief in being subjected to the worst form 
of heckling and insult by the Minister of Natural Resources in 
responding to the continuous litany of accusations that there is 
a privatization plan to terminate the operations of Devco. 
The minister has responded with what has been called the worst 
form of heckling and insult; that being, of course, the truth. 
But there is no such plan to terminate the operations of Devco. 
The hon. member may find that heckling and insulting, but that 
may be because the truth may sometimes foil a good story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story being perpetuated by the member is not very helpful to 
the operations of Devco, nor is it helpful to the management or 
to the orderly operations of this firm which is quite capably 
developing an economic opportunity for the people of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned with the hon. member's continual insistence that 
this strategy exists.  The secret cabinet document that was 
referred to has been found not to be a secret cabinet document at 
all.  Frankly, it does not exist.  The allegation, being quite 
false, is not very helpful to the workers of Devco.  I plead once 
again for the hon. member to cease and desist and to work with us 
to explore the truth for a change and to continue in supporting 
this corporation.
