</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-290, an act to amend the criminal 
code (breaking and entering). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise today on 
behalf of the constituents of Calgary East to reintroduce my 
private member's bill that would amend the criminal code to 
impose a two year minimum sentence for repeat offenders of break 
and enter crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Break and enter crime is not only a property offence.  It is a 
crime against a person.  It is a psychologically damaging crime, 
often leaving victims feeling personally violated and 
traumatized.  It has the potential to be a violent crime because 
every break and enter is potentially a home invasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a victims amendment to the criminal code because the 
result would be fewer victims by imposing a real deterrent on 
professional break and enter criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also cut what is a real source of revenue for 
career criminals and organized crime by breaking the cycle of 
proceeds of break and enter crime being used to finance other 
criminal activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts need a clear direction from parliament that sets out 
the concern Canadians about this very serious crime.  I welcome 
the support of my colleagues for this non-partisan initiative.

<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
this is kidney month I should like to present two petitions from 
people who are concerned about those who have kidney disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition is signed by hundreds of people from the 
Peterborough region who point out that kidney dialysis and 
transplantation have been valuable and continue to be useful, but 
that there are difficulties with dialysis treatments and that the 
rates of organ donation are not sufficient to meet the needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore they call upon parliament to work and support research 
toward the bioartificial kidney, which will eventually eliminate 
the need for both dialysis and transplantation for those 
suffering from kidney disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second petition is signed by many people in Peterborough and 
central Ontario who point out that kidney disease is a huge and 
growing problem, which they want us to note especially during 
kidney month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also point out that progress is being made in various 
treatments, but they call upon parliament to encourage the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research to explicitly include 
kidney research as one of the institutes in its system, that 
institute to be named the institute of kidney and urinary tract 
diseases.

Speaker, there are still people concerned about the renaming of 
Mount Logan.  My understanding is that this is no longer an 
issue, but I have recently received a petition that urges 
parliament to put on hold efforts to rename Mount Logan until 
such time as this and other suggestions concerning memorials to 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau have been properly assessed.

government neglect.  That which we will discuss today is 
certainly the most outrageous and offensive example of government 
interference and misconduct I have ever seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not tell the House that in August of last year the 
Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services initiated a program to replace our aging Sea 
King helicopters, something they had promised to do by the year 
2000 in their 1994 defence white paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not tell the House that the procurement process put in 
place has come under serious attack by stakeholders in the global 
aerospace industry.  I need not even tell the House that the 
majority of those now sitting on the government side were elected 
in 1993 on a promise to cancel a helicopter contract to replace 
the same Sea Kings still in use today, which cancellation cost 
taxpayers anywhere from $800 million to $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian armed forces are in need of our help.  Our men and 
women in uniform cannot come up here, as so many others do, with 
placards to protest the injustices committed against them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These people need safe equipment capable of doing the difficult 
jobs that we all assign to them.  We ask the sons and daughters 
of our Canadian families to lay their lives on the line for each 
and every one of us in the Chamber.  We send them to every corner 
of the globe.  We in the House therefore have the great 
responsibility and awesome duty to afford them all the protection 
and security that we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That protection will come with cost, costs that can either be 
financial or even political in nature.  I stand here today to 
tell everyone that the government is so worried about paying the 
political costs of replacing the Sea Kings that it has distorted 
the tendering process to undermine competition so that it is not 
embarrassed one more time.  The government has already decided 
who is going to get the helicopter replacement contract.  That is 
very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about political trades between this government and 
the governments in Europe.  I could talk about industrial 
exchanges, a helicopter contract there for a manufacturing plant 
here, but let me for the moment just share a little story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last May, a caucus colleague of mine, someone who now sits on 
the government side, came to me with a conspiracy theory.  He 
said the government was going to award the Sea King replacement 
contract to a company called Eurocopter.  As history and 
<I>Hansard</I> will record, my colleague at that time and I rose 
in the House and called on the Minister of National Defence to 
deny the story.  He did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stood and told us “all that sounds like a lot of 
nonsense to me.”  However, within months, within three short 
months to be exact, the minister stood in another place and 
announced a procurement process so strict that it, to the eyes of 
many, eliminated all of the competition but Eurocopter.  The 
minister and his colleagues produced a document.  To be specific, 
it was a letter of interest addressed to the aerospace industry. 
That document and the problems it contained is the reason I stand 
here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter of interest showed for the first time that it would 
be “the lowest price compliant” bid that would be chosen. 
First, it means that no matter what aircraft competes, even if it 
is only of marginal ability, as long as it meets the statement of 
requirement and is the cheapest helicopter, it will be selected. 
If an operationally marginal competitor is even $1 cheaper than a 
helicopter with 100% more operational capacity, then saving a 
dollar will win that contract.  That is a disgrace.  All this 
despite the fact the treasury board guidelines 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 
state clearly that government procurement should be done on the 
best value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That document opened the door to a process with certification 
deadlines and technical requirements that penalized some of the 
most respected helicopter manufacturers in the world.  It opened 
the door to a procurement process so alien to both logic and 
reason that major industry stakeholders took one look at it and 
scratched their heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House knows that one company was so disadvantaged by the 
letter of interest that it was compelled to take the matter 
before the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, and now the 
Federal Court of Appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are companies that are beginning to say that the process 
is so flawed and so biased that they might not even waste their 
efforts making a bid.  However the process did not hurt all 
companies.  The only group that is in no clear way disadvantaged 
by the current competition rule is Eurocopter and its Cougar MK2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the process itself.  In their exalted wisdom, the 
powers that be on the government side chose to split the 
contract.  Never have we seen this done before.  Instead of a 
single contract there will be a process to obtain a basic vehicle 
and a second process to obtain the vital mission system. 
In both cases, even with different possible contracts for 
maintenance and upkeep, there is no question that this will mean 
increased cost.

</I></B></P><P align=left>So that the everyday ordinary citizen knows what the government 
is planning to do, it is like saying to Canadians that they 
should go out and buy a car with no air conditioning, no radio, 
no speedometer, no tires and then go out a second time and buy 
all those things and have them installed at a later time.  That 
is exactly what the government is doing with the helicopters.  It 
is foolishness for certain.  Worst still it is foolishness with a 
political motive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the proper tendering process was used, the worst case 
scenario for the defence minister is that he would have to walk 
outside these doors and announce that the company that won the 
bidding process fair and square is the very company that this 
government snubbed seven years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows it made a big mistake in 1993.  It is now 
willing to manipulate the bidding process so that it is anything 
but fair.  Therefore, it will not have to give the contract to 
the company that can replace these aging Sea Kings and do what is 
right for our men in the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do Canadians know that there is a special cabinet committee 
through which all decisions related to this process must pass?  I 
do not think the members know about this.  Do Canadians know that 
the special cabinet committee is so shrouded in secrecy that it 
is difficult to know who is actually making the decisions?  Do 
Canadians know that with the help of this committee the 
government ignored the recommendations of the defence department 
to avoid the political suicide that a fair process might entail? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are way beyond giving money to golf courses and hotels here. 
This is not a little problem that the cabinet can sweep under the 
carpet.  We are talking about billions and billions of taxpayer 
dollars.  We are talking about corruption and abuse of power at 
the highest levels.  We are talking about the government 
sacrificing its own rules and guidelines to force an outcome that 
does not make it look bad.  If things are not changed we will end 
up with a helicopter less capable than the aged Sea Kings we have 
had in use for decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am using the strongest words I know to express the anger and 
shame I feel.  I am using the boldest language allowed in the 
Chamber to warn Canadians of the deceit and dishonesty that we 
have discovered.  I say let us do the right thing.  Let us 
correct the injustice where we find it.  Let us do what we were 
elected to do.  If we do not we will dishonour those who came 
before us and those who defend us from evil if we do not.

the member referred to a hypothetical situation where a bidder 
would bring forward a proposal with 100% more functionality for 
$1 more in cost than another and that it would be shameful if the 
government chose the cheaper one when for an extra dollar it 
could get 100% more functionality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member feel that it is appropriate for a bidder to 
provide a proposal which meets the requirements the government 
laid out in its request for proposal, or should there be an 
investment in functionality well beyond the requirements which 
clearly would require more maintenance, more after costs and 
probably more development?  In fact, the development would 
probably not be complete in time for the certification time 
frame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member saying to the House that we should spend extra 
money to get functionality which is not required? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, with respect to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I applaud the member for Saint John for her very 
passionate delivery and support for the military.  I am a member 
of another opposition party, but for some time she has fought for 
the military's benefit in both procurement and quality of life 
issues.  I commend her on her delivery.  She also knows some of 
the problems that have arisen with this procurement process.  She 
has spelled it out to those across the floor.  They are 
shortchanging the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask her to speak a little about the procurement process. 
She implied through her presentation that there was something 
wrong with the changing of the statement of requirement on that 
particular procurement for the maritime helicopter.  She alluded 
to some of this in her reference to the letter of interest. There 
was a process that took place prior to that letter being 
delivered which dealt with getting the military to say it would 
change its mind from the EH-101, which is the helicopter that we 
know will be suitable for this climate, to something far less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member talk about the process prior to that letter of 
interest being delivered? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, our military people have 
already written a letter stating that the letter of interest is 
political suicide.  It is not good for the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the top ranks telling us it is wrong.  However, they 
have been told to stay out of it because that private little 
cabinet committee is making all the decisions.  That is not the 
way we function in the House of Commons.  That is not what we 
should do for our men and women in the military. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to participate in a debate on such a crucial issue. 
I congratulate my colleague from Saint John for bringing it to 
the House.  This is an issue that has been discussed for years in 
parliament, and certainly in the country, for a number of 
reasons.  It is mainly because we are proud Canadians.  One of 
the agencies that causes us to be so proud is our armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ask people to defend us we expect that we will provide 
them with the best possible equipment to do the job.  We send 
hockey teams onto the ice.  For many years Canada, as a proud 
nation, has watched these teams.  They have been made up of 
people from many nationalities who live all over the country. 
They have worn the Canadian red and white sweater with pride 
while representing us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who are a little older will perhaps remember the 
1972 series that finished up in Russia.  Undoubtedly each of us 
can vividly recall the day when Paul Henderson scored the final 
goal to win the series for Canada. 
All of us felt very proud because these people were representing 
our nation.  They were representing our nation in combat but it 
was a sports combat.  For those of us who remember the series, we 
might say it was more than a sports combat, it was an 
international combat.  However, what it did was open the doors 
for friendlier feelings between us and other nations, especially 
Russia.  We showed that we were well prepared, well equipped and 
we could do the job.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we send our armed forces into combat where, 
instead of the high stick that might knock out a tooth or cause a 
few stitches here and there or the odd concussion that goes with 
hockey, we are asking them to put their lives on the line.  Not 
only did we do it during the great wars and other international 
conflicts, but we do it all the time, even in our peacekeeping 
efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we send out our forces, our representatives, those who go to 
the front lines for us, we do not know from day to day what kind 
of conflict they will be in.  It is our duty to make sure that 
they have the best equipment available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear stories about our armed forces today, how they are 
not properly equipped, how the funding provided is so little that 
they are living on the borders of poverty, how can we expect 
anyone to give their all, which is what we ask of them, if we 
treat them in such a manner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A typical example is the helicopter issue that we are talking 
about in the motion.  What makes Canadians so upset is not the 
fact that we are debating whether or not we are providing them 
with the best helicopters.  Unfortunately, under the present 
tender calls, we will probably not get the best and that is a 
major concern.  Canadians are perturbed by the fact that we have 
been waiting so long for the machines.  Canadians are also 
perturbed by the petty politics that have been played this last 
seven or eight years over this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key planks in this government's platform, which is 
now cowering under pressure, is to provide helicopters.  The 
helicopters would have been provided long ago if it had supported 
the original idea to purchase the Sea Kings.  In the 1993 
election, the then Tory government was ridiculed for the 
excessive amount of money it planned to spend on helicopters. It 
was told that it should be able to provide helicopters at a 
cheaper cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard, in a very sneaky manner during the last election, this 
government talk about the need to provide helicopters and how it 
could be done much cheaper than the Tory government was going to 
do.  Unfortunately, people sometimes talk in half truths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone today wanted to buy a car for $20,000 and I promised 
I could sell the person a car for $15,000, what I would not be 
telling the person is that my car is not as good as the one that 
he or she intends to buy.  If someone wanted buy a fleet of cars 
for a million dollars and I told that person that I could sell 
him or her a fleet of cars for three-quarters of a million 
dollars, what I would not be telling him or her is that the 
number in his or her fleet is much greater than the number in the 
fleet that I am talking about.  It is very easy to confuse people 
if we do not look at the minute details. 
The people of Canada certainly have been confused and deceived 
for years by this government in relation to the provision of 
equipment for the armed forces. This goes right back to 1978, 
when it talked about the need to replace the Sea King.  That was 
23 years ago.  We are talking about replacing equipment needed by 
the people who serve us, who represent us on the first lines. 
What an insult to the intelligence of Canadians.  What an insult 
to the people in our armed forces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the Mulroney government approved a replacement of the 
Labrador search and rescue and Sea King maritime helicopter fleet 
with a common helicopter EH-101.  The new fleet was ordered at a 
cost of $4.3 billion, which is what started the big opposition: 
the cost of helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look now at what we are getting, we find we do not know 
what we are getting.  That is the problem.  If we knew what we 
were getting perhaps we could have some intelligent commentary on 
it.  However, it would not be from us in here.  I doubt that 
there are many people in this whole assembly who know very much 
about the workings of a helicopter.  Some might pretend, and 
perhaps we do have some people who have spent some time in the 
field as pilots, mechanics or whatever, but I would suggest that 
very few really know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, whether we know anything about it or not, when we find 
out that the package will come in four different unrelated 
components, we sort of wonder what we will get when it is all put 
together.  That is a major concern.  By the time we do something 
like that, put it together, take the final product and divide the 
numbers into the total cost, it will be very interesting to see 
the unit price compared to the unit price of the original 
suggestion made by the Tory government back in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call upon the government to eliminate the 
barriers in the Letter of Interest to the aerospace industry, 
which impede a fair and open Maritime Helicopter Project, and 
that maritime procurement be conducted on a “best value to the 
Canadian taxpayers” basis, in accordance with the Treasury Board 
guidelines.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the motion is good enough because when we ask

Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
listening to the debate on the opposition motion today I am 
hearing a moderate amount of negativity.  I am puzzled where that 
might come from, but I understand that partisanship lends itself 
to creation of negativity from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, one should note that the armed forces and our 
government, on behalf of Canadians, have successfully gone 
through a procurement of a search and rescue helicopter, which is 
a fairly sophisticated procurement initiative.  I think the 
initiative was very successful.  I believe we are on the verge of 
accepting the first of those search and rescue helicopters to 
replace the existing older search and rescue helicopters, the 
Chinooks, that are now in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government has, in my view, successfully gone through a 
procurement initiative to obtain the search and rescue 
helicopter, that process being almost complete now, why is it 
that members opposite would just presume or assume that a second 
initiative to replace the Sea Kings, the maritime helicopter, 
could turn out to be an alleged mess?  I will not use some of the 
other negative words, but how could the government have suddenly 
taken a turn to go so wrong, when in my view it has appeared to 
operate so well in procuring the new search and rescue 
helicopter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Madam Speaker, when we talk about 
conflict or wars, one of the words that we always hear is 
brainwashing.  It seems that the members opposite have been very 
well brainwashed in relation to the procedures that we are 
dealing with here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns us and I am sure Canadians is not that we are 
seeking information in relation to the replacement of the 
helicopters. It is the matter of the rules and restrictions that 
are being placed on them to prohibit the best type of helicopter 
that would replace what we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we should be asking why some of these restrictions are 
in place.  That might be something we will follow up at another 
time.  The bottom line is that if we are going to have the best, 
then we should have the opportunity to get the best, not a 
bargain basement price where we usually get what we pay for.

Madam Speaker, I have listened to the member for St. John's West 
on this very important initiative, the procurement of the 
maritime helicopter.  His party knows the history, more than any 
other party in the House, about what it took to bring that 
procurement up to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have been trying to pick a maritime helicopter for 
over 30 years.  The Conservative Party initiated the procurement 
process to purchase this helicopter.  The military went through a 
long process in picking the best helicopter for the conditions 
that it would be faced with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member, what does he think the helicopter should be 
like, given the fact that it was his party that chose it?  Could 
he also tell us why it was chosen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Madam Speaker, the answer is very 
simple.  If we are going to send our people to the front lines, 
we should provide them with the best equipment that is available.

ones that would cost $4.3 billion.  That was opposed, as hon.

because the Tory government thought those machines were the best 
at that time.  All we ask now is that the current government, in 
purchasing equipment for our armed forces, buy what is best for

the contract for the purchase of the helicopters needed by the 
Department of National Defence for its maritime operations may

manage the purchase process. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure hon. members on all sides of the House that the process 
will be fair, open, transparent and competitive.  At the end of

billion can be invested in other worthwhile initiatives including 
the new social justice initiative announced in the Speech from

armed forces.  The new helicopters will be equipped with 
integrated mission systems designed to meet needs specific to 
maritime operations.  This state of the art equipment will give the 
men and women of the Canadian armed forces the tools they need 
to do their work better in demanding often dangerous operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after the maritime helicopter project was announced, 
last August, the government released a letter of interest to 
inform businesses of our intentions and our general requirements 
and to discover their interest in the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter of interest also set out the purchasing strategy 
planned, and the facts were confirmed. The project would 
comprise two separate contracts: the first would pertain to 
basic vehicles and the second, integrated mission systems.  Long 
term service support will be an element of both contracts. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter of interest had another goal, and that was to 
initiate a dialogue with the industry.  I am pleased to report 
that we have been successful in that regard.  Many of the 
companies that responded to the letter of interest have also 
provided helpful feedback on our statement of operational 
requirements and procurement strategy. 
We will respond to the comments and take the views of potential 
bidders into account as the project unfolds over coming weeks and 
months.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making is that it is very much an open and 
transparent process.  Industry interaction is critical for large 
projects such as this one.  The release of the letter of interest 
was a first step in our effort to encourage a dialogue with 
industry. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our next steps will be to announce which companies have 
expressed an interest in becoming the prime contractor for the 
helicopters or the mission systems, or both, and meet the 
criteria set in the letter of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately—and this is very important—no Canadian company makes 
helicopters that comply with the requirements of the maritime 
helicopter project. This means that the basic model will be 
provided by a foreign supplier. 
We think that several foreign companies can meet our needs and 
we anticipate that a large number of companies will compete for 
these contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for mission systems, I am pleased to say that Canadian 
companies can provide such systems and that some have expressed 
an interest in that regard. It is perfectly possible that a 
Canadian company will be awarded that contract. We also expect 
Canadian companies to bid for the two subcontracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some wonder why it is necessary to have two different calls for 
tenders to buy helicopters and mission systems. 
The reason is very simple. We believe that, by using separate 
calls for tenders, the state will get the helicopters and 
services that it needs, and the necessary long term in-service 
support, at the best possible price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That approach will also allow a larger number of companies to 
bid, since using a single contract would have the effect of 
eliminating many Canadian companies that are interested in 
becoming the prime contractor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of general interest I confirm for hon. members that 
the maritime helicopter project is exempt from the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, from the WTO agreement on government 
procurement, and from any restriction or requirement under 
comprehensive land claims agreements.  However the agreement on 
internal trade will apply to the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned a moment ago, the letter of interest released 
last August has triggered a dialogue with industry.  To 
facilitate further industry interaction, the project management 
office for the maritime helicopter project has established a 
website to serve as the principal means of communicating with the 
industry.  The website will be a vital source of information for 
potential prime contractors and others interested in the project. 
We plan to use the site to make key technical requirements known 
to all bidders as early as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toward this end, over the next few weeks the project management 
office will post draft specifications and other documents on the 
web that will eventually form part of the formal request for 
proposals. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The progressive issuing of provisional RFPs will enable 
interested companies to examine and comment on various aspects 
of the maritime helicopter project.  We will be able to make 
changes to the technical requirements or other features of the 
project based on their comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This dialogue will increase the likelihood that helicopter and 
mission system hardware will be compliant with project 
requirements, and will also make it possible to confirm that 
interested companies can reasonably meet the government's 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interested companies will have ample opportunity to examine the 
provisional specifications for the base helicopter and to make 
comments in this regard over a two-month period, after which we 
will be launching an obligatory prequalification process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prequalification process is unique in this project.  In 
fact, it is the first time we have used it for a project of this 
magnitude.  We want to avoid having tenders rejected because 
they are non-compliant technically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preparing a tender is very expensive and the government must 
work together with potential suppliers to keep the risks of 
non-compliance to a minimum. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this in mind, the prequalification process will be 
conducted in advance of the formal submission of bids. 
Prequalification will largely focus on the hardware aspect of the 
bid based on the draft specifications.  Separate prequalification 
processes will be conducted for the basic helicopter and 
integrated mission system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping with the overall approach being used for the project, 
the prequalification process will involve a dialogue with 
industry.  Potential prime contractors will be expected to 
provide a level of detail we would normally get in formal bids. 
The technical information provided by each potential contractor 
will be examined to ensure it conforms with the requirements set 
out by the Department of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This interactive approach will give industry an opportunity to 
address any concerns we might have with its technical proposals 
before it submits formal bids, thereby reducing the risk of 
receiving non-compliant bids.  Potential bidders who have not 
achieved the prequalification status at least 30 days in advance 
of the close of bids will be declared non-compliant.  Their bids 
will not be considered as part of the formal tendering process. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to repeat that the prequalification process will 
focus primarily on the technical aspects for each contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will still be possible to declare a bid non-compliant if a 
company does not meet the other requirements set out in the RFP, 
such as those having to do with the statement of work, 
management of the program, funding, and industrial and regional 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should also know that the inclusion of service support, 
which is a separate component in each contract, is unique to 
this project.  Comprehensive maintenance and support services 
for the helicopters and the mission systems will be required on 
an ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government anticipates that this service support will be 
required for a period of approximately 20 years.  For each 
contract, this component will include an option to progressively 
increase service support up until the end of the helicopters' 
life cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Service support, which is included in each RFP, will ensure that 
we obtain a quality product, since the supplier will have to 
assume long term responsibility for what he is delivering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also allow the government to seek the maximum industrial 
and regional benefits for each contract. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members no doubt have questions about the timing of 
different stages of the procurement process.  Our procurement 
plan is to ensure the formal RFP for the helicopter contract in 
the fall.  The RFP will have a three month closing date followed 
by a two month evaluation process leading to the selection of the 
successful contractor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to sign a contract for a basic helicopter as early 
as possible in 2002, after which we will move quickly to the 
issue of requesting formal proposals for the mission system.  As 
hon. members can appreciate, the two RFPs cannot proceed 
simultaneously, as potential bidders for the mission system will 
need to know which helicopter is to be purchased in order to 
develop a proper integration plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The request for proposals for both contracts will set out strict 
evaluation criteria for price, technical compliance, contractual 
terms and conditions, and industrial regional benefits. 
Specifically with regard to industrial regional benefits our goal 
is to ensure that Canadian suppliers receive maximum benefits for 
both contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with the principles used for previous procurements, 
we will be seeking industrial regional benefits equivalent to the 
value of the contracts for both the helicopter and the integrated 
mission system.

prime contractor submitting the lowest proposal that complies 
with all the terms.  This proposal is to include the airframe, 
the modifications, the related modifications to the ship and 
service support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the mission systems, the contract will be awarded 
to the prime contractor whose proposal is the lowest.  This 
proposal is to include the costs of the mission package of the 
maritime helicopters and service support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the Minister of National Defence, informed the 
House that the maritime helicopters were the first priority of 
his department in equipment procurement.  Worth nearly $2.9 
billion, this proposed purchase is also the largest under my 
department's management at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My department is the largest procurement organization in Canada. 
We have vast experience in the management of major government 
supply projects, including the purchase of defence materiel.  I 
can therefore assure the House that my department is able to 
carry the maritime helicopter project to a successful 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want also to assure my hon. colleagues that the transparent 
and competitive process we have put in place will ensure that 
all those tendering will be treated fairly, that taxpayers' 
money will be carefully invested and that, finally, the purchase 
of these maritime helicopters will meet Canada's needs for many 
years to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, we 
have an access response from DND that states that the maritime 
helicopter program office in DND never initiated the 
recommendation to split the maritime helicopter program and make 
purchases based on lowest price compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all government departments must agree before it leaves 
cabinet, public works recommendations had to be the same as DND. 
DND did not agree on what was being proposed by the Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services and the Minister of National 
Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister please tell us why it is going in this 
direction?  Furthermore, how could they possibly at this time 
enter into an agreement?  In New Brunswick the Learn Stream 
company, the president and CEO of Lockheed Martin Canada, has 
already signed a memorandum of understanding with them.  I 
thought we had not made a decision yet.  Why are we out signing 
agreements with companies, such as the one in Fredericton, in my 
province, that are in pursuit of the federal government's $2.8 
billion maritime helicopter program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes the need to secure the very best in 
training systems and the Learn Stream expertise in the 
development of custom courseware and learning technologies, helps 
to fulfil this requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has already entered into agreements with 
companies and yet we are supposed to be discussing who gets the 
contract.  I have never seen this done before.  I am sure it has 
never happened in the House before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not know where 
the hon. member gets her information but definitely she has it 
all wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in August it was the Minister of Finance.  I said, if 
they would have listened to my speech, that I was at the side of 
the Minister of National Defence when he announced the 
procurement, strategy and intention of the government.  This was 
a government decision.  It was not a decision by the Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services or the Minister of National 
Defence.  The government stands behind this decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the second part of the member's question, I do not 
know where she got the information but there is no agreement with 
any company.  We sent a letter of interest.  We got proposals and 
we opened dialogue and discussions.  There is no signed agreement 
with anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really surprised and shocked to see that while we are going 
through the process, the hon. member has decided to fight about 
what company should get the contract.  It is unfair since we have 
an open process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I certainly listened to the minister carefully 
because I too had some questions on the way this particular 
procurement initiative has been set up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly he pointed out that there would be two contracts left: 
one for the airframe, basically the helicopter airframe, and the 
other one for the mission kit.  Is that not correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because there are two contractors, who will be the prime 
contractor?  Will it be the Government of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the mission kit does not quite fit into the airframe, or if 
something has to be adjusted, holes cut in the frame or whatever, 
who will be liable for that if it does not work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will be liable if one contractor does not like the way the 
other contractor configured a certain part of the airframe or 
vice versa?  Will the government then have to come and intervene? 
Why is there not a prime contractor and why was it not let? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know for a fact that the government was advised not to do it 
this way but it went ahead and did it anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B>  Madam Speaker, first, the reason 
for making two contracts is that we wanted to have more 
competition.  This will give more companies, especially more 
Canadian companies, the possibility to participate in this major 
procurement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there will be a primary contractor.  The primary 
contractor will be, according to the letter of interest that we 
put forward and received comments on and to which we will 
respond, the integrated mission control contractor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this industry, companies make associations with each other. 
Why have an open competition process when these companies can 
make agreements among themselves for the benefit of the Canadian 
taxpayer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are doing it this way.  I am surprised again how 
they take a pre-position for one company when there are so many 
companies interested in the project. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, from what the minister just said, 
and I say this with all due respect, the reality is that this is 
simple nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that this contract was split to exclude one 
particular company, the company that had the original EH-101.  If 
the government decided that possibly that company would have been 
the most successful bidder today, then we would be asking the 
government why it cancelled the contract in 1993 in the first 
place.  That is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the following question for the minister.  When the 
initial tender process for the helicopters went out, it stated 
that it was “mandatory” that it be completed by 2005.  Now we 
have word that it has been changed to read that it would be 
“preferred” to have the helicopter replaced by 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the minister please explain the change? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B>  Madam Speaker, first, this process 
does not exclude anybody.  To the contrary, it includes everybody 
to compete.  If the Cormorant wants to compete, it can compete. 
It is very good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This procurement strategy is to make sure that Canadians get the 
best for their tax dollars and that they get the best equipment 
the defence needs.  The government cancelled the contract because 
it does not need to spend so much money.  This strategy will save 
Canadian taxpayers $1.5 billion that we can invest in health, in 
social justice and other things that Canadians need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  My question was quite clear.  I asked why the change in 
the wording of the contract from mandatory to preferred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  That is not a point 
of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the distinguished member for Saint John mentioned in her 
speech that one would never buy a motor vehicle without the 
frame, the tires, the transmission and the air conditioning. 
That struck a chord with me being a car dealer for 18 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out that the Ford Motor Company just announced that 
it has had so much trouble separating the contract for regular 
cars and police equipped cars that it has come together with its 
contractor to produce one package.  It will now have one package 
for electronics, navigation and communications, with which police 
cars are equipped.  It has all come together because there was no 
accountability.  Nobody was ever held responsible if there was a 
defect or a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister separate the air frame from the mission 
package on helicopters when he knows that private industry has 
proven this to be a defective approach? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B>  Madam Speaker, we had fruitful 
discussions after the letter of interest was sent out to the 
industry.  The way this procurement would go ahead is that, 
first, we would have the competition for procurement of the basic 
helicopter.  Once that competitive process is over and we have 
chosen a base helicopter, the other competition will start. In 
the second competition the industry will now know the model of 
helicopter we will have chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very sophisticated industry and an industry that works 
with each other.  We have been seeing consortiums on purchases of 
this nature around the world.  Why can consortiums not be within 
the competitive process for the taxpayers' benefit?  Why do 
multinationals always have to always get the benefit instead of 
Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I should point out that I will be sharing my time 
with my colleague from Vancouver Island North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I jump into the discussion on the Sea King replacement, I 
would like to begin by thanking all the people in my riding for 
the valiant effort they put forward in my successful re-election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very appreciative of the democratic process.  I saw it in 
full action in my riding for eight months, although it was almost 
a year if we include the election.  A lot of campaigning went on 
during the nomination process and my membership reached 15,000, 
the largest membership in Canada.  I had 10,000 constituents who 
came out to the polls for my nomination.  It was very 
significant.  I am very grateful for their involvement in my 
nomination and election.  My election was rather like a cakewalk 
after the nomination.  My deepest gratitude goes to those people 
who participated and helped out so much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now go on to the Sea Kings, which has been an issue for 
quite some time.  Discussions and efforts to replace the Sea 
Kings, the maritime helicopter, have been going on for over 30 
years.  It began in the early seventies and we are no closer now 
than we were back then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue was studied at length under the Conservative 
government of the day and a decision was made, I believe, in 1992 
to replace the helicopter and give our military personnel 
something they could use, feel safe in and something for which 
they would be proud. 
Everyone in the House knows what unfortunately happened to that 
project in the 1993 election.  A decision was made by the Liberal 
government and the Prime Minister of the day to shut down that 
project.  I have never heard a good excuse as to why it was shut 
down.  There have been excuses rendered, but I said a good 
excuse.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had an opportunity to see a lot of our equipment, as have 
other members on both sides of the House.  They have had the 
opportunity to look at the equipment our military personnel have 
to work with.  The Sea King is one of the oldest helicopters and 
is definitely in need of replacement.  Its limitations jeopardize 
those who use the equipment as well as those who may depend on 
our personnel for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very frustrated given the fact that we have sat in the 
opposition in the House since 1993.  We have pushed the 
government to bring about closure on this issue and give our 
troops some good equipment.  It just was not to be.  It is still 
not to be for several years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how much longer our Sea Kings will last or how 
many more lives will be lost.  Lives have been lost by personnel 
using this equipment.  It is an unnecessary jeopardy of members 
of our military personnel.   They work in a most unusual 
environment.  Even with good equipment they sometimes lose their 
lives.  We saw that happen not too long ago, but to jeopardize 
lives unnecessarily by allowing them to continue to use old 
equipment is another matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the last election we submitted a policy paper dealing 
with military issues called “Canada Strong and Free”.  It makes 
mention of the need for having proper equipment.  There are 
experienced people who know what proper equipment means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One section in that pamphlet included an idea that we wanted to 
put forward in an effort to try to fill a need in our military. 
It said that we should have corvettes with helicopters on them as 
a means of patrolling and as a means of readiness.  Our booklet 
was circulated to ex-military personnel and to the military. Many 
experts had a good look at it.  The feedback indicated that it 
was not a very good idea to have a corvette ship with helicopters 
on it because of the size of a corvette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experienced personnel said that we were crazy if we thought they 
would go back to corvettes in the North Atlantic, the roughest 
seas in the world.  It would not be a suitable way to spend 
taxpayer money.  That came from an expert.  We are certainly open 
to changes and suggestions.  I think in this case that is exactly 
what must be done.  The experts know the environment in which the 
equipment will be operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Eurocopter happens to be the choice of the government on 
the other side, it is a dreadful mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Where are they? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  I hear the hon. member.  Where are they? 
That helicopter is no bigger or more powerful than the Sea King 
that is operating on our frigates now, which is 40 years old.  It 
has no more capacity than our present equipment.  Why are we 
replacing a helicopter considered too old and unable to meet the 
conditions of the day with something almost comparable except 
somewhat newer?  That is the only difference.  Why would that be 
happening?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have question for the government across the way.  Is it 
because back in 1993 the Prime Minister decided to cancel that 
cadillac project, as he called it, at the expense of the military 
and for the benefit of gaining votes?  Is that the reason it was 
cancelled and is no longer being considered? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty years of progress in trying to come up with the right 
piece of equipment is finally reached, and what happens?  It 
becomes political.  The member across the way mentioned something 
about partisanship.  I do not know how much more partisan we can 
get than ripping something away that is legitimately needed, in 
this case by our military, because of a political advantage that 
might be gained.  I think there is something cynical about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the past.  Today is the present.  Since that time there 
has been an effort to change the statement of requirements so 
that something less or something other than the one that was 
cancelled back in 1993 could possibly be selected.  How can we go 
about doing that?  How can we change the statement of 
requirements on which the military spent years and many millions 
of dollars researching?  All of a sudden we will change it into 
something else and expect the military to support everything we 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk to the rank and file in the military.  As members 
across the way will know, those who were part and parcel of the 
project know that this is not what is required.  They had already 
made their selection and now the political masters will make them 
change it and turn it all around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is up.  There is a real need to take the procurement 
processes out of the hands of politicians until the final level 
of negotiation is done.  Unfortunately that is not the direction 
in which the government is going. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member suggests that decisions have already been taken.  That 
could not be further from the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister laid out for the House, there is an ongoing 
extensive process where the letters of interest were sent to 
create a dialogue with the industry to determine what its 
situation.  We found that the helicopter market is much more 
mature, much more developed than it was back when the situation 
was dealt with by the former government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It raises a question about procurement as a process.  Public 
Works and Government Services Canada provides professional 
procurement services on behalf of all government departments and 
agencies.  In regard to this very important procurement that has 
been presented to us by the Department of National Defence, our 
objectives are to meet the specifications of the client, being 
DND.  That is precisely what we are doing.  The process is to 
satisfy the specifications required by the Department of National 
Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public works and government services does not play around with 
the specifications.  By creating a dialogue with the industry we 
ensure that the process we go through will meet those standards. 
We want value.  We want the lowest cost for the taxpayer and we 
want to meet the specifications.  We do not want anything more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister indicated, by splitting the request for proposal 
into two pieces, one for the frame and one for the mission 
system, it is quite frankly an opportunity to take advantage of 
the mature marketplace that the helicopter industry and the 
aerospace industry provide.  I hope the member will inform 
himself that there are many more interested parties now than 
there ever were before.

specifications of DND and the lowest cost for meeting those 
specifications? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is a good question. 
Do I have a problem?  If the process were as open as the 
government claims it to be I would have no problem, but that has 
not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just have to go back a few years, during which time an effort 
was made on the part of the government under the Deputy Prime 
Minister, the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council 
Office to change the statement of requirements on the maritime 
helicopter from what the EH-101 specified, or the military 
specified, into something more suitable for the frontline over 
there.  Is that open and transparent?  No, it is not open and 
transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised a good point.  There is a need to consult.  We 
have to change the overall procurement process, not just in the 
area of the military.  I know other countries have done so.  They 
have included industry.  They have included the public, the 
government and the opposition where there was a unified voice 
coming out of the house to do what was best for the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have that now.  It has become a very partisan issue. 
The military has been chopped this way and that way because it is 
easy to chop it.  It is not a constituency that is all lumped 
together in one spot.  It is easy to pick on.  It is easy to 
knock down.  It is easy to change the whole way of thinking 
because of that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not agreement in the House over what is best for our 
military.  It has become very partisan and I have to say it is 
because of that side of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern

should not be advocating one company over another in the House. 
We should be advocating a clear, open and transparent contract so 
that all companies have fair bids on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my earlier question to the minister of public works I said a 
particular company was being excluded from the contract because 
of the way the tender process was set up.  I did not mention the 
name of the company.  The minister mentioned the name of the 
company, which was Cormorant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This obviously smacks and reeks of political interference. Could 
the hon. member from the Alliance Party elaborate on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member raises the crux 
of the whole matter.  It shows how partisan the House has become 
over issues that are beneficial to the overall country and in 
this case to the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has involved meetings behind closed doors to change things 
that should never have been changed.  It has defeated and 
frustrated the efforts of experts and those who use this 
equipment to the point where a malaise has set in.  It has been 
detrimental to our country and to our military.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the budget for the Department of National Defence was 
more than $12 billion.  It had 85,000 members.  The budget was 
slashed by the government to $9 billion.  It is now at $10 
billion and its ranks have shrunk to 58,000.  This week there are 
noises from the government that it will add another $600 million, 
basically for deserved wage increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the value of the dollar and the 11 year timeframe, is it 
any wonder our military has been asked to do more and more with 
less and less?  Throughout this whole episode since 1993, the 
government has been paying lip service to supporting the military 
when in fact it has been callous and irresponsible in its 
actions, particularly in terms of equipping our armed forces 
personnel for the jobs at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a candidate in the federal election in 1993.  How well I 
remember the Liberals making a huge issue of the EH-101 
cancellation.  They never suggested we did not need helicopters. 
They simply suggested it was the wrong one.   Where are we now, 
eight years later?  Not a single maritime helicopter replacement 
for the Sea Kings has yet been ordered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Search and rescue helicopters will be delivered to the west 
coast.  We will have five in Comox this year and we will have the 
operational training centre in Comox.  Search and rescue 
capabilities will be filled over the next year and a half, none 
too soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sea Kings are ancient.  They are a national embarrassment. 
The $600 million paid to cancel the 43 Cormorant helicopters 
ordered in 1993 was a problem at the time.  Cancellation was a 
problem because Canada really needed new helicopters then.  We 
need them now more than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The search and rescue helicopters ordered in December 1997 are 
the same helicopters that the government cancelled in 1994 at 
great cost to the taxpayer.  the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of National Defence questions whether we have a problem 
with this process.  Yes, we sure do, because we are not naive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote at some length from Greg Weston, Sun Media national 
political columnist.  I would rather do that than plagiarize.  He 
encapsulates very well what is common knowledge in national 
defence and political circles, both nationally and unfortunately 
internationally. This is an international embarrassment.  He 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, buying Cormorant helicopters from the same British-Italian 
consortium that got $600 million of public money for (the Prime 
Minister's) cancelling of the original contract for Cormorant 
helicopters—well, the political optics of this were not lost on 
the bright lights in the Prime Minister's Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enter (the Prime Minister) and Company.  According to one 
classified document, retired Ontario Chief Justice Charles Dubin 
was hired by the justice department to give “a legal 
opinion—in connection with the procurement of search and rescue 
helicopters”.  He found nothing to justify voiding the Cormorant 
bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Government Services hired the accounting firm 
KPMG— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a respected outfit.  He continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to conduct an “independent validation” of the bid process. In 
a document marked “for government eyes only—sensitive,” KPMG 
reported that the bid process represented “one of the best 
procurement evaluations we have seen”. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, sources tell us that the PM appointed—his trusty 
deputy PM and all-purpose political fixer to head up a secret 
cabinet committee, presumably to ensure that bidding was fair, 
open, honest—and not won by the Cormorant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1997, (the Prime Minister) headed south for his 
usual month of golf, reassured by the military that the Cormorant 
bid was history.  But a funny thing happened on the way to the 
contracting office.  (The Deputy Prime Minister) had to phone 
(the Prime Minister) in Florida to tell him the Cormorant had 
won.  (So apparently had the Defence Department which had so 
effectively bamboozled the PM.) 
(The Prime Minister's) response to this news was described to us 
as largely unprintable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In early 1998 (yes, after the election) the Liberal government 
decided to call bids for another 28 multi-purpose military 
helicopters, bringing the total new fleet to 43—the same number 
the Tories had ordered and (the Prime Minister) had cancelled 
five years before.  This time (the Prime Minister) and Co. left 
little to chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one memo to Air Force Commander L. C. Campbell, a fellow 
officer began:  “Assuming there will be a competition to select 
the new maritime helicopter, it is quite possible that the 
Cormorant might win it”.  He then asked: “Even though the 
Cormorant is politically unacceptable (“political suicide” as 
you said), how do you ensure that it does not win a maritime 
helicopter competition?“  And: “If the Cormorant were to win a 
military helicopter competition on its merits, wouldn't we again 
be in the same position of being accused of tricking the 
government?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally:  “Do you think the Cabinet would just opt to select 
the second place finisher if the Cormorant were to be winner of a 
competition?”

suspicious, why we are not naive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that this knowledge within the Department of 
National Defence, in political circles and for anyone close to 
this subject is the motivation for this motion.  The government 
thinks it is politically embarrassing for it to allow an 
objective, unbiased, non-partisan analysis of the Sea King 
replacement proposals and insiders are aware that the fix is in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The men and women in our armed forces and Canadian taxpayers 
deserve to be treated with respect and the government needs to 
take a principled position, not a political position, on such an 
important issue.  Shame on the government.  Shame on the Prime 
Minister's Office for allowing this to become a political 
exercise, for leaving our military in the lurch without 
replacement maritime helicopters and for corrupting the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saint John, the mover of the motion, has been 
eloquent this morning on this issue, as has the Canadian Alliance 
critic.  I support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have other points I should like to make.  If the initial 
EH-101 contract had been filled, all search and rescue and 
shipboard aircraft, none of which are flying now, would have been 
flying four or five years ago.  When a Sea King crashed in Saint 
John in 1994 the then defence minister, who is now the transport 
minister, asked Colonel Cody, then the base commander at 
Shearwater, to keep a lid on the community with the promise there 
would be a replacement by the year 2000.  Colonel Cody complied, 
but when the promises went unfulfilled, in retirement he felt 
compelled to speak out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Retired Canadian forces officers and Atlantic Canada senators 
have formed Friends of Maritime Aviation to speak out against 
tardiness of Sea King replacement.  Collectively the retired 
officers have flown more than 10,000 hours in the Sea Kings.  The 
blame rests with the Prime Minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

This is absolutely wrong and I want to lay out why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put out a letter of interest to advise the industry about the 
government's intentions and requirements to determine the level 
of interest in the project. 
The letter of interest outlines the intended procurement strategy 
and the fact that the project will involve two separate 
competitions, one for the helicopter and one for the mission 
system.

industrial and regional benefits, or IRBs.

It has been laid out.  All of the specs are on the Department of 
National Defence website for all members to see and for the 
aerospace industry to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that this is the process, which has been laid out very 
clearly in the letter of interest to the aerospace industry, I 
wonder if the member would not agree that this in fact is an 
open, fair and transparent process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I read a lot of military 
history and a lot of regular political and other history. If we 
do not pay attention to history, we are bound to repeat it. The 
mistakes are ones that we have to pay attention to, along with 
the other malfeasance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not naive.  We know this is not an open and fair process. 
We know that the Prime Minister's office is trying to direct 
where this contract goes.  We know the Prime Minister's office 
has an agenda.  That is totally unprincipled and totally 
inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our armed forces personnel, more than anyone else in the 
country, are people who, when they sign an employment contract, 
put more than a vocation into this.  They are putting their lives 
in the hands of their employer, the Government of Canada and our 
armed forces.  They do not deserve to be treated the way they are 
being treated in this Sea King helicopter replacement program.

member from Vancouver Island.  As he has an air force base in his 
riding so I have one in mine, Shearwater, where I believe most of 
the replacements will hopefully eventually end up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an earlier question I had for the minister of public works, I 
said that the way this tendering process is split basically 
excludes a particular company from bidding on the contract.  I 
never mentioned the name of the company.  In the minister's 
reply, the minister said Cormorant, so even the government knows 
the company that is being excluded from this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for members of parliament to stand up in the House and 
support one company over another one, but the member from 
Vancouver Island is right when he says it is up to us to ensure 
that all tendered contracts, especially for something as valuable 
as armed forces, are as open and transparent as possible so that 
everyone has an opportunity to bid fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether he could just elaborate on that, please.

Saint John brought forward a procurement issue like this, the 
member for Calgary Northeast, the critic, jumped right on the 
bandwagon and away he went.  As it turned out, the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal noted that in fact they were both 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have another example of the reformed Alliance blindly 
following the Tories in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is this:  why is it that the reformed 
Alliance in 1993, in 1995 and again in 1997, wanted to cut 
defence but finally, in the last election, talked about $2 
billion?  We have already done $2.3 billion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as is my 
custom and as this is my first speech since parliament 
reconvened, I want to thank the constituents of Saint-Jean, who 
have put their trust in me for a third time. I am very pleased 
to represent them in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have 20 minutes to speak this morning, I will give the 
House some incredible examples of injustice in my riding of 
Saint-Jean, particularly where national defence is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several issues underlying today's debate. 
People talk of transparency, but what has become transparent to 
me is that there has been political interference in the issue 
now before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget about Canadian content, because it is always 
the same Canadian and Quebec taxpayers who have to foot the 
bill. I think it is important to raise the issue of Canadian 
content in this debate. Let me give as an example something that 
happened in the riding of Saint-Jean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity recently to tour, with the Minister of 
National Defence, Canadian military facilities in Eritrea. We 
heard nothing but praises for the new armoured vehicle, the LAV 
III. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember asking the Minister of National Defence, here in this 
House, why that contract was given to GM, in Ontario. 
In my riding of Saint-Jean, Oerlikon had the expertise to carry 
out the turret part of the contract. I wanted to know why the 
turret part of the LAV III contract was not given to Oerlikon, 
in Saint-Jean. The minister skirted around the issue but did not 
answer the question. My goal was to create more jobs in the 
riding of Saint-Jean, in Quebec, which is still part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, the armoured vehicle was built by GM, in Ontario, 
and the turret, by Devco, in California. What I said was “It 
does not make any sense. The taxpayers of Canada and of Quebec 
are paying for this, and our money is being used to create jobs 
elsewhere”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about something very similar here today. 
I will show, as my colleagues have done, that the process before 
us is not completely transparent and that some companies are at 
an advantage while others are at a disadvantage. This is bad in 
the context of Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a brief outline of the whole story. It all began at 
the end of the Mulroney government. I clearly remember that. 
There was an election campaign and the government wanted to buy 
the Cadillac of helicopters, some fifty of them, at a cost of 
$5.8 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remember that the then leader of the opposition, who is 
now the Prime Minister, kept repeating “We are going to cancel 
this contract”. To the point where people later described it as 
a farfetched election promise. The Liberals had promised all 
sorts of things, so they had to at least fulfil some of their 
promises. 
And they fulfilled that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> It is like the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Yes, just like they were going to eliminate 
the GST. But they did not fulfil that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No sooner had the Prime Minister been sworn in than he met his 
cabinet and cancelled the EH-101 contract. Of course, there are 
costs involved in the cancellation of a contract that has 
already been signed. That decision cost $500 million to Canadian 
taxpayers. But nothing had been solved. The Sea King helicopters 
were built in the sixties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the new critic on national defence issues, I am sometimes 
told “Mr. Bachand, we want to take you for a helicopter ride”. I 
am always careful to ask “In which one?” Because, even though I 
am a rather brave man, I am very reluctant to fly in Sea King 
and Labrador helicopters. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So one contract was cancelled, at a cost of $500 million.  We 
have helicopters dating back to the 1960s and time marches on 
and they have still not been replaced.  A few years later, in 
1998, the government said “It is really too dangerous and it is 
costing us too much in upkeep.  Let's buy 15 Cormorants”.  This 
was a $790 million contract, at $60 million each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cormorant EH consists of companies with consortiums here. 
Consortiums are often involved.  This one includes Bombardier, 
Canadian Helicopter Corporation and Bristol. 
I would remind the House that these are three Canadian 
companies, one of which, Bombardier—and this is important for 
us—is in Quebec and has extensive aeronautics expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore bought it. The Prime Minister met with the 
President of France once or twice.  Since I was not there, 
naturally I am unable to comment on what was said between the 
President of France and our Prime Minister.  Suddenly, however, 
the winds shifted towards Eurocopter, a consortium with a large 
French component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, we were committed to the 15 Cormorants which we 
bought and which we will have delivered.  Rather than say “Keep 
this expertise and go for some continuity” the government is 
saying “How can we get out of this now?”  This is where the 
letter of interest comes in.  The government sets out 
specifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His first specification: “We have bought 15 helicopters, and we 
will now buy 28 more for maritime patrol and to replace the Sea 
King fleet. Here is what we want from the companies. We outline 
the requirements and tell them we do not want to spend more than 
$925 million for 28 helicopters”. I remind the House that we 
just bought 15 Cormorants at $60 million apiece. But now, we want 
to get 28 more for $925 million. That is about $33 million 
apiece. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very well that EH will probably be excluded. We do not 
want to spend more than $925 million, and we are also saying that 
the contract will go to the lowest bidder. It means that, for a 
$1 difference between Eurocopter and EH, a Canadian consortium of 
which Bombardier is a partner, the contract will go to 
Eurocopter. We should also consider that EH is proposing an 
helicopter which is often compared to a Cadillac, the top of the 
line. But, for a $1 difference, we would rather buy a Lada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the letter of interest means. In other words, we 
can buy from Eurocopter an helicopter with the technology of the 
1970s. Scandinavians have just refused to buy their helicopters 
for maritime patrol from Eurocopter because they consider this 
aircraft not to be safe in Scandinavian weather. I remind you 
that our own weather is quite similar. Weather conditions here 
and in Scandinavia are rather similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will settle for a Lada, when we could have a Cadillac for 
$100 more. That is a problem. Besides, there will be no Canadian 
content at all. 
The work will be done elsewhere. The government will use $925 
million provided by Quebec and Canadian taxpayers to have 
helicopters built elsewhere. It seems to me that it should be a 
government policy to have some Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision in the letter of interest that I mentioned will 
benefit some companies and penalize others. Certification 
involves many technical details and there are companies that 
will not be able to get that certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else with regard to the best possible 
price. This contradicts Treasury Board guidelines. Treasury 
Board does not say the best price, but the best value. 
To get the best value, it may be better to spend a few extra 
millions and have helicopters that will be safe for our pilots 
and our military personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These helicopters will be used for surveillance and, sometimes, 
for search and rescue operations. It is important to have some 
flexibility and not say “The lowest bidder will be awarded the 
contract”, knowing that Eurocopter will most likely be selected. 
People are not interested in a technology that dates back to the 
seventies, but this is what we will have.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have another problem in ten or fifteen years.  We will 
very quickly have maintenance problems with that.  It seems to 
me that the Lada's reputation is not as good as the Cadillac's. 
It seems to me that, when we buy a Lada, we are back at the 
garage sooner for engine or body repairs.  The same thing is 
going to happen with these helicopters, except that we are 
talking about $925 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, another argument in support of awarding the 
contract to EH is that we already have the expertise.  We 
already have of 15 EHs, the version we call the Chevrolet, as 
compared to the Cadillac version the Progressive Conservative 
Party wanted to buy in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some questionable decisions in all this. 
It is hard to accept that we can exclude Canadian content like 
that so readily.  Bell Helicopter could even undertake to do the 
assembly if EH were chosen.  Companies such as CRL Technologies 
are prepared to do the emergency lighting system for these 
helicopters.  All these people are going to be brushed aside. 
We are talking about the possible creation of some 250 to 300 
jobs in Quebec with this contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what the government has decided to do, though.  It 
has decided to go elsewhere.  It has decided to award a contract 
in Europe, without Canadian content.  We the taxpayers of Quebec 
and Canada will simply be left with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that I heard my Liberal colleagues talking about 
transparency a while ago.  The political meddling is 
transparently obvious to me.  Eurocopter was very upset at 
losing the last contract for the 15 Cormorants. 
The Prime Minister met with the President of France.  They 
agreed to say “We will try to do something for you”.  They are 
unable to say what this “something for you” is and to give the 
contract to Eurocopter directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the letter of interest before us, it amounts to the same 
thing.  The government is making life impossible for EH and 
other companies. It is making it easy for Eurocopter. That 
company will probably win the contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us in the Bloc Quebecois, the political meddling in the 
process is transparently obvious. What is more, Canadian content 
has been totally ignored.  It is important for us to have this 
sort of debate. 
Military procurement involves the purchase of huge amounts of 
materiel.  We should pay much more attention to seeing that our 
taxes are having positive benefits here at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will therefore be very happy to support the 
motion by the Progressive Conservative Party member.  We agree 
with them, and I think that the opposition members we heard this 
morning agree with us as well.  There has obviously been 
political interference, and the government is completely 
dropping Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the government is going to learn something from this 
discussion.  Today, it is perhaps not too late to launch another 
kind of call for tender which would truly benefit not just one 
company which the government has its eye on, but everyone. 
The government should use the Treasury Board directives on best 
value, rather than seeking the lowest price, and it should try 
to require Canadian content.  I think that then it would be a 
responsible government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I have the impression that this will not be 
possible.  I think that today's debate should not be in 
vain.  It is not too late to do something.  We are a bit 
discouraged when we look at how this situation arose and see the 
government's attitude and how it said no.  Cancelling this 
contract cost a lot of money and now the government is coming 
back with another contract which has no Canadian content and 
where the helicopters will be manufactured outside Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
believe the member is not familiar with the ongoing process. 
Opposition members in their speeches have been complaining that 
the procurement strategy discriminates against potential bidders, 
namely EH Industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind members that EH Industries did appeal or make a 
complaint to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal.  That 
proceeding took place.  It rejected the appeal on the EH-101. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT25"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT25"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1200

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I want to state categorically that we do not 
discriminate against any bidders.  In fact, members will know 
that EH Industries won the contract for the search and rescue 
helicopters following a fair, open and transparent competition. 
It is more than welcome, and I suspect it will be bidding on this 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the letter of interest is to inform the industry 
at large of a potential project.  It identifies to the industry 
the objectives of the project.  It is laid out in detail and on 
the DND website, which has requested that Public Works and 
Government Services Canada conduct the procurement process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member does not seem to be aware of this, but there is a 
prequalification process.  Once the letter of interest goes out 
and the industry has a dialogue with public works based on the 
procurement strategy, this process, which will be conducted ahead 
of the final bid solicitations, will make key technical 
requirements available to all bidders as early as possible and 
aid in receiving technical compliance of candidate helicopters' 
mission systems.  This will serve to shorten the overall 
competition and procurement time and mitigate risks to Canada and 
the bidders that a formal bid might be found technically 
non-compliant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a matter of simply putting out a different tender.  It 
is not a matter that there is political interference.  The fact 
is that it is a public, open and transparent process carrying on 
a dialogue with the industry, preclearing to ensure that there 
are technically compliant proposals and then requesting bids. 
The member has it all wrong.  I think the member should 
understand that the process now is fair, open and transparent. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Madam Speaker, at the risk of annoying my 
colleague a bit more, I repeat that what is transparent is the 
fact that there was political interference, as clearly 
demonstrated by the whole process. This shows that the 
government wants to exclude companies, and I think that EH is 
one of them. The company benefiting from the situation is 
Eurocopter. I have here the letter of interest and this is what 
it says: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purpose of the evaluation, the lowest priced compliant 
proposal will include the price of the BV— 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it is obvious that we are talking about the lowest 
bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to teach the hon. member some mathematics. The 
Progressive Conservative Party wanted to purchase 50 
helicopters, at a total cost of $5.8 billion, or $100 million 
per unit. The Liberal government decided to cancel this contract 
and, in 1995, to buy 15 helicopters at a total cost of $790 
million, or $60 million per unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we talk about the Cadillac version of 1993 and the 
Chevrolet version of 1998. 
Today, I am talking about the Lada version. This is the version 
we will be getting, because the EH model cannot be built to the 
contract specifications, that is 28 helicopters for $925 
million, which would represent a cost of $50 million per 
helicopter. They definitely will not be able to meet these 
criteria. The government knows it is excluding EH by specifying 
that it will go with the lowest bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am saying that one thing is transparent: after the 
meeting between the Prime Minister and the President of France, 
a fresh wind blew toward Europe. But, once again, the government 
dropped Canadian content and taxpayers in Quebec and Canada will 
have to bear the cost. There is no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, there obviously was some political interference, and 
Canadian content was dropped. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first of 
all, I think my colleague is being very hard on the Lada when he 
compares it to the sort of helicopters the government has in 
mind.  But he also compares the EHs to a Cadillac, when I would 
compare them to a Lincoln Continental, which is a much better 
vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, before any decision is taken, I would 
like the member for Saint-Jean to get across to all members of 
the House the importance of that decision for job creation as 
well. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that if Bombardier is chosen, direct and indirect jobs 
will be created in Quebec and in Canada.  We are concerned about 
the quality of products and services if we buy outside Canada. 
If one buys a car which is no longer on the market and for which 
one can no longer find parts or get after sales service, this 
becomes a worry.  Equipment that has cost the government 
billions of dollars may have to be scrapped.  There is also the 
question of maintenance and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government made a promise during the election campaign, at 
the time, blaming the Progressive Conservative government of Mr. 
Mulroney.  It said all sorts of things, spoke out against free 
trade and the GST. Now it is even worse than the Progressive 
Conservative government that preceded it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member for Saint-Jean taking into account job creation, 
quality of services, productivity, maintenance, and the safety 
of these helicopters?  Will we have better service and better 
flight safety? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague from Charlevoix for his excellent question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want go on with him over the Lincoln Continental versus 
the Cadillac.  However, it seems to me that there is a difference 
between a Cadillac or a Lincoln Continental and a Lada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to come back to his question, because I think it is 
important.  We think that if the contract were awarded to EH in 
the Montreal region, it would mean an additional 200 or 300 jobs 
for Quebec.  This is nothing to sniff at, because they are often 
high paid jobs.  A level of skill is required for these jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the contracts for the army, there are always economic 
benefits, because there are subcontractors.  I have given you the 
example of CRL Technologies, which would be prepared to do the 
emergency lighting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the matter of the maintenance.  It is very 
important.  Since the government bought 15 Cormorants in 1998, 
why not buy another 28.  It would have the same maintenance 
equipment for them instead of a double system: one maintenance 
system for the Cormorants and one for Eurocopter.  Eurocopter 
might say “We are going to send experts from Europe, but you 
have to pay for that.  We are prepared to do the maintenance for 
a year or two, but after five years, we cannot.  We are not going 
to send Eurocopter or a Eurocopter company to North America to 
look after the maintenance of your helicopters”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a very intelligent question.  Basically, the maintenance 
will cost us more. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that is quite an analogy from the member for 
Saint-Jean.  I do not think I would want to fly either a Cadillac 
or a Lada, but at the same time there should be a helicopter or a 
machine out there to do the job.  I know that is what the member 
is seeking to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in my hands a book that is full of access to information 
documents we have received on this particular item.  I would like 
to ask the member a question after I read one of the newspaper 
articles I received as a result of the release of these access to 
information documents.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Documents obtained under the Access to Information Act by Ottawa 
researcher Ken Rubin reveal an unprecedented, top-down approach 
to defining the military's technical needs in areas such as 
aircraft range and cabin size. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is talking about the maritime helicopter.  What does that say 
to the member for Saint-Jean?  Is the process open or is it not? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe my remarks were quite 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the whole process put in place by the Canadian 
government is not transparent. It is even biased. Because of all 
the requirements, including the financial ones, some companies 
will not be able to meet the deadlines or specifications or 
comply with the financial framework.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise 
in the House, especially on behalf of the men and women who work 
at the Shearwater military air force base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the hon. member for Saint John who has been like 
a bulldog on this file for many years, and I say that with the 
greatest of respect.  I thank her and her party for bringing this 
very important issue for debate today in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell a little human interest story before I get into the 
text of my speech.  It is my daughter's unofficial 13th birthday 
today.  She was born on February 29 and, of course, there is no 
February 29 this year.  On behalf of parliament, I would like to 
wish Jasmin a happy 13th birthday.  My best wishes also go to 
little Erika Nordby, the one year old girl in Edmonton who has 
proven to all of us that the human spirit lives on in the child. 
She has given us all hope for the future.  I wish her and her 
family the very best and a prosperous future.  I thank her for 
her indomitable spirit for what she has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to reality, to the issue of the contract that is before us 
and the tendering process.  It is obvious that the government is 
up to something.  In my earlier questioning of the minister of 
public works, I asked him about and challenged him on the 
tendering process.  I stated that the way it was split and the 
way it was done will exclude a particular company from having 
fair and equitable access to the bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not mention the company's name.  There are well over a 
dozen companies that could apply for this particular contract. 
Companies from around the world are bidding on this particular 
tender.  The fact is the minister stood up and said that 
Cormorant can bid on this.  He said Cormorant, not me.  Of all 
the companies he could have picked and chosen, the minister of 
public works was the one who said Cormorant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, it is not our place in the House of 
Commons, regardless of our party or our political background, 
whether we are federal, provincial or municipal, to stand up and 
defend the interests of one company over another. That is not our 
role.  Our role is to ensure, especially in opposition on this 
side of the House, that when the government gives out a tender it 
is open and transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking here about Canadian tax dollars not the Liberal 
slush fund.  When money is doled out for a tendering process, the 
contract or even the perception of the contract must be 
completely clean.  It must be open and transparent, and any 
company anywhere can have the opportunity to bid on the contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies will compete among themselves.  They are very good at 
that.  Companies like Cormorant, Puma and Sikorsky all have the 
opportunity to bid among themselves, which is what they do best, 
and then the winner will decide on the best available equipment 
for the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government has decided that is not the way to 
go.  It will exclude the particular company in question because 
it would be politically unsuitable for them if indeed that 
particular company was successful in bidding on the contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member for Saint John would then ask the following 
question because I know I, the Canadian Alliance and the Bloc 
would ask it as well.  If that particular company is successful 
in bidding on the contract, then why the hell did the government 
cancel it in 1993 in the first place?  That is the crux of the 
matter.  That is what the entire debate is all about. It is 
strictly politics.  It is political interference at the worst 
level, and it is quite obvious that it comes from the minister 
down.  He mentioned it himself.  He picked out the company name, 
not me.  It is very clear that is what he has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the men and women of Shearwater, they deserve and 
demand to have a proper helicopter in which to perform their 
duties.  Right now Canada cannot meet its IATA agreements for 
minimum search and rescue requirements.  If we ever have another 
unfortunate Swissair disaster, it is highly unlikely, with the 
cuts to the coast guard and to the military, that we would be 
able to meet the requirements. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an IATA agreement that we signed.  We have a duty and a 
responsibility to protect our coastlines, especially in the north 
and the Arctic.  We cannot even meet the minimum requirements 
because the Liberals over there are constantly delaying, treating 
our military like a bank account that they just keep robbing, 
taking away from and ignoring the lives of the men and women who 
work for the military.  It goes on and on, not just with 
helicopters but with everything else.  What the government has 
done to our military men and women is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I speak so passionately about it, as may be known 
from previous speeches I have made in the House, is that I was 
born in Holland.  My parents and oldest brother were liberated by 
the Canadian military in 1945.  My father chose to come to Canada 
because of a young soldier he met.  He asked him why Canada had 
risked and sacrificed so much.  The soldier from Canada told my 
father “Well, sir, we had a job to do”.  It was as simple as 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada sacrificed many of its young men and women so that 
Holland and many other countries could be free.  My father taught 
me that from day one.  As an immigrant to Canada I feel honoured 
and privileged to stand up in the House of Commons for those men 
and women, especially the ones from Shearwater.  It is my small 
way of thanking them and Canada for what they have given me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The least I can do is go after the government to ensure there 
are proper resources and funding for our military men and women, 
so that when we put them in harm's way they will have the best 
equipment available.  They should know that their families back 
home are well taken care of and that they, in the event they 
become injured, will not be treated like the Riordon family of 
Nova Scotia.  What we have done to our veterans is an absolute 
disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am stretching the argument a bit here.  The reality is that 
the government has changed the tender process.  It was once 
mandatory to have the replacement by 2005.  Now the government 
says it would prefer to have it by 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe for a second that the helicopters will be here 
by 2005.  I do not believe it.  In my consultations with various 
manufacturers they have said that even if the bid were announced 
today a company would have great difficulty securing the final 
aspect by 2005.  They simply cannot get it done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the government had some guts for once to tell the truth 
around here.  The reality is that 2005 will possibly not be the 
target date.  It should stand and tell the Canadian people the 
truth.  I do not see why that is so difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I am stretching the parameters of discussion in that 
regard, but it is the fact of the matter.  It has misled the 
House.  It has misled our men and women.  It has misled the 
Canadian people.  That is simply unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to comprehend why the government acts the way it 
does.  When we look at the history it is quite obvious why it 
does. Now I understand why the Conservatives have brought the 
motion forward.  It was the Conservatives who were involved in 
the contract for the EH-101.  They put the bid out and everything 
else.  Those helicopters would have been flying today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Liberals that said if we vote for them they would get 
rid of it.  They played on the fears of Canadians that it would 
drag us into further deficits.  They completely ignored the needs 
and wishes of the military.  It was almost like they were playing 
the military against the rest of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see what that kind of attitude has done to our men and women 
in the military.  The minister of defence has stood in the House 
time and time again to answer questions from my former colleague, 
Mr. Gordon Earle who represented Halifax West, and said the troop 
complement would never go below 60,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it is below 58,000 and it is going lower every day.  The 
minister of defence said that, again misleading the House and 
Canadians.  It is an absolute disgrace the way we treat our 
military men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another condition of the contract that I think is very important 
is the hours of maintenance.  We would assume with this amount of 
money, the billions of dollars being spent on the project, there 
would be a commitment from whichever company is successful that 
it would require a certain number of hours of maintenance for 
hours of flying time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying that we will save billions of dollars, 
that we will save all this money, but it does not tell us the 
current rate of maintenance on the Sea Kings we have today.  It 
is over 30 hours of maintenance for one hour of flight time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those costs are not calculated into the so-called savings.  It 
is a disgrace that the government can mislead the House and jig 
figures around to make them look good.  We in the opposition 
understand that.  We are not so naive and gullible as to fall for 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The men and women of Shearwater air base and many other air 
bases across the country know it as well.  They know the Liberals 
are not friends of the military or of the men and women who 
serve.  They are certainly no friends of the company that wanted 
to bid on the contract.  I will not mention the company by name 
because the minister has already done that.  It is not my place 
to support one company over another, although I wish them all the 
best of luck in getting the contract.  I do not believe it will 
be done by 2005.  It is an absolute disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of other things to say.  The minister has stated 
that the procurement will be off the shelf, which means there 
will be no risk to the government.  Could it assure us that the 
aircraft it procures will have an identifiable certificate of 
airworthiness at the time of purchase?  Nothing in the contract 
says that.  There is no guarantee that it will be airworthy by 
the time we get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What gives?  What is going on in the shady halls or backrooms of 
the government and of the minister of public works? Who is 
pulling the strings around here when it comes to a very essential 
contract that we desperately need?  It is not just for military 
purposes.  As I stated before, it is also for search and rescue 
purposes.  Our men and women could have something safe and new in 
which to fly, and something of which they could be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said it time and again, as have many other members of the 
opposition and even some Liberal members.  Our men and women of 
national defence are some of the greatest people in military 
uniform around the world.  They are very proud to do the job they 
do.  We as legislators sometimes make legislation that puts them 
in harm's way.  It is paramount that we give them the best 
possible equipment with which to do their jobs.  Unfortunately 
that has not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government delays and delays.  I do not believe for a second 
that 2005 will be met.  It is absolutely unfortunate that the 
government proceeds in this regard.  Through access to 
information we learned that the government was advised of savings 
of over $700 million by the purchase of a helicopter that is 
common to search and rescue helicopter.  The savings were 
identified as common air crews, common crew training systems, 
common spare and support systems, common manuals and common 
certification systems, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government ignored its own advice and played fast and loose 
with taxpayer money.  It is unacceptable.  In my view it is not 
uncommon.  It just spent $1.3 billion on a home energy rebate 
that did not go to people who bought fuel.  It went to prisoners 
and some U.S. citizens.  We even found out the other day that it 
went to a member of parliament.  I did not get mine.  I know some 
charities that could have used it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the mentality of the Liberal side.  We are not surprised 
by that.  Nobody is surprised by the actions of the government. 
It is a common theme that goes on and on.  The unfortunate part 
is that we are not talking about energy.  We are talking about 
the lives of the men and women of the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who maintain the Sea Kings are magicians when it 
comes to the mechanics.  The Sea Kings have been stripped, torn 
down, ripped apart and put back together time and time again. The 
men and women who work on the Sea Kings deserve the applause of 
the House for the work they have done to keep the machines safe 
and up to standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the best mechanic cannot warn about unforeseen 
circumstances.  The Sea Kings are very old.  Even the best 
mechanic cannot do all the work that is required every time. 
Things can be overlooked, parts can be stressed and situations 
can happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible that the government did not think of that back 
in 1993.  It is incredible that it is still not thinking of it. 
It announced the project.  In fact when the announcement was made 
a colonel at Shearwater said it was a red letter day for the air 
force.  He was right. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all the pushing and shoving by the opposition, the 
government finally made an announcement.  If the colonel had all 
the information we have now, I do not think he would have said it 
was a red letter day for the air force, especially now that we 
understand how the tendering process has worked and that it will 
not be ready by 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I am wrong.  I hope the government proves me wrong.  I 
will stand in the House and apologize to the government if the 
helicopters are here in 2005.  I do not believe for a second that 
they will be.  I wish the government would come clean and say 
that.  It should tell the men and women of the military exactly 
what is going on.  It should be honest with them. They deserve to 
be told the truth, but that is not happening right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible the government has gone on a secret little 
mission in Nova Scotia.  It had a panel looking at realigned 
services for the Shearwater air base, the Greenwood air base in 
the Annapolis valley and the Halifax airport.  I suspect with the 
recent announcement of cuts to the air force that Greenwood and 
or Shearwater may shut down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the role and the goal of the government it should 
tell us and let the men and women on those bases understand what 
is going on.  Again, if I am wrong, I will stand and apologize to 
the House.  I suspect that quite possibly one of those bases will 
be severely reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the representative for Shearwater I will do everything I can 
to protect Shearwater and keep it going.  I am sure the member 
for Kings—Hants would do the same for his area and that the 
member for Vancouver Island would do the same to protect his. 
That is what we do.  We try to protect the men and women of our 
constituencies against the ruthless cuts by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an era of surplus, yet the government is continually 
cutting the military.  It is no wonder it cannot recruit anyone 
for the military now and that men and women are going to the 
private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's military has a history of greatness because of the 
veterans who served in World War I, World War II, Korea and the 
Boer war, and our current veterans from the gulf war, Bosnia and 
so on.  Those men and women did great work for Canada.  They are 
wonderful ambassadors for Canada, spreading democracy around the 
world and defending the interests of those who cannot defend 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals treat them with such disregard and disrespect that 
it is no wonder they are leaving in droves.  The way they treat 
our veterans and our current military personnel, as well as the 
way they look at alternate service deliveries for the supply 
chain, completely destroys the hopes and aspirations of people in 
the civilian workforce such as the members of UNDE, the Union of 
National Defence Employees, who work on the bases.  They may not 
be military men and women, but they are very proud and honoured 
to do the jobs they do.  They are serving their country.  What do 
the Liberals do?  They look for alternate service delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often wanted to say this and I will say it now.  I would 
not be surprised if one day they stood in the House and alternate 
service delivered our entire military, contracted it out, 
completely shut it down, laid off the 50,000 men and women in our 
armed forces, and perhaps give the entire military to the U.S. or 
someone else.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Hire mercenaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Why not hire mercenaries?  That is a 
good point.  Why do we even need a military the way the 
government is going?  It is absolutely amazing.  I say that 
tongue in cheek, but that is almost the approach the government 
is taking.  If that is the direction it goes in and contracts out 
the entire military, I suggest we should contract out the 
government and move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on forever on this issue, but I am sure the House 
cannot wait for the questions from the other side that will come 
my way.  In closing the men and women of our military deserve 
better.  They deserve a lot more from the government and from all 
of us.  I hope these kinds of debates will continue in the future 
so that we can focus attention on what is required for the brave 
men and women in our military.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during the member's speech he referred to the crux of the matter. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT31"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT31"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He described it as basically being that the procurement of the 
maritime helicopters was split into two; one a request for 
proposals on a frame and the other for a mission system.  The 
member made the allegation that by splitting the contract for 
helicopters into two parts it somehow discriminated or provided a 
barrier against a particular company.  In fact, he named E.H. 
Industries Ltd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>E.H. Industries Ltd. actually made an appeal to the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal.  I would like to inform the member 
that the CITT rejected the complaint by E.H. Industries Ltd.  I 
am not sure if the member knows more about this than CITT.  If he 
does maybe he should explain to the House why he is more of an 
expert than the CITT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to point out that E.H. Industries Ltd. won 
the competition in a fair, open and competitive process for the 
search and rescue helicopters.  That very clearly shows that 
there is no bias against any particular company.  In a fair, open 
and transparent process, it is obvious that the government has no 
position on any potential bidder.  The reason why we put out a 
procurement strategy, which included a letter of interest, was so 
we could have a dialogue with the industry, advise what the specs 
were and do pre-qualification to make sure that we could get the 
best helicopters to meet the specifications of DND at the best 
possible price on behalf of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggested that having a procurement strategy which 
goes for the frame first and then puts out bids for the mission 
system was a barrier.  Could he explain to the House why a 
comprehensive pre-consultation and pre-qualification somehow 
provides a barrier to anybody? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess in the Liberal 
world, if everybody was a Liberal life would be great.  The 
reality is that it discriminated against that particular company. 
Why did that company feel it had to go to court?  No other 
company is doing that.  The fact is that this is a politically 
motivated tender.  Everybody knows that.  The only problem is we 
in opposition will say it while the Liberals will hide behind it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will throw a question back to the question.  Why did the 
government change the prerequisite of the current tender from a 
mandatory replacement by 2005 to a preferred replacement by 2005? 
It is because it knows that it cannot meet that commitment by 
2005.  It has misled the Canadian people and the brave men and 
women of not only the Shearwater air base but of all the armed 
forces.  That is a disgrace. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague commented about the cost of the cancellation of the 
EH-101 and how the government was saying it was going to save 
money and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want my colleague and everyone in the House to know that the 
cancellation of the EH-101 has cost about $800 million.  When we 
look at the cost of maintaining the Sea Kings and trying to keep 
them upgraded and so on and then the replacement of the Labradors 
and so on, the total cost for the Liberal government will be $8.2 
billion.  It would have cost them $4.3 billion to get 43 EH-101s. 
Now we are only going to have 28 helicopters.  In addition, we 
have been told that the coastal patrol is going to be down to 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the hon. member see us looking after the coastal patrol 
when it comes to drugs, illegal immigrants and over-fishing?  How 
does he see it working?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague from 
Saint John, New Brunswick said it very eloquently.  How do we do 
it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, we probably will just contract it out to 
someone.  Maybe there is another country that cares a lot more 
about coastal defence and protection.  Maybe we can use their 
services because we certainly cannot seem to do it on our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was absolutely right when she said that the 
cancellation was not just the $500 million or $800 million 
initial cancellation fee.  We have to take in all the other costs 
which include the additional maintenance and everything that is 
attached to that cancellation fee in terms of the delay of the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the money that the taxpayers are very concerned 
about, it is the embarrassment of our country worldwide.  A 
country that is deemed by the UN to be the number one place in 
the world in which to live is embarrassed by the fact that we 
have over 40 year old helicopters being flown by these brave men 
and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That to me is the disgrace, the coup de grâce if I may say so, 
of the government.  It is the disgrace of having our brave men 
and women fly in those clunkers when other countries around the 
world have nice shiny equipment to fly.  They are much safer and 
do a much better job.  That is an embarrassment that I do not 
think the government will ever live down because I will not allow 
it to live it down. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to offer my support to the member who 
just made his presentation.  He is looking after the constituents 
in his riding, those on the Shearwater base.  He is very familiar 
with the problems which have plagued the pilots and the crews in 
trying to maintain and keep those machines in the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that he has involved himself significantly in trying to 
help bring the message to the House and the public as to what is 
going on.  That is very important.  I will commit myself and the 
defence committee in the Alliance to do whatever we can to 
support the member's endeavours at Shearwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the access to information documents, a new senior 
management oversight committee was struck.  It was called SMOC. 
It involved high level members of the military, the deputy 
minister of defence, the deputy minister of material and the 
like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these documents were released, there were immediate 
complaints.  Some offices acknowledged in their memos, which were 
obtained through access to information, that the top down 
approach headed by the new SMOC would likely include cabinet 
involvement at an earlier level.  That is access to information, 
proof in itself, that there was government interference in the 
process.  I would like the member to comment on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to repay the 
compliment to the hon. member for Calgary Northeast for his 
efforts and work, during the many years he has served the House, 
in trying to get the resources required for our military men and 
women.  I appreciate his support in the ongoing battle for 
Shearwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not a shame that he has to recite from an access to 
information document about the meddling and the intrusion by the 
cabinet into this decision.  It proves what we have been saying 
all along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is absolutely right.  This is not about doing what is best 
for the military.  This is about saving face.  There is no 
question in my mind that the cabinet and that particular minister 
of public works personally interfered in the process so that a 
particular company would be excluded from the bidding process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as my 
colleague from Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore said 
this has been an exercise of the Liberal government in trying to 
save face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not the only campaign promise or commitment that the 
Liberals made in 1993 in which it demonstrated very little 
consistency.  There were the commitments to get rid of the GST 
and the free trade.  The Liberals as members of the opposition 
fought vociferously the policies on GST and free trade.  Now as 
members of the government they have embraced them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case was perhaps the one that the government was most 
concerned about because of the symbolism of the helicopter 
contract.  The Prime Minister made a huge issue of this during 
the 1993 election.  At that time he said he would put zero on the 
cheque for helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately that cancellation cost, as my colleague from Saint 
John said earlier, around $4.2 billion for the Canadian taxpayer. 
That was a face saving exercise for the government.  Maybe the 
government had a flash of embarrassment based on all the other 
promises it broke after the 1993 election.  Maybe it saw this as 
the last bastion of consistency to their red book promises.  I 
cannot believe that the government would see fit to waste $4.2 
billion of taxpayer money.  That money could have gone to health 
care, transfers to the provinces for education, perhaps lower 
taxes or perhaps to strengthen our military.  Would that not be a 
great idea? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has demonstrated not just contempt for the House 
periodically, but also contempt for the military over the last 
seven years.  This neglect of the Canadian military is to an 
extent that we have never seen with regard to the quality of life 
in the military, pay issues, housing issues and the one we are 
focused on today, equipment issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Kings—Hants representing CFB Greenwood, this 
is a very important issue to me.  Approximately two years ago I 
attended a funeral in Greenwood for three servicemen.   These 
brave individuals perished on a mission of the Sea King 
helicopter.  It was a moving and memorable experience.  Hundreds 
of people gathered to celebrate their lives and to mourn the 
tragedy of their lives being ended so unnecessarily early.  The 
amount of emotion at that time is indescribable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot put a price tag on that.  We cannot put a price tag on 
the fear that our service men and women have every day when they 
use these helicopters and risk their lives.  We cannot put a 
price tag on the fear that their families live under on an 
ongoing basis that their loved ones are in risk because of these 
decisions.  I focused on the $4.2 billion loss to the Canadian 
taxpayer, but we have to recognize that the other losses have 
been priceless.  We cannot put a price tag on those things. 
I should say as well that I will be splitting my 
time with the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I came here I assumed that public policy was built around 
needs, around what people in our constituencies and across our 
country actually need, and around what our military needs.  I 
have learned since 1997 that politics can in fact be the natural 
enemy of public policy.  In fact, for very short term political 
reasons sometimes, decisions are taken that have a very 
deleterious impact on Canadians in the long term.  I do not think 
there is a better example of a case where public policy was 
sacrificed on the alter of political expediency than the case of 
the cancellation of the EH-101 contract and the decisions made 
after that, and I will list some of those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course my colleague from Saint John spoke earlier of the $800 
million in cancellation fees.  There are also:  the Sea King 
maintenance and upgrade, $600 million; Canada search helicopter 
program, $790 million; long term service for that program, $1.7 
billion; maritime helicopter project, again $2.9 billion; and the 
maritime helicopter project and long term service support, again, 
$1.7 billion.  The total cost is around $8.5 billion as opposed 
to the actual cost for the EH-101s, which would have been $4.3 
billion.  Even with Liberal math, this does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals could argue that by delaying the decisions as they 
did, they had the extra time to reduce the value of the Canadian 
dollar, which they have worked assiduously at over a period of 
seven years, and they have reduced the Canadian dollar 
significantly. Perhaps their strategy has been to delay these 
types of investments as long as possible, because every year of 
Liberal government leads to a lower Canadian dollar.  Maybe that 
is the stalling mechanism the Liberals are trying, but it is 
still not working.  Even with their valiant efforts to reduce the 
value of the Canadian dollar and devalue our way to prosperity, 
they have not achieved sufficient reduction of these costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that in making a very political decision about a 
life and death issue, the Liberals have treated our Canadian 
military and the loved ones of our Canadian military darned 
shabbily.  There are issues that rise above partisanship.  I do 
not think there is a member of the House from any political party 
who does not value and appreciate the contribution of our 
military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can speak at great length in the House about our commitment 
as representatives for our military, but the cabinet opposite has 
not delivered in protecting the interests of all Canadians by 
ensuring that we have a strong military and by respecting the 
members of that military, whether it is on quality of life issues 
or in terms of adequate housing and adequate pay and benefits. 
Also, beyond that there are the equipment issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that has repeatedly turned its back on the 
military.  This is the most egregious example of that because it 
smacks of partisan politics and Machiavellian manoeuvring at the 
expense of our brave men and women in uniform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will tell members today that as long as I am the 
member for Kings—Hants I will be defending the interests of our 
military and working to ensure that the people of Kings—Hants 
and all Canadians benefit from a strong, proud military, 
particularly the base in Greenwood in my riding, whose service 
people have provided and continue to provide such terrific 
service to Canada.

which the used the phrase that this is contempt for parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he would describe what he did in the previous 
parliament, which was contempt for parliament and for the people 
of Canada when he resigned his seat for the leader of the 
opposition, now leader of the fifth party in the House.  He took 
the population of his riding for granted when he thought the 
people would vote for the Conservative Party.  He resigned his 
seat and got a job in the leader's office.  Then when the 
election was called last October the member ran again and won the

parliament and contempt for the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Of course our hon.

hon. member for his non-partisan and constructive intervention on 
this topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting.  Here we have an opposition day motion 
whereby we are debating the future of the Canadian military and 
the government's neglect of the Canadian military, and even the 
government's own backbenchers do not have the gumption to stand 
up and talk about the issue at hand.  Instead they talk about 
something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member described my action of resigning my seat in order for 
my right hon. leader to have an opportunity to run in my riding 
as contemptuous.  I suggest he address his concerns about that 
issue to his leader, the Prime Minister, who entered the House 
under similar circumstances when a member resigned his seat.  I 
expect his leader would be surprised to learn of that member's 
philosophical aversion to that mechanism by which many leaders 
have entered the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps if the member were to address his concerns to his Prime 
Minister about those contemptuous actions taken by that Prime 
Minister when he first entered the House in the early nineties, 
he would probably ensure himself a longer period on the 
backbenches of that government.  Perhaps he should address his 
concerns about demonstrating contempt for parliament to those 
people over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the people of Kings—Hants spoke quite clearly on 
November 27 by giving me another opportunity to continue to 
represent them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I find the speeches today very interesting, particularly the 
speech made by the member for Kings—Hants, in which he spoke a 
lot about the financial side of things and how much the costs ran 
over.  In actual fact we have heard it here that we have actually 
saved money, because the whole project has changed.  It is not 
the same as the 1993 project.  The members on the other side do 
not seem to realize that.  The mission systems are not the same. 
The needs are not the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most interesting part is how the PC Party has changed its 
policy.  The 1993 system was one helicopter, one piece, but since 
then there have been two different contracts.  That was something 
proposed by the PC Party.  I do not see why the PC members are 
now going to one piece, one contract.  Perhaps the member could 
tell me why they have changed their minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in regard to the hon. 
member from Damascus on his road to conversion, first I am 
absolutely astounded by the member opposite who, in his good work 
in opposition on this side of the House, actually enabled us to 
attain much of this information.  Now that he is on the other 
side of the House, muzzled effectively and perhaps wearing those 
rose coloured glasses given out to all successful Liberal 
candidates, he sees things quite differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that if we were to compare that hon. member's 
positions about military issues when he was on this side of the 
House to his current views, we could see that his consistency on 
these issues is about as constant as that of the Prime Minister 
on the GST, free trade, deregulation of financial services or 
anything.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps as part of his membership in that caucus he has passed 
the first test:  there is no consistency and there is no 
commitment to the values and principles that sustain all of us as 
entities in the political environment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is certainly a pleasure to follow my distinguished colleague 
from Kings—Hants, who is very knowledgeable on this question.  I 
also want to acknowledge the hon. member for Saint John, who has 
brought the issue forward and has been consistent in her concern 
about the helicopter issue and about all other military issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is of interest to me because I was a member from 
1988 to 1993 and I was part of the government that approved the 
purchase of the EH-101 helicopters, which would have been in 
service now for some time, at least some of them.  We would have 
replaced some of the Sea King helicopters which continue to 
literally fall out of the sky and present a hazard to our 
military people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as we know, the Liberal government cancelled the 
contract that was given by the Canadian government in a way that 
caused them a ton of grief and cost the taxpayers of Canada a lot 
of money, with upward of $1 billion in costs for cancellation 
fees, legal fees, settlements and work in the departments.  That 
is a thousand million dollars that went for absolutely nothing. 
It was a fee to cancel the contract:  a thousand million dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the effort we go through in Nova Scotia to try to 
raise money for hospitals, social services, highways and roads 
and all the things we need money for that the government will no 
longer do.  The government says it will no longer have highway 
improvement agreements and it will cut back on transfers to 
health care.  I think of the thousand million dollars that was 
just thrown away for nothing to prove a political point.  It is 
very sad that the money was totally wasted and that we have 
continued to debate the helicopter issue for so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of that thousand million dollar mistake, the 
government has had to distort the tendering process and the calls 
for proposals on helicopters in order to exclude the helicopter 
the Conservative government ordered in the early nineties, which 
the Liberals cancelled.  In order to save face, the government 
cannot possibly allow the same helicopter to be reordered after 
the Liberals cost taxpayers a thousand million dollars in 
cancellation fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue goes back to 1978, when the Liberals themselves 
identified the need for new helicopters.  That is 23 years ago. 
They did nothing about it at that time.  In 1992 when the 
Conservatives came in, they did approve the replacement of the 
helicopters with one type of helicopter, an EH-101, for all the 
necessary purposes.  The Labrador search and rescue and the Sea 
King maritime helicopter fleets were to be replaced with the 
EH-101.  That would have given us efficiencies in replacement 
parts, training knowledge, training of pilots and mechanics, 
parts inventory and everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government cancelled that contract, it has been 
divided into two contracts.  The government has divided the last 
batch of contracts into airframe and mission packages.  Having 
been in the car business for some time, I just know what is going 
to happen when something fails with the helicopter in the future. 
The provider of the mission package is going to say that the 
problem is not with the electronic equipment but the airframe and 
how it has been constructed and how it interrelates to the 
mission package.  If something happens with the helicopter, the 
helicopter providers are going to blame it on the mission package 
supplier.  In other words, it is going to cost the government a 
lot more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a parallel issue, I recently heard on the news a good example 
of what the private sector is doing.  Ford Motor Company builds 
cars for police services.  There is inconsistency in the 
application of sirens and telecommunications and communications 
equipment in the police cars now.  They are so high tech, with so 
many electronic features and all the bells and whistles police 
cars have, that they have not interrelated well.  There are a lot 
of difficulties.  Warranty on issues has had to be refused 
because the car company says the difficulties were due to the 
supplier of the equipment and the equipment company says the 
problem was due to the supplier of the vehicle. 
The company has established a new policy.  It wants to supply one 
unit.  The police car will already be equipped so that the 
electronics are integrated and work in sync with the automobile's 
electronics, the engine, the transmission and all the other 
features.  It has had so much trouble that it is again passing 
the buck.  It is the supplier of the mission package or the 
supplier of the police car.  That is exactly what will happen 
with the new helicopters.  The supplier of the mission package 
will say that it is not its problem, that it is someone else's 
problem and the supplier of the helicopter will say that it is a 
mission package problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this will fail.  I have seen it myself with my own two 
eyes.  The private sector has acknowledged that the system does 
not work and here we are going into this process.  We will have 
two different parties supplying these things and the people of 
Canada will end up paying for it.  They paid the price for the 
cancellation of the last deal and they will pay the price for 
this poor policy of supply and procurement for these helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EH-101 is and always has been the military's first choice. 
It is the helicopter that it prefers and it has identified it as 
the best suited for its purposes.  However the politicians have 
interceded and said that it cannot be done and that it is not 
politically acceptable.  They said that we have to have a 
different helicopter so they changed the rules in order to 
prevent the EH-101 from being the successful candidate.  Who 
pays?  The taxpayers will pay once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A mistake was made in the first place when the Liberals promised 
to get rid of the EH-101.  They should just accept that they made 
a mistake and accept the responsibility for the billion dollars 
of grief that they have piled on top of Canadian taxpayers.  The 
military should be allowed to buy the right helicopter at the 
best price to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about life and death situations.  We are not 
talking about trivial matters.  The Liberals should acknowledge 
that it is their mistake and not put it on the backs of our 
military and search and rescue people just because of this 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines for the competition have excluded the EH-101 for 
all intents and purposes.  It will force the military to take a 
helicopter it does not want.  It is well known in circles that 
some of these helicopters are not even close to the criteria that 
the military really need.  Instead of having helicopters that are 
appropriate for its use, it will end up with helicopters that it 
does not want.  This is entirely for political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of rumours around.  The illustrious member 
from Damascus raised issues in the House when he sat with us on 
this side about innuendo, suspicion of under the table deals, 
promises between the governments of Canada and France, promises 
between cities and all kinds of other political deals made 
surrounding this whole helicopter issue.  It has been surrounded 
by rumours and innuendo, but now that the member is sitting on 
the Liberal side all those rumours and innuendo seem to have 
disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the government that was involved with the original 
decision to buy the EH-101 helicopters, it is a shame to see that 
decision reversed.  It is a shame to see the taxpayers saddled 
with a $1 billion tax burden, which was the price to get out of 
the contract, and now having to pay more for helicopters that are 
not suitable.  Those helicopters will be serviced in an improper, 
non-functional way contrary to what the private sector is doing 
with new technology, and again the taxpayer will pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the government just reverse its decision and 
accept the best helicopter as has been recommended by the very 
distinguished member for Saint John. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member for Kings—Hants did not really answer the question, 
but I am used to that.  When we asked questions we did not get 
answers from the other side.  That happens but I will try again.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party's 1993 specifications show that the contract had 
separate units: a platform and mission system.  I made that 
recommendation last year at SCONDVA.  I would like to know when 
that was changed in PC Party policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a question I would 
like to ask the hon. member for Compton—Stanstead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year in the House he said “Our information says it seems 
that the Cougar II may come with a promise of a Daimler-Chrysler 
plant, probably in Shawinigan”.  I am not sure where Shawinigan 
is or whose riding that is, but this is the Liberal member asking 
if there is a promise to put a helicopter plant in Shawinigan. He 
went on to say “A more interesting angle is that this deal may 
also come with a promise of neutrality from the French government 
in the next Quebec referendum”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member still think that the member from Shawinigan 
has the fix in for a helicopter plant in Shawinigan in order to 
approve this contract? 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to be in the House to speak about helicopters, a 
subject that is not new to me.  Today I would like to focus on 
the remarks toward the central role that the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services is playing in managing the maritime 
helicopter project. 
I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Haliburton—Victoria—Brock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleagues who have spoken before me, I have the utmost 
confidence in the department's ability to administer this major 
crown procurement.  The Department of Public Works and Government 
Services is not only the federal government's main purchasing 
organization, it is the largest procurement outfit in Canada. 
This common service agency buys everything from paper clips to 
train services to scientific research and, yes, sophisticated 
military and defence equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department services more than 100 federal departments, 
agencies, crown corporations and special operating agencies, 
including parliament.  It deals with thousands of suppliers, both 
here in Canada and internationally.  On a day to day basis 
contract officers of Public Works and Governments Services Canada 
deal with a range of suppliers, from individual contractors to 
some of the biggest industrial, financial, consulting and 
manufacturing concerns in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department averages 50,000 contracts a year, with a total 
value of $8 billion, or about 57% of the federal government's 
total annual spending on goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House can see, Public Works and Government Services 
Canada brings a wealth of experience and expertise to the 
maritime helicopter project.  With a value of close to $2.9 
billion, there is no question that this project is larger than 
most.  It is the single largest procurement currently being 
managed by the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same principles apply.  I can assure hon. members on all 
sides of the House that this procurement will be managed 
efficiently, effectively and with the greatest respect for 
taxpayer dollars.  The reason I can say this is because Public 
Works and Government Services Canada has 60 years of purchasing 
history behind it.  It has earned a solid reputation as a highly 
competent and professional procurement agency.  It operates to 
the highest standards which are clearly defined in federal 
statutes, regulations and policy manuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are aware, the overall procurement and 
contracting policies of the Government of Canada are established 
by the treasury board.  These policies are aimed at acquiring 
goods and services in a manner that enhances access, competition 
and fairness, and that results in value to the Canadian 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procurement strategy for the maritime helicopter project 
meets all of these criteria.  It also complies with the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services' own framework 
of guiding principles for procurement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department has one governing postulate for all its 
activities, and that is integrity.  Public Works and Government 
Services Canada is committed to ensuring that its supply 
activities are open, fair and transparent.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The integrity of the procurement strategy for the maritime 
helicopter project is above question.  As the Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services has demonstrated through his 
earlier comments, the 28 maritime helicopters and associated 
integrated mission systems required by the Canadian forces will 
be purchased through a process that is fair, open and 
transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Public Works and Government Services has 
identified several guiding principles that underlie this overall 
commitment to integrity.  I would like to briefly review them for 
hon. members to further underscore the strength of this 
procurement strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For each procurement it undertakes, the department is committed 
to satisfying the operational needs of its clients while 
obtaining the best price through the procurement process.  That 
explains why procurement officers had to work hand in hand with 
officials of the Department of National Defence to develop the 
letter of interest and other documents released last August.  It 
explains why the procurement includes an unprecedented commitment 
to industry dialogue and interaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as obtaining value, the procurement strategy ensures that 
once the client's operational and technical needs are met, the 
lowest price bidder for each requirement will be awarded the 
contract provided that acceptable terms and conditions and 
industrial and regional benefits are proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Works and Government Services Canada's procurement 
practices are also aimed at advancing the government's national 
objectives, particularly in the area of social economic policy. 
The maritime helicopter project meets this principle on two 
accounts.  First, by ensuring that the men and women of the 
Canadian forces have the equipment they need to perform their 
vital work in the service of all Canadians.  Second, by ensuring 
that a comprehensive package of industrial and regional benefits 
will be a key criterion in the evaluation of all bids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is generally acknowledged that no Canadian company is able to 
provide the entry level helicopter.  However there is a 
possibility that Canadian firms will participate as 
subcontractors.  We know that Canadians firms are capable of 
supplying the integrated mission systems and have expressed 
interest in doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister has indicated, the government's goal is to 
ensure that Canadian suppliers receive the maximum benefits from 
both contracts.  Consistent with principles used for the previous 
procurements, the government will be seeking industrial and 
regional benefits equivalent to the value of the contracts both 
for the helicopter and the integrated mission system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition is another guiding principle for procurements by 
Public Works and Government Services Canada.  There can be no 
doubt as to its application to the maritime helicopter project. 
Two separate competitive processes will be undertaken to ensure 
that the crown obtains both the required helicopter and the 
integrated mission system, as well as the long term in service 
support it needs at the lowest possible price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the mandatory prequalification process ensures a 
maximum level of competition for the contracts because it will 
mitigate the risk of receiving non-compliant bids.  Hon. members 
can rest assured that there will be strong competition for these 
contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equal treatment is another principle adhered to by the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services' procurement 
officers.  The department's policy is that all potential 
suppliers of a particular requirement must be subject to the same 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several elements of the procurement strategy, including its 
general openness, will contribute to the achievement of this 
principle.  All potential bidders will have access to the same 
information and will be kept apprised of any changes and 
technical specifications and other requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry interaction process initiated by the government, 
which will include the posting of technical specifications and 
other documents on the project's dedicated website, will provide 
for a two way dialogue that ensures there will be no surprises at 
the end of the road.  All potential bidders will be given the 
same opportunity to demonstrate technical compliance through the 
prequalification process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, accountability is the cornerstone of the department's 
procurement activities.  As is the case with all other 
procurements, the Public Works and Government Services Canada 
will be accountable for the integrity of the entire procurement 
process from start to finish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on its long history of working with the Department of 
National Defence on many projects, including highly sensitive 
procurements, the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services anticipates no problem in this regard.  The two 
departments have a close and positive working relationship that 
will be manifested through this maritime helicopter project.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to be open, fair and transparent as 
this project moves forward over the next few months.  All 
potential prime contractors are fully aware of the different 
elements of the government's procurement strategy, and all bids 
will be measured fairly against a strict and open set of 
evaluation criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members have questioned why the government is using 
the lowest cost compliant as the basis for awarding these two 
contracts when bids for the search and rescue helicopter were 
assessed based on overall value to the crown.  The answer is 
simple:  The mandatory prequalification process of the maritime 
helicopter project will ensure that all the helicopters and 
integrated mission systems ultimately considered by the 
government are capable of doing the job.  Once this has been 
established, the evaluation of individual proposals can focus on 
cost so that the crown's needs are met at the lowest possible 
price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maritime helicopter project is an important step forward in 
providing the Canadian forces with state of the art equipment 
that meets the needs of the 21st century.  I know this is of 
concern to Canadians from coast to coast.  Having heard the range 
of views on the subject, I trust hon. members will recognize the 
strength of the government's approach and will give their 
unequivocal support to this endeavour.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
to ask the hon. member for Compton—Stanstead, does he deny that 
it was his questions in the House when he sat on this side of the 
House that uncovered this clear bias that we are debating today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, when he sat with me on this side of the House, he 
informed me that there was a problem.  He said that the Prime 
Minister was going over to France to talk with the French 
government, along with the Daimler-Chrysler plant people, about 
having this Eurocopter agreement and that it was a deal that was 
being entered into.  He knew about it because it was leaked to 
him by some DND people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he deny today that he was the one who was asking for a 
fair, open, public tender process in accordance with the approved 
statement of operational requirements?  What is happening today? 
It does not comply with that operational requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member, for whom I have great respect, how could 
he sit on this side of the House and ask those questions, and 
then today turn around and say that everything is fine and is 
rosy?   he was totally opposed to it when he sat here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an interesting 
question.  Things have not changed just because I am on this side 
of the House.  The questions still get asked.  I guess the 
difference is that the questions get answered now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting that the member opposite keeps talking 
about this as not being a fair and open process.  I think it is 
an extremely fair and open process, much fairer than what we have 
seen in the past.  If we want to go back to processes, as I said 
before, I have the process from 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back to 1993, we are talking about the same type of 
situation: a separate platform and a separate mission systems. 
The only difference was that there was only one company that 
happened to bid on those two combined issues and it got the job.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the speech of 
the member for Compton—Stanstead has neither interest, substance 
or odour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, when he was a candidate for the Progressive 
Conservative Party, his speeches defended the policies of Mr. 
Mulroney's Conservative government and condemned the actions and 
promises of the Liberal Party and of the current Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member, who has been here since 1997 and was 
elected, at the time, by condemning the Liberal Party's 
policies, now be on the other side of the House and defend a 
position outlined in a speech that was probably drafted by the 
Liberal Minister of Public Works and Government Services? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very easy. As I said before,

speak to the motion before us today, the maritime helicopter 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for Compton—Stanstead.  The party saw 
enough support for this member to nominate and elect him as 
vice-chair of defence and veterans affairs.  I remind the member

with Jean Charest, who was a Conservative, he also left to excel 
in the Liberal Party.  It seems that if one leaves those benches 
over there, one tends to move up in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal first with the facts that are before us.  We have 
heard a lot a numbers coming out of the opposition party.  I 
think they found them somewhere in a comic book.  This deal will 
save $1.5 billion over the former government's helicopter 
purchase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contract that involved the EH-101 was $5.7 billion.  The 
contract for the helicopter purchased is at about $2.9 billion, 
plus the helicopter purchased for search and rescue brings it up 
to $3.7 billion.  This is a difference of $2 billion, even adding 
in the $500 million in cancellation costs, not with the numbers 
they are throwing around.  In cancelling the EH-101, the 
government is still saving Canadian taxpayers $1.5 billion 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my colleague across the way, the member for Saint John, 
is concerned about the men and women of the Canadian forces and 
about making sure they have the tools and the support they need 
to do their job.  This is a priority for the government also.  It 
is why I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak about the 
helicopter project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to proceed with this acquisition demonstrates the 
government's leadership in ensuring that the Canadian forces are 
properly equipped for their missions.  As members know, over the 
past two years, the government has reinvested more than $2.5 
billion in defence.  Additional new funding was announced this 
morning when the supplementary estimates were tabled.  As stated 
in the recent Speech from the Throne, these increases will help 
ensure the forces are equipped and prepared to respond quickly to 
calls for help at home and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the defence white paper, the government made it clear that 
modernizing the Canadian forces required several key equipment 
purchases, including the maritime helicopter.  The government is 
delivering on these commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our navy has taken possession of the first of four Victoria 
class submarines.  The army has acquired new state of the art 
light armoured vehicles.  The United States has followed suit and 
is buying some of these vehicles, as is New Zealand.  These 
vehicles are made in London, Ontario.  The air force will be 
receiving 15 new search and rescue helicopters and upgrading the 
CF-18 fighters and Aurora surveillance aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August of last year, the government granted approval for the 
Department of National Defence to begin the process of acquiring 
28 new maritime helicopters.  As the Minister of National Defence 
has said, acquiring a suitable maritime helicopter to replace the 
aging Sea King is his top capital acquisition priority.  A 
modern, robust and capable maritime helicopter is vital for 
maintaining multipurpose combat capable forces.  I might also, as 
a side note, say that the United States is still flying Sea Kings 
and swear by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Sea King has performed admirably as our maritime 
helicopter, we must ensure that the Canadian forces are equipped 
to meet the demands of the future.  The maritime helicopter is a 
vital component needed by the Canadian forces to carry out the 
range of tasks that the government may ask of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maritime helicopter plays a wide range of roles, including 
surveillance and control of Canadian territory and approaches, 
search and rescue, peace support operations, defence of North 
America, NATO, collective defence, international humanitarian 
assistance and disaster relief, among others.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement of operational requirements for the maritime 
helicopter clearly describes what kind of helicopter we need to 
carry out our maritime activities.  For example, it explains why 
we need 28 maritime helicopters to meet our current defence 
commitments.  It explains how much the maritime helicopter must 
be able to carry in order to accomplish an assigned mission and 
the airborne time required to conduct the mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also explains what kind of mission systems, for example, 
communication, sensors and radar, will be required to ensure the 
helicopter's versatility and interoperability with our allies. 
The statement of operational requirements is strong and coherent. 
It is consistent with current defence policy and supported by 
thorough operational and statistical analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of work has been done to identify what kind of maritime 
helicopter the Canadian forces need to carry out their defence 
missions.  I am sure the member for Saint John will be pleased to 
hear that the process to acquire a new maritime helicopter for 
the Canadian forces is being done with the best value for 
Canadian taxpayers in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all members know, if someone has to borrow money to buy 
something, whether it is a house or a car, one makes sure that 
every penny spent is used wisely.  One would not buy more than 
what is needed.  One would not want to pay a nickel more than one 
had to.  The government understands that the money it has is 
borrowed from the taxpayer and that the taxpayer is entrusting 
the government to spend it wisely.  That is what the government 
is doing with the maritime helicopter project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will acquire what the Canadian forces need at the 
lowest cost to the Canadian taxpayer over the long term.  We will 
get what is the best possible price, compliant with our 
requirements, over the full life of the helicopter.  In other 
words, we are being smart about it and our approach is very 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will acquire off the shelf, non-developmental equipment.  We 
will not spend more than we have to spend.  We will buy only what 
we need.  We will make sure the combined cost of acquiring and 
maintaining the helicopter is the lowest possible.  This will 
save taxpayer money over the long term.  If this is not getting 
the best value, I do not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will have saved Canadian taxpayers $1.5 billion 
compared to the former government's EH-101 project.  This is 
after including the costs associated with cancellation and the 
investments the Department of National Defence had made to ensure 
the continued airworthiness of the Labrador and Sea King 
helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only about saving money.  It is also about ensuring 
the Canadian forces get the equipment they need at a price we can 
afford.  By launching the process to acquire new helicopters the 
government has done just that.  The government is committed to 
ensuring that the men and women of the Canadian forces have the 
tools they need to get their job done.  Acquiring a new maritime 
helicopter is part of this commitment.  We are doing this in a 
way that is right for the Canadian forces and right for Canadian 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Kosovo visiting with a quality of life report 
follow-up, I flew in a Griffon helicopter and found that it was a 
state of the art piece of equipment.  We flew in very heavy 
traffic and in an area that was consistently dangerous.  The 
operational people on this mission were highly trained and 
technically aware of what was going on.  They were the most 
professional people I have dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to commend the men and women of the 
Canadian forces for the work that they do on our behalf and on 
behalf of all of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member talked about figures being used on this side of the House 
as if they came out of comic books.  He also talked about the 
great deal and the amount of savings to the government in the 
present tender call.  I remind the member that a six pack is 
cheaper than a dozen any day of the week.  Let us compare apples 
and apples when we talk about costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister spoke this morning he talked about the 
different references that would be included in the tender call. 
He did not mention the word commonality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A study conducted for the Department of National Defence by one 
of the minister's associate departments showed that by choosing 
the helicopter that could do both services, over $257 million in 
1990 dollars could be saved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member table those figures to show that there is no 
other avenue the government could have explored?   Would he tell 
us if the government considered the commonality factor when 
assessing the tender call to make sure Canadians got the best 
bang for their buck?  We are not talking about saving money here, 
we are talking about saving lives.  It is not the dollar value 
that counts, it is the service and equipment we get for the 
dollars we spend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am more than happy to 
include the numbers I gave in my speech.  I know the Conservative 
Party does not think about dollars.  If it thought about dollars 
it would still be the ruling party.  It wanted to spend millions 
of extra dollars on cadillacs so their members could run around 
in armour plated vehicles.  That is why the party was reduced to 
two people in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those two saw the light and is now the leader of the 
Liberal Party in Quebec.  The member for Compton—Stanstead saw 
the light and came over, and is now the vice-chair for defence 
and veteran's affairs.  It is a step up when one becomes part of 
a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned.  Our first concern as a government is to 
make sure the men and women of the Canadian forces are properly 
supplied, properly trained, have the right equipment, operate in 
the safest environment and still save the taxpayers money.  That 
is what this government is all about.  That is what we are doing. 
The Conservative Party will be down to two again if it keeps 
talking about spending taxpayer money lightly and loosely, as it 
has in the past. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
be happy to table the figures from Liberal programs that show 
they spent $8.2 billion when they replaced the Labradors, and now 
the helicopters.  Guess what?  There will be 33 helicopters. That 
is the total.  We would have had 43 helicopters at a cost of $5.8 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is $8.2 billion versus $5.8 billion.  The taxpayers have 
been taken.  I will table the documents and I have no problem in 
doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am certainly glad the 
member for Saint John is tabling Liberal documents.  Obviously 
the Conservative Party does not have any of its own.  I would be 
more than happy to see them tabled and to deal with them.  I am 
sure that if she had checked with some of the people she had 
dealt with in the past who are now Liberals, they could probably 
get her some more really good numbers that make perfect sense for 
any government to follow. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this supply day motion, and I 
commend the member of the Conservative Party for bringing the 
motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely important issue and I am quite stunned 
listening to the parliamentary secretary to the minister.  He 
makes it sound like everything is just great in the military.  He 
indicated that the equipment is top notch, that things are going 
in the right direction and that everything is fine.  I will talk 
a little about that toward the end of my presentation because the 
defence minister said the same thing at the defence suppliers' 
conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about how the attitude that everything is okay 
really does not bode well for the replacement of the helicopters 
or for the military generally.  That kind of attitude in the 
minds of and coming from the lips of the minister and the 
parliamentary secretary certainly causes me great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is about having a fair and open process for replacing 
the Sea Kings. 
I do not think anyone would argue that the Sea Kings are in need 
of replacement.  However, this motion may turn out to be entirely 
irrelevant.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a rumour this morning that the government already has a 
plan in place to deal with the Sea King problem.  The plan is to 
put ejection seats in the helicopters.  God knows, we cannot 
afford to lose as many pilots as we are losing helicopters as 
these helicopters drop from the sky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government plan, and this is just a rumour, is to put 
ejection seats in the helicopters and apparently the contractor 
can put in an inflatable life raft.  The pilot will need to blow 
it up when he is in the water, but there will be a life raft 
attached to the seat and everything will be fine.  No one have 
not quite figured out how to deal with the roof of the helicopter 
coming off and some other little details, but the government does 
have a plan in place for dealing with the Sea King problem. I say 
this tongue in cheek.  It is obviously meant to be humorous but 
it is not really funny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My nephew flew a Sea King out of Halifax for about five years. 
He did not seem too concerned about it when he was single and 
before he had a child.  He knew the Sea Kings had problems on a 
regular basis and that they were ditched quite often.  He knew 
they flew in some of the most difficult conditions on the face of 
the earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My nephew is a young fellow.  He already had a commercial 
licence when he went into the military.  He wanted to fly an F-18 
but unfortunately the government cut back that program just as he 
enlisted, so he went with the Sea Kings.  He was committed to the 
military.  He wanted to do his job and do it well, and he did. 
For the length of his contract he flew the Sea Kings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His attitude, I sensed, changed when his first child was born. 
As parents we often think about life a little differently when we 
have the extra responsibility of a child.  I sensed at the time 
he had the child that he was not happy at all to be flying those 
old Sea King helicopters.  He knew the risk to him was greater 
than necessary.  He was willing to take a risk.  I never sensed 
that he was ever ready to back off on a risk, but he knew the 
risk was greater than could be reasonably expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, when it came time to renew the contract he did 
not want to fly the Sea Kings any more.  He wanted to get back 
into the F-18 program.  They had been losing pilots.  He was 
trained on a twin engine machine the same as the F-18s.  There 
were a lot of similarities, which might sound a little 
surprising.  He told the government he wanted an assurance that 
he would go back into the F-18 program if he was to renew his 
contract.  He could not get that assurance.  A trained pilot with 
years of experience was lost because the government has no 
serious commitment to the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the minister's attitude and what he said 
recently at the conference.  However, with that kind of attitude 
in place, I do not see an awful lot of hope for the future of the 
Canadian military as long as this minister and this government 
are in charge.  I am very concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sea King replacement program is not new.  The Sea Kings are 
from 1964.  They are almost 40 years old.  My nephew, when he 
started flying them, was under 25 years of age.  He was so much 
older than the Sea Kings that it is not even fair to compare 
their ages.  It would make him sound like an old man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Replacing the Sea King was first talked about and seriously 
considered in the 1970s.  Here we are in 2001 and there is still 
no real commitment to replacing them.  I do not think the 
commitment is there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Sea King and the Labrador search and rescue 
helicopters, which are flown by the air force today, were slated 
for replacement with the EH-101. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Conservative Party and the governing party have 
been back and forth on the issue for some time, each saying their 
program is less expensive than the other.  In reality, the 
program which was put forth by the Conservative government, when 
we compare apples to apples and equipment to equipment and do a 
fair comparison, was a much better deal than the deal the 
Liberals are considering now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $500 million cancellation cost is lost.  The cost of 
replacing the helicopters is greater when we compare apples to 
apples and oranges to oranges.  When buying military equipment a 
bare bones helicopter is probably less than half the cost.  The 
equipment put into it is the greatest cost.  That is what we must 
look at when we compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The points have been made by members of the Conservative Party 
and countered, completely inaccurately, by members of the 
governing party.  The issue has been dealt with.  What I will 
talk a little more about is the government's general lack of 
commitment to the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we heard last week at the conference of defence 
associations was startling.  The defence minister and the chief 
of defence staff both proclaimed that the Canadian forces, with 
fewer than 60,000 soldiers, was in better shape than at the end 
of the cold war when it had 80,000 men and women in uniform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for the Canadian military stood at the 
conference and said that things were in great shape, the military 
was better than it was 10 years ago and that we were doing a 
great job.  Someone without a clue about the military might think 
that was great because it is better than it was 10 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for the minister, the very next speaker was, who? 
The very next speaker was Major-General MacKenzie, a well 
respected man in the Canadian military and a respected analyst of 
the Canadian military.  He stood right after the minister and 
said that the army could not fight and that the uniformed 
leadership should have a right to say so.  He made it clear that 
we have terrific men and women serving in the military. The 
problem is the lack of commitment on the part of the government 
to replace equipment, such as the Sea Kings.  The problem is the 
lack of proper training and the lack of money for the military. 
The little bit of money added to the spending today will not 
solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right after the minister stood up and said that everything was 
okay, we had Major-General Mackenzie saying that things were an 
absolute mess.  When he asked for a show of hands from anyone at 
the conference of defence associations who honestly believed the 
military was in as good shape as it was 10 years ago, not one 
hand went up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who knows anything about the military knows that if a 
defence minister stands at a conference like that and says that 
things are great and that they are better than they were 10 years 
ago, the minister either does not know what is going on or he 
does not care.  It is one or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have a minister who thinks like that and says things 
like that, what hope is there for getting an acceptable 
replacement for the Sea King?  What hope is there for getting 
acceptable equipment in any area?  What hope is there of getting 
proper uniforms for our men and women? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was deputy defence critic three years ago we were 
debating soldiers' uniforms and basic things like personal kits, 
and the debate had already been going on for a couple of years. 
Today we send men and women on overseas missions without proper, 
basic equipment like uniforms. 
What kind of commitment is that to our military?  It is 
disgusting.

Speaker, based on the comments being given opposite it is very 
clear that they have absolutely no interest in assisting the 
military.  It seems to me too that they are writing off Atlantic 
Canada because after all it is Atlantic Canada that stands to 
benefit as a result of the kind of movement we are making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have talked about political interference. They 
are the last people who should be lecturing anyone about 
political interference, especially in light of some of the 
comments made by their critic, the member for Calgary Northeast, 
who said that we should use the notwithstanding clause to get rid 
of recruiting targets that were mandated by the human rights 
tribunal and which were designated to diversify the ethnic and 
gender representation in the military.  Talk about political 
interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that the prescribed levels of women and 
visible minorities in the Canadian armed forces had compromised 
combat capability.  Shame on him. Finally he asked if we would 
force aboriginal people to serve in the navy?  It is insane and 
dangerous.  Does that not sum up exactly what those people stand 
for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Tuesday there was a press release given by the member for 
St. Albert in which he said the government was on a spending 
spree.  One of the departments in which we spent money was 
defence.  Would the member talk to the member for St. Albert and 
tell him to get his facts straight?  More to the point, would the 
member make sure that he supports the kind of spending that we 
are doing, and rightfully so, in the military? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an absolutely 
legitimate concern that the government is on a spending spree. 
The problem is that its priorities are all wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bit of extra money it will put into the military this year 
does not even bring it back to the level of spending when we came 
here in 1993.  In spite of the fact that the salaries have gone 
up, all those costs have gone up and it is still not back to 
level of 1993.  There is no commitment to the military.  The 
commitment is to putting more money into the human resources 
department so that the minister could use it to gain political 
benefit.  That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where the extra spending has gone, to that kind of 
thing.  That is the kind of program that is improper.  It 
demonstrates that the government does not have a clue about 
setting priorities.  The military, which protect the country and 
its citizens, should be a top priority of the federal government. 
Yet the commitment is not there.  The minister stood last week at 
a conference and said that things were better than they were 10 
years ago.  Anybody who has a clue about reality knows that is 
absolutely ridiculous.

would be more than it was before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I advise the House that the EH-101 was $5.7 billion less the 
cost of the search and rescue helicopters, which brings it down 
to a $2 billion difference.  After we take off the $500 million 
penalty and the additional cost of operating the existing fleet, 
it still leaves a savings of $1.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely wrong.  It will not cost more.  It will 
be $1.5 billion less to Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that kind of comment 
demonstrates that Liberal backbenchers are willing to be like 
puppets.  They get the information from the minister and are 
willing to go ahead and spew those figures.

know that what is priced out there is not the same as was priced 
out when the Conservatives made the deal before the 1993

there are procurement problems throughout the military.  I will 
expand the debate a little to talk about other procurement 
difficulties that the government is having. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an ex-member of the Royal Canadian Air Force of the sixties, 
I can make some comparisons today when I look at the equipment in 
the military and the numbers of members of the military.  I 
reflect back to that period of time and the pride that we had in 
the equipment of the day.  Even though through the years it was 
modernized somewhat, there was an inherent pride which seems to 
be missing through many parts of the military today because of 
procurement problems and being delayed for so long on necessary 
equipment purchases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example is one of the recent cutbacks which needs to be 
questioned, the cutback of the patrol times of the Aurora 
aircraft.  Patrol times have been cut down from 19,200 hours in 
1993 when the Liberals came into office to 11,500 hours today. 
Their wish is to cut those times further to an unacceptable 8,000 
hours per year, despite a written recommendation by the chief of 
the air force who stated emphatically that less than 11,500 hours 
would result in an unacceptable impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the increasing use of the northwest passage, coupled with 
increasing numbers of polar overflights, one might argue for more 
patrol hours rather than less in order to assert our presence and 
our sovereignty in the far north.  We must remember the 
circumstances of the United States ship, the <I>Manhattan</I>, and 
how its presence challenged our Arctic sovereignty not too many 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have generals who describe our current military by using such 
words as irrelevant.  That is shameful.  Two million Canadians 
served in Canada's military in the last century and did so with 
great pride.  Successive governments have decimated our military 
readiness in many areas, including Arctic patrols and equipment 
maintenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently military trucks were not available to tow the cannons 
to Parliament Hill for ceremonies.  They had to be towed here by 
motor league tow trucks. It is just one example of how we are 
treating their maintenance.  I would say that is a foreseeable 
maintenance issue that should be projected.  What hope do we have 
if we need these services overseas?  Is there a local chapter in 
Bosnia of the motor league? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was detected recently that our CF-18s have moisture problems 
in the honeycombing of the wings, another procurement problem. 
Are we projecting ahead?  What are we doing on procurement of 
necessary planes to replace the CF-18?  What are we doing today 
and when is the projection?  Will we be sitting here and talking 
about that 30 years from now?  The CF-18s are from the 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also a recent situation with the Leopard tanks where 
it was reported that over the years the bottoms of the tanks had 
worn so thin that a screwdriver could be pushed through them. 
The solution was to weld plates over the bottom of the tanks 
rather than look at a replacement for a hull that is over 30 
years old.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more recently there was another procurement strategy where 
questions arose.  It was reported that military barracks in 
Alberta were being abandoned barely four years after they were 
constructed.  The reason was that hundreds of cracks appeared in 
the foundation, another procurement difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing spoke louder of Canada's lack of mobilization capability 
than the recent incidents on the high seas when 10% of our 
military equipment was held hostage until we had to forcibly 
board and take it back.  Should we consider procurement 
capabilities and heavy lift capabilities for the armed forces?  I 
think so.  Our lack of heavy lift capability let a private 
shipping company seriously embarrass us in the eyes of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compounding of this disgrace was illustrated when only one 
of the two helicopters that set out to intercept the ship made it 
to the ship.  The second one had to turn back because of 
mechanical failures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military has not seriously listened to the concerns of 
current and former armed forces personnel about its physical 
welfare.  Current and former armed forces personnel were recently 
told that their complaints about mysterious physical ailments 
were likely their own fault, apparently because they are 
overstressed with worry.  In short, they are sick with worrying 
about their health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Curiously senior military personnel in European countries and 
NATO have not adopted the shortsightedness of their Canadian 
counterparts.  Among non-Canadian military personnel depleted 
uranium with increasing frequency is being singled out as a 
potential contaminant of the greatest concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the end of the 
gulf war, but on a rather sour note because we still will not 
acknowledge the soldiers who served in that war as being war 
veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must as a nation demonstrate a renewed commitment to the 
future well-being of our armed forces.  I have seen time and 
again that whenever Canadians are reminded of how today's 
freedoms are due to the current and past sacrifices of many in 
our military they respond generously and with gratitude. Concerns 
for the well-being of our military personnel should be shared by 
all and entrenched in military operations manuals and directives. 
It is those in our military who are entrusted to carry the torch 
in the name of our war dead to protect the peace and freedoms 
that we as Canadians enjoy today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
procurement strategy that has been laid out by the government 
includes a prequalification process which will make key technical 
requirements available to bidders as early as possible and aid 
them in receiving technical compliance of Canadian helicopters 
and mission systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member believe that the process of issuing letters of 
interest, of having a dialogue with the aerospace industry and of 
having a prequalification process is in the best interest of 
Canada, our military and our taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, coming from a background 
in the construction industry where there are a number of 
initiatives where people prequalify, I believe the 
prequalification has to be open enough.  At times 
prequalification in the construction industry is sometimes too 
narrowly focused.  It would have to be on the understanding that 
it would be open to the maximum number of people qualifying to 
bid on it.  When examining the proposals that come in certainly 
we would reach a point in time when the door has to be closed to 
get on with sincere bidding processes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three problems that the minister must address.  First, 
there is still an unlevel playing field for Canadian farmers 
today.  Canada spends 0.78% of its GDP on agricultural support 
while the U.S. spends 1.07% of its GDP on agricultural support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, input costs are going up at an alarming rate.  The cost 
of putting fuel in tractors, combines and other farm equipment 
went from 37 cents a litre to over 50 cents a litre for the crop 
year starting in 2000.  Nitrogen in some cases has gone from 16 
cents a pound to 40 cents a pound this spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the value of the commodity has gone down drastically.  In 
1996 a producer received $5.50 a bushel for wheat.  Today that 
same bushel of wheat is returning $2.45.  The same year canola 
returned $10 a bushel and today it is $5.18 a bushel. We need two 
more things—

last October, the World March of Women captured the attention of 
the entire world.  Canadians and Quebecers marched to back up 
their demands at the provincial, federal and international 
levels.  They called for equity, not violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These marchers understood that the power is theirs and that it 
is their duty to exercise it.  Yet sexist attitudes still 
prevail:  pay inequity, lack of recognition for the 
sociopolitical contribution of women, refusal to recognize the 
equality of the sexes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, which boasts that it is the best country in the world 
but does not respect women, mothers, and female workers, is a 
poor model indeed.  Once again, those who preach democracy around 
the world are knowingly passing the buck.

up until their rights are fully recognized.  And they have the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for almost two years now the Prime 
Minister has been stumbling over questions from the opposition 
related to the Shawinigan file, but yesterday he fell flat on his 
face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He declared unequivocally in the House that when he was elected 
he had revealed to the ethics counsellor that he was owed money 
on the shares in the golf course.  Yesterday the ethics 
counsellor contradicted that.  I have the Prime Minister's public 
declaration of declarable assets.  There is no mention of the 
over $200,000 debt for the sale of the golf course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple.  Why did the Prime Minister not 
declare the debt owed to him from the golf course to the ethics 
counsellor when he should have? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I gave all my assets to the lawyer who is my trustee and 
she had all the discussions with everyone.  She informed the 
ethics counsellor or the staff of the ethics counsellor.  It was 
a time when they were doing a lot of work because all the 
ministers were doing the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were informed.  It was not an obligation to reveal this 
type of asset but she revealed it anyway.  That is exactly what 
the ethics counsellor said.  He said it was not an obligation and 
she did it right at the beginning. 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's own words on 
June 8, 1999, showed that it was an obligation to reveal it. That 
is in his own words.  He should have done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He lent someone as much as $200,000 to $300,000 in the purchase 
of the shares in the golf course.  He neglected to tell the 
ethics counsellor about it.  The reason that he did not tell him 
about it was because he did not want the ethics counsellor to 
know about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did he hide an asset worth over a quarter of a million 
dollars from the ethics counsellor?  It is not on the file.  It 
is not there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I gave all my assets to my trustee.  I checked again 
with her yesterday and this asset was declared to the officers at 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She repeated that.  She said that she discussed my file with the 
ethics counsellor and the staff of the ethics counsellor.  She 
revealed it for me after I transmitted my assets a few days after 
I became Prime Minister. It was a problem for her and not a 
problem for me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry but he did not declare it 
in 1993.  As a matter of fact three years went by.  He thought 
the little secret would not come out, but when it did not go 
through in 1996, only then was he forced to confess to the ethics 
counsellor that he had this loan of over $200,000.  Then he was 
given three years to sell it or to declare it.  He did neither of 
those for another three years until the opposition forced him to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that first he hid it from the ethics counsellor; then he 
hid it from the House; and now he has tried to hide it from the 
Canadian people.  Why—

explained time and time again that there was no conflict of

and the auberge, that I did nothing wrong and that I followed all 
the rules.  The RCMP did the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always followed the guidelines.  I have not misled

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left>The conflict of interest code states that public officeholders 
can only be involved in their blind trust after the ethics

</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case it was the Prime Minister who informed the ethics

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

knows all the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I became the Prime Minister.  I had sold my shares before I was 
sworn in.  I had sold my interest in the hotel six months before. 
The day after I became Prime Minister my assets were transferred 
to my trustee, like anybody else.  She had to deal with the 
ethics counsellor.  He returned a certificate to me saying that 
he was satisfied with what I did. He repeated that to the public 
time and time again. 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley,

elected as Prime Minister in 1993.  It was only after the Prime 
Minister contacted the ethics counsellor on January 27, 1996, 
that he began to lobby for loans and grants for the neighbouring 
Auberge Grand-Mère. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister ensured that the hotel got loans from the 
BDC, the Business Development Bank of Canada, immigrant 
investors, and grants from human resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the Prime Minister not acting more like a businessperson 
concerned about his assets than he was like a normal, ordinary 
member of parliament?

with 19% unemployment and the Prime Minister, as the member for 
Saint-Maurice, had the duty to make sure that any project 
creating jobs would receive the grants that were available to any 
other business in any other riding.

the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs reacted to the

international relations, by saying that Quebec had the 
constitutional right to not implement certain provisions of a 
future treaty on a free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the federal government knows that Quebec will not feel 
bound by commitments made by Canada without prior approval from 
the province, would it not be more advisable to proceed with a 
true consultation, instead of being arrogant? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the provinces are being consulted in certain areas. I am even 
told that it is a former deputy minister of education in Quebec 
who is in charge of the negotiations. Everyone is involved, but 
when it comes to international relations, it is the federal 
government that represents all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the provincial government is free to walk out and 
reject free trade in provincial jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>His minister is describing us, and 
describing the Government of Quebec as irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But who is irresponsible? The government that protects its

one is irresponsible?

$470 million from last year.  All the agriculture minister has 
done is replaced what the government has already taken away from 
farmers.

supplementary estimates and read them in the way they are 
supposed to be read, he would see that we did not cut money to 
agriculture.  I suggest that if he does not know how to read them 
he should get a briefing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we did today is we added $500 million and, with the support 
of the provinces, that will be $830 million more for farmers in 
Canada now than it was before lunch today.

Mr. Speaker, recently, when it was pointed out to the finance

endlessly about everything except the highways.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the amount of money is $600 million over six years, 
$100 million a year over the entire country, $10 million for the 
province of British Columbia.  This is absolutely pathetic.  We 
know the government spends hundreds of millions if not billions 
of dollars in other provincial projects in conjunction with the

serious about infrastructure from coast to coast and B.C. is just 
as important as any other part of this country when it comes to 
infrastructure.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order with respect to the motion under 
Government Business No. 2.  I implore the Chair to grant me a few 
minutes. This is a point I want to raise with this House and with 
you in particular, Mr. Speaker, knowing full well that you will 
be concerned by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Tuesday of this week, the government used closure 
to force the House to change the amendment process in the 
Standing Orders of the House. 
The government took this action after giving notice once, last 
Friday, following only two hours of debate.  We want our 
amendments respected at committee report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to understand at the moment and to grasp this new 
rule the government has imposed on the House.  I refer in 
particular to the last sentence of the new government rule, which 
states, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—in exercising this power of selection, the Speaker shall be 
guided by the practice followed in the House of Commons of the 
United Kingdom. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is essentially what Erskine May said in a document in 
English only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to understand the subtlety of this regulatory 
innovation. 
We asked the Journals Branch of the House of Commons for 
information in French, so as to understand that new rule. Nothing 
is available in French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite understandable, since documents are not translated 
in French in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. Gone are 
the days when French was the language of the monarchy. As a 
francophone member of parliament from Quebec who wants to 
understand the subtleties of that new rule, I would like to at 
least have the opportunity to examine it in my own language. It 
would make it easier to understand and to discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can I do my job properly if I must draft amendments and the 
rules governing that process remain an unfathomable mystery 
because they are in English? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 133 of the Constitution Act, of 1867, guarantees and 
protects my right to use my language, French, during the 
proceedings of the House of Commons. This is a right, and I want 
that right to be respected. A number of hon. members in this 
House have always fought and continue to fight to have French 
recognized. The hon. government House leader is a prime example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one here is able to tell me in my own language the scope of 
that rule. But to do my work effectively as a member of 
parliament, I must understand the nuances and subtleties of a 
rule of law. I must understand its very essence. In order to do 
so, I must have an opportunity to study that rule in my language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only anglophone members of parliament will have that privilege. 
Until all members of the House have access to complete, 
substantive rules and a full description in the French language 
of the practices of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, 
it is impossible for me to know and to understand what now 
constitutes a satisfactory amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am entitled to have at my disposal the necessary tools to 
present an effective argument.  I must be able to reply to 
objections when members try to attack our amendments.  As a 
francophone MP, this new rule subjects me to an arbitrary and 
inaccessible decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the 21st century.  When my amendments are attacked, I am 
entitled to be able to reply knowledgeably.  I am entitled to 
know the rules of this House and to have access to them in my 
mother tongue, French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until my rights and those of other francophones are protected 
and respected, I respectfully and humbly ask that the Chair 
suspend the execution of this measure.  Francophone members must 
be on an equal footing with the other members of this House when 
we prepare amendments.  A double standard will never do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all entitled to an equal opportunity to have our 
amendments selected, debated and voted on in the House.  I 
should not be penalized because I work in French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am calling on you to do is to protect the rights of all 
members of the House and to treat us all alike in the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government unilaterally invoked closure.  This was a blatant 
attack by the government on one of the linguistic groups sitting 
in this House, and was not what we expected from many hon. 
members, including the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We francophone MPs have had rules and practices imposed on us 
and will have to work with them in English only.  We really 
cannot call London every time we want to understand how the rule 
works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to hire translators to consult officials in London? Would 
it be up to them to explain to us, poor francophones that we 
are, the subtleties of the rule?  I ask the question quite simply 
and with all due respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I ask you to declare this rule inoperative.  This is 
not the first time that the rules have created a conflict with 
reality.  Some of your predecessors, Mr. Speaker, have addressed 
similar situations.  I ask you to declare that linguistic 
equality, the creator of opportunities in this House, will take 
precedence so that all members may have the same opportunity to 
learn the rules of the game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would remind you that we have a law in Canada 
called the Official Languages Act.  Very quickly, I quote for 
your consideration two paragraphs to the preamble to the act. The 
first indicates that the law provides: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—full and equal 
access to Parliament, to the laws of Canada and to courts— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth paragraph is of particular interest to us as it 
pertains to the work involved in putting amendments forward, 
because the government House leader's motion deals with this: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—officers and employees of institutions of the Parliament or 
government of Canada should have equal opportunities to use the 
official language of their choice while working together in 
pursuing the goals of those institutions; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by reminding the House of section 2 of the act, 
which reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>a</I>) ensure respect for English and French— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if it had been decided in this House that, from now on, 
in order to help members make decisions, we will be using 
documents in French only. Some MPs would have stood up and said 
“This is treason. Quebec is once again taking precedence. 
Francophones want to take control”. But think about it. As the 
act says, we must: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>a</I>) ensure respect for English and French as the official 
languages of Canada and ensure equality of status and equal 
rights and privileges as to their use in all federal 
institutions— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what is most important: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—in particular with respect to their use in parliamentary 
proceedings, in legislative and other instruments— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit this argument—knowing you, Mr. Speaker, 
and knowing the parliamentarians in this House—and I hope for a 
ruling in favour of removing this insulting measure which 
prevents us from working in both official languages and 
understanding a very important process, namely the procedure 
regarding amendments made to any government bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this time. I truly 
appreciate it and I am waiting for your comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

</I></B></P><P align=left>The articles of our present rules, the Parliament of Canada Act, 
all refer to the fact that we are guided by the principle of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we rejected our style of parliament?  Are we going to 
reject the fact that we live in a system known as responsible 
government? What kind of nonsense is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are doing this to make a cheap political point, to try to 
monopolize a rule that does not even exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What upsets me the most is that the hon. member is using the 
language of my ancestors, of my children and of my grandchildren 
to do so.  This is the shameful part.  He should rise and offer 
his apologies to this hon. House for daring to perpetrate such an 
act today.  The member opposite knows full well he is in the 
wrong.  He knows what he has just said is not right.  But it has 
been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Speaker of the House knows these rules much 
better than I do. And I know as well that he will recognize that 
we are guided everywhere, unless indicated elsewhere in the 
Standing Orders, by the practices of the United Kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite claimed that I drew on Erskine May.  Even if 
that were true, and it is not, Erskine May's is one of our 
procedural manuals on the table before me in this hon. House, 
quoted by one and all, including the person today in the Chair. 
The member opposite knows better than what he is saying, and I 
know that he will fail to influence the Chair, which will act 
with its usual wisdom. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am surprised to hear such rhetoric from the government 
House leader. I guess it is somewhat embarrassing to get caught 
with one's pants down. And the government House leader is 
obviously embarrassed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He feels compelled to invoke the Canadian constitution, which 
tells us of course that this parliament is a British type of 
parliament and that, consequently, its rules and procedures are 
patterned on those of the United Kingdom parliament. He feels 
compelled to do that to refute the argument of the hon. member 
for Richmond—Arthabaska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, allow me to say that, in my opinion, the point 
raised by the member for Richmond—Arthabaska is of the utmost 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government House leader thought that the section of the 
Canadian constitution was enough for us to understand his motion, 
why did he feel necessary to include in Government Business No. 2 
an explicit reference to the fact that the Speaker shall be 
guided by the practice followed in the House of Commons of the 
United Kingdom? This is a fundamental issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is indeed a British type of parliament. But all of us in 
this House know that, while this parliament may be a British type 
of parliament, it has its own distinctive features and rules.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently we cannot decide from the outset that whatever 
applies in the United Kingdom automatically applies here in 
Canada, since we have our own rules and precedents. Only in the 
absence of rules and precedents do we look at how things are done 
in London, only then do we look at the rules and precedents are 
in London. Otherwise, we follow our own rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, in the Parliament of Canada, we have our own rules and I 
fail to see why we should get excited the way the government 
House leader has about the fact that we simply want to point out 
that among these rules there is one requiring that this 
parliament operate in both official languages, French and 
English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the motion refers to the United Kingdom.  Suppose 
that this motion had referred to practices in effect in France's 
national assembly.  What would have been the reaction of our 
anglophone colleagues?  They would have said “My God, what are 
the practices of the French national assembly, and how can I 
become familiar with them, because they are available in French 
only?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point being made by the member for Richmond—Arthabaska is 
of the utmost importance. For that reason alone, Mr. Speaker, you 
must give it consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add another reason, which I mentioned in my speech on 
the motion of the government House leader.  Naturally, he 
reminded us that his motion had been duly passed in the House. I 
need hardly point out that this motion, which amends a practice 
of this parliament, was imposed by the government majority, that 
the opposition parties did not support this practice that the 
government House leader wants to introduce, that he did not even 
have the courage to amend the standing orders, and that he is 
indirectly trying to force you, Mr. Speaker, to take a stand in a 
political debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, with respect to the intervention by my colleague 
from Richmond—Arthabaska and with respect to the motion itself, 
as passed by the government majority, I refer you to pages 260

very important point has been raised and I suggest to you that it 
is not a very important point.

written in the years 1688 and 1689.  That was the bill of rights 
that happened to have been written in the English language in the 
United Kingdom as it then was.  In the Parliament of Canada Act,

have evolved in the parliamentary envelope, all the way from the 
beginning of Confederation.  We still do it, we continue to do it 
and there is nothing improper.  I do not happen to think it is a 
very important point, although the fact that the House should 
always be operating in two languages is, and the House does, and 
there have been two languages used on this point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the reference to the Parliament of Canada Act will help

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be very brief on this point and I will speak in my first 
language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak of the law of Canada and particularly the 
Official Languages Act of Canada.  Many members of the House will 
remember not many months ago when we stood in tribute to the 
memory of the late Right Hon. Pierre Trudeau.  He was a man with 
whom I disagreed on many matters.  He brought in a law that wrote 
into the law of the land the bilingual nature of this country and 
particularly of this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many of us here in the House who fought to support 
that law and fought to support that principle.  That is the 
principle that is at risk here today.  If we, citing laws from a 
century ago, a time when Canada was a colony of Britain and not 
an independent country, start a precedent here of saying that the 
unilingualism that was part of Canada's past should prevail over 
the bilingualism that is part of Canada's law and present, then 
we are on a dangerous and slippery slope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I frankly am shocked to hear these arguments coming from 
members of the party that was created and given such momentum by 
the late Mr. Trudeau, by members of the party of the late Mr. 
Pearson who fought so hard to assure a respect for the official 
languages of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Official Languages Act is clear.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this Act is to—ensure equality of status and 
equal rights and privileges as to their use in all federal 
institutions, in particular with respect to their use in 
parliamentary proceedings, in legislative and other instruments, 
in the administration of justice, in communicating with or 
providing services to the public and in carrying out the work of 
federal institutions— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the central and most important federal institution of 
the land.  If we are not, on a particular item, going to respect 
the full import of the Official Languages Act in the proceedings 
of this parliament, then it is in danger everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is raised by my colleague as a point of order.  It could 
almost be a point of privilege because it goes to the roots of 
the purpose of the House and it goes to the roots of the 
bilingual nature of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all engaged in debate in the House and sometimes said 
intemperate things.  All of us do.  I would hope that the 
government House leader and his colleagues will consider what he 
has just said.  I would hope that they would consider the tone in 
which he spoke, perhaps not deliberately; that is not the issue. 
No one is accusing anyone of anything deliberate, although I have 
to say that if this is proceeded with, if there is an attempt to 
steamroll over this legitimate concern that has been raised by 
francophone and other members of the House, then it becomes a 
deliberate slight of the principles of the law concerning the 
Official Languages Act of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on my colleagues in the Liberal Party, a party I worked 
with in having the Official Languages Act adopted across Canada, 
to reconsider and to insist on the application in fact here of 
the fundamental principle of this act as concerns the rights of 
the francophone members of this House.

Speaker, I also want to associate our party with the remarks of 
the right hon. gentleman from Calgary Centre.  As a westerner I 
see how important it is that we have the absolute equality of the 
two languages in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the great debate over the Official Languages Act in 
1969 when I was a member of parliament, and I remember the 
commitment made by all three parties in the House at that time 
that the two languages would be absolutely equal here in the 
House of Commons.  I think that is a fundamental principle and it 
is a principle we must continue. 
What happened the other day in the House of Commons runs the risk 
of deviating from that principle.  I hope that the minister will 
come back and amend what he said in the House a short time ago.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am now ready to rule on the 
question of privilege raised by the opposition House leader, the 
hon. member for Fraser Valley, on February 13, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequent to the adoption of a time allocation motion in 
relation to Bill C-2, an act to amend the Employment Insurance 
Act and employment insurance regulations, the hon. member rose on 
a question of privilege to express his concern and dismay about 
the frequency with which the government had resorted to time 
allocation to cut off debate prematurely on legislation during 
the 35th and 36th parliaments, a trend he believes is to continue 
in the present parliament.  The hon. member claimed that the 
government's use of time allocation was a misuse of its authority 
and that the time had come “to declare the measures imposed by 
the government today as excessive and unorthodox”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member argued that the Speaker has the authority to 
refuse to put a time allocation motion if, in his judgment, the 
government is abusing its powers and the rules of the House by 
not allowing sufficient amount of time for debate.  He concluded 
his argument by suggesting that the Speaker consider the amount 
of authority and discretion available to the Chair to decide not 
to propose to the House a motion of time allocation if there has 
not been a sufficient period of time for debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the hon. government House leader, the House 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois, the hon. member for Roberval, the 
House leader of the New Democratic Party, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona, the House leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party, the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, and the hon. member for St. 
Albert for their interventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The request that is being made of the Chair in this instance is 
one which places me in a position of some delicacy.  It is, of 
course, true that the Chair uses its discretion on every occasion 
on which it intervenes.  That is not to say, however, that 
rulings are made simply on the Speaker's personal authority. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I> states, at page 570, 
and I quote: 
<UL><UL>

</I></B></P><P align=left>In a ruling on a similar case, Speaker Fraser said, at 
<I>Debates</I>, March 31, 1993, page 17860: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it is not always understood that the Chair is constrained in 
what the Chair can do by the rules which this House has passed. 
It is not surprising that sometimes some hon. Members, or even 
members of the public, feel that the rules we have set for 
ourselves may in some cases be unreasonable or even worse. 
However, it is extremely important I think that the Chair be 
bound by those rules until the House decides to change them. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case which gave rise to the point which I am addressing, 
there has been no suggestion that the government in any way 
deviated from the procedure laid out in the standing orders.  I 
do not feel, under those circumstances, that there are any 
grounds whatsoever which would lead the Chair to intervene.  The 
Chair wishes to be very clear on this point.  The rules and 
practices established by this House with respect to time 
allocation leave the Speaker with no alternative in this matter. 
Speaker Fraser said in the case to which I have already referred, 
at <I>Debates</I> March 31, 1993, page 17861: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to advise the House that the rule is clear.  It is within 
the government's discretion to use it.  I cannot find any lawful 
way that I can exercise a discretion which would unilaterally 
break a very specific rule. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In making this ruling, Speaker Fraser was faced with arguments 
very close to those before us in the present case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of the extent of the Speaker's authority has been 
raised and reference has been made to the practice in the United 
Kingdom.  The government House leader indicated in his comments 
on this question that in other jurisdictions greater use is made 
of the scheduling of work both in the House and in committee.  It 
may be that the House is no longer satisfied with the manner in 
which the time allocation rule works.  If that is so, it is for 
the House to consider and, ultimately, to determine what 
procedure will best suit its current circumstances.  Planning 
done on the basis of consensus could be a significant benefit, 
not only for the business of the House but also in promoting an 
atmosphere of decorum and respect in which that business is 
conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system has always been one which functions on the basis of 
rules established by the House itself.  However, under our 
current standing orders, it would be highly inappropriate for the 
Chair to take unilateral action on issues already provided for in 
the standing orders.  Where the standing orders gives the Speaker 
some discretion, then it is the Speaker's responsibility to be 
guided accordingly; where no such guidance is provided, no such 
action can be taken.  It is certainly not up to the Chair to 
establish a timetable for the business of the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is by its rules and not by the authority of the Speaker that 
the House protects itself from excesses, both on the government 
side and on that of the opposition.  The Speaker's role is to 
judge each case as it arises, fairly and objectively, and in so 
doing, to ensure that those rules are applied as the House 
intended. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Lamoureux, when faced with a similar situation stated in 
<I>Journals</I> July 24, 1969, page 1398: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker is the servant of the House.  Honourable Members may 
want me to be the master of the House today but tomorrow, when, 
perhaps in other circumstances I might claim this privilege, they 
might have a different opinion—I am not prepared at this time 
to take this responsibility on my shoulders.  I think it is my 
duty to rule on such matters in accordance with the rules, 
regulations and standing orders which honourable Members 
themselves have turned over to the Speaker to administer. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind the House that the standing order 
with respect to time allocation has been invoked only once in 
this, the 37th Parliament.  I have indicated clearly that this 
use of the standing order does not represent a matter of 
privilege.  If further cases arise, the Chair will deal with them 
individually, on their merits.  I remind the House that the Chair 
will not rule on hypothetical cases or on questions raised only 
in the abstract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I would like to thank hon. Members for their 
carefully considered arguments on this question.  The Chair is 
conscious of the importance which members on both sides of the 
House attach to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague about the process 
that has occurred with the Liberal government in terms of it 
cancelling the promise that it made in 1993 to deliver 
helicopters.  We are still paying for that promise now.  We do 
not have the equipment in place right now.  The Prime Minister 
cancelled that unilaterally in 1993.  Could he comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe that overall 
this indicates a dramatic failure of the Liberal government in 
the very basics of governing, which is procuring and supplying 
our armed forces with equipment.  In fact, this has really been a 
25 year procurement boondoggle that is never ending.  It is going 
on and on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in my speech, I related my experience coming from the 
militaries of the 1960s.  Coincidentally this has existed since 
the 1960s.  In 1962, I took electronics training in Clinton, 
Ontario, in the Royal Canadian Air Force.  At that time the 
transistor was considered to be an unreliable; a new invention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that period of time, we have progressed from transistors to 
chips with tens of thousands of transistors on them to fibre 
optics.  The progression has been going on and on.  However where 
are our helicopters?  They are still in the 1960s, while a 
Liberal government waffles and waffles and procurement goes on 
endlessly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I

</I></B></P><P align=left>This my first speech in the 37th parliament.  It is certainly a 
great pleasure to be back.  I would like to take this 
opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to congratulate you on your appointment 
as Deputy Speaker.  I hope you will relay to the Speaker my very 
best wishes and best regards on his election as Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased and deeply honoured that the people of 
Nepean—Carleton have put their trust in me to be their voice in 
this important, historic and, as we have seen, often colourful 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics can be a very busy lifestyle and spouses often bear the 
brunt of that lifestyle.  I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank my wife, Joan, for all her support over three municipal 
elections and two federal elections, all successful I might add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also be remiss if I did not say a few words of thanks to 
my staff.  They are Joan Tierney, Pat Murphy, Carrie Schroder, 
Liz Schlesak and Michael May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to speak on the motion that was moved by my 
hon. colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has demonstrated many times its commitment to 
provide the Canadian forces the equipment it needs to do its job: 
new search and rescue helicopters; new armoured personnel 
carriers; new submarines; upgrades to our CF-18 fighter aircraft; 
and Aurora maritime patrol aircraft.  That is an impressive list 
by any measure.  It does not stop there.  Acquiring new maritime 
helicopters to replace the venerable Sea Kings is also a key part 
of the capital procurement program laid out in the defence white 
paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the government has delivered on its promise by announcing 
last August that it had given the Department of National Defence 
approval to proceed with acquiring a suitable replacement for the 
Sea King.  Our maritime forces must be capable of dealing with a 
wide variety of potential threats. 
They must be capable of controlling events above, on and below 
the surface of the sea.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipborne helicopters are a key component of that capability. 
Such aircraft are indispensable to any navy and significantly 
increase the surveillance, defence and attack capabilities of our 
frigates and destroyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, maritime helicopters play a wide range of roles, 
including search and rescue.  This is an important capability for 
a country that has the longest coastline and the second largest 
land mass in the world, not to mention extreme weather 
conditions.  Operating from our ships, they provide us with a 
unique capability for offshore operations.  Many sailors in 
distress in the frigid waters of the north Atlantic owe their 
lives to these helicopters and the Canadian forces crews who fly 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few years our maritime helicopters have 
participated in disaster relief missions during the Manitoba 
floods of 1997, after the crash of Swissair flight 111 in 
September 1998 and in humanitarian relief operations in Somalia 
and elsewhere around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These aircraft routinely conduct fisheries patrols and have 
assisted the RCMP in drug interdiction operations.  They have 
supported operations preventing the landing of illegal immigrants 
by sea.  They have also participated in peace support operations, 
notably in the Adriatic Sea between 1993 and 1996, in Haiti in 
1993 and 1994, in the Persian Gulf since 1991 and in East Timor 
in 1999.  They constitute an important part of our contribution 
to the defence of North America as part of our naval task groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maritime helicopters are also part of our contribution to NATO's 
Standing Naval Force Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than 35 years the Sea King helicopters have performed 
those duties admirably.  There is no doubt that a new helicopter 
is needed in order to enable the Canadian forces to continue 
making a vital contribution both here in Canada and around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has recognized that need and is moving forward 
with the acquisition of a replacement, but not at any price. 
Taxpayer money will be used wisely and the government will not 
spend any more than it needs to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to providing the Canadian forces 
with a maritime helicopter that will meet its present and future 
needs at the best possible price and over the full life cycle of 
the aircraft.  However, let me be clear.  We will not compromise 
the capability requirements for this replacement aircraft.  These 
requirements are clearly laid out and described in the statement 
of operational requirements that was released last August by the 
Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document was put together by the Department of National 
Defence.  DND conducted an extensive review of its needs using 
contemporary scenarios, and identified operational requirements 
backed by rigorous statistical analysis.  The statement of 
operational requirements is consistent with current defence 
policy and also reflects the changes brought about by the end of 
the cold war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need the kind of helicopter we needed 15 years ago or 
even in 1993 when we cancelled the EH-101 project.  The cold war 
is over.  We are shifting away from open ocean anti-submarine 
warfare to more regional, coastal or littoral operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now need an aircraft that is available in sufficient numbers 
and has the appropriate payload, endurance and mission systems to 
do the job required by tomorrow's security environment.  We need 
a helicopter that has balanced, multipurpose capabilities and 
will meet the needs of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this strong and coherent statement of operational 
requirements, the government will be able to pursue a procurement 
strategy adapted to the times.  Canadian taxpayers will also 
benefit from the strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when counting the $478 million in cancellation fees, the 
cost of the new SAR helicopters and the investments made to 
ensure the continued airworthiness of the Labrador and Sea King 
helicopters, we expect to save Canadians $1.5 billion when 
compared with the cancelled EH-101. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will save money because we will acquire off the shelf 
technologies, not developmental ones.  We will save money because 
we will have a more competitive marketplace and the operational 
requirements now reflect the changes in the strategic 
environment.  We will also save money because we will take into 
account both the purchase price for the helicopter and the cost 
of maintaining it through its life cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we get delivery of the new maritime helicopters the 
Canadian forces will continue to rely on the Sea Kings to perform 
its missions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members of the House have raised concerns over the safety 
of the aircraft.  It is true they are not getting any younger. We 
all know that, but let me be clear.  The government will not ask 
the men and women of the Canadian forces to fly unsafe aircraft. 
The minister has repeated that on a number of occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Significant investments have been made to make sure the Sea 
Kings continue to operate safely and perform their various tasks 
until the replacement helicopters are brought into service.  For 
example, we are spending some $50 million on engine and gearbox 
upgrades.  To improve the operational capabilities of the 
helicopters, the air force is proceeding with upgrades such as 
cargo carrying floorboards, electronic self-defence equipment and 
an improved rescue hoist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I again underline the government's commitment to 
the Canadian forces.  We saw that in today's announcement of the 
supplementary estimates.  Providing them with the equipment they 
need at the best possible price is at the core of the acquisition 
process.  It will benefit both Canada and the men and women of 
the Canadian forces.  It is worthy of the support of every member 
of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member's speech.  There is not really a 
polite way to comment on it, so I will be very careful how I do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once in the mid-eighties I was up north flying in a twin otter. 
It had been a scout plane in Vietnam and was full of bullet holes 
that had been patched up.  I suggest that airplane would be more 
dependable than half the airplanes and all the choppers that the 
Canadian army, the Canadian navy, and our search and rescue 
people fly now.  It is absolutely scandalous that the hon. member 
and the government would try to defend the position they have 
taken on military helicopter procurement and search and rescue 
vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said before in the House and will say it again that 
obviously there is no one on that side of the House who has ever 
waited for a helicopter in a dangerous life and death situation 
or who is related to anyone who has waited for a helicopter in a 
life and death situation.  If they had and if they had even one 
bit of credibility or conscience, we would have a much better 
fleet of helicopters to pick up people offshore, to take people 
off oil rigs when necessary, and to pick up fishermen when they 
are standing on the roof of a sinking boat and there is not 
another boat in sight.  We would not be debating the issue.  We 
would not be talking about what helicopters will be procured.  We 
would already have them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to correct the mathematics.  These are not the 
opposition's numbers.  These are the government's numbers: EH-101 
cancellation fees, $500 million; Sea King maintenance and upgrade 
to the year 2008, $600 million; Canada search and rescue program, 
procurement of 15 helicopters, $790 million; maritime helicopter 
project, 28 helicopters, $2.9 billion; MHP long term service 
support for 25 years, $1.7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total cost of the Liberal's programs, without inflation, is 
$8.2 billion.  The total cost of procurement of the EH-101s, if 
they had been bought to begin with, was $5.8 billion.  Those are 
the government's numbers.  I would like to hear the member's 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is long on 
rhetoric and very short on facts.  I have not seen the hon. 
member anywhere close to the defence committee over the last 
number of years.  I do not know where he has been, but he has 
obviously not had the opportunity to take in some of the 
discussions at the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, he attempts in the course of his comments to 
malign all the equipment the Canadian forces uses.  I can tell 
the hon. member that I have been up in Canadian forces 
helicopters.  I have flown in helicopters over Kosovo. 
The Griffon helicopter was one of the finest helicopters 
operating in Kosovo until it was moved out the region and we 
consolidated our forces in Bosnia.  The British and the Americans 
were relying on Canadian helicopters for surveillance because 
their own helicopters were giving them trouble.  I have flown in 
Canadian helicopters in Canada as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the Sea King is an old helicopter that needs 
replacing, and that is precisely what the government has done. 
However had we adopted the program the Conservative Party wanted 
us to get involved in, the EH-101, we would have had a cold war 
helicopter for a post cold war environment.  It would not have 
met the operational requirements the Canadian forces have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada specialized in anti-submarine warfare during the cold 
war.  It did that job extremely well.  Canada was noted as one of 
the best, if not the best, in the world in terms of 
anti-submarine warfare, but that is not where the game is now. We 
have to adjust the process, the procedures and the strategy to 
meet the strategic environment we are faced with now. That is 
precisely what the government has done with this acquisition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have time to deal with the hon. member's numbers, but 
the numbers were certainly very bad.  That is why the government 
cancelled the program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, I have been following the maritime 
helicopter project very closely for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and I have had several discussions about the 
department's central role in replacing Canada's Sea Kings, which 
have served the Canadian forces extremely well but are now 
nearing the end of their service lives.  I welcome the 
opportunity to debate the merits of the government's decision to 
purchase 28 new maritime helicopters and, more specifically, its 
strategy for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members may know, this is the single largest federal 
procurement initiated by the Liberal government since it was 
elected in 1993.  It is an important component of a larger long 
term strategy to equip the Canadian forces with modern, state of 
the art equipment for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the large monetary value and sensitive nature of the 
procurement, I can assure hon. members that the project has been 
thoroughly scrutinized by the Department of National Defence and 
Public Works and Government Services Canada.  This is the right 
decision and the right approach for both the military and for 
Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
for his commitment to ensuring that the process is not only fair, 
open, transparent and competitive, but that it is also innovative 
and progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also commend the Minister of Defence and his officials for 
developing a statement of operational requirements for the 
maritime helicopter that will meet the modern needs of our 
Canadian forces.  The world has changed over the past decade and 
so have our defence requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both our ministers are determined to get the project right. 
Their efforts deserve the support of hon. members on all sides of 
the House.  The procurement strategy developed by the Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, combined with a more 
realistic understanding of Canada's needs, will save the Canadian 
taxpayers $1.5 billion compared to the previous government's 
helicopter project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Public Works and Government Services has 
already pointed out, that money can and will be invested in other 
government priorities that were endorsed by Canadians in last 
fall's election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key factors that will ensure the success of the 
project is the government's commitment to initiate real, 
meaningful dialogue with the aerospace industry.  From the moment 
the maritime helicopter project letter of interest was released 
last August, the doors for communication have been opened and a 
two way dialogue between the industry and government officials 
has been positive and constructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that there is a high level of interest in 
the project both in Canada and abroad.  Why would there not be? 
Contracts will be awarded for equipment worth more than $2 
billion over the next few years.  On top of that, the winning 
bidders will be contracted to provide long term in service 
support of equipment they sell to the Crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the defence industry, projects like this do not come 
along every day.  The maritime helicopter project is expected to 
generate spirited and intense competition among some of the 
biggest defence contractors in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dialogue initiated with the industry last August has already 
generated feedback that will help defence and procurement 
officials fine tune the requirements and specifications according 
to the procurement strategy.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also allowed us to identify the firms that have both an 
interest and a capacity to be prime contractor for one or both of 
the helicopter and integrated mission system contracts. 
Potential contractors have been fully informed about the 
different elements of the procurement strategy and the 
obligations they will need to fulfil as we move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry is also aware that two requests for proposal will be 
issued and two contracts will be awarded, one for the helicopters 
and one for the integrated mission system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister already noted, the issuance of the two 
competitive RFPs will allow us to procure both a helicopter and 
an integrated mission system that meet our needs at the lowest 
price.  It will also result in opportunities for broader industry 
participation in the overall project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated a moment ago, one of our guiding principles for this 
procurement is the case for all government contracting, that is, 
to be open and fair with all bidders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of developing bids of this nature can run into millions 
of dollars, so we must take reasonable steps to avoid receiving 
bids that will be disqualified because of technical 
non-compliance.  That is why the strategy for this project 
includes a prequalification process that has never been used 
before in Canada on a project of this size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically what we are saying is that the potential bidders will 
have to demonstrate to procurement and defence officials that 
their proposed equipment complies with the government's 
operational requirements before they submit a formal bid.  This 
will not eliminate but will certainly minimize the risk of 
non-compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two separate prequalification processes will also be conducted, 
one for the technical compliance of the basic helicopter and the 
other for selective components of the maritime helicopter 
integrated mission system.  Potential bidders who have not 
prequalified at least 30 days in advance of the bid close will 
be declared non-compliant and their formal bids will not be 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to emphasize that prequalification will largely be based 
on the hardware side of each contract only.  The bid could still 
be declared non-compliant if the company fails to meet the other 
requirements in the request for proposal.  So even with the 
prequalification process, bidders will still have to meet tough 
criteria in other elements of the RFP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another unique element of this procurement strategy is that it 
will ensure a long term value to the crown in its decision to 
include inservice support as a component of each contract.  Like 
any piece of mechanical or electronic equipment, both the 
aircraft and the mission systems will require comprehensive 
ongoing maintenance and support once they are in operation. 
In service support covers a broad range of activities that will 
ensure safe use of helicopters over their operating life, 
including basic aircraft and systems maintenance, spare parts 
acquisition, inventory management, software support and 
simulation and training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maritime helicopters will require in service support for a 
period of some 20 years or longer.  Procurement and defence 
officials believe that including an in service support component 
in each competitive RFP will provide further assurance that they 
will obtain a high quality product.  There is significant merit 
in the approach.  After all, no supplier is likely to deliver 
substandard equipment if the same contractor has to assume the 
responsibility for its long term service.  Potential contractors 
will be looking at a 20 year commitment to their equipment, so 
there is little chance that anyone will try to cut corners that 
may save them money today but dramatically increase costs down 
the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dialogue with the industry that I mentioned earlier did not 
begin and end with the release of the letter of interest.  It is 
in fact an ongoing process carrying through the prequalification 
stage of the procurement and continuing on to the bid close date. 
There will be a good deal of direct contact with potential 
bidders, but the primary vehicle for this dialogue and sharing of 
information will be the maritime helicopter project website, 
which was established a number of months ago by the project 
management office.  For hon. members' information, the site can 
be accessed through the public works website. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that our government has made a commitment to become 
the world's the most electronically connected to its citizens and 
is using its communications medium to keep potential bidders and 
other interested parties informed about this project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the coming weeks and months we will be using the website to 
progressively release draft elements of both RFPs, beginning with 
documents related to entry level helicopter.  This will give 
bidders a chance to review and comment on various aspects of the 
project early on when there is still time to make changes that 
may be beneficial to the crown as well as to the bidders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure all hon. members that strict criteria will be 
used to evaluate each proposal that is ultimately received by the 
government.  The bidder who submits the lowest price that is 
technically compliant and has acceptable terms and conditions, 
industrial and regional benefits and risk assessment will be 
awarded the helicopter contract.  Shortly thereafter, we will 
release the RFP for the second element, the integrated mission 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, let me say that I have every confidence that the 
procurement strategy now being implemented will give the men and 
women of the Canadian forces the maritime helicopter they need 
for today's operational environment, and I am certain that all 
members will agree that the government's approach is supportive 
of our military, fair to industry and responsible to taxpayers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member.  The speaker 
before him indicated that the Sea King had a role as an 
anti-submarine warfare device.  I happen to think that hunting 
for subs is an important activity, especially considering that we 
barely have any other presence in the Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Minister of National Defence does not seem to 
agree with that position.  The minister, by the way, has referred 
to the use of the Sea King as an anti-submarine warfare device as 
something that is a relic of the cold war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I am posing is this:  who has it right?  Is it the 
minister, who says that the Sea King and its replacement are not 
to be used as an anti-sub device, that this is merely a relic of 
the cold war and does not have any more relevance, or is it the 
previous speaker who indicates that indeed this is an important 
purpose and that Canada should be conducting anti-submarine 
activities?  Is it the minister who is right or is it the 
previous speaker who is right?  Which Liberal has it right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the motion before the House 
has to do with a procurement strategy for the new helicopters. 
There are two contracts, one for the basic helicopter and the 
second for the integrated mission system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Public Works and Government Services provides 
procurement services for all departments of the government.  The 
Department of National Defence has provided public works and 
government services with the specifications for this particular 
project.  Public works and government services is now outlining 
its procurement strategy, as it did last August.  We are now in 
the process of having a dialogue with the aerospace industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procurement strategy and the process that we are going 
through is, in our view, the best way to ensure a good, 
successful project of acquiring these helicopters, which is in 
the best interests of the military, the government, DND and the 
taxpayers. Those are the issues before the House and that is 
exactly what we are doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the parliamentary secretary to the minister of public 
works to perhaps enlighten us a bit more on the procurement 
strategy.  All along we have been told by the government that the 
procurement strategy would be based on the cheapest cost, whereas 
the treasury board guidelines for procurement under article 9.1.1 
are as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated in the policy, the objective of government procurement 
contracting is to acquire goods and services and to carry out 
construction in a manner that enhances access, competition and 
fairness and results in the best value or, if appropriate, the 
optimal balance of overall benefits to the Crown and the Canadian 
people.  Inherent in procuring best value is the consideration of 
all relevant costs over the useful life of the acquisition, not 
solely the initial or basic contractual cost. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I already said to the previous Liberal member who spoke, 
there is a difference of $3.2 billion from the Liberals' own 1994 
numbers.  Their numbers state it will cost $3.2 billion to 
procure new helicopters, whereas if they had kept the original 
EH-101 plan it would have cost $5.3 billion or $5.1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the member's comments on procurement, on 
the fact that the government changed the rules for this contract, 
on the fact that it is not listening to the military advice its 
own defence department is giving, and on the fact that it has 
stepped out so that the Prime Minister could take his pen and 
write “no helicopters” across the paper.  It has adapted, bent 
itself backwards and swallowed itself whole in order to do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member's first question 
was in regard to the process.  The process of course, from the 
requirements of the Department of National Defence, was a 
decision of the government.  Treasury board is part of that 
government, so it is in compliance with treasury board 
guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just briefly lay this out.  In August a letter of 
interest went out to the aerospace industry to promote a 
dialogue.  It outlined the intended procurement strategy for all 
parties.  The rationale for our procurement strategy is quite 
simple.  We believe that a separate competitive process will 
ensure that the crown obtains both the required helicopter and 
the integrated mission system as well as the long term in service 
support needed, at the lowest possible price.  It will also allow 
for greater industry participation in the competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's preamble simply talked about lowest cost.  That is 
not true.  The procurement strategy is much broader than cost. It 
has to be compliant with the broad specifications as outlined in 
the letter of interest and as fully detailed on the government 
website. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague from 
Calgary West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate has been a very interesting one.  It is a very 
worthwhile topic that has been brought forward by the 
Conservative Party today.  It has just been unbelievable to 
listen to the arguments put forward by the Liberal government in 
defence of an indefensible position.  That is what it has tried 
to do today.  Liberal members have spent their time defending 
their action or lack thereof on the maritime helicopter 
replacement program in such a way that their arguments do not 
stand up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument just submitted by our colleague, the Liberal member 
from Nepean was unbelievable.  He made the unbelievable statement 
that had the government gone ahead with the plan developed by the 
Conservatives in the 1990s, which the Prime Minister tore up in 
1993, we would have had a helicopter with cold war capabilities 
and that would have been a bad thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all that is wrong.  Second, if we follow his logic, it 
was a better thing for the government to have spent $10 billion 
over the same period of time and not get the helicopters that are 
needed in a shorter period of time, rather than spend the 
approximately $5 billion that would have seen the helicopters 
delivered under the procurement plan of the Conservative Party 
back in the 1990s.  They would have been delivered in 1993.  That 
is completely illogical.  It does not make sense when we look at 
the pieces of this indefensible position being offered by the 
Liberals today in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second assertion being made by most Liberal members is that 
they are in some way saving the taxpayers $1.5 billion by waiting 
for who knows how many years before we actually get the 
replacements for the Sea Kings, which are older than I am.  They 
are saying unbelievable things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should be embarrassed and disappointed by this, 
because in fact what they are saying is that they are going to be 
procuring 28 helicopters rather than the original 35 under the 
plan offered by the Conservatives in the early nineties.  There 
will be seven less helicopters delivered so one would think that 
there should be some cost savings.  It is a little bit like the 
following argument:  the government says that instead of buying 
35 cars it will buy 28, but it will be saving $1.5 billion or 
whatever the cost of those cars would be.  If we look at the 
logic of that argument, here is where it leads. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are saying that they can spend more now over the 
same period of time, get less and we are going to be saving money 
by doing that.  That just does not make sense.  Canadians know 
that.  Our military personnel know that.  They know that politics 
has been played in this situation for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know about the procurement plan that has been in the works to 
replace the aging Sea Kings for decades now.  It is now the year 
2001.  We would have had military capability and the equipment in 
place in the mid-1990s had the Prime Minister not simply played 
politics and torn up the contract that would have seen the 
EH-101s delivered into service when they were needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, what has happened is we have what I am going to call a 
boondoggle.  It is a word that applies here, as it has in many 
other areas of spending by the government.  We had this 
boondoggle occur.  Lives have been lost because of old equipment 
that has put our military personnel at risk.  Sea Kings take 
approximately 40 hours of service for every hour in the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was mentioned by colleagues in the House today that the 
situation has become rather embarrassing.  We commend our 
personnel for maintaining the equipment and putting their lives 
on the line when they use this equipment that should have been 
replaced long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a government to stand in this place and defend the position 
in this situation is simply indefensible.  I think Canadians are 
forgiving when people say they made a mistake, that they were 
wrong and that they will make good on it.  That is exactly what 
the Liberals should be doing in this House today.  If they did 
they would be able to come clean with Canadians on the failed 
delivery of equipment, on the time it has taken to replace the 
equipment and on their defence of it.  Instead of coming clean, 
they have offered lame excuses which do not sit well with those 
who are in need of the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from the Conservative Party have mentioned the 
situations on the Atlantic coast in terms of rescues.  My 
colleague from South Shore talked about the government obviously 
not having been in the situation of needing the service or 
knowing anybody who needed the service.  That was a very good 
point.  The lack of care and the lack of commitment to put this 
in place now because there is a need for it is simply 
indefensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that the motion is not votable today.  I think we 
would find opposition parties united on it.  The motion is a 
common sense one that has attempted to correct a serious error 
made by the Prime Minister back in 1993.  What is very upsetting 
and disappointing to members of the House from all parties on 
this side, and I am sure members on the government side as well, 
is the lack of action as well as the lack of acknowledgement that 
politics was played with this file and that those politics have 
resulted in lost lives, our personnel being put at risk and many 
other problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on one other comment made in the House today 
with regard to earthquake preparedness, which falls under the 
realm of the Department of National Defence.  During question 
period and in some of the debate today we were asked about the 
earthquake in the Vancouver area yesterday.  There appeared to be 
a lack of concern on the government's part about that issue.  It 
moved the base at CFB Chilliwack with the emergency preparedness 
capabilities from the Vancouver region to Edmonton, which is 750 
miles away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We raised questions about this particular issue today with the 
Minister of Justice from Edmonton.  We asked the minister what we 
would do when those services were no longer available to help 
people in Vancouver should a large earthquake occur, and it will 
sometime but we do not know when.  The minister's response was 
that we were fearmongering. 
What a completely unacceptable and disappointing comment.  How 
are our forces going to bring heavy equipment to Vancouver if 
there are no runways and if the major transportation corridors 
are gone?  It is an indefensible position.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed in the delivery of the maritime 
helicopter program and in so many other ways.  Members of the 
opposition will be united on this debate and many others to keep 
the government accountable.  It is very clear to all Canadians 
that rather than do the right thing, admit it was wrong and fix 
the problem immediately, it is going to continue to stonewall and 
drag on something that needs to be fixed and could have been 
fixed in 1993.  That is truly disappointing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rodger Cuzner (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member suggested that unanimous consent would be 
garnered by the entire opposition party.  During the his speech 
he did not allude to any of the barriers that pertain to this 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call upon the government to eliminate the 
barriers in the Letter of Interest to the aerospace industry, 
which impede a fair and open Maritime Helicopter Project, and 
that maritime procurement be conducted on a “best value to the 
Canadian taxpayers” basis, in accordance with Treasury Board 
guidelines. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member expand on what the barriers are as they apply 
in this situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the immediate barrier is 
the Liberal Government of Canada.  It is obvious that that is the 
huge barrier.  We have solid agreement from all members that the 
barrier is the Prime Minister.  He said no in 1993.  We could 
have had helicopters in service now, here, today.  Instead, eight 
years later there are still no helicopters in sight.  That is the 
barrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another particular barrier is the statement of operational 
requirements and the whole process that has been put in place. 
The Liberals have changed the process thereby eliminating 
particular members of the industry from putting forward proposals 
to be included in the procurement strategy.  That has been done 
deliberately to save political face because the government does 
not want to end up ordering the same helicopters or variants of 
them that it cancelled in 1993.  That is the barrier to this 
going forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
chair and vice chair of SCONDVA stated today that they are on the 
record as supporting the cheapest helicopter for naval 
operations.  I am sure our troops in the field feel wonderful 
about getting the cheapest but not the best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member feel that it is right for the government to 
override treasury board's recommendations and policies when it 
comes to replacing the Sea Kings?  With its letter of interest, 
the government has overriden treasury board sections 9.1.1 and 
9.1.2.  In no way should the government ever do that.  That is 
there for everyone to abide by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague 
for Saint John and I congratulate her for bringing this motion 
forward today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government is doing is not right.  It is indefensible. 
It is a position put forward here today by the Liberal Government 
of Canada and it is one that is clearly wrong.  It must bear the 
responsibility for cancelling the program in 1993 that would have 
seen helicopters in place to save lives across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It would have saved $1.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  The member says it would have saved 
$1.5 billion but he does not say that it is seven less 
helicopters. 
He wants to say one thing but not the other.  He does not want 
the whole story to be told.  I do not blame him.  The decision is 
made is such an embarrassment for his government.  It should hold 
full responsibility for what it has done.  Canadians are 
disappointed with the government and the course of action it has 
taken by cancelling the helicopters and rewriting the letter to 
exclude some so that it is not embarrassed further in this whole 
fiasco and boondoggle.

Speaker, I will address the folks back home.  I want to tell 
everybody who is watching at home or in the offices around the 
Hill today what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are swallowing hard on a subject on which they ran 
a campaign in 1993.  They told Canadians they wanted to scrap a 
Conservative initiative to purchase EH-101 helicopters which were 
clearly the best helicopters that could have been purchased.  The 
Prime Minister went about beating his chest during the election 
campaign and said that cancelling this would save money.  At the 
end of the day, what will happen is that the Liberals will spend 
a lot more money in aggregate and we will get less helicopters in 
return.  That is what is called Liberal fiscal responsibility; 
pay more for less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, this is not just a tongue in cheek kind of cute 
argument.  People have died as a result of that flawed decision. 
People lost their lives operating those helicopters that should 
not have been in the air because of the Prime Minister and his 
government's decision.  This is not just a question of money. 
This is a question of sacrificing the lives of our forces.  The 
Liberals should be really ashamed of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at about $600 million in cancellation fees that 
the Liberals brought upon themselves by cancelling the contract. 
It is a lot of money but it gets worse than that.  It is also the 
fact that they paid all that money over the last decade to keep 
these flying heaps in the air.  When we consider that some of 
them were bought in 1964, that is a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, it was 12 years before I was born.  I will 
even venture to say that the Prime Minister, who went about 
beating his chest in 1993 about the ending of this contract, was 
probably not even elected when these helicopters were bought.  It 
is an absolute shame to consider that our men and women in the 
forces have been flying things that are absolutely in heaps by 
everybody else's standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote from some things here.  This is absolutely 
choice.  This just goes to show to what lengths the Prime 
Minister and some of those around him are willing to go in order 
to try to quash this project so that they do not have to wipe the 
egg off their faces because they did not order the EH-101.  The 
EH-101 won the contract fair and square.  What did the government 
do to hide that, to obfuscate it, to delay it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is from an article from the London <I>Free Press</I> written 
by Greg Weston.  The date of this is last February 22. 
For those folks back home who want to check it, they can look it 
up on the Internet.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By mid-1997, sources say it had become apparent the bidding was 
again going to be won by the Cormorant. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, the Cormorant is the parent of the EH-101.  It is 
the same brand of helicopter.  It goes on:

$600 million of public money for Chrétien's cancelling of the 
original contract of Cormorants—

colleagues that we cannot do indirectly what we might not be able 
to do directly.  Although the member might be quoting, he will 
have to slightly adapt his text to refer to, in this case, the 
Right Hon. Prime Minister or other ministers that might otherwise 
be named or referred to in this same article.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the guilty do not like 
having their names read out loud.  What it boils down to is that 
the Cormorants were the proper choice.  It did not cost the Prime 
Minister.  Who are we kidding?  He is using taxpayer dollars in 
Shawinigan.  It actually cost Canadian taxpayers $600 million. 
Then he decided he needed a political fixer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I cannot name names, he brought in the Deputy Prime 
Minister as his trusty political fixer.  The Prime Minister 
instructed the Deputy Prime Minister that the Cormorant through 
another bidding process was not to win.  In other words, there 
would be a contest but the Cormorant or a version of the EH-101 
could not be allowed to win.  That was the rule.  It goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1997, the (Prime Minister) headed south for his usual 
month of golf, reassured by the military that the Cormorant bid 
was history.  But a funny thing happened on the way to the 
contracting office.  The (Deputy Prime Minister) had to phone the 
(Prime Minister) in Florida to tell him the Cormorant had won. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They rejigged the process all over again and the Cormorant won 
fair and square.  The Prime Minister's response to the news was 
described as largely unprintable.  Expletives were uttered by the 
Prime Minister because he hated the fact that the Cormorant won 
the process by a fair bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It talks about a memo from a fellow officer to Air Force 
Commander L.C. Campbell, whom I have quoted before, which began: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assuming there will be a competition to select the new maritime 
helicopter, it is quite possible that the Cormorant might win it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It went on to ask: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do you ensure that it does not win a maritime helicopter 
competition? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It then referred to the military and went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Cormorant were to win a military helicopter competition on 
its merits, wouldn't we again be in the same position of being 
accused of tricking the government? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the military not be the one to decide what helicopter 
would best service its function?  Yet we have the Prime Minister, 
the Deputy Prime Minister and the cabinet interfering with the 
decision and competition process by saying the Cormorant is not 
allowed to win because they promised they would gut the program 
in 1993 when they were running during the election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very serious that they would waste billions of dollars of 
taxpayer money, put lives on the line and contribute to the death 
of our armed forces just because they did not want to get egg on 
their faces.  Shame on the government.  Shame on the Prime 
Minister and shame on the Deputy Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk a bit about what these helicopters will be 
used for because even the minister seems to have some fuzzy logic 
about it.  Basically they would be used for search and rescue. 
When I visited the base in Esquimalt I was told by military 
personnel that they could not do the job because of the 
situation.  They had to bring in Americans in the Straits of Juan 
de Fuca.  The Canadian forces could not perform this job but the 
Liberals are continuing to delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Search and rescue is one of the functions.  Canadians are not 
doing a lot of it or as much as they should, especially when we 
consider that for every hour in the air there are 40 hours of 
maintenance on any helicopter in the air.  That is the search and 
rescue story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about the anti-submarine warfare activities.  By 
having helicopters on the back of naval warships it multiplies by 
25 times the ability of the ship to conduct anti-submarine 
warfare.  As the ship is sailing along the helicopter flies off 
the back of the ship, goes out to the limits of its 
circumference, drops a boom into the water and listens for subs 
underneath.  It drastically improves the ability of sub hunting.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we only spend a scant few hours a year up in the 
Arctic with icebreakers, if we are lucky, our minister happens to 
think that anti-sub warfare is “a relic of the cold war”.  He 
does not believe we should be enforcing sovereignty.  The 
minister does not think that is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The job of our military, our navy, and these helicopters is to 
police our boundaries and to find out whether other nations are 
conducting submarine operations, whether they be under the ice or 
off either of our coasts.  If our minister with his Liberal, 
fuzzy-headed, soft, mushy logic does not think we should be 
finding out whose subs are in our waters, we have a serious 
problem.  That is pretty serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on but I realize that my time has come to an 
end.  I know that members on the other side will prattle on about 
procedures for bureaucratic buying.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member dealt very briefly with the motion before the House which 
has to do with the process.  We are talking about the alleged 
barriers within the letter of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process and the procurement strategy has been approved by 
the government, which includes the Treasury Board, and it is in 
compliance with all procurement criteria.  Most of the member's 
speech had to do with the allegation that somehow there was a 
bias against EH Industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 there was a cancellation of the EH-101.  The government 
made that commitment during the election and followed through for 
the reasons outlined.  The member should also know that we put 
out for tender replacement of search and rescue helicopters. EH 
won that contract in a fair, competitive and open process. With 
regard to the current contract EH Industries did make an appeal 
to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, and the member 
should know that the CITT rejected that appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member disagree with the Canadian International Trade 
Tribunal with regard to the ongoing process?  If he does, he 
should explain to the House why he disagrees with the CITT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad I have been given 
the opportunity to tell Canadians that Liberals across the way 
and the member who just asked the question have written it so 
that they can rule out Cormorant and Sikorsky from competing in 
the bids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will it be a fair bidding process when the government has 
specifically structured it so that Sikorsky and Cormorant cannot 
compete?  Cormorant won the process fair and square before. 
Sikorsky is one of the biggest manufacturers in the world of 
helicopters.  They are both ruled out of the bidding process 
because the PM does not think that meshes with what looks good on 
his face.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell members a little private story in response to that 
question.  I flew in the Eurocopter when it was brought to 
Ottawa.  My staff and I had an interest in this issue even before 
I was serving on the Standing Committee for National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs.  I actually flew around in that helicopter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the officials from Eurocopter about some of the details 
of the aircraft.  They crassly told me, because I do not think 
they figured out that I was an MP, that it would come down to 
where the helicopter was assembled.  Because of the way the Prime 
Minister wanted to guide the process for getting jobs, they said 
the government would not go with the other helicopter. Because of 
where it would be assembled and because of the jobs that would be 
in and around the Prime Minister's neck of the woods, the 
Eurocopter would win.  It was driven by the most partisan 
political considerations of all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
just given a document which states that any attempt to close the 
wide variance in air vehicle performance would require either a 
major redesign of the proposed Cougar or a significant change in 
the operational role of the National Shipping Agency, which would 
then require reassessment of the Canadian navy's concept of 
operations.  The redesign is estimated to cost in excess of $500 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is my colleague from the Reform Party aware the Cougar that will 
be given to the navy does not even meet naval requirements?  Now 
it is another $500 million to redesign the whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B> Mr. Speaker, right from the beginning this 
issue has been a massive waste of taxpayer money.  I agree with 
the hon. member.  I could look at some of the statistics I wish 
could have been included in the main part of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are cancellation penalty costs of $478.6 million.  Then 
the cost of actually upgrading the Sea Kings.  Mechanics can only 
do so much but they have to go ahead and repair them. It is $50 
million to upgrade them.  Then there are maintenance costs.  As I 
said, for every hour in the air it is 40 hours of maintenance. 
That is another $750 million. Then there is the  cost of the 
replacement at $2.9 billion for 28 helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the government is spending close to $5 billion. 
The original contract was for seven helicopters and would have 
cost only $3.24 billion.  It is an absolute waste of money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this has been a fascinating day for me.  How many angels 
can dance on the head of a needle?  It is quite fascinating.  I 
will be splitting my time with the member for Scarborough East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important 
opposition day motion.  Let me begin by commending the hon. 
member and her party for their interest in how the Canadian 
forces are being equipped to do their job.  Certainly this is of 
concern to many Canadians.  As the hon. member knows, the 
government has been taking progressive steps for some time now to 
ensure that Canada's military has the state of the art equipment 
it needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also acknowledge the hon. member's concern for the prudent use 
of taxpayer dollars.  One of my principal goals as an elected 
official has always been to make sure that the government and the 
governments with which I served before on a municipal level 
deliver an appropriate level of service to all Canadians in an 
efficient and cost effective manner.  I think that is the role of 
all politicians, is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National defence is one of the most important services any 
government can provide its citizens.  Expenditures in this area 
must undergo very careful scrutiny.  I have no doubt that the 
maritime helicopter project will withstand such scrutiny.  I also 
believe that the procurement strategy developed by the Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services is in the best interest 
of Canadians and our defence personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a strictly economic perspective, two factors set defence 
and military procurement aside from most other types of 
purchases.  First, defence equipment is generally in service for 
relatively long periods of time so a strategic long term outlook 
is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members have no doubt been made aware throughout debate 
on the motion, defence equipment tends to be extremely costly. 
The maritime helicopter project is a case in point.  The 
replacements for Canada's aging Sea King helicopters are expected 
to be in service for more than 20 years.  They will be used in 
harsh conditions and extremely dangerous situations.  Safety and 
durability are of utmost importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These helicopters and their associated integrated mission 
systems will be expensive to purchase.  In fact, it bears 
repeating that even though we are saving taxpayers up to $1.5 
billion compared to the former government's helicopter purchase 
project, it is still a huge financial commitment.  With a value 
of close to $2.9 billion, the maritime helicopter project is the 
single largest procurement currently being managed by the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is important to have a fair, open, transparent 
and competitive tendering process to award these contracts.  We 
believe that separate competitive processes will ensure that the 
crown obtains both the required helicopters and the integrated 
mission system, as well as long term in service support that is 
absolutely necessary at the lowest possible price. 
I have the utmost confidence in the ability of the minister of 
public works and his department to manage this procurement.

House one thinks that as soon as the Liberals win an election we 
immediately dismiss all the departmental personnel and hire just 
Liberals to do a terrible job for the Canadian public.  In fact, 
we have a huge department of people who have worked here for 
years and years, much before that party was even a glimmer in Mr. 
Manning's eye, and they have a vested interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I would remind members once again to 
please refer to one another by either portfolios or riding names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my apologies.  I am 
getting so enthusiastic about the topic that I got carried away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am especially pleased to see that the government plans to use 
a number of innovative practices to help ensure a successful, 
cost effective acquisition of the 28 maritime helicopters and the 
integrated mission system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus my remarks today on two measures in particular, the 
government's unprecedented commitment to industry dialogue and 
interaction, and the unique prequalification process that is the 
cornerstone of the procurement strategy for the maritime 
helicopter project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Public Works and Government Services has 
informed the House, the defence contracting industry was made 
aware of the government's general intentions and requirements in 
relation to the maritime helicopter project through a letter of 
interest released last August.  The letter of interest was much 
more than a statement of needs.  It was also an invitation for 
individual companies to comment on the government's plans and to 
indicate their intention to participate in the competitive 
bidding process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister has already noted, the government has received 
input on its statement of operational requirements and 
procurement strategy from several companies.  These comments will 
be given careful consideration as defence and procurement 
officials continue to define this project in the months ahead. 
The letter of interest has successfully initiated a dialogue with 
the industry which will not only continue but will broaden in 
scope and detail right up to the bid closing dates for each of 
the contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We firmly believe that industry interaction is critical for 
large projects such as this.  It protects the interests of 
taxpayers while ensuring that potential prime contractors and 
subcontractors are fully aware of the government's needs and 
intentions and do not assume an undue financial burden or risk in 
preparing their bids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government intends to make full use of the World Wide Web to 
facilitate this industry interaction.  A dedicated website has 
already been established for the maritime helicopter project, as 
has been mentioned already, and information has been posted for 
the industry and other interested parties, including the Canadian 
public.  Again, this reflects the government's commitment to a 
fair, open and transparent process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the project unfolds, the level of detail posted on the 
website, and thus the site's value to potential contractors, will 
grow.  Draft specifications and other documents will be available 
through the website for review and comment by industry, the 
people who know what they are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This interactive process could lead to changes in the technical 
requirements or other elements of the project.  It will also 
increase the likelihood of technical compliance of candidate 
helicopters and integrated mission systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second innovative procurement practice I wish to speak about 
today, the mandatory prequalification process, is in many ways an 
extension of the government's commitment to industry interaction. 
As hon. members have been informed, separate prequalification 
processes will be conducted for both contracts in advance of the 
formal submission of bids.  This is the first time such a process 
has been used in Canada for a project of this size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister has already noted, prequalification should 
enable us to greatly minimize the problem of disqualification of 
bids due to technical non-compliance.  This saves a lot of 
companies a lot of money.  It stops them from getting into bids 
that they just cannot complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mitigating the risk of non-compliance is good for the government 
because it ensures the maximum level of competition for the 
contracts.  It is also good for the industry which, as hon. 
members can appreciate, invests an enormous amount of time and 
money in developing bids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear yet again that prequalification will 
focus largely on the hardware aspects of each bid.  Our goal is 
to make sure that potential prime contractors can conform with 
the technical requirements of the maritime helicopter project as 
set out by the Department of National Defence before—and I 
underline before—they submit a bid.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a contractor cannot conform to these requirements there is no 
need to devote additional time and resources to developing or 
evaluating other elements of the bid, thereby saving us money and 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To prequalify, potential prime contractors will be asked to 
provide an appropriate level of detail about their equipment and 
systems, which will be carefully reviewed by defence and public 
works and government services officials.  Prime contractors will 
also have the opportunity to explain their proposed equipment and 
solutions, to seek clarification of technical issues and to 
address any concerns that might be raised on the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Potential contractors that have not achieved prequalification 
status at least 30 days in advance of the bid close will be 
declared non-compliant and their bids will not be considered as 
part of the formal tendering process, thereby saving both sides a 
lot of time, money and aggravation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the bids close, the normal process will be followed for 
selecting a successful contractor for government tenders awarded 
on the basis of lowest price.  In addition to price and technical 
compliance and industrial and regional benefits, contractual 
terms and conditions will be part of that evaluation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the basic helicopter, the price evaluation will include the 
basic helicopter, related ship modifications and in service 
support.  For the integrated mission system, the evaluation will 
include the integrated mission system and its in service support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government clearly believes that Canada is more likely to 
meet both its technical and cost requirements for the maritime 
helicopter project by talking with the industry.  Such dialogue 
will result in a better meeting of the minds, so to speak.  It 
will reduce the risk to government and to industry alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the debate that is taking place in the House today, it will 
contribute to a successful procurement project that will respect 
the interests of taxpayers and meet the needs of the Canadian 
forces for many years to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member's speech very carefully, 
noting that there were comments in her speech that reflected the 
comments of some of her colleagues in almost identical words.  I 
hate to think this, but it could not be a canned speech from the 
minister of public works that she was delivering, could it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know she gave a lot of credit to the minister of public works 
regarding the process he has set up.  I am sure that she must be 
aware from his presentation, and it was actually one of the 
members of the media who brought this to my attention, that the 
contract for the maritime helicopter project will not be signed 
this year.  It will be signed next year.  What will that in 
effect do?  That will push off the whole project again and it 
will be another five to six years before a delivery of even one 
machine to our military takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about the openness of the process and so on, which I 
believe is a bunch of hogwash, but just think of this.  Right now 
we have a 40 year old aircraft out there that requires 40 hours 
of service for every hour in flight, and we have this minister 
and this government stating that it will be another year before 
the contract is signed and another five years before one machine 
is delivered.  There is something seriously wrong with the 
priorities on that side of the House, and I would like the member 
to comment on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think there 
is anything wrong with ensuring the best quality available.  The 
machines are going to be used for 20 to 25 years.  If the member 
opposite wants us to rush about madly to put a less than perfect 
machine in the air and put men at risk, then I do not endorse 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like anything else to the member opposite.  It is like the 
party opposite starting as the Reform Party.  It was almost what 
was wanted, but not quite.  It had to take time to mature into 
the Canadian Alliance.  The process we are in right now is 
maturing at a much faster rate and we are going to end up with a 
much better product.

some of my colleagues, but I really cannot let the nonsense that 
I just heard go by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says the government does not want to rush out and do 
this.  The contract was cancelled in 1994.  The last I looked, 
that was seven years ago.  The contract that was cancelled was 
put in place because the military needed the equipment, so 
clearly the military needed the equipment well before 1994, 
knowing the less than lightning speed with which any government 
moves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equipment that was needed before 1994 was ordered.  The 
government decided to toast the contract for political reasons in 
1994.  Here we are in 2001, finally with some kind of decision to 
buy.  Now we find out that we will not have delivery of this 
badly needed equipment until later down the road and the member 
has the gall to say the government does not want to rush 
anything.  How on earth can she stand and spout such nonsense and 
expect Canadians to buy that kind of line? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it quite 
fascinating that everything done on this side of the House is 
subject to severe scrutiny and question, but that there is 
absolutely no concern in the opposition members' minds about, 
first of all, the contract we cancelled being absolutely the best 
contract available to the Canadian public.  Second, the fact that 
all the helicopters are still flying and our defence system is 
still working quite nicely means that it was probably in advance 
of when it was needed.  The fact is that we are being careful, 
meticulous and doing the best job possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might also point out to the member opposite that the public, 
to use her word, toasted the government that was going to bring 
the contract into place precipitously and that party was reduced 
to a paltry sum of people over there who are spending an entire 
day wasting the taxpayers' time on a subject that is well 
underway.

some confidence that my constituency has no particular

comment on this without any obvious axe to grind, it does not 
mean that my constituents are uninterested.  I am perfectly happy 
at this point to defer my remarks until the House leader speaks

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
while my constituency has no obvious axe to grind and no 
particular involvement in this particular issue, it does not mean 
that my constituents are therefore uninterested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last election, I heard from my constituents on many 
occasions about their concern over the state of the military. 
They were concerned that the military was not being treated well 
and that their equipment was out of date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therein lies the debate.  Canadians want a military of which 
they can be proud, but the costs are somewhere in the 
area of problematic.  For instance, the costs of the 
modernization of the F-18 are astronomic.  The costs of the 
quality of life for members of the military are substantial.  The 
costs of the Aurora upgrades are enormous.  The costs of this 
helicopter project alone are projected to be $2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The part of the motion with which my constituents can agree is 
that the procurement be conducted on the basis of the best value 
to Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The above issues that I have just cited, those four outstanding 
issues, the Auroras, the F-18s, the helicopters and the quality 
of life of the military, and there are more, are significant 
issues for all of us, both in the military and outside the 
military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume that members opposite think that the best value for the 
Canadian taxpayer is the guideline to be applied to all of the 
above.  I do not know what the total costs of all those files 
might be, but I think it is safe to assume that we would use up 
whatever surplus is in the budget this year.  We would probably 
also get into the contingency fees, if not the prudence factor, 
and we might actually start dipping into tax cuts and the Canada 
health and social transfer.  The costs of these projects are 
enormous and, in my analysis, one needs to bring balance and best 
value to the taxpayers, whether it be in helicopters or any other 
request by the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that the costs are enormous, we cannot be paralyzed. 
The military has in fact set out its priorities in its requests. 
Apparently the opposition was upset when the letter of interest 
proposed that there could be a possibility of splitting the 
contracts between the airframe and other systems.  This is 
similar to what General Motors does when it splits its main 
suppliers into those that can deliver various sections of an 
automobile most quickly and efficiently and, indeed I say, 
cheaply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some potential bidders apparently do not like the idea that 
efficiency and costs are to be part of the bid.  The opposition 
apparently agrees that costs and efficiency should not be a 
barrier to a bid.  The opposition and other bidders apparently do 
not like the qualification process to submit a bid.  The 
government has legitimate concerns that those submitting bids 
should also be qualified to submit the bids.  What a strange 
idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the military suggested a qualifying process be given time, 
those companies that were already qualified were upset because of 
the potential increased competition.  It does seem rather 
fundamental that this so-called barrier be addressed.  After all, 
what is the use of having a bid from someone not qualified to 
submit a bid in the first place?  Indeed, what could be generated 
from soliciting more bids from people who in fact are not 
qualified? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that when General Motors solicits bids it checks out 
its bidders rather thoroughly before giving out a contract. 
Surely it is fundamental that those who submit bids be qualified. 
I hope that the opposition would not encourage bidders who are 
not qualified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next phrase in the motion is that it be fair and open.  I 
have listened to members opposite argue for a fair and open 
process.  Who would be against fairness and openness?  Yet when 
members opposite are challenged on what is not fair and what is 
not open, they lapse into some rope-a-dope response about 
political interference. 
However, they are not very specific.  Their rope-a-dope response 
would do credit to Muhammad Ali.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite lapse into generalities when asked specifically 
about what is not fair, what is not transparent and just where 
this political interference might lay.  Apparently the continuous 
posting of this issue on the website is not open, is not 
transparent and is subject to political interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of National Defence has issued a letter of 
interest regarding a $2.5 billion contract for the purchase of 28 
helicopters.  Some companies in the aerospace industry, namely 
E.H. Industries and Sikorsky, questioned aspects of the bidding 
process.  E.H. Industries in fact took legal action against the 
department before the Canadian International Trade Tribunal.  The 
claim made to the CITT was that the contract bidding process was 
unnecessarily strict, thus eliminating competition.  The CITT did 
not accept the proposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have trouble understanding the opposition's argument.  Is it 
arguing in favour of fewer competitors, which would therefore 
advantage a smaller pool of bidders, or is it arguing for a large 
pool of bidders, some of whom may not be qualified to bid? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand a disgruntled bidder who likes the process set up 
in a particular way which maximizes his or her advantage, and 
launches a lawsuit to protect his or her advantages.  However, 
what I cannot understand is an opposition supporting a bidder who 
only likes things one way which would maximize the advantage of 
that particular corporation, thank you very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the opposition is speaking against its own 
motion, the essence of which is fairness, transparency and best 
value for the Canadian taxpayer.  To use the words of that famous 
philosopher, Yogi Berra, this appears to be déja vu all over 
again.  The opposition is apparently against any initiative that 
would open up the pool of qualified bidders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been eight years since the Canadian electorate passed 
judgment on the Mulroney government and yet here we are, three 
elections later, the Tories are up from two seats to 12, and 
apparently arguing against transparency and a bidding process 
designed to solicit the greatest number of bidders.  It is like 
we are stuck in a time warp.  Is this not the same crowd that 
brought us the $42 billion deficit and forced the newly elected 
Liberal government to take huge sums out of all programs, 
including military programs, in order to get the nation's 
finances in order?   Why would the military, let alone other 
Canadians, believe in a motion from a party that has caused so 
much grief for the military? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we not had to climb our way out of a $42 billion deficit, 
maybe, just maybe, the helicopter issue would be off the table 
and we would put it behind us.  From the $4 billion Tory 
contract, we would be down to the $2.5 billion Liberal contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a disingenuous motion from a party that dug the Canadian 
government and the Canadian people a huge hole.  It now wants to 
fly out of that hole with economic voodoo and prioritizing that 
is inappropriate in the first place.  It is a shame that this 
motion is not votable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member spoke of a $42 billion deficit in 1993.  What he 
failed to mention was that that deficit, as a percentage of GDP, 
was actually reduced by half from what the Mulroney government 
had inherited in 1984 from the previous Liberal government.  In 
fact it was reduced by half as a percentage of GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also forgot to mention that program spending, which was 
growing every year by 15% under that previous Liberal government, 
was reduced to zero under the Mulroney government.  He also made 
some other omissions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Economist</I> magazine's 1998 year preview for Canada 
stated that the credit for the elimination of the deficit in 
Canada belonged to the structural reforms made by the previous 
government, that is, the Mulroney government, and it listed 
specifically free trade and GST as being those policies that were 
most instrumental in the elimination of the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him if he is aware of what his party's 
position was on free trade and the GST in the 1988 and 1993 
elections.  I am curious as to where his party stood, prior to 
being elected, on those two fundamental policies which his party 
and government has embraced and utilized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly hope that his party was not, as some people 
have told me, vociferously opposed to those policies.  Surely to 
goodness his party would not have embraced those policies so 
warmly in government that it opposed so vociferously in 
opposition.  That would mean that it effectively had to swallow 
itself whole on this and many other issues.  I would really 
appreciate his feedback on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do know that the Canadian 
people have embraced this government three times.  That, in and 
of itself, is a rather remarkable concept.  I do know that the 
party opposite has not been so enthusiastically embraced.  A 
reduction of a majority government to two seats is somewhat like 
a kiss from a sister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do know that between 1984 and 1993 we had some of the best 
economic times that the country has ever enjoyed.  The party of 
the member opposite did nothing during that time and did nothing 
to wrestle the deficit that it was continuing to run into the 
ground.  The Canadian people have passed judgment on that and 
apparently they prefer the programs that this government has over 
the proposals of the fifth party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the member's speech and it 
sounded just like the previous speech by one of his colleagues, 
the member from Mississauga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had the same basic comments in there, nothing new, nothing 
innovative, nothing to support the project itself.  It seems that 
the speech writer over there has the same mindset that leads to 
absolutely nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have been mostly patting themselves on the back and 
proclaiming this great open process that they want to deliver to 
the Canadian public and to industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about this openness that the member has alluded to 
in his presentation.  As I pointed out before, I have a book full 
of access to information documents on this particular project 
which clearly point to interference by the Deputy Prime Minister 
in this process.  He wanted the statement of requirements changed 
so some changes were made through the senior oversight management 
committee.  The committee met seven times to deal strictly with 
the SOR on the maritime helicopter. That is politicians 
interfering directly into the affairs of the military.  They had 
no business being in the procurement process and yet it did 
happen.  Now, that was the Deputy Prime Minister, those 
officials— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I know that it is not 
much time when colleagues choose, as they may, to split their 
time, but with questions and comments being only five minutes we 
are running short of time.  I encourage the member for Calgary 
Northeast to possibly direct his question to his colleague 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will do that very thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about this wonderful open process that the 
Liberal government has embarked upon.  Documents show exactly the 
opposite.  They show that there was political interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment on just where he thinks this 
project will go, given the past track record of his government 
and its nasty interference into every procurement that it can put 
its finger in.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I question whether the hon. 
member listened intently.  Had he done so, he might have noticed 
a substantial difference between the previous speaker and my own 
speech.  That being as it may, the hon. member seems somewhat 
contradictory.  On the one hand he wants us to be accountable and 
on the other hand he does not want us to consult industry because 
he believes we should have bids from unqualified groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability in my view means the government gets involved in 
designing the letter of intent.  It designs the basic parameters 
of any bid upon any contract at any time.  It is there on the 
website and I cannot imagine why the hon. member is upset with 
the process.  It is as open as open can be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
been following the debate throughout the day very closely. A 
number of speakers have risen and most people recognize that we 
need new helicopters for the Canadian military.  That has been 
stated over and over again even from the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My difficulty with what I have been hearing from the government 
benches is the total cost.  There has been a serious 
contradiction in the total cost of the helicopter procurement. 
There has been a contradiction in the Liberal numbers.  Every 
time they put a speaker up I hear different numbers.  I quoted 
them once before when I asked a question, but for the record and 
in my speech I will quote the numbers again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are government numbers.  They are not my numbers or 
fictitious numbers that we pulled out of a hat or out of the air. 
They are the government's numbers.  The EH-101 cancellation fees 
are based on the numbers constantly cited by the government and 
in the press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have stated them at $478 million.  The government's own 
numbers are $500 million.  It has been reported in the press at 
$786 million.  It is probably closer to $1 billion.  That is what 
it actually cost the government to cancel a helicopter contract 
for the EH-101s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take the government's more modest figure of $500 million, 
which is a little more than what we have been tracking them at. 
Then we can put the Sea King maintenance and upgrade to the year 
2008 at $600 million, and those are government numbers again. 
Then we can add in the Canada search helicopter program, which 
has already purchased 15 helicopters for $790 million.  We also 
can add in the Canada search helicopter's long term service 
support for 25 years, which again is part of the real numbers. 
The real numbers add up to $1.7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we add the maritime helicopter project for an additional 28 
helicopters at $2.9 billion, and the maritime helicopter project 
long term service support for 25 years at $1.7 billion, the total 
cost for the Liberal program, without inflation, is $8.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is it getting the $4 billion figure?  It is smoke and 
mirrors.  This is the real world.  Those are your numbers.  Stand 
in the House and defend them, or contradict them again, but go 
down the list.  Everything that—

passionate about the subject on hand, but I would ask him to 
direct his remarks through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, your direction is noted. 
Certainly I meant to address my remarks through the Chair and got 
carried away with the subject matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments own numbers show that the cost of helicopter 
procurement will be $8.2 billion.  The total cost for the 43 
EH-101s, based again on the government's own numbers from the 
1993 election, was $5.8 billion.  We can be assured that it did 
not miss anything, that it added in every penny, dime and dollar 
it could. There is a contradiction of $2.4 billion.  Somehow or 
another the government must come up with the numbers.  It cannot 
stand there and say its program is cheaper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a personal interest in the helicopter bid and in search 
and rescue helicopters.  It was not many years ago, on February 
15, 1982, that the <I>Ocean Ranger</I> sank off the Grand Banks of 
Newfoundland losing 84 personnel on board. There were 90 knot 
winds and 37 foot seas, average seas.  I was working on a rig off 
Sable Island at the same time with a 70 foot air gap and the 
waves were hitting the bottom of the rig. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we need search and rescue helicopters.  That is why 
we need defence helicopters that are fit to fly.  People who are 
put in the air in dangerous circumstances must be able to depend 
on the machinery to deliver them to their target in a rescue 
mission, a military mission, a humanitarian mission or whatever 
it may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has forgotten that early in the morning of 
February 15, 1982, when 84 <I>Ocean Ranger</I> personnel were 
lost, many of them jumped overboard and were in the water when 
the choppers got there.  Anyone reading the write-up on that 
disaster would be well aware that the men were dead when the 
choppers arrived because it was at the extreme limit of the 
helicopters' range.  They a hold of some of the bodies but could 
not pull them out of the water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about helicopters on the east coast, we are not 
talking about some type of expense.  What is human life worth to 
the government?  What is human life worth to the friends, 
families and loved ones of people who have been lost offshore in 
the past or unfortunately may be lost in the future?  It is not 
worth debate in the House or discussions over dollars.  I do not 
care if they are millions of dollars.  We need helicopters. We do 
not need them in 2008.  We needed them yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely scandalous to debate the issue in this place at 
this time with a government that cancelled a perfectly good 
contract for 43 helicopters because the Prime Minister found 
himself in a position where he had stated publicly that he would 
take his pen and write zero helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Prime Minister made a mistake and was not able to 
admit to it, and because his government and colleagues of the day 
would not force him to change his opinion, we are in a situation 
today where we cannot carry out search and rescue activities at 
any time on the east coast, west coast or in the high arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank goodness we have helicopter crews and mechanics who are 
absolute geniuses at keeping old helicopters airborne.  Otherwise 
we would be the laughingstock not only of NATO, not only of our 
own country but of the entire planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will relate an incident that happened in one of our NATO 
exercises.  If it were not such a sad thing it would be funny. We 
had a chopper sitting on the deck of an American frigate, as was 
typical.  Our pilots were standing on the deck when an American 
pilot came along. 
One of the American pilots came over and asked, in a typical 
southern accent, “You-all belong to that helicopter?”  The 
Canadian pilot said “Yeah, that is our chopper”.  The American 
pilot looked at him and said “Well, you know, it's smokin”. He 
was appalled.  There was smoke coming off the helicopter. There 
was smoke coming from the engine housing.  They could not believe 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That would not happen in the United States.  The Americans fly 
better hardware and have better gear because they have at least 
some respect for their military forces.  They put them in danger 
but they put them in danger with first class equipment, proper 
backup and some consideration that they might be dependent upon 
those soldiers, those men and women, at some future time in the 
history of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked offshore on the east coast from 1980 and 1988.  I went 
through two rig abandonments during that period.  We ended up 
staying on the rig.  We were safe.  There was a good chopper 
sitting on the deck and we could have abandoned the rig at any 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw the abandonment of the Euro Princess, a Yugoslavian 
freighter which had run aground off Sable Island.  Sixteen 
Yugoslav sailors were taken off the Euro Princess in 50 knot 
winds and 30 foot seas.  It was a very daring rescue mission 
carried out under very difficult circumstances.  There was a very 
narrow window of time to get to the freighter because it had lost 
power, no lights were working, it was in total darkness and it 
was the middle of the night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our search and rescue people were able to rescue the sailors and 
take them to Sable Island.  The boat was 650 feet long and was 
stuck on the bar around Sable Island.  The worry was that it 
would be swept free by a big wave and take the legs out from 
underneath the Rowan Juneau, the rig I was working on at the 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rig was abandoned except for 12 of us who kept the pump 
circulating to prevent being stuck in the hole.  The point is 
that we would not be able to carry out that rescue mission today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
With respect, I do not see how the discussion is relevant to the 
motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the member was making the 
case to get to that point of relevance.  In the next two minutes 
I am sure he will get to it, as we get ever closer to 5.30 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be cautious in how 
I say this, but the relevant point is very simple.  We need 
helicopters for search and rescue.  I understand as much as 
anyone in the House that the helicopters are on order.  We need 
helicopters for our military personnel.  We need first class 
equipment because we have first class pilots, men and women who 
operate the machines and who service them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that on the high seas, on the east or west coast of 
Canada or in the high arctic, human lives are not important is a 
scandalous admission by the government, but it does not surprise 
me at all.  It is typical of what we have been hearing during the 
debate and what we have seen from the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quoted a lot of numbers previously and, quite frankly, we get 
lost in the numbers.  I will make a comment to the intervention 
here again.  We are not talking about numbers here, we are 
talking about human lives.  We are talking about how we can carry 
out an offshore rescue, how we can find hunters who are lost, how 
we can get people out of the high arctic and how we can medivac 
people in dangerous circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a few minutes ago a member spoke about the fact that we 
just had a major tremor on the west coast of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is lucky, that is all, that the tremor was 46 
miles underground instead of 16 or 17 miles underground.  We 
would not only have highways shut down in B.C., we would have 
buildings collapse and we would have major fiascos.  In order to 
respond to that, we absolutely have to have the military up to 
strength and we have to have rescue vehicles.  Helicopters are 
the only rescue vehicle that can be used in those circumstances.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should proclaim 
August 1 of each year Emancipation Day in recognition of the 
heritage and contributions of Canada's black community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is an honour for me to rise this 
afternoon on behalf of the constituents of Calgary East to speak 
on Motion No. 242, a motion proclaiming emancipation day.  The 
text of the motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should proclaim 
August 1 of each (and every) year Emancipation Day in recognition 
of the heritage and contributions of Canada's black community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin my comments on the motion, I would like to say 
that I have been a member of the House since 1997.  This is the 
first time I have been able to bring forward one of my private 
member's initiatives for debate.  I quite frankly wondered if I 
would ever get a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How private members' business is conducted in the House is a 
strong reflection of the muzzle placed on opposition members and 
government backbenchers by the government.  There are some 
tremendous ideas generated from members of parliament that are 
being ignored or discounted because of the limited time and 
resources given to private members' bills and motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the motion before us today, it has been deemed a 
non-votable item, meaning that after today's one hour debate, the 
motion will disappear.  All the time, energy and thought that 
went into drafting the motion will simply disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that there is so little time for initiatives such 
as these.  The government could lengthen the time given to 
private members' business each week.  The government could allow 
one bill and one motion from each opposition and backbench MPs to 
be votable per session.  Changes like this could have a 
tremendous impact on this place, but then the government chooses 
not to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I will now begin my comments on Motion 
No. 242. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Slavery in the British Commonwealth ended on August 1, 1834, a 
day that is celebrated in several countries and Canadian cities 
as emancipation day.  This occurred a full 30 years before the 
United States abolished slavery with Lincoln's emancipation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spearheading the initiative was a member of parliament from the 
British house of commons.  William Wilberforce introduced a bill 
to stop the importation of slaves into the British colonies.  It 
was he who raised the voice of conscience.  He impressed upon his 
peers the horrors of slavery and stressed that this barbaric 
practice went against the teachings of Christianity and other 
religions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His heroic efforts have come to be recognized the world over and 
influenced the great American emancipator, Abraham Lincoln.  In 
fact, Mr. Wilberforce's bill was the first international human 
rights legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill called for the freedom of all people.  It was the 
beginning of the global eradication of slavery.  People tended to 
identify black slavery primarily with the United States.  To a 
much lesser degree, slavery was practised in Upper and Lower 
Canada in the 18th and early 19th centuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting that in the 1790s, several members of Upper 
Canada's legislative council and legislative assembly were slave 
owners.  At the same time, prominent individuals in both Upper 
and Lower Canada were opposed to slavery.  Individuals such as 
Lieutenant Governor John Simcoe, Chief Justice William Osgoode 
and Joseph Papineau were harsh critics of this barbaric practice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Emancipation Day is recognized in several countries and in both 
the cities of Ottawa and Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in Tanzania.  She is a country that has lost many of 
its sons and daughters to slavery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a little city on the coast called Bagamayo where we can 
still see the ruins of structures in which slaves were held 
before they were shipped to the Americas.  Standing there, tears 
come to people's eyes as they think of the suffering people 
endured and the number of families that were torn apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago I had the honour of going with the Governor 
General to Senegal.  On the islands we saw where slaves were 
taken out.  Believe me, it was not a pretty sight that any human 
being can be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1834 Canada has played a vital role to thousands of those 
whose basic human dignity was denied.  We can take great pride in 
the fact that the final destination of the underground railroad 
was Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a non-partisan initiative that I hoped would garner 
unanimous support in the House of Commons.  As Canadians, we 
should not only acknowledge past injustices but we must celebrate 
courage, compassion and conviction.  We, as parliamentarians, 
should feel a sense of pride that our system took a moral stand 
on the issue of slavery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion's only mandate is to recognize those people in the 
world who were the first to recognize emancipation for what it is 
and the hope it held for the millions of people who call 
themselves Canadians today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians listening to this debate today will know that February 
was a Black History Month.  Across the country Canadians of 
African descent celebrated and reflected upon their rich and 
diverse heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 22, on Parliament Hill, the Mathieu Da Costa Awards 
ceremony highlighted students from across the country who 
explored the contributions of Canadians of diverse ethnic and 
racial backgrounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with the members of the Ontario Black History Society who 
have been at the forefront of celebrations of black history for 
more than 20 years.  Through dedication and commitment, they 
continue to spread the history of black Canadians and their 
incredible achievements like: the great black Alberta cowboy Mr. 
John Ware whose log cabin still stands in the Dinosaur Provincial 
Park; Mathieu Da Costa who, in 1605, was thought to be the first 
person of African descent to set foot on Canadian soil; and Mr. 
Anderson Ruffin Abbot, the first black Canadian doctor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on about the past and ongoing accomplishments 
and contributions of Canada's black community.  Suffice it to say 
Canada is a better country and a better place today because of 
the contributions of black Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion I am speaking to today is not only about celebrating 
these accomplishments but acknowledging past injustices and the 
moral conviction of Canadians who took a stand against slavery.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to address Motion No. 242 from the hon. member for 
Calgary East, concerning Emancipation Day. The motion reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
proclaim August 1 of each year Emancipation Day in recognition of 
the heritage and contributions of Canada's black community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While February, which seemed very long, is Black History Month, 
this motion provides us with an opportunity to mark an 
particularly important event for the black community in Canada 
and in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, August 1 marks the coming into effect, in 1834, of the 
Emancipation Act introduced by Thomas Buxton in London's House of 
Commons, in 1833. That act ended slavery in all the British 
colonies. This was 30 years before President Abraham Lincoln's 
Emancipation Proclamation freed Black American slaves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about slavery, the first thing that comes to mind 
is the history of slaves in American plantations. 
Who can forget <I>Gone with the Wind</I> or the television series 
<I>Roots</I>?  But we must remember that slavery also existed, although 
on a lesser scale, north of the United States in what was then 
called British North America, i.e. the Maritimes, Quebec and 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of the conquest in 1759 there were 1,132 slaves of 
African origin on the soil of New France, although the French 
crown had never authorized the slave trade in New France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following American independence the number of slaves grew, 
particularly in 1783.  Certain Loyalists left the United States 
to settle in British North America, taking their slaves with 
them.  It was thus that 2,000 slaves arrived in the land we 
inhabit today.  Slavery remained legal in British North America 
until 1834. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike slavery during the same period in the United States and 
in other parts of the British Empire, such as Jamaica, where 
slaves represented the bulk of the manpower on large sugar cane 
plantations, slavery in British North America may quite rightly 
seem to have been a fairly minor phenomenon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation tabled in 1833 took effect on August 1, 1834. 
It abolished slavery throughout the British Empire.  However, it 
provided for a transitional period of from four to six years 
during which slaves would have to continue to work in the same 
place, but as apprentices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation made provision for immediate measures to be 
taken to abolish slavery throughout the British Empire. 
Accordingly, all children born during the proceedings leading to 
the passage of the legislation, or under the age of six, were 
free. All slaves over the age of six had to serve an 
apprenticeship of six years, in the case of slaves working in 
the fields, and four years, in the case of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation provided that apprentices were not to work more 
than 45 hours a week without pay and that they should be paid 
for any additional hours.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For their part, plantation owners had to feed and clothe all 
their apprentices.  They also had to provide a fund for the moral 
and religious education of former slaves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, compensation of 20 million pounds—I do not really know 
how that translates in today's terms—was to be paid to slave 
owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of the 21st century, this law is a nightmare. 
However, it marked the end of slavery in much of the world.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>August 1 is currently commemorated in Jamaica, the former 
British Guyana, in the Caribbean, areas where slavery lasted some 
considerable time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1834 runaway American slaves turned to the British colonies 
in North America until 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln 
implemented the Emancipation Proclamation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us had little knowledge of the experiences of our 
brothers and sisters in the Black community right here, in Canada 
and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today shed light on an ignoble period in 
our history, but one we cannot ignore.  To recognize August 1 as 
Emancipation Day is to recognize the deplorable, often horrible, 
treatment accorded a whole group of people.  It is to regret its 
occurrence and, in the end, it is to apologize for it and 
remember that the values of respect for humanity, equality and 
justice give societies their real strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois therefore supports this motion, seeing it as 
an expression of a desire to recognize the equality of 
individuals and the right to freedom.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am quite pleased to participate in the debate and 
exchange views with my colleagues on the motion to proclaim 
August 1 Emancipation Day in recognition of the heritage and 
contributions of Canada's black community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone sitting in the House can see for themselves that I am a 
descendant of Africans.  I am a descendant of African slaves 
brought to North America during the system of slavery, so the 
question of Emancipation Day in Canada is a personal issue for 
me.  I want to commend the member on the other side of the House 
for his motion and for his initiative in tabling the motion and 
calling on the government to declare August 1 Emancipation Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing of this debate makes the subject all the more 
important.  The Anti-Slavery Society of Canada was launched 150 
years ago in February.  The great American abolitionist, 
Frederick Douglas, was in Canada at the invitation of this 
society, as were other speakers.  The society sent delegations to 
Britain, lobbied churches and politicians and organized meetings 
in support of the cause of slaves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start by saying that the heritage and contributions of 
Canada's black communities are integral to the economic, 
political, social and cultural history of this country and its 
people.  Therefore the spirit of the motion is a reflection of 
what my government has been saying all along, that the heritage 
and contributions of Canada's black communities have made our 
country what it is:  multicultural, inclusive, prosperous and the 
best country in the world to live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote Martin Luther King and something that he 
said about Canada in one of his lectures in 1967:

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we want to build a fair and equitable society we 
have to start by acknowledging that our history is not perfect, 
that Canadians have suffered injustices at different periods and 
that it is regrettable that this otherwise compassionate and 
welcoming country also has a history of injustice.  This country 
has a history of slavery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that hon. members have already heard that slaves 
existed from the time of the first explorers, under la 
Nouvelle-France.  My first French ancestor came here from Rouen, 
France in 1668 at the same time that African slaves were here and 
were being sold and, in some cases, executed at the will of their 
owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Journey to Justice</I>, a new film by the National Film Board 
of Canada, charts the little known history of the struggle for 
black civil rights in Canada.  The history of our country has had 
regrettable aspects, but Canada was a safe haven for some 40,000 
to 60,000 slaves who escaped slavery in the United States in 
search of freedom in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did they search for freedom here?  Because Canada had the 
saving grace that slavery was abolished in 1833, over 30 years 
before it was abolished in the United States.  In the United 
States it took the American civil war to bring an end to slavery. 
As we all know, the American civil war is the war in which more 
Americans lost their lives than in the combination of the world 
wars that we knew in the 20th century.  Canada did not require a 
civil war in order to bring about prohibition of and an end to 
slavery.  I think that is to our credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some historians say that the underground railroad would not have 
been possible without the co-operation of the Canadians who 
ensured that there would be help for runaways once they made it 
to Canada.  Speaking of the underground railroad, we must also 
recognize the role of the slaves themselves who engineered the 
entire escape route, which included trails, rivers, swamps, 
caves, barns and woods that led runaways to freedom at great risk 
to their own lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My message to my colleagues here today is that Canada is proud 
of the heritage of Canada's black communities.  We value the 
contributions of my community to Canada's development.  At the 
same time, we must draw an important lesson from our history to 
make sure that Canada remains the north star, not just for blacks 
but for all Canadians of every ethnocultural origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As citizens and leaders we should remain vigilant and be 
committed that injustice never happens in our society again. 
Every Canadian must have a place in our society and must be 
afforded the opportunities to contribute to building the future 
of this great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has made this commitment to Canadians and I would 
like to say that we have demonstrated our commitment by taking 
concrete steps in many areas.  Let me give hon. members a sample 
of what we have done.

officially designating February as Black History Month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, Parks Canada and the U.S. national parks signed a 
memorandum of understanding committing their services to a number 
of projects, including the underground railroad.  Under this 
agreement we will ensure that the story of the underground 
railroad is adequately commemorated and communicated to the 
public.  The multiculturalism program has assisted Parks Canada 
and the black communities in the formation of an underground 
railroad network to facilitate co-ordination among historic 
sites, to improve conservation and to promote information sharing 
and marketing of sites, nationally and internationally.

Act, that the U.S. declared open season on runaway slaves—even 
those in the North, who has previously been considered 
free—sparking a rush to the border and galvanizing the fledgling 
abolitionist movement in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite proud of the multiculturalism program of the 
government.  The program continues to work with communities, 
institutions and different levels of government to promote social 
justice and equity in our society.  The multiculturalism 
initiative addresses local issues at the grassroots level, 
promotes institutional change so that our institutions are 
reflective of the makeup of our society and are responsive to the 
growing diversity and facilitate public education so that 
Canadians appreciate the rich diversity of our society.

motion.  I think it is great.  Given many of the statements made 
by members of his party who sit in the House, statements that 
were very derogatory toward the black communities, other 
ethnocultural communities and government initiatives, I would 
encourage him to support multiculturalism and attempt to change 
the minds and policies of his members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great honour and an opportunity for me to speak tonight on the 
private member's motion to establish an emancipation day in 
recognition of the heritage and contributions of Canada's black 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour because I represent thousands of people in 
Dartmouth and the communities of North Preston, East Preston and 
Cherry Brook, many of whom are the direct descendants of African 
people captured in the slave trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also honoured to speak on behalf of my esteemed colleague 
from Windsor, Ontario, who also represents many black Canadians 
who made their way out of slavery through the underground 
railroad into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important debate to have because it will shed light on 
a widely forgotten and obviously shameful part of our history. We 
can learn from it.  It is an opportunity for us to think, 
meditate and really try to imagine the experience of the first 
African-Canadian descendants who arrived in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does the story start?  It started 500 years ago when 
Spanish settlers first brought slaves from Africa to the 
Dominican Republic.  In the next 300 years, conservative 
estimates say that over 10 million people were brought across the 
Atlantic Ocean from Africa in the slave trade.  Henry Bishop, the 
curator of the Black Cultural Centre in Nova Scotia, said the 
numbers could be double or triple that but they do not take into 
account the numbers of women and children who died in transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where did this human cargo come from?  The original homeland of 
most Nova Scotia peoples of African descent is west Africa.  From 
about 500 until the 1600s, the three west African kingdoms of 
Ghana, Mali and Songhai were rich and powerful nations.  Their 
economic life revolved around agriculture, manufacturing and the 
international trade of gold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the British established rice, indigo and tobacco 
plantations in the southern parts of North America, plantation 
owners first used native Indians as slave labour but then turned 
their eyes eastward to the continent of Africa.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1700s European countries, including Great Britain, had 
slave trading companies on the west coast of Africa in such 
present day countries as Gambia, Sierra Leone and the Ivory 
Coast.  Men, women and children were captured inland, ripped away 
from their families and brought to the coast by African dealers, 
then sold and held in European slave factories.  They would then 
await shipment and be transported across the ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Americas and the Caribbean, the Africans were sold for 
cash.  This money purchased sugar, rum, spices, cotton, tobacco, 
coffee and molasses for sale in Europe.  The transatlantic slave 
trade between Africa, the Americas and Europe created immense 
wealth for European nations.  It was a cruel commerce in human 
lives with no regard for anything except profit and power.  I 
believe it surpassed any atrocity, any genocide, as yet recorded 
in human history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the northern colonies, slaves worked as farmhands, domestic 
workers or in trades, such as lumbering, mining, blacksmithing, 
weaving and spinning.  A slave was not free to marry, vote or 
move freely about.  A slave could be legally whipped, starved, 
tortured, mutilated or branded.  A slave could be forced to have 
children or to work many hours a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first crack in the slave trade began during the American 
revolution between 1776 and 1783.  Historians customarily portray 
the American revolution as an epic struggle for independence 
fought by stalwart white columnists against mighty England.  The 
struggle for liberty, life and the pursuit of happiness also 
involved tens of thousands of black Africans and their 
descendants residing in the British colonies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Caught in the middle of this war, thousands of them took up the 
British offer of full protection, freedom and land in return for 
their support for the British cause.  When the rebel Americans 
won the war, the black people in New York, who had joined the 
British before the surrender, were issued certificates of 
freedom.  About 3,500 of these black loyalists fled to what is 
now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Black loyalist settlements sprang up in Annapolis Royal, 
Weymouth, Digby, Windsor, Preston, Sydney and Halifax.  About 
1,500 black loyalists settled in Shelburne county.  Free blacks 
built the community of Birchtown, named after the man who signed 
their certificates of freedom.  Their freedom remained illusive 
and hard won.  The British had promised free land and rations for 
three years to the black loyalists.  However, most were cheated 
of land and forced to work on public projects, such as road 
building, and were denied equal status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Racism, epidemics, poverty and harsh winters made life miserable 
and for many the promised land became intolerable.  In 1792 about 
1,200 free blacks sailed from Halifax to Sierra Leone in west 
Africa where they helped set up the capital which is now 
Freetown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many more escaped slaves arrived in Nova Scotia from the United 
States during the war of 1812 under conditions similar to the 
ones of the black loyalists.  They moved into the Halifax area to 
settle in Preston, Hammond Plains, Beechville and Porters Lake. 
However life remained brutal and dangerous.  Slavery was still 
legal and in force in Nova Scotia until slavery was abolished in 
the British Empire in 1834. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of miles away, in the centre of the continent, in the 
period leading up to the American civil war, many more black 
African descendants travelled the underground railroad by night 
through waterways, swamps, forests and backroads.  With the 
assistance of such groups as the Quakers, free blacks and native 
Americans, these bonded men, women and children sought out the 
freedom land of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A legendary conductor of the underground railroad, Harriet 
Tubman, became known as the Moses of her people.  Tubman was born 
into slavery on a Maryland plantation and suffered brutal 
treatment before escaping in 1849.  Over the next decade she 
returned to the American south many times and led hundreds of 
freedom seekers north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It almost paralyzes the mind to think of the hardships facing 
these early black settlers in our country.  It is hard for young 
black Canadians of African descent to fathom the horror that 
befell their ancestors or the courage and the tenacity with which 
they carried on.  They were held together by strength of purpose 
and endurance, and by their faith in God.  Black loyalists used 
the church as a source of security, a social gathering place and 
an educational institution. 
The church provided a spiritual and emotional release for these 
settlers.  They continued to express their yearning and hope for 
freedom and equality through spiritual songs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The memory of slavery and the scars of slavery run deep in the 
black communities of Nova Scotia and all of Canada to this day. 
They run deep in the literature of black Nova Scotian artists 
such as Lucky Campbell, George Elliot Clark, Jeremiah Sparks, the 
gospel choirs, the civil rights activists and the church leaders. 
They run deep in their continued efforts to fight racism, 
poverty, injustice and ignorance wherever they find it in their 
struggle to raise their families and build strong communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They run deep in the words of the song which has become the 
black national anthem and which begins every event within the 
black community where I come from.  I respectfully quote from

Canadians of black African descent.  I wish to offer my support 
to the motion to enact an emancipation day so that we can

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure today that I rise to speak to the motion to create 
August 1 as emancipation day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for Calgary East for introducing the 
motion.  I also commend my colleague, the hon. member for 
Dartmouth, for her excellent discourse, particularly in her 
description of the very important history of black communities in 
Nova Scotia.  I commend the hon. member for a particularly 
thorough and engaging discourse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Black Nova Scotians have made very important contributions in 
the past and they continue to do so today.  We are very proud in 
Nova Scotia to have the largest indigenous black population on a 
per capita basis of any province in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised and disappointed with the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine when she turned what should have 
been a non-partisan debate on a very important fundamental issue, 
what should have been a celebration of multiculturalism, into a 
partisan mudslinging match on the floor of the House of Commons. 
I thought that was unnecessary and it is tragic that it happened 
today.  In this important issue there is clearly no role for 
partisanship.  Again I commend the member for Calgary East for 
introducing the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should celebrate the progress that has occurred for black 
Canadians since the days of slavery.  We should celebrate the 
emergence of some great Canadian black role models and black 
Canadians who have made such a terrific contribution to Canadian 
society and from whom we have all benefited.  That awareness of 
all our histories is important, particularly as a tool through 
education to combat the negative impacts of racism and the lost 
opportunities of racism.  I think again, as we pause to recognize 
and celebrate our individual collective histories, that it can 
take us a long way toward tackling the negatives of racism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has had a strong history in this regard.  It was the 
leader of our party today who as Prime Minister in 1979 appointed 
the first black Canadian to cabinet, Lincoln Alexander. 
Later Mr. Alexander went on to become Canada's first visible 
minority appointed as lieutenant governor of Ontario.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud in the other place to have Senator Donald Oliver, a 
fellow Nova Scotian and certainly a very strong contributor to 
the Senate.  He is a great Canadian who serves the interests of 
all Nova Scotians and all Canadians very well.  Of course we have 
Senator Anne Cools in the other place, and in this place we are 
very pleased to have members of the black community who 
contribute so much to the betterment of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>l will mention a few individuals from Nova Scotia who made a 
particularly great contribution to our history.  The hon. member 
for Dartmouth through her history in theatre would know the actor 
Walter Borden.  We are also proud of novelist Fred Ward, 
filmmaker Sylvia Hamilton and poets Maxine Tynes and David Woods, 
and poet, author and filmmaker George Elliot Clark, all of whom 
have made significant contributions to our history and the 
cultural mosaic of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should have also mentioned that Senator Oliver is from 
Wolfville, Nova Scotia, which is in my riding.  I am also very 
proud of Ted Upshaw, an inspector in the RCMP who is the highest 
ranking black Canadian in the history of the RCMP.  He is from 
Three Mile Plains outside Windsor in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we celebrate these great contributions.  As 
we become more aware, particularly as young Canadians become more 
aware of these excellent and important contributions, it can make 
a lot of difference in tackling some of the misconceptions and 
the stereotypes which so often hurt all of us.  As a society it 
has a negative impact from a macro perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do an awful lot more through education by celebrating the 
contributions of the past and present and working toward ensuring 
a more unfettered access to the opportunities to shape the future 
of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to consider things like equality of opportunities in 
terms of economic issues as well.  We have to ensure that not 
only our governmental institutions but also businesses and 
individuals all strive a little harder to ensure that the 
barriers to access, to success and to opportunity are taken down. 
We have to make that commitment on an ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere is it easier to do that and to start setting an example 
than through our education systems provincially.  The federal 
government can play a role in working with provincial governments 
on these types of initiatives.  I tend to think those are 
probably the best places to start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion of my friend and colleague from Calgary Centre to 
designate August 1 as a holiday, as emancipation day, would be a 
step forward.  It would be beneficial in terms of helping achieve 
some of these goals.  It is only one step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for bringing forward the motion.  I 
wish it had been made votable.  It is unfortunate that in this 
place so much work and thought go into private members' business 
that are ultimately not provided with the level of attention I 
feel is important or with the level of attention that the members 
opposite would like to see provided to some important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that it was not made a votable motion.  I regret that 
some members opposite chose the opportunity to turn this very 
important and positive debate into a more partisan exercise. 
That should not in any way, shape or form detract from the 
commendations for the member's initiative in bringing this 
forward.  I wish him all the best in this initiative and offer 
the complete support of myself and my party for this initiative.

extremely sad that the member on the other side took this 
opportunity to play politics.  She could not understand that this 
was a private member's motion, an initiative.  She is a

this.  However, she closed her remarks with unfortunate partisan 
politics that has brought this debate down two notches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope, and I join my colleague, that the importance of the
