</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this year the Ontario Agricultural College in my riding 
of Guelph—Wellington is celebrating its 125th anniversary.  Much 
has changed since the OAC opened its doors in 1874, but the one 
thing that remains the same is the OAC's well deserved reputation 
as a world leader in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many distinguished Canadians have graduated from OAC, including 
astronaut Roberta Bondar and our very own Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OAC has also produced a very well respected university.  The 
University of Guelph grew out of this agricultural college to 
become one of the best universities in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate all of the faculty and staff of the 
Ontario Agricultural College, both past and present.  They have 
built a tradition of excellence of which not only 
Guelph—Wellington but all of Canada is proud.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on Friday, January 29 I hosted a public forum to discuss 
the Estey report on grain transportation.  Over 250 grain 
producers attended the meeting from across Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba.  Farmers not only had an opportunity to listen to a 
panel of speakers discuss the merits of the report, but they also 
had a chance to get up and voice their opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While producers are not unanimous in their support of this 
report, there was a message that was very evident during the 
meeting.  Farmers are frustrated with the current system. 
Producers are losing millions of dollars each year due to 
government regulation and inefficiencies in the grain handling 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPAC, the parliamentary television channel, taped the meeting 
and it will be replayed on February 6 and 7.  The Minister of 
Transport and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food should 
take time to watch the tape of this meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all MPs and Canadians everywhere to hear directly from 
food producers.  Farmers put high quality food on our tables and 
are the economic base in many communities.  We need to listen to 
them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today in connection with the Bloc Quebecois' 
position, which is surprising to say the least, concerning child 
pornography and the role of Parliament in the judiciary process. 
The position of the Bloc Quebecois on this matter is 
incongruous and hard to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this party and its members support such a motion, given 
their past positions on various justice issues?  I personally 
see this as an attempt to hijack this debate in order to justify 
recourse to the notwithstanding clause of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let them try to defend future recourse to that clause, fine, but 
I believe that the public will be able to figure out for itself 
that Bloc members are using the debate on child pornography and 
the judiciary process for purely political purposes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Team Canada has scored another major international 
hockey victory.  Our national team came home on New Year's Day 
1999 after winning the Spengler Cup in Switzerland for the fourth 
consecutive year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the first time any country has won four times in a row 
during the cup's 77 year history.  The latest championship by 
Team Canada was made possible through the defensive efforts of 
not one, but two outstanding players in the great riding of 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke:  Shawn Heins of Eganville and Allan 
Letang of Renfrew.  Not only my constituents are proud of their 
efforts, but all Canadians are proud of all Team Canada players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that Team Liberal will be put to the test when 
Canada's political champions travel up the valley into my 
riding's hockey hot bed to compete next Wednesday night at the 
Pembroke winter carnival.  We will be facing a much tougher 
opposition of sharpshooters compared to the puny, punchless, 
prolix popguns who pass themselves off as the opposition in this 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
APEC is an issue that is not going to go away for this Prime 
Minister or for this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as Watergate was not about a break-in, the APEC inquiry is 
not about pepper spray.  It is about freedom of expression.  It 
is about political interference from the Prime Minister giving 
direction to Canada's national police force to suppress 
protesters' freedom of expression.

public complaints commission process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will spend millions and millions of dollars, still 
ending up at a blind wall.  With over $1.4 million already blown 
away and hundreds of witnesses to hear, they have only heard 
four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is already so high because the solicitor general and 
justice minister have agreed to protect the Prime Minister at a 
rate of $2,000 an hour for lawyers' fees.  Commissioner Ted 
Hughes is trying to sort out the lawyer funding mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the APEC public complaints commission process lurches 
forward, even under the astute guidance of Ted Hughes, I say 
again that we have the right driver in the wrong vehicle.

quotas to cut off as many people as needed to net government

government has given employees a choice:  either cut off enough 
people to meet your quotas or lose your jobs.

pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us seriously talk about how the Reform Party cares about 
children in the country.  They were the only people in the 
country to speak out opposed to the national child benefit. Every 
government, provincial and territorial, agreed, and they were 
opposed.  It was the only party in the House to oppose the 
community action program for children so that children could get 
a hot lunch.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Canada ratified 
the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991. 
It should be noted that 191 state parties have ratified the 
convention.  Article 43 of the convention provides for the 
establishment of a UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to 
review reports of states parties which have ratified the 
convention.  As a party to the convention and pursuant to article 
44 of the convention, Canada is required to submit a report to 
the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child on the measures it 
has adopted which give effect to the rights recognized in the 
convention and on the progress made on the enjoyment of those 
rights.  Canada presented its first report in 1994.  The Canadian 
Coalition for the Rights of Children, the coalition, also made a 
presentation at that time.  One of the recommendations of the UN 
committee was that a permanent monitoring mechanism be 
established to assess Canada's compliance with the convention. 
In its concluding observation on Canada's first report, the UN 
committee stated that it is “concerned that sufficient attention 
has not been paid to the establishment of a permanent monitoring 
mechanism taht will enable a system of implementation of the 
convention in all parts of the country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The coalition approached several departments to secure funding 
for a separate, independant and impartial report which would 
represent non-governmental organizations' view point with respect 
to Canada's cpmpliance with the convention.  Both Canada's report 
and the coalition's report will be submitted to the UN committee 
in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Coalition for the Rights of Children ensures the collective 
voice of over 50 non-governmental organizations in Canada 
concerned with the rights of children, such as the Adoption 
Council of Canada, UNICEF Canada, Save a Family Plan, Street Kids 
International, CARE Canada, Child Find Canada and Child Welfare 
League of Canada, is heard.  The mandate of this national 
organization is to monitor the implementation of the convention. 
In order to accomplish this task, it has developed a framework to 
measure the status of children's rights in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This framework will enable the federal and provincial 
governments to assess which prgrams and policies are effective 
and identify the work that needs to be done to promote the 
development and well-being of Canadian children.  The coalition 
has been working on this project since 1995.  Several departments 
have made a contribution to the coalition.  The Department of 
Justice has been co-ordinating the funding since 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a), (b), (c), and (d): The Coalition for the Rights of Children 
received funding in 
fiscal year 1995-96 and 1996-97 to develop a framework to monitor 
Canada's implementation of the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child.  The funders for this initiative were: 
Canadian Heritage, Human Rights, $24,750 and Health Canada, 
Childhood and Youth, $24,750. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the project was to devise a monitoring process by 
establishing research indicators and identifying sources of 
information.  The coalition reached out to the broader community 
to complete this initiative.  The final product was only due 
during the course of fiscal year 1996-97 upon receipt of 
additional funding to write and produce a publication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The coalition received funding in fiscal year 1996-97 to write and 
produce the monitoring project report and to disseminate the 
findings.  The funding partners were: Justice Canada, Public Law, 
$25,950; Canadian Heritage, Human Rights, $45,950;and Health Canada, 
Childhood and Youth, $8,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project resulted in the publication of a 45 page document 
entitled:  “Canada and the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child:  Developing a Monitoring Framework”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The coalition received funding in fiscal year 1997-98 to develop 
Canada-wide information network, including key 
provincial-territorial correspondents, through conference 
participation and meetings.  This will ensure that the monitoring 
of the convention is truly effective and accurate.  The coalition 
is also in the process of conducting a review of convention 
articles in order to identify the issues and to determine 
methodology for data collection in order to commence the drafting 
of the report.  The funding partners included: 
Justice Canada, Grants and Contributions Fund, $30,000; Canadian Heritage, 
Human Rights, $35,000; Status of Women, $30,000; Health Canada, 
Childhood and Youth, $40,000; Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, $8,000; 
Human Resources Development Canada, Office for Disabilities 
Issues, $20,000; and Human Resources Development Canada, Social Development 
Partnerships Program, $5,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For fiscal year 1998-99, the coalition is expected to receive 
the following amounts to collect and analyse data for the 
application of the Canadian Coalition for the Rights of Children 
developed framework to convention articles and to evaluate overall 
findings:  Justice Canada, Grants and Contributions Fund, 
$62,000; Health Canada, Childhood and Youth, $45,000; Canadian Heritage, 
Human Rights, $40,000; Human Resources Development Canada, Office for 
Disabilities Issues, $25,000;and Human Resources Development Canada, 
Social Development Partnerships Program, $25,000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>(e), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j): The Department of Canadian 
Heritage has funded the following 
projects related to the UN Convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fiscal year 1994-95, the Society for Children and Youth of 
B.C. undertook a project entitled “UN Convention on the Rights 
of the Child—Promotion and Implementation”.  Canadian Heritage 
provided a grant in the amount of $18,850.  The purpose of the 
project was to promote the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
to act as a provincial clearinghouse linking individuals and 
organizations interested in the convention and to explore ways of 
monitoring compliance to the convention to be carried out in 
fiscal year 1995-96.  An interim report on the project has been 
filed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fiscal year 1995-96, Canadian Heritage provided a grant of 
$10,000 to the Society for Children and Youth of B.C. for the 
second part of the project.  It was entitled “UN Convention on 
the Rights of the Child—Rights Awareness Project-Year 2”.  In 
adition to the purpose outlined in the project for fiscal year 
1994-95, the year 2 project also focuses on identifying 
mechanisms for monitoring compliance with the articles of the 
convention.  A final report has been received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fiscal year 1997-98, the Society for Children and Youth of 
B.C. received a grant from Canadian Heritage in the amount of 
$20,000 for a project entitled “UN Convention on the Rights of 
the Child:  Measuring Compliance of Policy and Practice”.  The 
purpose of the project was to undertake research to develop a 
monitoring framework to measure the compliance of policies and 
pratices with respect to the implementation of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the society's model enables the 
development of an analytical framework and a four star rating 
system for assessing the compliance of legislation with the 
convention.  These were applied to all British Columbia statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Coalition for the Rights of Children's monitoring 
framework can be compared to a wide angle lens for assessing 
implementation of the convention in Canada, taking into account 
all aspects of the convention from legal to a public opinion 
perspective.  The Society for Children and Youth of B.C.'s 
statutory compliance model and the proposed policy and practice 
models can perhaps be described as telephoto lenses, which 
presents the detailed picture in the areas of legislations and 
regulations, policy and practice.  Integrating these two vistas 
would provide the basis for a comprehensive picture of the level 
of implementation of the convention in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A search of the files of the Department of Justice for the last 
three fiscal years reveals that in fiscal year 1997-98 the 
Department of Justice provided a grant of $10,000 to the 
University of Montreal, Faculty of Law, to write and publish a 
book on the rights of the child in Quebec, viewed through the UN 
convention on the Rights of the Child.  This book will also 
contain a in-depth analysis of existing legislation, doctrine and 
case law and proposals for reform in light of the convention. 
The book will fill a void in the French academic tools presently 
available.  The book is due out in 1999.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Citizenship Act was last reviewed, back in 1977, our

Now that we are in the era of globalization, we are seeing

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our citizenship is the very foundation of the Canadian identity. 
It is the common denominator that unites us from coast to coast. 
It is also one of our most valuable assets. 
Our citizenship gives us invaluable rights and freedoms and it

</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship is something we do not give much thought to in our

have met hundreds of new Canadians for whom this ceremony was a 
highlight of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many of our new fellow citizens, the certificate of

roots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian citizenship is not only a prerequisite for being issued 
a passport and for voting. It is first and foremost a milestone 
in becoming a full-fledged member of our society with its great 
humanitarian tradition of fairness and equity, and it is in 
keeping with this tradition that we drafted the new Citizenship 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, we conducted consultations with Canadians that have 
enabled us to put forward today a piece of legislation that 
addresses their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank all those who were involved in this 
process. As many of you may have noticed in December, when I 
first introduced the bill, it contains major improvements and 
necessary updates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since many of my colleagues have already perused the new 
Citizenship Act, there is no need to get into an exhaustive 
presentation. I will nonetheless take a moment to outline its 
key elements. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This innovative act includes some important changes for the 
attribution of citizenship at birth.  There are three ways of 
obtaining citizenship by birth.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship is automatically granted to all children born in 
Canada, to children born abroad of a Canadian parent and to 
children adopted abroad by a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granting Canadian citizenship to all children born in our 
country is what we call the jus soli principle.  This principle, 
honoured by many countries, aims to prevent statelessness.  It 
also reaffirms our adhesion to the Canadian humanitarian 
tradition to which I referred earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children born abroad to Canadian parents will automatically be 
Canadian citizens.  However, the second generation of children 
born in a foreign country will have to reside in Canada for three 
years before age 28 in order to retain their Canadian 
citizenship.  Then again, it is important for our government to 
make sure that our citizenship is based on the attachment we have 
to our country and the knowledge we have of its values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping with our tradition of justice and fairness, we 
propose changes to ensure greater equity between natural born and 
adopted children.  Currently, a foreign child adopted by a 
Canadian citizen is treated as an immigrant and must be first 
admitted as a permanent resident.  With the new act, a foreign 
child adopted by a Canadian will be granted citizenship without 
having to go through the entire immigration process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a signatory to the Hague Convention on Protection of 
Children, Canada is committed to ensuring that inter-country 
adoption respects the best interests and rights of the child. 
The new act represents a strong statement in support of this 
commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the adoption must conform to the laws of the nation 
where the adoption takes place and to those of the province of 
residency of the adoptive parents since adoption falls under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, one can also choose to become Canadian.  It 
was important that we also modernize the attribution of 
citizenship by naturalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main features of the new act is the clear and precise 
definition of criteria for attaining citizenship by 
naturalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our primary goal is to ensure that people who obtain Canadian 
citizenship have a deep commitment to the adopted country.  We 
believe that commitment is possible only if the person is 
physically in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Physical presence makes it possible to develop a sense of 
belonging and a better understanding of Canadian society, values 
and culture.  With this in mind, we have redefined the residency 
criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many have noticed, the current legislation does not include 
the word “physical”, thus leaving too much room for 
interpretation of the meaning of “residence”.  The new act 
phrases the residency conditions in more precise terms, requiring 
such presence in the country.  Accordingly, a permanent resident 
must reside in Canada for a cumulative three years during the 
five years that precedes his or her application for citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people who come to Canada are involved in business and 
maintain links with their country of origin.  Actually, over half 
of business immigrants create their own jobs.  They bring in new 
capital and contribute to the development of Canada's 
international trade.  This represents a notable contribution to 
our country.  Other newcomers seek to maintain close social and 
family ties to their countries of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the reason, it is vital that we provide these permanent 
residents with the flexibility to travel outside Canada. 
Therefore, we have extended the period during which they need to 
meet the physical residency requirement from four years to five. 
This offers a sufficiently flexible framework that takes into 
account the reality of those who need to travel for business or 
personal reasons.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also adding a new requirement that calls for adequate 
knowledge of our country and of one of our official languages. We 
want applicants to be familiar with the values of our society and 
to be able to demonstrate it without the help of an interpreter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members might wonder why we have put so much emphasis on 
physical presence and knowledge of the country.  To answer this 
question we have to ask ourselves the meaning we give to our 
citizenship.  The answer lies in our principles and in the 
tradition of democracy, justice and fairness that we all share in 
Canada.  It is of utmost importance that people who adopt Canada 
as their new home be prepared to accept the responsibilities that 
accompany the privileges of holding Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These criteria provide the necessary balance between two key 
principles:  protecting the value of Canadian citizenship while 
providing flexibility for prospective new Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new process will also address concerns expressed by 
Canadians across the country.  It will protect the value of 
Canadian citizenship and promote administrative efficiencies. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this new legislation on citizenship, we are doing what is 
needed to change a complex process to make it more precise, more 
effective and better suited to today's reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In establishing clear and precise criteria for citizenship, we 
are helping to ensure its value.  It allows us as well to 
simplify a process that is currently long and time consuming. 
Most applications for citizenship pose no problems.  They can 
now be processed by citizenship officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the citizenship judges, as they are currently known, will 
have more time to work on other duties given them.  To mark the 
change in their role, we will now be calling them citizenship 
commissioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new citizenship legislation defines some of the selection 
criteria of these commissioners.  They will be Canadians who 
have distinguished themselves through their significant 
contribution to their community and Canadian society.  They will 
be people who have shown, through their commitment to the 
community, their ability to fill the role with enthusiasm and 
dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to asking them to preside over citizenship 
ceremonies, we will ask them to spend a significant portion of 
their time promoting related civic values. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the public consultations on legislative review I met with 
people from every part of the country.  Although the main focus 
was on immigration, citizenship was also included in the dialogue 
I had with Canadians.  It became clear to me that one of the best 
ways to enhance the meaning of our citizenship was to promote it 
widely.  As our society changes it seems very relevant to promote 
values such as civic responsibility, respect for the law and 
understanding among peoples.  Indeed these lie at the core of our 
Canadian identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best persons to assume this responsibility are our 
citizenship commissioners.  The improvements to the decision 
making process will allow them to use their time, talents and 
expertise to actively promote community involvement and Canadian 
citizenship.  Being a Canadian citizen brings rights and 
privileges and the exercise of these rights entails 
responsibility.  Our citizenship commissioners will now take upon 
themselves the mandate of making Canadian citizens well aware of 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding I will take a few moments to discuss the oath 
proposed under the new Citizenship of Canada Act.  I am proud to 
propose to my fellow Canadians a pledge of allegiance adapted to 
today's values.  The previous oath had remained unchanged for 
over half a century.  It was high time to review it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed oath includes a clear commitment to Canada, to the 
Queen, to Canadian values and to respect for our rights and 
freedoms.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When new Canadians pledge their allegiance to Canada they will 
also commit themselves to observing our laws and to fulfilling 
their duties and obligations as active members of Canadian 
society. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year in Canada, some 160,000 people become Canadian 
citizens.  Their commitment to their country of adoption is 
expressed in the oath of allegiance.  With the new oath we are 
proposing, that commitment will no longer be to symbols but 
rather to the concrete definition of Canadian citizenship: our 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a model throughout the world, 
defence of the democratic values that unite us, respect for our 
laws and for our duties and obligations as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to remind you that the primary mission 
of my department is to contribute to building a stronger Canada. 
The new Citizenship Act fits into that mission by reinforcing 
the value of our most precious asset as Canadians: our 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building a stronger Canada means modernizing our institutions so 
that they may reflect contemporary issues and realities while 
respecting our traditions of justice, equity and compassion. 
Finally, building a stronger Canada means lending an ear to the 
concerns of the people of Canada, and responding to those 
concerns. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new act is the result of considerable consultation and in 
depth reflection on what we want our country to be in the next 
century.  It is part of the government's efforts to modernize 
Canadian institutions, to keep them in tune with today's 
realities and to foster public confidence in them, and to 
preserve and promote our identity, our values and our traditions. 
We need to make sure our legislative framework is updated to 
reflect our sense of who we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I propose today with this forward looking, uniquely 
Canadian legislation.  Therefore I ask all members of the House 
to support the new Citizenship of Canada Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I ask for unanimous consent of the House to have the 
minister respond to questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is their unanimous consent to permit 
a question and comment period consequent on the minister's speech 
as suggested? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
very unfortunate the minister was not willing to entertain 
questions at this time.  I certainly have a lot of questions for 
her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation, an act to replace the current 
Citizenship Act, is dealing with the very important subject 
matter of citizenship.  It is a very personal issue and an issue 
that most of us feel very strongly about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is especially important for new immigrants so that they sense 
the pride in accepting Canadian citizenship, the feeling of new 
opportunity that comes with being a Canadian citizen, and the 
commitment that taking citizenship means and demonstrates to our 
country, Canada.  For new Canadians particularly citizenship is 
something that is very personal and very important.  For that 
reason the subject matter of this piece of legislation is also 
very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time I have been immigration critic for the official 
opposition I have heard touching personal stories from new 
Canadians about what it means to be a Canadian citizen.  All of 
us who are not new citizens of the country could be reminded what 
it really means by listening to our newest citizens.  I know many 
of us feel strongly about being a Canadian citizen, but a 
reminder from time to time would do none of us any harm.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by giving a little background material to the bill. 
The government's stated purpose has been presented by the 
minister.  Bill C-63 was tabled by the minister on December 7, 
1998.  It is intended to replace the current Citizenship Act. 
Bill C-63 will be the new Citizenship Act when it passes, 
hopefully with many amendments about which I will talk in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-63 has been touted by the minister as the first major 
reform of citizenship in 20 years.  It is an attempt to modernize 
the act, as we have just heard the minister express.  While some 
parts appear to more clearly define parts of the act than they 
are defined in the other act, Bill C-63 certainly does not 
constitute a major modern reform.  Critical areas have been 
neglected while others have been changed in a negative way.  I 
will refer to a few of those in my presentation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the minister on two points.  First, I 
congratulate her for finally after three years as minister 
presenting some legislation in her area.  Clearly the first piece 
of legislation should have been major changes to the Immigration 
Act because the Citizenship Act refers to the Immigration Act in 
several cases. Because the Immigration Act is clearly in a state 
of collapse we need new legislation in that area immediately. 
That should have been the first area dealt with, but I sincerely 
congratulate the minister for finally bringing forth a piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I congratulate the minister and her department for 
making the bill an easy bill to read.  I am very sincere about 
this point.  Some pieces of legislation are very difficult to 
work one's way through.  This one is not.  It is presented in a 
very clear way.  That allows anyone reading the legislation to 
very quickly recognize that there are many things missing from 
the legislation.  I will talk about some of those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In way of a general response to the bill, the Standing Committee 
on Citizenship and Immigration tabled its report in 1994, four 
and half years ago.  It was the only committee report that has 
dealt in a substantial way with citizenship.  Many others have 
dealt with various components of the Immigration Act, but it was 
the only one that has dealt with citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four and a half years later we finally have legislation dealing 
with the act, but unfortunately it does not deal with many key 
issues proposed by a committee which is a Liberal dominated 
committee.  With a majority of Liberal members we would think the 
minister would listen and pay some attention to what the 
committee put forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This unwillingness to change integral parts of the act will 
result in several things, and there are some very negative 
things.  The court system will ultimately make law in several 
areas which should be made by the House of Commons and by 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is left out of the act will in effect neutralize some of 
the good proposals that are put forth in a very general way by 
the legislation.  In other words, it has been put forth in such a 
general way and so much has been left to regulation that it is 
virtually meaningless in many cases.  The regulations that will 
be put forth by departmental officials will determine the impact 
of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An increase in power is given to the minister in many areas of 
the legislation.  To be fair, I recognize that authority is 
necessary in some places.  I will talk a bit later about one of 
those areas.  Too much power is being given to the minister 
without the checks and balances required to make sure that no 
individual will be discriminated against in an unfair way.  I am 
very concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along the same line and by way of general comment, the 
legislation contains clauses which were incorporated not as the 
result of an initiative on the part of the minister but due to 
court cases. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545
<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old legislation was so loose, the court in effect made law, 
and the minister decided she should at this time incorporate the 
court decisions in law which she is required to do. An example of 
a case which is worth talking about shows the extreme unfairness 
of parts of the old act which led to one of the changes in this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until recently there remained within the Citizenship Act a 
discrimination between men and women. Before 1977 certain 
children would not have qualified for citizenship and under the 
current act, such children are required by the act to make an 
application for citizenship and undergo a criminal security 
check.  Children born abroad before 1977 to a Canadian mother 
would not automatically obtain citizenship but children born 
abroad before 1977 to a Canadian father need only register their 
births. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this was an unbelievable discriminatory aspect of the 
old bill.  Unfortunately, rather than government changing that 
before 1977 it was changed by the courts and incorporated here by 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these general reasons and some very specific reasons, the 
official opposition must oppose this bill unless there is 
substantial willingness on the part of this minister and this 
government to accept some substantial and broad amendments.  I 
would hope that kind of co-operation is there between the 
official opposition and the government and that the government 
will look at some very substantial amendments that we will be 
proposing in committee and at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those amendments are accepted, then we would only be too 
happy to support this legislation.  However, at this time we 
clearly cannot accept this legislation in the way it has been 
presented to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get into the specifics of the act.  One of the 
very serious flaws of Bill C-63 deals with citizenship at birth. 
Bill C-63 states that all children born in Canada, except those 
born to diplomats, are automatically citizens at birth regardless 
of whether either of their parents has citizenship status as a 
landed immigrant or as a permanent resident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 12 of the 1994 committee report states 
“Children born in Canada should be Canadian citizens only if one 
or both parents is a permanent resident of Canada”.  This 
statement was made in a House of Commons committee report, a 
committee dominated by Liberal members of this House, yet the 
minister refused to accept that recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not only the House of Commons committee that recommended 
change in this area.  In 1997 the LRAG report, the legislated 
review advisory committee report, outlined the government's 
awareness of the problems that this clause was causing.  It said 
“In our consultations across the country we heard concerns about 
the abuse of the provision of the Citizenship Act granting 
automatic citizenship to children born on Canadian soil”.  It 
was recognized by that committee as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this is the position of the official opposition, and I 
am going to quote directly from Reform policy.  “Reform supports 
an immigration and citizenship policy that requires children born 
in Canada to take the citizenship of their parents.  Children 
born in Canada to landed immigrants would assume Canadian 
citizenship”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, there is support from several groups and from many 
Canadians to not automatically grant citizenship to children born 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During her press conference tabling this bill in December, the 
minister stated that she made no changes to this clause because 
there was no research done on how big a problem citizenship at 
birth really is.  She stated that because hospital records do not 
request the nationality of parents and that changing this would 
require provincial co-operation, her hands were basically tied in 
terms of collecting data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister has been the minister for immigration for three 
years now. 
Why has the necessary background work not been done so that the 
minister could have presented in this bill those changes that 
Canadians are asking for.  Her story is that she cannot do 
anything about it because the research has not been done. It has 
been four and a half years since the committee reported. Why on 
earth has the research not been done?  I hope the minister will 
answer that somewhere along the way. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On several occasions the minister has made it clear that she 
really does understand the abuses that result because of this 
automatic granting of citizenship.  She knows of the case of 
Mavis Baker which is before the supreme court now.  In this case 
Mavis Baker who came to this country legally and has three 
children was ordered to be deported by the minister's department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the legislation is so loose and based on the UN 
Convention on the Rights of the Child among other things, her 
lawyer stepped in and said that Mrs. Baker could not be deported. 
Her deportation order by the department is being overturned by 
the court.  We have not heard the results of this case yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not be the least bit surprised that because this law has 
been left as it is, the minister's neglect in this case, that the 
courts could well determine based on the UN Convention on the 
Rights of the Child that these children be automatically granted 
Canadian citizenship due to the law the minister chose to leave 
the way it is.  Because the UN Convention on the Rights of a 
Child does not allow separation of a mother from her children, 
the court could determine that this woman cannot be deported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That kind of law in effect being made by a court is completely 
unacceptable.  Let us have laws in this country made in the 
Parliament of Canada.  It is only loose legislation, improper 
legislation that allows the courts to make laws the way they have 
been doing for so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue that has been dealt with in this bill and which 
I want to talk about concerns the requirements for granting 
citizenship.  There are some recommendations in this bill that 
look good on the surface. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 6(1)(b) of Bill C-63 defines the terms of permanent 
residence more concisely than does the current act.  This was 
incorporated in response to recommendation 6 of the committee 
report.  The existing legislation may be loosely interpreted. 
Some individuals have been found to be residing in Canada due to 
a court case.  The courts determined that they were residing in 
Canada because they had a bank account in this country or because 
they own property here. Either one of these things would indicate 
that they were residing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said the right words in the bill.  She said that we 
were going to plug that hole.  What will be required is 1,095 
days or three years of physical presence in this country within a 
five year period to meet the conditions for applying for 
citizenship.  That change was made.  Sadly this change is 
rendered virtually useless because the minister did not implement 
recommendation 7 of the House of Commons report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 7 said that measures should be introduced to 
enable accurate monitoring of periods of time that permanent 
residents are absent from Canada.  There is nothing that provides 
any mechanism or any rules that would allow for the tabulation 
that would be necessary under this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect this piece of legislation is rendered completely 
useless because the follow-up step has not been done. What will 
follow will be done behind closed doors by the minister's 
officials.  The minister will approve as she sees fit without any 
requirement that it be passed by this House. In effect, even a 
change that sounds good and looks good is rendered virtually 
useless because it is so loose it is meaningless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about the blatant patronage. It goes another 
step that we have not seen for some time.  Let us look at the 
blatant patronage which has been promoted in regard to 
citizenship judges. 
Probably one of the most contentious issues of this bill is the 
continued trend of patronage which has now been put at a new 
level.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under clauses 31 and 32 the duties of the current citizenship 
judges will be handed over to departmental officials at 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada.  We have called for that for 
some time.  That is a good move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizenship judges who are patronage appointees will no 
longer determine citizenship.  That will be done within the 
department.  We have supported that because it should reduce 
costs, allow some streamlining and lead to some consistency in 
the rulings among the people who are determining citizenship. 
That is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of just ending the patronage appointments entirely, the 
minister has created the new position of commissioner.  What is 
the role of these commissioners?  They will continue to get paid 
at the same rate until their terms are up and then they will be 
reappointed at the minister's will, or some new friends will be 
appointed.  What is their role? Listen carefully because it is 
unbelievable that this kind of patronage appointment would be put 
in place.  Their role is to promote active citizenship in the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk to the member from Hamilton, to the Canadian heritage 
minister about that because that is one of the stated purposes of 
her department.  They had better get it straightened out between 
the immigration minister and the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
and decide which department will do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians would say it is not necessary for any department 
to do this.  It is a complete waste of taxpayers' money.  Let us 
stop wasting money in the citizenship and immigration department. 
Let us stop wasting money in the Canadian heritage department 
and let the local residents and local community groups promote 
good citizenship.  I know of so many groups that do such a good 
job of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us cut this spending entirely.  I can sure see the Speaker 
is agreeing with this completely.  That encourages me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to make several more points about citizenship judges 
but I think I have made the point.  I will go on to the next 
section which is the granting of citizenship, clause 6(1)(b)(i). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation allows individuals whose application for 
permanent residence is approved to count each full day of 
residency in Canada from the date of application as a half day 
toward the total needed for citizenship application.  That is the 
way the current act reads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-63 removes that provision. As a result applicants will be 
penalized for bureaucratic delays in the department.  Even if 
these delays are caused through no fault of their own, because of 
the removal of the provision they will be given no credit 
whatsoever toward their three year requirement for residency in 
the country before they are eligible to apply for citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disgusting.  Few things disgust me more than when a 
department acting inefficiently can put that kind of burden on 
someone who wants to apply for citizenship in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly people who want to become Canadian citizens should not 
be denied the opportunity to do so in a timely fashion just 
because of bureaucratic holdups.  It is a very sad commentary on 
this part of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some changes made regarding adoption outside Canada. 
Some of these changes seem to be a move in the right direction 
but they are so loosely defined and the regulation will really 
determine whether they are effective or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-63 will reduce the distinction between a foreign child 
adopted by a Canadian citizen and a child born in Canada. 
Currently a foreign child adopted by a Canadian citizen must 
first be admitted to Canada as a permanent resident before 
citizenship can be granted.  That is the way it is under the 
current act.  It is currently ensured that the child is sponsored 
and undergoes medical, criminal and security checks.  That is the 
way the act is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will remove those requirements as long as the adoption 
occurs outside Canada.  That causes me great concern. I just 
cannot wait to get the minister's explanation as to why that has 
been put in the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation will make it easier for adopting parents to 
gain Canadian citizenship for the child, which is good, but Bill 
C-63 stipulates that in order to allow citizenship to be granted 
to the minor, the adoption must create a genuine parent-child 
relationship.  This is in response to some abuse we have seen 
across the country.  It is not general abuse but specific people 
abusing the system by claiming they are adopting while they have 
other reasons for wanting the young person to come into the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43 puts the regulation in place.  The concern is that 
section 43(f) leaves defining the terms of this relationship to 
the minister's discretion.  This legislation fails to provide 
more specific guidelines and terms with regard to exactly how 
this will be determined. The legislation is so loose that 
regulation could make some changes that appear to be positive 
have no positive impact whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another area of great concern in this bill.  Should 
this bill pass as is, authority will be given to the immigration 
minister to redefine the Canadian family if she so chooses.  I am 
referring to clause 43 which grants the minister quite far 
reaching powers including the right to “specify who may make 
application under this act on behalf of a minor”.  This is not 
defined in the legislation.  It is left to the bureaucrats and 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 43(c) refers to fixed fees.  The level of the fees could 
have a great impact on how this act works.  Clause 43(i) defines 
a spouse for the purposes of this act.  It is left to the 
minister's to define what a spouse is.  Should this legislation 
pass the minister could choose to define a spouse in any way she 
wants.  If the minister feels a change should be made, that 
change must be made by parliament.  It should be made neither by 
the minister nor by the courts.  This legislation opens it up so 
the minister can freely define what a spouse is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of concern to me that the minister is free to define what 
constitutes the relationship between a parent and child for the 
purposes of determining entitlement to citizenship under the 
provisions of this act. Allowing these issues to be determined by 
the minister behind closed doors without the oversight of 
parliament is clearly a very arrogant and insulting thing to do 
to the Canadian population.  I call for the minister to quickly 
reject this part of the act.  I hope it is something she missed 
as she was reviewing the legislation put together by her 
department. If changes are needed in these areas and the minister 
wishes to make them, those changes should be done in parliament 
and not behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party policy supports restricting sponsorship privileges 
to the immediate family members, including spouses, minor 
dependent children and aged dependent parents.  All others should 
apply for entry through the normal selective process.  That is 
what we and I think many Canadians are calling for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read both citizenship oaths.  This is the oath under the 
current act: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I swear [or affirm] that I will be faithful and bear true 
allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of 
Canada, Her Heirs and Successors, and that I will faithfully 
observe the laws of Canada and fulfill my duties as a Canadian 
citizen. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the proposed oath contained in this legislation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this day forward, I pledge my loyalty and allegiance to 
Canada and Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada.  I 
promise to respect our country's rights and freedoms, to defend 
our democratic values, to faithfully observe our laws and fulfil 
my duties and obligations as a Canadian citizen. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I objecting to the new oath?  No.  I do not think the new 
oath is probably all that bad.  What I am objecting to is the way 
this oath was arrived at.  This minister is so arrogant that she 
puts forth her oath and thinks her oath is what the Canadian 
population should accept.  That is arrogance that Canadians will 
not accept.  I believe the minister will be chastised by the 
Canadian public for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the minister has missed an opportunity here.  She has 
missed a tremendous opportunity to have a patriotic debate across 
this country such as presents itself rarely. She could have 
called for a debate across the country in this House where 
Canadians would have the input on the oath and the oath then 
would truly be the oath of Canadian citizens. It would be an oath 
supported by citizens across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no, the minister in her infinite wisdom has determined that 
she can change that oath unilaterally and to heck with what 
Canadians want. I am concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be now a debate on the process of entering this oath 
and on the oath itself, but it will not be as a result of what 
the minister has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the language requirement in clause 6(1)(c), the minister 
stated in her presentation that she has put in place language 
requirements for those who wish to become Canadian citizens.  The 
clause in question states: “The minister shall on application 
grant citizenship to a person who has an adequate knowledge of 
one of the official languages of Canada”.  Further clause 
31(7)(3) states that the new commissioners “will be responsible 
for providing advice and recommendations to the minister on 
appropriate methods to evaluate citizenship applicants about 
their knowledge of an official language of Canada and of the 
rights and responsibilities of citizenship”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least the minister will let these citizenship judges who will 
no longer be judges have their say on what they think the 
language requirement should be, but clearly the legislation 
should contain a definition of what the minister believes are 
reasonable language requirements.  The minister has once again 
ignored her responsibility to make a decision on this issue.  She 
is going to have that made behind closed doors by her 
departmental officials.  Parliament will have absolutely no say 
in what adequate language requirements are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the move sounds like it may be a good move, I have heard 
from some new Canadians that they do not support the new language 
requirements or any new language requirements. But probably a 
majority do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this change could have been so positive because nothing 
has been defined, because everything is left up to regulation, we 
have not a clue what the minister really means about that.  I 
think that is too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the second reading of this bill and we are looking at 
very general comments.  I have kept my comments quite general. 
There are several other issues I will talk about as we get to 
report stage.  Other members of the official opposition will talk 
at third reading and in committee as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope this minister will pay attention to what she 
hears at committee, to what she hears from Canadians from across 
this country.  Because the minister did not listen before she 
presented the legislation, she should now listen to what 
Canadians really want in this area of citizenship.  It is an area 
that is extremely important to Canadians, a very personal issue 
and an issue which should be dealt with by Canadians and not by 
the minister behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to future debate on this issue from all political 
parties and hopefully we can make the changes necessary to make 
something out of this bill, something that Canadians will be able 
to identify with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I seek 
the unanimous consent of the House to divide my time with the 
member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, with each of us taking 20 
minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent from the House 
for the hon. member to share his time as requested? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> First of all, I would like to say that we 
generally understand citizenship to be part and parcel of 
national sovereignty.  It is the government's prerogative to 
introduce a bill such as this. 
We will support it, bearing in mind of course that the day is 
not far off when a sovereign Quebec will introduce its own such 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, with the contagious laughter of an 
enthusiastic minister in the background, I wish to draw to the 
House's attention six questions we have about the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by congratulating the minister on one 
aspect of the bill, a courageous aspect that makes me think I 
was not mistaken in describing the minister as a dove, while 
other aspects of the bill are indicative of a few hawks in this 
cabinet.  There have even been some uncharitable remarks about 
nighthawks, but that is another story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through you, Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the minister for having 
included recognition of same-sex couples in her bill. 
This is ground-breaking, for such recognition is long in coming. 
I am pleased that the minister has shown leadership and I hope 
that she is seated right beside the Minister of Justice in 
cabinet, if that is not privy information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore congratulate the minister on this aspect of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first question has to do with the decision to introduce a 
citizenship bill first when all signs were that an immigration 
bill was coming down the pipe.  The minister wanted to take us a 
bit off guard and introduced a citizenship bill first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the government's prerogative, but I know that deep 
inside she will agree, in the light of the Trempe report, tabled 
by the task force brilliantly led by the former deputy minister 
to the current minister responsible for income security. This 
task force made 172 recommendations, some being admittedly more 
valuable than others, but I think that overall it did a good 
job. I would have liked to see the minister heed the wishes of 
the auditor general, who had asked that she review the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inefficiency of the Immigration Act and the highest 
administrative tribunal, namely the IRB, currently costs the 
provinces of Ontario and Quebec $100 million a year. This is 
something that could have been addressed if the minister had 
been willing to, but we were all left unsatisfied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also arrived at a fascinating diagnostic. 
He told the IRB that there were two hierarchies pitted against 
one another: officials and commissioners. Such confrontation 
obviously makes it very difficult to exercise any real 
administrative control. The hon. minister knows that what I am 
saying can easily be found in the documents from the auditor 
general, and I ask her in all friendship to table a bill in the 
next few weeks. She can count on the kind and gentle co-operation 
of the opposition in ensuring vigilance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to share a few good memories with the minister 
about the 1995 referendum campaign. I think this was a high 
point in her public life, she had incredible visibility and the 
full confidence of the Prime Minister. 
We will recall that the agreement signed in June by the three 
party leaders—the current Quebec premier, Mr. Bouchard, Mr. 
Parizeau and Mr. Dumont—contained a proposal, which will be 
back on the table in a foreseeable future, and I am sure the 
minister remembers it, for dual citizenship. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is reassuring. Behind every minister, there is probably a 
closet sovereignist. The minister is surely very pleased to tell 
us that, since the provisions remain the same, the status quo is 
maintained as regards dual citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once Quebeckers decide to become a sovereign people, we will 
certainly be able to agree, as two sovereign states should do, 
on the issue of dual citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very positive aspect of the bill. Again, we hope the 
minister's influence will be felt among Privy Council members, 
but that is far from certain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is that of linguistic ability. 
That issue was also raised in the Trempe report. I agree that it 
is not easy to draw the line. However, I hope the parliamentary 
committee—before which, I am sure, the minister will as usual 
be pleased to appear—will obtain guarantees that, with regard 
to the linguistic skills that will be required and evaluated by 
using standardized tests, particular attention will be given to 
the knowledge of French which, as you know, is Quebec's official 
language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Quebec government has made representations to 
the minister. We will reiterate them and I hope the minister 
will be in a position to provide the guarantees that are 
necessary, given the precarious situation of the French language 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You, Mr. Speaker, are a bilingual citizen and this is to your 
credit. Quebec's precarious situation is easily understood when 
we read the Beaudoin report. The authors of that document, which 
was released two years ago and which is named after the minister 
responsible for the charter of the French language, estimated 
that 40 rulings—imagine the context in which we find 
ourselves—were made under the provisions of the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms and invalidated entire sections of Bill 
101. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the minister is aware of this. It is important to be 
vigilant and to make sure that those who choose to settle in 
Quebec will comply with an inescapable requirement, which is to 
have a knowledge of the French language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I am counting on you, Mr. Speaker, to remind the minister 
that we must have very solid guarantees. It will of course be 
our duty to raise these issues in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the oath of citizenship. The minister is a woman 
of honour. She knows the importance of an oath in everyday life. 
An oath is a binding commitment with a strong symbolic value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is a small paradox. There is something of an 
inconsistency. First, we should question why we are maintaining 
this allegiance to the Queen of England. Some may argue that 
Canada has been a sovereign country since the Statute of 
Westminster. We know that. 
We wonder why a minister, who seems to represent the progressive 
wing of the cabinet, stubbornly and, I must say, somewhat 
awkwardly maintains an allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth 
II, who has had her share of problems, as we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to speak against the royal family—it would be 
against our rules—but let me say that there have been many more 
divorces in that family than in mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we keep in an oath of allegiance such an explicit 
reference to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, who fulfils a 
symbolic role? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1620

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not have been wiser to take advantage of the 
opportunity to eliminate this reference to Her Majesty Elizabeth 
II in “modernizing the oath” as they are calling it?  The 
minister has said in a press conference that these are two 
separate debates.  I imagine this government will have the 
opportunity to discuss the matter as things develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something I do not understand, and I am sure the 
following question will be of interest: How can it be that the 
opportunity is not being taken, in revising this element, to 
respect what this government has adopted, namely a motion 
recognizing Quebec's distinct society, its distinct character? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ought there not to be some consistency here?  If we want to 
speak of the reality of Canada, and if we believe that we must 
do so truthfully and accurately, ought the minister not to agree 
with me that it would have been the most basic of courtesies to 
refer to the existence of two nations in this country or at 
least to Quebec's distinct society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's characteristics are well known.  The minister, who has 
a strong background in social sciences, is aware of this.  I am 
not asking the minister to become a member of the Bloc Quebecois 
or the Parti Quebecois but, as a Quebec MP just like me who 
shares my passion for Montreal, when talking about Quebec, she 
should speak with a bit more finesse, a bit more accuracy, a bit 
more refinement, all qualities which she certainly does not lack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mention should have been made that Canada comprises two nations. 
Any treatise of constitutional law, which the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry has taught over many years, would have 
helped the minister understand that a nation is made up by 
people with a sense of community. This is the definition given 
in the 19th century.  A nation is made up of people that control 
a territory.  The minister cannot deny that Quebec controls a 
territory, that its population has a real sense of community, 
that it has a vernacular language, French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth element that defines a nation is, of course, its 
history.  This is important, because this is to be found in 
every constitutional law treatise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's oath is incomplete, her work is incomplete.  I 
think we should expect amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could make the same remarks with respect to native Canadians. 
Why did the minister not refer to them?  At the 1982 
constitutional conference, the minister was already very 
interested in things federal.  She knows very well that this 
conference was the native peoples' conference.  It even appears 
in the Constitution Act, 1982.  There are very specific rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak of Canada, we really must do so in the knowledge 
that it will soon be facing major change, based on two states 
that will form an association respecting their mutual 
sovereignty.  In the meantime, it would have been simple 
courtesy for the minister to mention Canada's binational reality 
and the existence of the first nations, in her reference to 
Canada.  This must not be forgotten, when an oath is taken on 
this reality.  This did not happen, and should be rectified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise another point that will require the minister to 
provide explanations to the committee.  This is the notion of 
redefining the role of the citizenship judges in depth.  They 
will be called citizenship commissioners.  However, the 
description of the responsibilities of these commissioners 
remains rather vague.  It would not take much for this appear as 
a desire for rather lyrical propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill mentions promoting civic values.  That is certainly 
interesting, because there is no social unity without civic 
values. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1625

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But would this not be a slippery road to propaganda? I do hope 
the minister will make it extremely clear what role these 
commissioners will be expected to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strongest criticism I have to make to her—and I urge her 
to listen, as her undivided attention is required on this very 
serious concern of ours—has to do with the process for 
appointing the commissioners. Why not go through the Public 
Service Employment Act and have a competition? How will they be 
appointed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the press conference, I was left with the impression that we 
are dealing with partisan appointments, something I have always 
stayed away from, as the whole sovereignist movement has done. 
So, does the minister not feel that the appointment process 
could be used to benefit friends of the government? I am 
concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were sure that those selected were all as qualified as the 
hon. member for Laval-Ouest, I would not be concerned, because I 
know that immigration is an area she knows very well, having 
herself been involved in those circles. But we have been given 
no such assurances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the minister will have to be extremely careful and 
that these appointments should be free from partisanship. I want 
to really stress this point. I do not want to turn into a 
Reformer, but still the minister should beware and she will have 
account for her actions to the parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important point is the whole issue of international 
adoption.  I myself had occasion, in a slightly more informal 
context, to make representations to the minister.  She knows how 
important this issue is for the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I wonder whether I would have unanimous consent to 
table a letter addressed to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, in which Quebec's minister Jean Rochon, an 
honourable man if ever there was one, and André Boisclair, 
express certain concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot resist sharing this letter with its rather— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B>  The reply as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> The reply as well, if a page brings it, because 
I do not have it with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B>  Table them both at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> I will read the letter, then: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a meeting with the minister of relations with citizens 
and immigration, on October 26, you confirmed— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reference here is to the minister. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—your intention to table, in mid-December— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone will recall that that was around the last day of the 
session. 
I wish to mention in passing that the opposition parties were 
put in a rather difficult situation from a parliamentary point 
of view, because I learned on the train one Friday that I had to 
be back Monday to reply to the Minister. It would have been 
nicer to have a few extra days to prepare, but I know that the 
minister has her plate full and that this will not happen again 
in future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a meeting with the minister of relations with citizens 
and immigration, on October 26, you confirmed your intention to 
table, in mid-December, a bill to amend the Citizenship Act. 
This bill proposes, among other things, to grant citizenship 
without delay, in cases of recognized international adoption, to 
the child adopted by a Canadian citizen, before that child 
arrives in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill raises various issues in Quebec. One of them has to do 
with how we can reconcile the legislation and our civil code. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stop here, but let me tell the House this: under Quebec 
law—and the minister, who at one time sat in the National 
Assembly, knows Quebec law—the adoption process must be 
confirmed and finalized by an order from a Quebec court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an incompatibility and this is why the Quebec 
government made representations regarding the fact that the 
status of adopted child would be granted when the child is still 
abroad, before the process is finalized in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, I fully realize that parents who go through 
the international adoption process expect things to be done 
diligently. We hope it will be the case. However, I am asking 
the minister to respect the provisions of the Quebec civil code, 
and in particular the prerogatives of the National Assembly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we will support this bill, since citizenship is 
an attribute of national sovereignty. In the not too distant 
future, when we have achieved sovereignty, we Quebeckers will 
have an opportunity to introduce a similar bill. I know that we 
can count on the minister to promote good relations and to 
ensure successful negotiations on dual citizenship.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> I am always very 
pleased to see the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve display 
his sense of humour and irony to the House, involving our 
colleagues on the other side of the floor and reminding us that 
they sometimes do listen to the opposition and its proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be pleased to associate with my colleague from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, as I have in other circumstances, 
moreover, in offering some views, some enlightenment arising out 
of my training as a professor of international and 
constitutional law, as someone who has spent a number of years 
in a university teaching about legislation such as this 
Citizenship Act. Someone who wants to take a constructive look 
at improving this legislation, clarifying some of its 
provisions, making that contribution for the most part within a 
parliamentary committee, which will examine it clause by clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be worthwhile raising a few questions here in the 
House, in order to provide the minister and her staff with the 
opportunity to reflect upon some of the clauses which strike me 
as needing more reflection and perhaps upon the changes which we 
can examine together within the parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to be that the general nature of the act has not been 
changed, overall.  Of course it has retained the two major 
concepts for assigning nationality, the concepts of the law of 
the blood and the law of the soil, jus sanguinis and jus soli, 
adding to them naturalization and attribution of citizenship 
under a certain number of other criteria, such as the 
exceptional criteria by which the minister may, on occasion, on 
recommendation of the governor in council, award citizenship. 
These items are in many ways a repeat of the old act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt one thing the minister should look at, and 
that is the notion in part I of the right to citizenship.  It 
seems to me that clauses 3 to 12 of the bill do not really 
concern the right to citizenship, a right that could have been 
acknowledged and guaranteed in the Canadian charter of rights 
and which was not.  We could have, had we wanted, for example, 
incorporated in Canadian law the prescriptions of international 
instruments such as the Universal Declaration on Human Rights or 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit the following thought to the minister for her 
consideration: does part I not indeed concern the granting of 
citizenship and should we not use that expression rather than 
the right to citizenship.  Although the quality of citizen is 
involved, clauses 3 and following are not drafted in a way as to 
concern a right really, but the government's ability to grant 
citizenship, especially when it is granted through the process 
of naturalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compared with the part following, which concerns the loss of 
citizenship, part I should be entitled: “Granting citizenship”, 
with the corollary of the various reasons and grounds for 
granting citizenship provided in the various provisions in this 
part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to the minister that in this part there is 
some doubt about the relevance of clause 11(e), which could pose 
a problem in the case of dual citizenship, as the government 
does not seem to want to grant or agree to grant Canadian 
citizenship when an individual is a citizen of another country 
or is entitled to citizenship in another country.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a restriction to dual citizenship in paragraph 
11(e). I therefore submit to the minister that this may be an 
exception to the rule, which calls for further investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a need to ensure—this has not been done and, in 
any case, it deserves careful consideration—that the 
legislation will not allow the two conventions signed by Canada, 
that is the Convention on the nationality of married women and 
the Convention on the reduction of statelessness, to be 
violated. By signing the latter, Canada and the other 
signatories agreed to pass legislation that does not cause 
statelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to finding out at committee whether the act has 
been examined in terms of compliance with this international 
convention of which Canada is a signatory. This is one of the 
issues I think a parliamentary committee should look into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing in this act that struck me; it is in part 
4 on prohibitions. The concept of public interest may be too 
vague. In the context of paragraph 21(1), this concept is the 
basis for making an order prohibiting the granting of 
citizenship. This may be too vague a concept and the vagueness 
of the criteria set out in paragraph 21(1) of this citizenship 
bill could cause problems in terms of constitutional validity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also submit to the minister that it might be a good idea to 
consider adding, at section 23, which deals with national 
security, a provision to ensure that, in paragraph 2, reference 
is made not only to crimes provided for in federal legislation, 
but also international crimes now codified in several 
international conventions as well as in the statute of Rome 
establishing the international criminal tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be appropriate to add a reference to the criminal acts 
under international law referred to in section 11(g) of the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  This might be one way of 
ensuring that international criminal acts, being increasingly 
codified, could be used to justify refusal of citizenship, since 
it would represent a threat to national security to award it to 
people who have committed criminal acts not only under federal 
law but under international law as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always found this act to contain a curious concept—and I 
found it so in my university teaching days as well—that of 
Commonwealth citizenship. 
In this act, as in the one it is intended to replace, there is 
the concept of Commonwealth citizenship, that any Canadian 
citizen or any citizen of another Commonwealth country holds the 
status of citizen of the Commonwealth in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is therefore a nationality or citizenship which is 
superimposed on nationalities attributed by other countries, but 
it is one about which we know nothing.  What point is there to 
Commonwealth citizenship?  Does it confer any real rights, or is 
a highly symbolic assignment to citizens of other Commonwealth 
countries of a status in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to be properly enlightened on the real significance 
of this concept of Commonwealth citizenship and its corollaries 
in Canadian law. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there is one point here which ought to be of concern to 
the minister, which is that other concepts of citizenship or 
nationality appear to be being created here in Canada itself. 
It might be worthwhile checking whether the Nisga'a treaty, just 
signed between the authorities of British Columbia and the 
Nisga'a band, contains a concept of citizenship which is 
compatible with Canadian citizenship, or is complementary to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there would have to be an examination of, not only the 
concept of Commonwealth citizenship, but also other domestic 
citizenships which seem to have been created, or will be created 
in future, by treaties with aboriginal nations. 
So I suggest the minister examine this new idea of a domestic 
citizen and look at how it would work with the notion of 
Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, on a more technical level, on the content of the bill, 
I sometimes have a hard time understanding why, in a bill on 
citizenship, there are provisions that have nothing to do with 
citizenship.  All of part VI concerns what non-Canadians cannot 
or can do. There are provisions on their right to acquire 
property, for example, in this bill, and a number of provisions 
on the power of the lieutenant governor in council, by 
regulation, to alter bans on property ownership by non-Canadians. 
This whole part should not be included in a bill on 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general organization of this bill, therefore, does not lend 
itself to the idea of including provisions that do not concern 
Canadian citizens and the rights they enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in my opinion, we could readily contemplate the 
inclusion of clauses 49 and 54 in legislation other than on 
citizenship, because it seems to me they have no place in this 
legislation, except a place history has reserved for them, but 
that history does not justify now as it used to, especially 
since the existence of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms and other instruments enshrining property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, these in my opinion are the things that warrant debate and 
verification in certain cases. 
I was also interested in the matter of citizenship from the 
standpoint, as my colleague mentioned, of what would happen in 
the case of a sovereign Quebec, in the matter of dual 
citizenship, the opportunity for dual citizenship. I am one of 
those who consider the minister very wise to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Visionary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> —visionary, even—my colleague, the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve has such a way with words—in that I think 
that, internationally, the trend now is no longer just to 
tolerate, but to accept and even encourage multiple 
nationalities and not just dual citizenship. The trend is to 
even add the category of supranationals as Europe has done, with 
the Maastricht treaty that was recently passed to recognize 
citizenship in the European Union, which is entirely consistent 
with French or British nationality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something sovereignists will continue to ponder.  Would 
it be a good idea for a sovereign Quebec to share supranational 
citizenship with a sovereign Canada, in other words citizenship 
in one Canadian union for two sovereign states?  These are 
debates we will also be having. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present legislative setting, amendments are certainly 
important. My colleague, the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, 
and I will be making constructive suggestions during the 
committee debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by recalling the fundamental 
distinction established by the French when they passed the 
Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The French understood “man” in the generic sense, including 
“woman” of course, as a universal being with a certain number of 
fundamental rights to which he was entitled as a member of a 
universe where borders were of no importance.  But citizens are 
no longer universal beings.  Citizens inhabit territories and, 
when it comes to the status of Canadian citizens within such 
territories, they must be provided with citizenship legislation 
that provides them with the best guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this perspective that the Bloc Quebecois intends to 
make a positive contribution to the study of this bill.  I hope 
that I will be able to make a contribution that will be helpful 
to the minister and her officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am happy to represent our caucus in the debate at second reading 
of Bill C-63.  I will be splitting my time with the member from 
Kamloops.  I am relatively new to the critic area of citizenship 
and immigration, but I am getting well versed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is certainly not new to me given the area of Winnipeg 
in which I live.  Citizenship is probably one of the key issues 
and concerns that we have in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that the minister has chosen to remain in 
the House to listen to the input of the opposition.  I have not 
seen that in the past from any minister during second reading. 
Ministers usually read their piece and then carry on out the 
door.  It is a very nice gesture and I am glad the minister is 
interested in what we have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Winnipeg Centre citizenship is a critical issue. 
We recently took a survey to get an idea of how many new 
Canadians are living within our borders.  I knew there were high 
numbers of certain groups, but I was very surprised that there 
were 7,800 people of Filipino background just within Winnipeg 
Centre, and certainly my riding does not represent the majority 
of Filipinos in Manitoba or Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only group that came close in numbers in terms of minority 
groups was the aboriginal population, with 6,500.  There are over 
2,000 Portuguese, over 1,800 Vietnamese, over 2,000 Chinese, 
Laotian, Cambodian, Eritrean, Chilean and Guatemalan people. I 
was overwhelmed by all the various subgroups.  It was a real eye 
opener to see the number of new Canadians that have settled in 
the riding of Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that we would like to see many more.  We 
would hope that any amendments to the Citizenship Act or 
Immigration Act would send a very welcoming message to the world 
that we recognize immigration as an engine of economic growth. 
In our riding it is critical in revitalizing an inner city that 
has more than its share of problems as a core area of a major 
Canadian city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a case in point, during the election campaign, going door to 
door in the worst part of my riding, it was revealing to see the 
housing stock.  We would go past shack after shack with boarded 
windows or a house used by gangs, and then there would be a 
lovely little cottage, just recently renovated, with a painted 
fence, a new roof, curtains in the window and flowers planted 
along the sidewalk. 
Without even knocking on the door I knew that was the home of a 
new Canadian.  I knew that would be a Filipino family or a 
Vietnamese family so proud of their home.  The selling price of 
these houses is $15,000 to $17,000.  A person can buy a good home 
in the inner city of Winnipeg for under $20,000.  By anybody 
else's standards this would not be the kind of property that we 
would go to a great length to beautify, but the new Canadians who 
come to Winnipeg do just that.  It is a real pleasure to see. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a pleasure that the area is being repopulated.  There 
has been a mass exodus out of the inner city.  As people manage 
to get some means together they seem to move out to the suburbs, 
leaving this donut-shaped city and vacant houses.  There have 
been 65 arsons since October in a 12 block area.  It is almost 
like the Watts riots in the southern states at the height of the 
civil rights movement.  It is burn baby burn.  They are trying to 
level the inner city in many ways just out of sheer frustration 
at all things that poverty brings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, new Canadians are turning that around by buying these 
houses.  They are also keeping the schools viable because there 
are more children in the neighbourhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I am disappointed because I do not believe 
that this piece of legislation is going to move us any closer to 
the goal of welcoming new Canadians to the country or sending 
the message internationally that the door is open to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without getting too technical I would like to go through some of 
the points that we have reservations about and what leads us to 
say that at this point, without amendment, our caucus will not be 
voting for Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to speak about the physical presence 
requirement in clauses 6(1)(b) and 2(2)(c).  While I understand 
the concern over what many people feel was a loophole in the law, 
I feel that the proposed requirement for a full three years of 
physical presence in Canada is extreme.  I also object to the 
loss of the current provision whereby one-half of the time spent 
in Canada prior to becoming a landed immigrant would be counted 
toward residency for citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue that we find the most fault with would be the language 
requirement, that the test has to be done in one of the two 
official languages.  The minister in her introduction said that 
Bill C-63 was the result of extensive consultation around the 
country.  I agree.  I went to the consultations in Winnipeg. 
However, overwhelming I believe what the minister heard during 
those consultations was that Canadians did not want this 
rigidity.  The language issue was a real sore point, a real hot 
button for a lot of the groups who made representations.  Even 
the Filipino Association of Manitoba, the largest ethnic group in 
my riding, made a very spirited representation to that committee. 
It was very capably argued by the son of the chair of the 
committee on citizenship and immigration, who is a very bright 
and well respected lawyer in the city of Winnipeg.  He spoke 
passionately against this particular clause.  I am sure it was 
not the only group.  I heard many groups making that 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote the organization that deals with English as a 
second language in downtown Toronto, COSTI.  Mr. Mario Calla felt 
very strongly about it.  He said “A lot of people will forfeit 
the opportunity to gain Canadian citizenship as a result of this 
change and that is very unfortunate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is great nervousness and unrest in the advocacy groups and 
in the social agencies that deal with English as a second 
language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we break it down to its barest core, how can we judge the 
value or the merits of an individual by virtue of what language 
they speak?  Why must they be proficient enough to take a test in 
one of those two languages? 
I do not see how that has anything to do with whether they will 
be useful to us as productive Canadian citizens.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people who live here for three to five years, as Mr. Calla 
pointed out, are too busy to get good enough in one of the 
official languages to take a written test.  When a person comes 
here and works at a minimum wage job, or maybe two or three 
minimum wage jobs, and maybe juggling child care, they might 
learn enough English or French to get by, like many people do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want more barriers.  This really does send the message 
that Canada is not welcoming people with open arms because we are 
going to put all these roadblocks in the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other obvious roadblocks.  The hated head tax, of 
course, we are not going to talk about under the citizenship 
rules.  I hope we get a chance to debate the head tax again under 
immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things like landing fees really set the tone to people in other 
countries who might be looking to Canada.  They feel that it is 
not an open door; it is a door that has a series of hurdles in 
front of it meant to trip people up and keep them out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first wish would be for 5,000 new Canadians in downtown 
Winnipeg tomorrow.  However, I do not see anything in these rules 
that will help us achieve that goal or even help with the message 
that Canada welcomes new Canadians to help rebuild this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate having an opportunity today 
to make a few comments on Bill C-63, an act respecting Canadian 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those of us who have been fortunate enough to be elected to 
represent our constituents here in parliament, one of the most 
pleasurable expectations of our time is to participate in 
citizenship ceremonies in our constituencies.  I am sure I speak 
for everyone here in saying that it is one of the highlights to 
see the joy in the faces and to see the tears in the eyes of 
people becoming Canadian citizens by choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us became Canadian citizens because we happened to be 
born here, but these people are different.  As I say, it is a 
highlight in my life.  When I am not able to be there 
my staff enjoy it equally.  Everyone wants to take our picture, 
we are invited to teas and there are all sorts of dinner 
invitations.  It is a great moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciated the minister saying that it is a moving ceremony. 
One cannot help but be made proud again to be a citizen of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things during the ceremony that I always feel a bit 
uneasy about is when I have to affirm my citizenship.  We stand 
to talk about the Queen, her heirs and so on.  I cannot help but 
think that this does not fit that well in modern day Canada.  I 
do not want to get into a debate on the Queen and the monarchy 
and who we should be swearing allegiance to, but I do find it 
somewhat uncomfortable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk to new citizens they are curious about this Queen, 
where she lives and who she is.  When I tell them she does not 
even live here, that she lives in another country, they think it 
is odd, but when one becomes a citizen of a new country a lot of 
things are strange.  But having a Queen who does not even live 
here seems to be peculiar in modern day society.  Our friends in 
Australia are looking at this.  I look forward to the debate that 
we will have in our country one day, hopefully sooner rather than 
later, on the question of the validity of having a foreign queen 
as our own queen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Winnipeg noted that section 6(1)(c) of the 
legislation requires that an applicant for citizenship must have 
an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada. 
At first blush this seems like a reasonable requirement.  If a 
person wants to become a citizen, to have knowledge of English or 
French is not an unusual expectation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think back to my own parents. 
They came from Norway and like most new Canadians sought out 
people of similar backgrounds and culture for the first year or 
two to become used to the new country.  Obviously they spoke 
Norwegian.  I do not think my father or mother spoke a single 
word in English.  They arrived in this new country and some years 
later became proficient in English. My Dad in his late nineties 
still speaks with a real heavy Norwegian accent, so I suspect it 
was probably some time before he became proficient in English.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislation gets to committee I want to encourage the 
minister to be open to this section to ensure that when we say 
that it has adequate knowledge that adequate does not mean we are 
going to prohibit people from becoming citizens who are having 
difficulty with the language and have lived presumably in their 
cultural community for the first two or three years and are 
simply in a very early learning stage.  We will examine this in 
committee and I ask the minister to be sensitive to this section 
and open to some very clear clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I would ask her at this early stage that when she 
appears before the committee to define what we mean by adequate 
knowledge in a very explicit way.  I know she will be concerned 
that we do it in such a way that this will not prohibit the kind 
of citizens we would welcome into Canada simply because they are 
a little weak in learning languages.  I know the feeling when it 
comes to being a little weak in learning foreign languages.  I am 
one of those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section that requires residency in Canada for three of five 
years is again something else we want to look at because as 
Canada is one of the world's great trading nations which attracts 
people from other countries to take up residency and become 
contributing citizens, it is really one of the key aspects we 
have as a country in terms of facilitating new overseas trade 
arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person comes from Vietnam and takes up citizenship in 
Canada it is only natural for them to think if they are going to 
be doing foreign trade either importing material or exporting 
Canadian goods to Vietnam that heir friends there would be an 
obvious contact.  So as we develop more trade and more overseas 
connection in terms of the whole globalization forces that are in 
place we should be sensitive to whether this three year permanent 
residency make sense recognizing modern commerce, trade and 
communications.  I am not saying it does not but I simply want to 
say that we have some concerns about this and it should be 
considered carefully in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn to section 28 which identifies a number of prohibitions: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite anything in this act, other than section 8, no person 
shall be granted citizenship or take the oath of citizenship, if 
the person 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) is, under any enactment in force in Canada, subject to a 
probation order, on parole, or confined in any penitentiary, 
jail, reformatory or prison; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) is charge with, on trial for, subject to or a party to an 
appeal of a review relating to an offence under this act or an 
indictable offence under any other act of parliament. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns I hear regularly, and I am not certain how 
accurate it is, is people often have a perception that a lot of 
people who have come to Canada and are not yet citizens and get 
in trouble with the law remain here.  Consequently we pick up the 
costs and we welcome a criminal element into our country.  I know 
that is not the intent of any legislation and not the intent of 
any government policy.  It would seem that when we consider 
section 28 this might be an opportunity to consider that section 
and ensure that Canadians know clearly that if a person wishes to 
become a citizen of Canada and he or she gets into serious 
trouble with the law, that person is not welcome any longer in 
Canada.  We do not want a person who participates in illegal acts 
to become a Canadian citizen. Again I ask the minister if she 
would clarify that section when we get to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud most of the initiatives the minister referred to in 
her opening comments in terms of the need to promote citizenship, 
the need to promote an understanding of what being a citizen of 
Canada entails, the responsibilities that go with that 
citizenship.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that at a time when we have all these forces tugging at 
us as a result of globalization and we as Canadians are part of 
such a multicultural, multiethnic and multiracial country we have 
to emphasize what it means to be Canadian.  It is not clear and I 
suspect we are one of the few countries in the world where people 
actually ask what it means to be a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine someone in Greece asking what it means to be a 
Greek or somebody from Italy asking what it means to be Italian. 
They know these things but it is not as clear here because of the 
kind of country we are.  We are an amalgamation of folks from 
every country of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister to give some thought to the consul we have in 
Chandigarh, Punjab.  It was set up as a consul office.  We 
understood the office would facilitate issuing visas and so forth 
but in my judgment there have been some problems with that 
consulate office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In talking with people they seem frustrated because a goodly 
portion who come to Canada from the subcontinent of India are 
from the Punjab state.  We should have that office operating in a 
more efficient and perhaps more elaborate fashion than it is at 
present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister to give that some thought, to expand the 
ability to facilitate those visas and other immigration and 
consular work from that office in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the member's presentation with interest but I have 
some questions as a result of his presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He expressed a concern that he cannot really tell what the 
minister means in the legislation about the language requirement. 
He is concerned that the requirement might be a little too 
difficult and may set up a requirement that is unreasonable for 
some people who are new immigrants wishing to become citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from people of new immigrant communities who have 
made that point to me.  They are concerned from that point of 
view.  I have also heard from others who say they think it is 
only a reasonable commitment on the part of somebody who wants to 
become a Canadian citizen to speak with a fair degree of 
capability in one of the official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it not concern the member that when he reads the 
legislation he really cannot tell what the minister has in mind? 
The legislation is so vague that it is impossible to tell what 
the minister has in mind.  If I were a new immigrant concerned 
that the requirements might be set at too high a level I would be 
concerned that it is not in legislation.  The member said he 
would ask the minister at committee and find out what she has in 
mind.  That is not good enough for me.  That is not good enough 
for new Canadians who want to know what the requirement will be. 
It should be in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that problem with almost every proposal made in the 
legislation.  There is not enough information to determine what 
the minister has in mind. Is the member not concerned about that 
issue?  Is it good enough for him just to hear the minister's 
answer and then assume that is what will happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue concerns the need to promote citizenship.  He 
is supporting that concept, that there is a need for government 
to promote citizenship.  The heritage department already does 
what it claims is promoting good citizenship with several 
different programs.  I wonder why that is going on. The member 
had expressed his support for that concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he believe that local community groups somehow are not 
capable of promoting good citizenship, that service and cultural 
groups in the community somehow are not capable of promoting good 
citizenship?  Does he feel there actually has to be a government 
bureaucracy whose job it is to promote citizenship? Does he have 
that little faith in the local community to do that?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am puzzled by what I 
sense as an attitude on behalf of my friend.  When I say I 
welcome the opportunity for these officers to go into the 
community and promote citizenship, I do not imply that is the 
only thing that takes place when they promote citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the citizenship judges who operate in my constituency. 
They are excellent individuals who are recognized in their 
communities as outstanding Canadians.  They make it a habit of 
promoting citizenship.  They go into schools, college classes, 
immigrant centres and so on to talk about the responsibility of 
Canadian citizenship.  My friend might think this is a bad idea 
but I do not.  That is not saying that other people are not doing 
it in all sorts of other ways.  Of course they all do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to say that many immigrant societies in my 
constituency promote Canadian citizenship.  They promote the 
concept and educate new citizens about what Canadian citizenship 
means. What it means to be a citizen in some countries is quite 
different from what it means to be a citizen in Canada.  Examples 
are the attitude toward police forces and authority in general 
and the attitude toward members of parliament.  The fact that you 
can actually walk into an MP's office is rather unique in the 
world, unheard of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid the time 
has run out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, could I seek unanimous 
consent for another 90 seconds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have the unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, thank you. This is after 
all legislation and from this legislation will flow regulations. 
Regulations will be the place to be specific in terms of what is 
meant by a term as vague as adequate knowledge.  My friend is 
absolutely right when he asks what this means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister will explain what it means and that we will 
see in regulations specifically what that means. Does it mean a 
test, as my friend from Winnipeg indicated?  Is it a competency 
level?  Is it an ability to communicate in some simple way 
through a written letter or through oral communication?  What 
does it mean?  My friend is right that we have to be specific 
about this.  It has instilled virtual fear in the hearts of many 
in the immigrant community because they see it as a potential 
barrier.   I do not believe it is an intentional barrier.  As 
long as the definition is adequate his concern and the other 
concerns can be adequately met. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to be here this evening and to speak on the proposed 
changes to the Immigration Act.  Before I venture too far into 
the matter I would like to revisit a bit of the history of 
Canadian immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 1, 1947 the first Canadian citizenship act took 
effect.  It was from this point on in our history that we were 
considered Canadian citizens.  This led to an unprecedented 
population increase of over 40,000 as people from around the 
world wanted to become Canadian. The concept of citizenship 
evolved as Canada advanced over the years.  In 1977 parliament 
initiated a new citizenship act. Today, some 22 years later, we 
have proposals before us to change the act once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the hon. member from the NDP say how sorry he was that 
we were referring to the monarchy.  I am so pleased and proud 
that the monarchy is still part of our citizenship oath.  I 
represent Canada's first city to be incorporated by royal 
charter.  We and our people played a major role in building all 
of this country.  We date back to 1783.  There are those who say 
they want to eliminate our ties to the monarchy.  I cannot 
believe that the people who say that sit in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall when the rumour was flying around here. 
I asked the Prime Minister in the House if we were going to break 
our ties with the monarchy.  After he talked to the minister of 
heritage he stood and said “I am not going to break the ties 
with the monarchy.  If the hon. member for Saint John would like 
to represent us in London, England we will fly her out 
tomorrow”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, I did not take that job but let me say that I have had an 
opportunity to be with Her Majesty.  I have had the opportunity 
to be with Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and also with Princess 
Diana before her life was taken away.  I want to say to everyone 
here and back home that if they want to divide this country like 
never before, that would happen if the monarchy was removed from 
the oath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to everyone how important this truly is.  I was very 
pleased when I saw the new oath and when the hon. minister read 
it because the oath still refers to the monarchy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows that my office has worked very closely with 
her office on a number of immigration cases.  We put in over 250 
hours in regard to one case.  There was a problem concerning a 
family with one child who had been born in the United States and 
another child who had been born in Canada.  My staff and her 
staff worked together. There were rules and regulations that had 
to be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After many months we were able to bring that family back to 
Canada.  They arrived just a few days before Christmas.  The 
whole community came together.  The little children got off the 
plane.  People had come from all over to give them gifts. Both 
the wife and husband work.  They have contributed to society. 
They donate their time to those who are living in poverty. The 
husband is a baker. He goes to Romero House which is a little 
drop-in centre. People who have no money go there to get their 
meals.  He bakes for them at night.  He makes sure that they get 
the best of food.  This has been a very beautiful success story 
but it took a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when the auditor general came to the public accounts 
committee.  He talked about the immigration program and the 
process.  He also talked about the fact that some 20,000 people 
are still here in Canada illegally because our process is so slow 
in the manner in which it is presently laid out. He recommended 
major changes to streamline it. I understand the minister has 
stated that with the new changes they are hoping to have all 
those cases completed within the year.  I must say that is a very 
strong statement because of the numbers that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the system, as the auditor general stated, it 
must be changed with the commissioners.  I have heard here 
tonight about taking patronage out of it.  All I can say is that 
whoever is there, let them be competent, let them know the 
process, let them apply the process.  Let them do whatever they 
have to do but do it in a manner in which politics does not play 
a role in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this is difficult.  We hear about the little families in 
church basements.  Usually when they go into a church basement it 
is because if they go back to the country from which they left, 
their lives are at stake. Usually they would not be in the church 
basement if the minister or priest did not believe in helping the 
little families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen it, I have worked with it and I know what it is all 
about. I hope we are able to work out a far better system than it 
has been in the past.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about the two official languages, whether they should 
be able to speak English and French.  I come from Canada's only 
official bilingual province, New Brunswick.  Our door is open for 
immigrants. In fact, a motion was passed recently by the mayor 
and council in Saint John, New Brunswick asking for more 
immigrants, to work to bring more into Saint John, New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are not absolutely fluent, there are all kinds of 
opportunities with our Samuel D. Champlain Centre.  If they are 
not fluent in French, we will teach them.  It will not cost them 
anything.  If they are not absolutely fluent in English, we can 
do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our doors are open in Saint John, New Brunswick and our people 
want more.  They do not all have to be in Vancouver or Toronto. 
They can be in the maritime provinces as well.  I hope in the 
future people will look at that in Ottawa. They have a role to 
play. They have a lot to share with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It talks about having to be a skilled worker. I mentioned the 
man who is a baker.  Bakers are considered to be in short supply 
in Canada.  However a refugee who can bake but who has no formal 
degree may fall short of receiving adequate points at the 
interview. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find a way to keep an open-minded approach to judging 
those who apply.  At the same time I agree that people must have 
the skills that show they can perform the task they say they are 
able to perform.  The test should be flexible, changing in its 
application but not in its content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other proposals contained in the most recent report are things 
that will have to be debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is reference to same sex families.  There are those who 
will believe that that constitutes a family. I am one who 
believes in the traditional family.  I am one who will always 
speak for the traditional family.  I think the traditional family 
has been forgotten and it is time for many of us to speak out for 
them.  I really do. I have some concerns about that section which 
is being recommended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other proposals contained in the most recent report are things 
that need to be debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of maintaining Canadian safety, I agree that we 
need to go as far as possible.  The safety that Canadians now 
enjoy should never be compromised for any reason. We have one of 
the highest standards of living in the world.  Although 
everything is not perfect, we are fortunate to live in this 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the more serious concerns I have with the proposals lie 
in the fact that there are no concrete measures proposed.  There 
are no details for us to study and comment on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What some of these proposals mean to one person may not mean the 
same to some of my colleagues.  This puts a great deal of work in 
front of the committee members as they will ultimately be the 
people who decide what is brought forth for concrete measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party has long valued the contributions of newcomers to 
Canada.  For the most part the immigrants we have received into 
Canada have been very resourceful, vibrant people.  Our party 
believes that we must have a balanced approach to immigration, 
one that would not punish legitimate applicants but one which 
would prevent abuse of our social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had a system that would see the end of patronage 
appointments, and I do not care who is in government, just make 
sure that we have responsible people there, then we would have a 
much better system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another suggestion would be to streamline the procedure to help 
expedite the process for legitimate applicants.  As I have 
stated, it takes a long time.  This could also serve to quickly 
turn around those applications that will not be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, this process will be long.  It will need to be 
thoroughly developed to best serve the needs of those wishing to 
come to Canada.  I hope all opinions will be listened to and 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. minister and her department for the 
help and co-operation she has given to me and my office on 
refugee cases in the past year.  I want that on the record.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
listening to the speech by the hon. member brought to mind the 
fact that I am an immigrant and had to go through the immigration 
process in 1979 to get into Canada.  It took about two years.  We 
first applied and we were automatically turned down.  We asked 
why we were turned down.  We applied a second time.  It took 
three applications to come here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife and I had money to buy a home.  We had jobs guaranteed. 
We felt we had earned the right to come here.  We had earned it. 
We truly felt like Canadians and that is the way we have behaved 
since, as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally see nothing wrong with having a high standard. That 
is the same message I get in my riding from all of the immigrants 
who have come in through the legitimate process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for the member. She does not object to 
requiring reasonably high standards.  The second point has to do 
with criminal refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem in the major centres has nothing to do with 
immigration as such.  But it is the problem which the minister is 
not addressing which is the one of criminal refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a TV interview last week with BCTV, a reporter basically 
demolished the minister over the issue of not deporting criminal 
refugees and allowing them to enter our borders holus-bolus.  She 
has done absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last three to four months in Vancouver there have been 
multiple arrests of up to 80 criminal Honduran drug dealers who 
are all illegal entries. Up to half of the arrests every night in 
Vancouver are criminal non-residents, aliens who have crossed the 
border as criminal refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the member thought about that problem in the big cities? 
Like most of the people of Vancouver, does she agree that there 
should be a better way of getting rid of those bad people quickly 
instead of having them hang around for 10 or 12 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, what one has to ask is 
were they like that before they came in or did they become 
criminals after they came to Canada, to Vancouver? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the drug situation the member knows it is not 
just the immigrants.  That drug situation is across the nation. 
When it comes to a criminal coming to Canada and becoming a 
Canadian citizen, then there is something wrong with the system. 
There are not enough strict rules to protect and to have the 
checks and balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little man who had come from Guatemala to Saint John was shot 
in the stomach.  He was lying in the street dying.  A fireman 
found him, picked him up, took him to his home and saved his 
life. That little man lives in Saint John right now.  He 
contributes to our society.  He was not a criminal.  He spoke out 
against a communist way of life.  That is the only thing he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to drugs we have to take stronger stands.  We have 
to do more to clean up the drug situation across the nation.  If 
there are immigrants who are into that and have come in with a 
criminal record then they should be deported.  We have to 
strengthen the system.  We have to have a stronger system.  There 
is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Madam Speaker, to make sure that my 
question is clear, I hope the hon. member has seen the news 
reports in the Vancouver area where up to 80 Honduran drug 
traffickers are being arrested at one time.  Eighty of them. 
They are taken to the court in Vancouver, charged and then they 
are immediately released.  They all live on welfare.  They all 
have free medical care.  They acknowledge that they are illegal 
refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about the genuine refugees who come from 
genuine refugee screening camps around the world.  People as 
young as 12 years old are using the system to come here to abuse 
our laws and deal in drugs.  They know they can be here for 10 to 
12 years before they are deported and it is all because of the 
minister over there who will do nothing about the problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to get clarification regarding a comment the member 
made.  She said she and her party certainly would not support 
redefining a spouse as a same sex spouse.  The member was 
referring to the leeway the minister has for her to change that 
definition on her own if this legislation passes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On CBC radio this morning a report was that all parties except 
Reform supported the changing of the definition.  That comment 
was with regard to the bill of last night of the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am so pleased the 
member brought that up so we can clarify it.  No, it was not the 
party.  The hon. member from my party who attended and spoke was 
speaking on behalf of herself and her feelings and not on behalf 
of the PC party.  I am speaking on my behalf. I am not for same 
sex benefits.  I am not for redefining the family.  I am for the 
traditional family and everybody knows that across Canada.

am certainly pleased to speak today with regard to Motion No. 
239. I infrequently speak in this place primarily because most of 
the time when I do want to speak it is not always possible and 
also because I speak only when I have something to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my hon. colleague has the best interests of our country 
in mind when he indicates that financial speculators apparently 
do have some play in some of the problems that occur in a lot of 
countries where there is not a lot of good control over finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask this question with regard to the financial transaction 
tax, the Tobin tax.  Economists will tell us anything we want to 
hear or there are ways to build models to indicate what is good 
and what is bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, the best way of avoiding a financial 
disaster is to have good management, good fiscal policy, good 
regimes and legislation to make sure that financial institutions 
and people who deal in financial transactions are managed 
properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing which apparently is a myth is that foreigners 
are responsible for creating speculation in countries. There are 
a lot of greedy people in the world. Machiavelli said the strong 
will do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. 
There are people like that in this world.  It does not matter 
what kind of situation they are in.  If we were to give everybody 
in our country, all 30 million people, $1 million each some would 
have goodwill.  They would want to help their neighbours and do 
not really care about money. After 10 or 15 years a lot of them 
would end up with zero cash and some would end up very rich, 
saying “We are all right, thank you very much.  We do not care 
about all of these other people.  Let them suffer because they 
did not do X and they did not do Y”.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That kind of world is not a good world to live in.  It is a 
world where the law of the jungle prevails.  Sometimes people say 
to me Liberals are soft.  I can be as strong and as vicious as 
any of my colleagues around the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if one really gets out in the jungle, as I did one time, and 
looks at the real wild animals they are not well dressed, they do 
not have three piece suits.  They are ugly.  They roll around in 
a lot of stuff, they smell like the jungle and they are vicious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the people who wear tuxedos, drive the big limos, live 
in places that are fenced in with servants and slaves and what 
have you think this is great. It is not a good environment to 
live in.  In that kind of environment even the people who are 
working for them do not like them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get back to the second point I want to make. Speculation 
starts in their own country for some people.  They understand the 
rules.  They understand the regulations.  It is the stock brokers 
or the local banker who gives these tip-offs.  They trigger these 
things.  It is kind of like a BRE-X.  The next thing we know all 
kinds of things happen. Then in come the speculators.  The 
speculators become involved. If we could only get a buck every 
time somebody makes a transaction it would be good for the common 
good of all Canadians and this would not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point which is probably the most important reason why 
this Tobin tax would be problematic is in this world there are 
many countries where trading occurs.  The capital will flee to 
the country that does not have a regime in place where moneys are 
taken during transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I know what we do in this House is very important, our 
discussions about how we regulate things and we are here as 
legislators, I am not here just to make laws.  An old farmer told 
me when I was first elected “Go to Ottawa but don't make a lot 
of rules and regulations that you are going to place in a stand 
somewhere.  Remember some times things like the ten commandments. 
That can get you very far”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes notwithstanding that our colleagues come up with good 
legislation and there are a lot of good private members' bills 
that have been passed in the House, the best thing about private 
members' bills is that we discuss them.  We look at all the 
angles and we pry and we probe. Sometimes the good ideas are 
stolen by ministers or by colleagues or by some group and used. 
We have to be mindful that we are just not here to make rules and 
regulations, put them in some kind of document, place them on a 
shelf somewhere or try them and they do not work or they make the 
system worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the finance minister has looked at it and the 
department has looked at it.  We hear the concern of the hon. 
member, but Canada is already exercising international 
leadership.  We have a broad strategy to attack the underlying 
causes of financial market volatility.  Big financial markets are 
not perfect institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I am told, the challenge we face is to find the best 
way of dealing with these problems, which economists call market 
imperfection.  In other words, no market is perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proponents of the Tobin tax then argue that such a law would put 
sand in the wheels of international financial markets by imposing 
a very small percentage tax on a foreign exchange trader.  And so 
the argument goes. 
This would discourage speculation.  It would stabilize the 
financial markets without interfering unduly with longer term 
trade or investment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others are attracted by the tax revenue.  There are a lot of 
people looking for these big slush funds, tax moneys. Politicians 
would love it so we could spend it and so that we could raise 
some funds which they believe would finance and enhance 
worthwhile programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have regimes for raising taxes.  Those regimes are well 
thought out.  This discussion is very good but as far as I am 
concerned this is not the way the government should go because of 
those reasons I mentioned. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I was delighted to hear my colleague from Bruce—Grey. I 
have not heard him speak often, as he mentioned, but I wish he 
would do so more often.  He certainly provides an excellent view 
on this subject.  I also enjoyed his member's statement 
yesterday.  He was on all the national networks mourning the loss 
of the rodent in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here this evening to talk about the motion of my hon. 
colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle on the financial transactions 
tax, that in the opinion of this House the government should show 
leadership and enact a tax on financial transactions in concert 
with all OECD countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many ideas that come from my colleagues in the aging New 
Democratic Party this is a noble one I think with a good purpose 
and a thoughtful objective in mind, to find some way of 
governments imposing some discipline on the increasingly unwieldy 
currency and financial exchange markets which really seem to many 
of us to be out of control at times.  I think we, like all 
Canadians, share at times a feeling of helplessness as we are 
adrift on the sea of trillions of dollars being exchanged daily 
across the world electronically, affecting our standard of 
living, affecting the value of our currency, affecting our 
international purchasing power and yet to a very large extent 
beyond the control of us as individuals or as communities or as 
government.  So I recognize the frustration which gives way to 
the kind of impetus we see behind this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be wonderful if we could find a fiscal policy lever, a 
tax if you will, to slow down the sometimes destructive and 
irrational nature of these speculative currency markets. That I 
admit.  It would also be marvellous if we could live in a world 
where everybody had a marvellous standard of living where there 
was no poverty, no unemployment and no economic inequities. But 
unfortunately that is not a world we live in and it never will 
be.  That is a Utopian world.  There are some things which 
government simply cannot do.  One of the iron laws of economics 
is that people will generally act in their own self-interest and 
maximize their own returns.  This is an irrefutable fact of 
economic history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially what I am saying is that the imposition of a 
financial transaction tax proposed by this motion would be 
unworkable, impractical and would create unintended consequences 
that would be far more devastating on developed countries like 
Canada than are the current vagaries of the currency exchange 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example springs to mind about the kind of perverse 
unintended consequences that result from governments when they 
choose to establish certain outcomes through tax policy.  In the 
16th century in England the crown was looking for an efficient 
way to tax people based on their wealth. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT46"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT46"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1745

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax collectors then noticed that wealthier people tended to 
have homes with a relatively new luxury of windows.  Lovely Tudor 
homes with windows were being built throughout the land.  The tax 
collectors decided to advise the crown that they should impose a 
window tax.  It was a brilliant idea to soak the rich. The 16th 
century version of the NDP said “Let's soak the rich and 
redistribute that income.  Let's have some Robin Hood economics 
here in jolly old England”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They imposed this punitive tax on windows.  The tax collectors 
went around from town to town and county to county and counted 
how many windows people had in their homes and assessed a levy 
based on how many windows they had.  Inevitably we can imagine 
the consequences which tax collectors could not possibly imagine 
in their linear minds.  What happened was that everybody 
throughout the land boarded up their windows and darkened their 
homes to avoid the taxes they would otherwise have to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This marvellous new innovation of Renaissance architecture, the 
window, became blackened and covered up because of a punitive tax 
which was designed to achieve some kind of equity.  To this day 
in some small villages in England we can see what were once 
framed as windows covered up by plaster.  To this day we still 
see the unintended consequences.  That is the kind of natural, 
inevitable, historical, human reaction to the effort by the state 
to impose taxes on people to penalize them for certain 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this in more recent history where other developed 
economies have tried to impose financial transaction taxes such 
as the one contemplated in this motion.  We have seen that 
jurisdictions such as Brazil, Sweden, Japan, Germany and 
Switzerland, all in the past five years or so, have removed or 
eliminated financial transaction taxes which they had at one 
point levied principally on the trading of equities and other 
financial instruments.  The United Kingdom, while not yet having 
eliminated the FTT which it imposed on the registration of 
securities, cut it in half back in 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did all these countries that were theoretically generating 
revenue from this painless small levy on financial transactions 
end up eliminating it?  What they found was much like the window 
tax, that these financial transaction taxes were 
counterproductive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By imposing a levy on securities and equities and the trading of 
those instruments there was less activity in their equities 
market, less securities were being registered.  Why?  It was 
because investors acting rationally in their own self-interest 
moved their financial investments, their equity tradings and so 
forth into other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax base which these governments had sought to derive 
revenue from began to diminish.  By imposing a tax not only did 
the revenues from that source decline year after year as 
investors moved more capital trading out of the country, but it 
became completely counterproductive because all the FTTs in 
various jurisdictions had a dampening effect on economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no doubt that we would see a similar 
unintended consequence were Canada and other OECD countries to 
impose an international tax along the lines proposed by economist 
James Tobin in his now notorious Tobin tax.  There is no doubt 
that it would be impossible to compel every national jurisdiction 
in the world to comply with such a tax.  It would also be 
impossible to impose sanctions on those sovereign jurisdictions 
that refuse to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we could persuade all 26 OECD countries and all G-7 
countries to impose a 1% or .5% levy on financial transactions, 
of which I am highly skeptical, we would still have some 130 
international sovereign jurisdictions to persuade to participate 
in this kind of tax.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inevitably some would do what banking havens like the Grand 
Caymans, Bermuda, Switzerland and the Channel Islands do today, 
that is act as havens for investment.  We would find that capital 
would flow to the point of least resistance.  We would end up 
with an enormous distortion in international financial markets 
which would be devastating to equity markets and the prosperity 
and economic prospects of countries like Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to my colleague from Regina, it is a nice idea but 
it is impractical.  It would not work.  It could not work.  Let 
us not hamper Canada's economy by imposing such an unworkable 
international tax regime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased to take part in this debate, which I feel is an 
important one, in light of my personal values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to congratulate the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle for tabling Motion M-239, which reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should show 
leadership and enact a tax on financial transactions in concert 
with the international community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment to this motion has already been proposed by the 
hon. member for Repentigny and reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by removing the words “enact a tax on 
financial transactions” and replacing them with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“promote the implementation of a tax aimed at discouraging 
speculation on fluctuations in the exchange rate.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the majority of our colleagues in this House will support 
the amendment as well as the main motion. The hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle is to be commended for putting forward this 
motion, which parallels the current debate surrounding the issue 
of globalization. 
This is a good example of globalization and how the world has 
shrunk, given that, with the extremely sophisticated technology 
available today, financial transactions can be performed 24 
hours a day, seven days a week, and have a major impact on 
economies worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been done extensively, and it makes this motion today, 
the Tobin tax, all the more interesting in light of recent 
developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a word, as we know, the purpose of this tax would be to levy 
a very small amount—one tenth of one percent—on 
international currency transactions around the world. It is 
estimated that such transactions total, and that is where it 
becomes interesting, between $1,500 and $2,000 billion a day. It 
is hard to imagine what $1,000 billion a day represents. 
That is order of magnitude we are talking about here. At the end 
of a year, given a rate of one tenth of one percent, $150 or 
$175 billion would have been raised and managed, as a world 
fund, by the UN or another organization designated by the 
international community for this purpose. As a result, and this 
is very important, wealth would be better distributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would act as a mechanism to curb rash exchange speculation on 
the currencies of countries, sometimes the most vulnerable 
countries. We would kill two birds with one stone with this 
world fund, which could be used effectively to fight poverty 
worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And better distribution of wealth would be achieved. 
This would have the effect of counteracting the negative effects 
of globalization and slowing down the progress of the unbridled 
neo-liberalism which has reigned for far too many years already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the way these faceless speculators, with no sense 
of social responsibility, no accounting to anyone, whose job it 
is to type away on computer keyboards everywhere on this planet, 
checking out interests rates that are too low, fostering their 
own clients' interests, thumb their noses at community or 
national interests.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we refer to national interests, we are not referring to 
some vague concept.  We are referring to what has happened in 
recent years, first of all in Asia, in Japan, Malaysia, Korea, 
Indonesia.  All of Russia has been through it since the wall 
came down, and now has become a haven for all manner of crooks 
and criminals.  Things seem to be out of control.  A few years 
ago Mexico too was experiencing some very hard times, as Brazil 
recently did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A full-scale attack is launched on certain economies—often 
developed ones such as Japan but sometimes still fragile, such 
as Indonesia perhaps—so that these economies must suddenly face 
some devastating times. 
This may be seen in the document I am going to read.  This has 
devastating effects on economies and on the individuals in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, an awareness is developing internationally.  I 
would like to take the opportunity to thank Charles F. Johnston 
of 5th Avenue North in Saskatoon for alerting me to the debate 
and inviting me to take part.  He summarizes very well the 
problem with the Tobin tax: “A tax like this not only would 
impose a number of constraints on short term speculation, but it 
would generate a fund destined to support economic growth and 
restore social programs throughout the world”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Johnston is one example of the awareness that is developing, 
especially in France.  That is not new. 
We all know about the acuity of the French on social issues. 
They have always been in the forefront.  They are there thanks 
to a publication you are no doubt familiar with, Madam Speaker, 
<I>Le Monde Diplomatique</I>, which, in January of this year, published 
a ground-breaking article on the question, entitled “For the 
reconstruction of the international financial system: at the 
root of the evil”.  The root of the evil for <I>Le Monde 
Diplomatique</I> is the processing of financial transactions, 
including those involving currency and rates of exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quickly read several quotes: “So, since the crash in the 
winter of 1994-95, half of the population of Mexico has fallen 
below the poverty line.  Malnutrition and famine are again 
raging in Indonesia.  In Russia, ten years of economic 
liberalism have done more to tarnish the reputation of 
capitalism than 70 years of propaganda on the “real” socialism. 
Average life expectancy for men has dropped by seven years, 
unprecedented in the 20th century.  In Korea and Thailand, IMF 
suicides continue.  Workers who have been laid off and are 
without resources kill their wives and children because they are 
unable to provide for them.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read another excerpt from this excellent article:  “The 
top 20% of humanity consumes 86% of the wealth, while the bottom 
20% is left with 1.3%.  The fact is, and we hear it often 
enough, that the gap is widening yearly at the same time as 
official development assistance is declining.  It is the debt 
that is the worst threat to the future of the south, 
particularly the future of less developed countries that are in 
the process of almost disappearing off the face of the earth 
because of debt that they are unable to repay now and will never 
be able to repay in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The less developed countries are spending an average of over 20% 
of their export revenues on servicing this debt. 
If this were lowered to 1% or 2%, as it was for Germany after 
the war, these countries could invest the money saved in health, 
education, and the environment, thus generating a virtuous 
circle.  The more a country could invest in human capital and 
sustainable development, the more it could reduce its debt, to 
the point of eliminating it entirely.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what would be done with the international fund resulting 
from the Tobin tax on international currency transactions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Still in France, I would like to mention the Association pour la 
taxation des transactions financières pour l'aide aux citoyens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this association is to denounce financial 
globalization, which adds to economic insecurity and social 
inequality by circumventing and limiting the choices open to 
nations, democratic institutions and sovereign states 
responsible for the general good. The association wishes to show 
that it is necessary and possible, contrary to popular opinion, 
for people to put the public interest ahead of the interests of 
financial markets and transnational corporations.  This 
Paris-based association also has a Web site.  I urge everyone to 
contact it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to the motion of the hon. 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle on whether we should enact a new 
tax on financial transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Christmas break I had the opportunity to travel 
throughout my riding and talk to many of my constituents, as I 
like to do whenever the House is not sitting.  I also held a 
number of town hall meetings and many private meetings where my 
constituents voiced their concerns on a number of issues.  They 
told me that they need more money for better health care.  They 
said they need more jobs and better opportunities in rural 
Canada.  Many people also told me that politicians need to get to 
work to solve our national unity problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all of my travels in the last six weeks and in all of my 
discussions with constituents not one single person said that 
what this country needs is a new tax.  Since I was elected in 
June 1997 I cannot think of one single time when any voter asked 
me to raise their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read several newspapers every day.  I also look through many 
press clippings.  This may be hard to believe, but I cannot 
recall ever seeing an article or an editorial calling on the 
government to raise taxes or to bring in another tax.  Yet we are 
discussing how we can take even more money out of the pockets of 
hard working Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard other members talk ad nauseam about James Tobin, 
the International Monetary Fund and the Asian financial crisis. 
I will talk about why introducing a new tax is a bad idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for members on all sides of the House to 
remember that when taxes go up there are very real consequences 
on the lives of every Canadian.  Whenever I hear a politician 
suggest that we should increase taxes I think of a gentleman from 
my riding by the name of John Minard.  John Minard did not come 
from a wealthy family.  He did not always have an easy life, but 
he made the most of his life and shared his successes with 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John built a successful building supply business that employs 
his family and many members of his community.  He and his family 
worked very hard at making this business successful and at making 
sure that the family's needs were always looked after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John was usually the first one at work in the morning and the 
last one out at night.  He worked six days every week to make 
sure that his family and his employees had a job to go to and 
that their bills were paid.  However, John Minard did not stop at 
providing for his very large family.  John always felt that he 
should give something back to his community.  Mr. Minard gave 
time and money to minor hockey, to baseball and softball for 
children.  He was involved in the local Rotary Club and he always 
had money for the Christmas Miracle for Kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, John Minard is no longer with us.  He passed away 
just over a year ago.  I bring up his name not just to pay 
tribute to this good man, but to make a point to my hon. friend 
from the NDP.  There are many John Minards in every community 
around this country. 
All across Canada there are people who work days, nights and 
weekends to make sure their families have enough to eat.  These 
same people are the ones who always have a few dollars for the 
scouts, for the hospital drive or for many other worthy causes in 
their communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want us to consider before we forge ahead and raise taxes 
is this.  Whatever project we would spend this new money on, we 
are taking money away from the John Minards of this country.  Is 
this project important enough that people like John Minard should 
have less money to feed their families?  Is getting money for 
whatever whim happens to strike members of parliament this week 
so important that we should deny that money for all the kids in 
John Minard's community who benefited from his generosity?  I do 
not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I understand that the hon. member thinks it would be a neat 
idea if we could get all of the countries and all of the 
principalities of the world to agree to do something about the 
nasty currency trader, but that tax fails the John Minard test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lots of Canadians buy Canada Savings Bonds and lots of Canadians 
save for their retirement.  Those are the people who would have 
to pay this new tax.  Is it more important to bring in this 
trendy new tax just so we can say “We showed those money traders 
in Singapore who is boss”?  Or is it more important that the 
kids who play minor hockey in Woodstock, New Brunswick still have 
people like John Minard and those who have come after him who 
they can count on to help support their communities?  In my 
opinion, I say let us support the hard working generous people 
like John Minard in our communities and take a pass on this tax.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to say at the outset what a joy 
it is to be participating in the debate today which has been made 
possible by my colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle.  I had the 
pleasure to second this bill.  In a sense, I am a co-sponsor with 
my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to listen to the debate and the commonality. 
Every speaker on this topic speaks against the currency 
speculators.  Everybody is against those who make their living by 
speculating on currency.  I have not heard anybody yet say that 
they are in love with the currency speculators, that currency 
speculators are somehow helpful, that currency speculators have 
done anything good for the economy, or that they are doing 
anything good for society generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in complete agreement that currency speculators who sit 
up 24 hours a day in some parts of the world are causing 
problems, causing havoc to the attempts of sovereign nations to 
develop their economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While listening to the previous speaker, I could not help but 
think of our debate around gun control.  Some people say that gun 
control will not stop all murder.  Therefore, why do we have gun 
control? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one said that it would stop all murder and that it was either 
one or the other.  We have gun control in our country to attempt 
to reduce the rate of murder.  I think we have been successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On balance, we can argue about whether this gun control 
initiative is appropriate or another control is appropriate, but 
the fact that we are not all packing sidearms like they are in 
Texas makes this place a better place to live, a safer place to 
live.  The fact that everyone packs sidearms in Texas makes it a 
terrible place to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about currency speculators, let us agree that it is 
worth the effort to try to control these characters.  No one can 
make a convincing case that this is good for anybody other than 
currency speculators and some of their bosses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the media and listen to some of our colleagues 
we hear a financial elite who just do not want any kind of 
meddling in their marketplace.  They want to have carte blanche 
freedom to do whatever they want. If that results in countries 
being devastated, like we have seen as a result of currency 
speculators, so be it.  We even came close in our own country 
just a few months ago when we watched our dollar collapse day 
after day.  In August last year our currency collapsed day after 
day, hour after hour, simply because speculators were speculating 
on our currency. 
It had nothing to do with the state of our economy.  But it 
caused problems.  It caused uncertainty in the marketplace.  A 
lot of investors and consumers were concerned about making 
important investments or consuming the items or services they 
wished.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A long comes an idea.  Is it a perfect idea?  My friend from 
Regina—Qu'Appelle says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should show 
leadership and enact a tax on financial transactions in concert 
with the international community... 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if the international community is in support of 
this, then this will proceed.  We cannot do it unilaterally.  We 
do not want to do it unilaterally.  We want to show leadership. 
The world is calling out for leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that our Minister of Finance a few months 
ago was completely against this idea.  Now the Minister of 
Finance says that he is open to these ideas.  The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance says that he thinks there is 
merit in this.  That is why I am puzzled by some of my friends in 
the Liberal Party who are against this initiative.  If the 
Minister of Finance thinks it is a good idea and if the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance thinks it is 
a good idea, why are those Liberals across the way bad-mouthing 
this concept? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what they are doing.  But it is a free country and I 
appreciate that they have a right to say unusual and perhaps 
uninformed things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what we are talking about.  We are talking about 
a form of the Tobin tax.  In 1972 James Tobin, Nobel Prize 
economist, first proposed the idea of a tax on foreign exchange 
transactions.  This has now been updated.  The most recent 
suggestion is that this would be a tax as low as .1% of 
transactions in order not to swamp the normal commission charges 
and so on.  It is fair to say that the first $10,000 would be 
exempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about the person buying a Canada Savings 
Bond.  We are not talking about a person buying a car.  We are 
talking about people who are currency speculators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be another charge, but the reality is that it would 
only be with the support of the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the international community was in support of some form of a 
Tobin tax, why would Canada not be in support of it?  I listened 
to the leader of Germany the other day.  He is in favour of some 
form of a Tobin tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I returned not long ago from the Asia-Pacific parliamentary 
forum.  Twenty-two nations from around the Pacific came together. 
This was a major item.  Unanimously they agreed that some form of 
a Tobin tax was appropriate for their countries.  Yet some of my 
friends in the Liberal Party bad-mouth this concept.  They are 
bad-mouthing the leadership of Asia-Pacific.  What are these 
people thinking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that some of my friends are here as voices of the 
financial elite of the country.  I can understand why they would 
not support this legislation.  However, most people representing 
constituents in the House of Commons would say “Show me a 
constituent in this country who would vote against the idea of a 
Tobin tax”.  If I went to Calgary today and said “Do you folks 
in Calgary like the idea of some form of control on international 
currency speculators?”, I bet there would not be a single 
Calgarian who would stand and say they would not want this kind 
of tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, yes there would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Oh, no there would not be.  The 
financial elite spokespersons would say that.  However, I know 
the average Calgarian well.  My previous home was on the 
outskirts of Calgary.  A Calgarian will not say “Give free rein 
to the international currency speculators.  Let them destroy 
economies around the world.  Let them smash the Canadian 
dollar”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a major trading nation.  The value of our currency is 
crucial in our ability to work in the international marketplace. 
The stability of our currency is crucial.  That is why I cannot 
understand my friends in the Reform Party who do not want to 
bring some meaningful rationale to this process.  As I say, it is 
a free country.  If they want to be on the side of the 
international currency speculators, who I am to say they ought 
not to be there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are quite enthusiastic about this initiative for two major 
reasons. First, it would have the ability to control 
international currency speculation.  There is no question about 
that.  Some have said we have to talk every country in the world 
into this.  My goodness.  Eighty per cent of global foreign 
exchange trade takes place in only seven cities in the world, 
Tokyo, New York, London, Singapore, Hong Kong, Frankfurt and 
Bern. It would not be bad if if we could control 80% of foreign 
currency speculators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another way.  If the international community buys into 
this why could it not be a provision of membership, as my friend 
from Regina—Qu'Appelle suggested, in the IMF?  If you are going 
to participate then you buy into this concept.  The leading 
nations of the world have bought into it.  Why would you not if 
you were a small country that wanted to join this organization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very significant benefit of the Tobin tax is the money 
it would raise for international development.  The suggestion is 
it is probably in the range of $150 billion that it would raise 
to solve the problems of poverty and environmental degradation 
around the world.  That is why I asked my Liberal friends across 
the way why they would be against such a massive initiative which 
could really solve the significant global problems we have today. 
My friend should be ashamed of himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For extremely good reasons we support this concept of the Tobin 
tax.  We support enthusiastically the suggestion by the hon. 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle that in the opinion of this House 
the government should show leadership and enact a tax on 
financial transactions in concert with the international 
community. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate today on the motion put 
forward by the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, a very thoughtful 
and considered individual.  I had the opportunity to participate 
in a debate with him not too long ago on our caucus task force 
report on financial institutions.  We dealt with the bank merger. 
It was supposed to be a debate but it turned out to be more like 
a love-in.  I was a little concerned given our different 
political stripe but most political parties were in favour of the 
recommendations we made, although we never did hear much from the 
Reform Party on bank mergers.  I guess it was in a difficult spot 
on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion by the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle calls on our 
government to show leadership and enact a tax on financial 
transactions in concert with the OECD countries.  The Bloc 
Quebecois has proposed an amendment that enlarges it to the 
international community in lieu of the OECD.  This is one of 
those rare occasions where I find myself in agreement with the 
Bloc Quebecois.  I would support enlarging it to the 
international financial community if we are to consider it as a 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle I support the motion in general terms but we need 
to clarify a number of issues.  Given the events over the past 
year or so, I do not think many Canadians would argue with the 
fact that global financial markets are interconnected.  There 
does not seem to be any doubt about that.  The financial meltdown 
in Asia started in Thailand over a year ago.  It was followed by 
the financial crisis in Russia and more recently the events in 
Brazil.  They have had an enormous ripple effect throughout all 
the economies and financial markets of world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although our Canadian dollar has shown some improvement 
recently, it has been taking a beating.  This is for reasons I 
believe are largely unrelated to the underlying factors of the 
Canadian economy.  While some might argue that the markets are 
always right, in some circumstances they are somewhat irrational. 
In this case they seem to be acting irrationally.  One has to 
wonder what is going on behind this apparent irrationality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our finance minister is pushing for an international agency that 
would monitor financial institutions worldwide.  I gather its 
purpose would be to identify emerging problems and develop more 
time sensitive and co-ordinated solutions. The proposal is a good 
one and one that I support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other solutions have been proposed to address the destabilizing 
effect of currency traders and speculators like the Tobin tax 
which has been much mentioned here today.  The Tobin tax would be 
a tax on individual financial transactions. However, unless all 
countries agree to such a tax it would not be workable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine 27, 28 or 40 countries around the world enacting a Tobin 
tax and a number of countries not.  It would not be a surprise if 
suddenly the financial transactions migrated to those 
jurisdictions where they did not incur the Tobin tax or financial 
transactions tax. Unless all countries are in harmony with such a 
tax it is just not workable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite talked about the finance minister saying he 
thought it was a good idea.  The finance minister realizes that 
there are a lot of good ideas out there.  The question is which 
ones are feasible and which ones would he implement.  I think his 
approach in pushing for an international agency to monitor 
financial institutions worldwide is a more workable solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to acknowledge that the issue of global 
financial market speculation and its impacts on global and 
domestic economies is one that deserves the attention of world 
leaders and deserves the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is showing leadership on this issue in the G-7 
and other international fora.  There are solutions to the 
downward pressure on the Canadian dollar that can be found right 
here at home.  Statistics Canada recently reported that Canadians 
are investing abroad in stocks, bonds and bank accounts at record 
levels.  This is a result in part of changes the previous 
Conservative government made in 1990 to the foreign content rule 
of RRSPs.  The limit at that time was increased from 10% to 20%. 
Perhaps that should be revisited given the effect it is having on 
the Canadian dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure there are people in this Chamber who would disagree 
and perhaps argue that the limit should go the other way. 
However, I am of the view that we should be very cautious in that 
area and perhaps consider moving it back.  If Canadians want to 
have foreign investments in their RRSPs no one would debate or 
argue that but why should the Canadian taxpayer support that, 
particularly when it could be having a detrimental effect on the 
Canadian dollar? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am offended as I am sure all Canadians are when the 
international financial markets are disturbed profoundly by 
speculators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine a tax on financial transactions.  Presumably such 
a tax would be targeted on foreign currency transactions.  The 
targets hopefully would be short term capital movements because 
investors should really not be penalized or inhibited from moving 
capital from one currency to another based on long term decision 
making or structural decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I throw out a word of caution.  We often hear Thailand cited 
where huge capital outflows caused a crisis. Was the movement of 
capital a symptom of some deeper underlying problems?  In other 
words, where was the chicken and where was the egg?  The answer 
to that in the case of Thailand is a categorical yes, there were 
some underlying fundamental problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some good Canadian friends of mine who have lived in Thailand 
for many years described to me recently the financial devastation 
in that country.  Did the migration of capital from Thailand 
precipitate the financial crisis there or vice versa?  This is an 
important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told by my colleagues in Thailand that the banking system 
collapsed as a result of three major issues. 
There were some very bad investments by the banks, a lot of 
cronyism in the banking system and a lot of corruption in the 
banking system. So foreign investors in Thailand perhaps could 
see this coming and decided to relocate their capital.  I think 
the causal chain of events is important here and we should not be 
just looking at speculative movements.  There are often some 
underlying reasons for the movement of capital.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do applaud the Minister of Finance in pursuing the 
establishment of an international agency, perhaps created from 
within the resources of the existing international agencies, that 
would track the fundamental financial stability issues in 
countries around the world and proactively develop strategies and 
actions required to prevent problems, not respond to events after 
the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to Canada and the downward pressure on the Canadian 
dollar vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar that we have experienced over 
the last year, we are told we experienced a flight of capital to 
so-called safe havens.  I find this curious when the economic 
fundamentals in Canada are so strong, if not the best among the 
developed countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we still suffer with the prospect of another 
referendum in Quebec. This creates uncertainty in financial 
markets.  I am sure this had some bearing on the fate of our 
Canadian dollar. Our colleagues opposite in the Bloc Quebecois 
and the Parti Quebecois in Quebec should be held accountable for 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle for his interest in 
this important topic.  I think it is very worthy of debate and 
discussion in the House and indeed around the world in the 
various international fora. I think it is a very important issue. 
I support the motion in principle and the concept, but we do need 
more discussion and debate. The main thrust of the motion is that 
our government should show leadership.  We are showing 
leadership. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to enter into this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is that the government should show leadership and 
enact a tax on financial transaction in concert with the 
international community.  I certainly applaud the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle on that motion and I very strongly support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we need an international agreement and we know that 
will certainly not happen unless somebody takes leadership. It 
only makes sense to me in the kind of government we have. We show 
leadership in a lot of areas.  We certainly could show leadership 
in the international community in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that Canada has explored the idea during the Halifax 
summit, at which time it became apparent that a number of G-7 
countries were very strongly opposed to the idea.  I recognize 
their positions have not changed.  But they will never change 
unless we provide the evidence to them on why it should change. 
We have to enter into that debate at a global level and go out 
there and make the arguments for putting in place a Tobin tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that even if we had all the industrial on side it 
would not be sufficient for the proposal to work.  But we have to 
start somewhere.  I suggest we can start here, that we need 
strong political will on the part of the Government of Canada and 
on the few allies that we can achieve in the beginning and 
exercise that political will so that we can institute a Tobin tax 
some time down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about a big percentage tax here.  It would be 
a very small percentage tax.  But imagine on the amount of 
speculation of money in this world what that small percentage tax 
would do in terms of benefiting and improving the lives of people 
around the world, in Canada, in Nicaragua, in Honduras, in 
Central America. All around the world it would improve the lives 
of people and those are the kinds of things that we should be 
doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member from the Conservative Party speak earlier. He 
used the example of someone in the community who did a lot of 
volunteer work.  I respect what that individual did.  I applaud 
what that individual did.  But the member tried to leave the 
impression that this was a tax that would hurt that individual. 
It would not.  I doubt that individual was a money speculator. He 
was not a financial money speculator.  Who are these people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a primary producer and I know about speculation in terms of 
the hog market, the grain industry and the beef industry.  I know 
very well that those people that play those markets make huge 
profits many times by shuffling a little paper around and playing 
with the futures market and so on.  The primary producer who does 
all the work, who takes all the risks, who creates the investment 
and puts his family to work and works himself, ends up many times 
loosing money.  The speculators make money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even worse when we get to the financial speculators, the 
money speculators.  They play games, not only with countries, and 
with the new technology that is available today millions even 
billions of dollars can be moved in the flash of a second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a rumour in New York where someone said that Canada 
was a basket case.  Of course when we became the government we 
changed that and the government is no longer a basket case. 
Remember what happened?  One trade, a supposedly respected 
trader, said internationally that Canada was a basket case. 
Suddenly our dollar started to go down.  That was the financial 
money speculators playing games and they are not playing games 
only with countries, they are playing games with people's lives.

it targets the unemployed”.

trouble of condemning our wonderful country, while the

view, at a time when 800,000 Canadian workers cannot qualify for

</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the number of children who leave for school in the 
morning without having had breakfast, this because of the 
government? These same Liberals were opposed to the changes made 
to the EI program by the Conservatives in 1993, on the grounds 
that those changes were inhuman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally toured the country and I heard horror stories. Some 
people, including women, related how they were treated by the 
Department of Human Resources Development, and how their 
families are suffering as a result.

employment insurance, so as to help Canadian families.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the previous 
speaker is always talking about fewer people being on 
unemployment insurance.  He always interprets this as being bad 
news because in his riding there seems to be fewer people on it 
and therefore fewer benefits. He interprets that to mean there 
are fewer dollars being spent in the economy of his constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take a piece of news and the NDP will make it bad news.  As a 
Liberal, I prefer to make it good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are fewer people on employment insurance, that is true. 
However, does anyone think that maybe that has something to do 
with the fact that there is a lower unemployment rate in the 
country and more people are working?  I think that is good news. 
It is good news that more people are working and have actual 
salaries and wages to spend in the constituencies and they are 
not dependent on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member speaks as if employment insurance is the only 
industry in his riding and that the benefits are the salaries his 
people are making.  Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also accuses the government and the administration of this 
department as having quotas to try to catch people.  Nothing 
could be further from the truth in that case as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious he does not know a great deal about the skills of 
management.  Every manager has to make a prediction about the 
coming year.  He has to predict how many workers he is going to 
need, what kind of production they are going to have, et cetera. 
That is good management.  This government is trying to follow 
that model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The officials within the HRDC department who are charged with 
the very serious responsibility of identifying fraud are also 
asked to predict.  That does not mean they are trying to reach 
that number.  It simply means that they are managing and taking 
care of the assets of Canadians as best they can and catching 
people who are fraudulently using the system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I must say what an honour it is to be in your humble 
presence again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rural route mail contractors are not considered to be 
employees according to the provisions of the Canada Labour Code 
because they are specifically prohibited those rights under the 
Canada Post Corporation Act, section 13.5.  This means that RRMCs 
do not enjoy the rights and protections that the vast majority of 
workers take for granted. 
This includes things like minimum wages, health and safety 
protections, workers compensation, employee insurance benefits, 
vacation leave, maternity leave, severance pay and so on.  RRMCs 
are also denied the right to negotiate improvements to their 
wages and working conditions.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government continue to allow these conditions to 
exist?  The RRMCs have now formed an association called the 
Organization of Rural Route Mail Couriers in a serious attempt to 
get the government to change their working conditions. There are 
now over 3,400 signed members who are dedicated to improving 
their lifestyles.  These members deliver mail to several million 
householders across rural Canada. They virtually do the same work 
as their urban counterparts.  How can this government deny these 
dedicated workers the opportunity to receive the same wages and 
benefit as their urban counterparts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very similar to what the regional rates of pay do to the 
lowest paid workers in the public service.  They get a different 
salary depending on what part of the country they live in and 
that is straight discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution to both these is to remove section 13.5 from the 
Canada Post Act, which this government could do, and replace it 
with section 1 of the Canada Labour Code, a very simple and easy 
thing that can be done to improve the lives of thousands of 
people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out that people who do similar work 
have these rights, private sector workers who deliver mail in 
rural areas, public service workers who deliver mail for Canada 
Post in urban areas, rural route mail carriers who work for the 
United States postal office. Even rural postal workers in Mexico 
have a collective agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RRMCs strongly believe that it is wrong to deny them rights 
accorded to so many workers. They are determined to change their 
conditions but they need the government's help.  Will the 
government remove section 13.5 of the Canada Post Act and replace 
it with section 1 of the Canada Labour Code now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1998 budget the federal government promised people that 
it would look at new ways to deliver information and programs so 
that rural Canadians are full participants in Canada's future 
prosperity.  Was the government's promise to look at new ways of 
delivering information programs just another way of saying it 
will find cheaper ways of exploiting rural Canadians who deliver 
information and programs? Rural Canadians would like assurances 
that this is definitely not the case. Recently it introduced 
restructuring the stamp sales which will definitely hurt 
thousands of rural route post offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking on behalf of the riding of Sackville—Eastern Shore I 
find this government's approach to rural route mail carriers 
absolutely despicable, as with the way it treats the bottom lower 
salaried people who work for the public service in terms of 
11,000 workers across this country, different regional rates of 
pay which this government has said it would eliminate in its 1993 
promises in the red book. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this will indeed be an interesting experience for both the member 
for Sackville—Eastern Shore and me because the question I was 
given is entirely different from the question he just asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as labour negotiations, Canada Post is an arm's length 
corporation functioning quite separately from the government and 
has very little government regulation at this time. It operates 
within our framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must apologize to the member and agree to meet with him again 
and respond more fully to his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the small franchisees he alluded to, the difficulty we 
had over the last couple of months in negotiating with many of 
these small postal service outlets is Canada Post is charged with 
providing Canadians access to postal service. The changes have 
been fought through committee.  Multiple changes have been put in 
place. The small postal outlets are being given a fee to operate 
with much assistance. The rural postal services or franchisees 
have had absolutely no changes to their revenue.  That has been 
guaranteed at the 1997-98 levels. As far as the large services 
are concerned they are being given a flat rate of $25,000 a year 
to operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have tried to do is get rid of the gentlemen who go 
around with large suitcases full of stamps and sell in the small 
areas.  I think we have done that well with this change to the 
postal services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I come back to my abject apology of not having a prepared 
answer for the first part which is the most extensive part of the 
hon. member's question.  We will meet again here sometime as 
dictated by the hon. Speaker.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the adjournment 
proceedings on a question I asked on September 30, 1998, 
stressing that the government has two things to do with respect 
to the employment insurance: significantly lower premiums and 
improve the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December, after the EI surplus scandal was exposed and the 
Minister of Finance was forced to backtrack on his plans for a 
bill to make the misappropriation of funds legal, EI premiums 
were cut by 15 cents for every $100 of income. While we were 
asking for a more substantial reduction, it nevertheless 
represents a major victory. Even more ground was won on the 
other, more important priority, that is reasonable eligibility 
requirements for the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, another scandal was unveiled. The human resources 
development minister was caught red handed. He claimed that no 
quotas were imposed on his officials to achieve reduction 
targets in his department. 
Well, we in the Bloc tabled a document showing that there are 
indeed quotas at employment centres, which have a disastrous 
impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party tabled a document providing further 
evidence of the fact that there are indeed individuals at Human 
Resources Development Canada who are put in front of a harsh 
reality: them must fill the required quotas or there will be no 
jobs left. There were 150 jobs at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the unveiling of this scandal will help produce the 
kind of results achieved with respect to the lowering of EI 
premiums, that similar results can be achieved in this case and 
that the government will finally see the light, eliminate the 
intensity rule and change eligibility requirements to make them 
acceptable again to women and young people entering the labour 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is terribly discriminatory to expect a woman or young person 
re-entering the labour market to have worked 910 hours to 
qualify, when the rules are much less stringent for someone who 
goes on EI only occasionally.  There is no reason for this sort 
of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers are the worst off.  Every time they use up 20 
weeks of EI, their benefits go down 1%.  Instead of getting 55% 
of their average earnings, they get 54% after 20 weeks of 
benefits, 53% after 40 weeks, and so on up to 50%.  The result 
will be that, in two years' time, all regions with seasonal 
industries will have people who get 50% of their average 
earnings rather than 55%.  This is treating people like economic 
guinea pigs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that everyone wants to work. 
When a company advertises a job, several people apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with all these facts, will the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, or the Minister of Finance, who is really in 
charge, do what is necessary in the coming weeks to put the EI 
scheme back on its rightful track, with sensible premiums and 
benefits that go on for a reasonable period, rather than 
building up surpluses to bring down the deficit at the expense 
of individuals and regions who have paid too high a price? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's policy, at a time when the impact of 
globalization is being felt, has weakened rather than stabilized 
regional economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I await an answer from the government.

<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in essence the hon. member was 
talking about the employment insurance fund.  He often makes 
reference to the fact that the moneys in the employment insurance 
fund are being used for other purposes and how the government 
must take measures to stop that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I remind the member that the auditor general in 1986 
advised the government that any revenue which comes in from 
employment insurance premiums must flow into the consolidated 
revenue fund because the government stands behind the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 10 of the last 17 years where the fund was in deficit it was 
the taxes of taxpayers who may not have paid any employment 
insurance premiums that went to prop up that account so that 
those individuals who were on benefits could receive those 
benefits.  It is not just about the fact that those individuals 
who pay receive benefits.  It is also about the fact that those 
premiums flow into consolidated revenues. 
In fact it is government that stands behind the program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the hon. member talks about the employment insurance 
program and how it is very necessary, we as a government believe 
that employment insurance provides a very effective and useful 
role for Canadians who find themselves temporarily out of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions taken by the government are directed toward ensuring 
that our economy performs in a way that small business and large 
business are able to create employment opportunities for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the record.  Since October 1993 private sector 
jobs are up almost 1.6 million.  Full time jobs are up over 1.2 
million.  During 1998 alone roughly 450,000 jobs were created and 
almost all of those were in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with the employment insurance program, there are other 
measures that the government has taken to ensure the economy 
performs to its fullest.  We will continue to do that so that 
Canadians who want to work have the opportunity to be employed.

<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to have the opportunity to remind the House that, on October 1, 
1998, I asked a question of the Minister of Industry concerning 
the dramatic layoff of 900 workers at Pratt & Whitney, 500 of 
them engineers in its R&D units.  The other employees involved 
were also high-ranking employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was this?  Because of federal government underfunding of its 
Technology Partnerships Canada program. 
I asked the minister whether he understood that this situation 
affects not only high-ranking employees, but also the lead role 
of Quebec and Canada in the aerospace industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking after colleagues who showed just how drastic the 
unemployment situation is, I know that when I say that the 
government must fund the Technology Partnerships Canada 
program—as I said in another question—at least to the $100 million 
level, this is because high-level jobs are a guarantee for the 
future, for the economy.  These are jobs which will get the 
economy moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is getting criticism from both sides.  Its 
strategy is the opposite of what it should be. 
It makes no sense to penalize the unemployed and make workers 
earning up to $39,000 and especially the SMBs employing them 
pay, as it does, through excessive contributions.  The big 
companies pay less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, however, it makes no sense not to give big 
business, including the aerospace industry, the instruments they 
need to be competitive, if there are to be high level jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technology Partnerships Canada is not a funding program. It 
funds itself from the return.  When research and development has 
become a cost effective product, it funds itself out of 
royalties.  That is why we support it.  It is not a funding 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program provides for the financing of research and 
development in strategic areas like aerospace, where Quebec has 
a small lead, followed by Ontario. This is an area that creates 
many jobs, one which is growing three times faster than this 
country's GDP, and where the industry, Pratt & Whitney in 
particular, goes significantly further than many businesses, not 
only in this area but also in others, investing 20% of its 
turnover. This cannot last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the competition is heavily subsidized, directly or 
indirectly, through DND contracts among other things. The same 
is true of the United States, which has resulted in engineering 
positions moving south of the border. This is to say that we are 
very concerned with the drop in the share of added income in 
sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is facing a productivity crisis. 
This is not the way to go about resolving it. Let us not forget 
the unemployed in all this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say that the government 
has made a substantial commitment to aerospace and other high 
tech, high growth sectors especially in the Montreal area and 
across the country.  An example of this commitment is Technology 
Partners of Canada whose budget was increased from $150 million 
two years ago to $250 million this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Montreal area, where much of Canada's aerospace industry is 
located, and all of Canada stand to benefit greatly from TPC. 
There have already been investments in several world class 
aerospace projects.  There have been other investments in the 
biotechnology, environmental technology and telecommunications 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success of the federal government strategy for promoting 
partnership for innovation, economic growth and job creation is 
evident across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Pratt & Whitney Canada our commitment has been 
substantial.  Today TPC has invested in two Pratt & Whitney 
Canada projects totalling $147 million.  We are continuing to 
work closely with Pratt & Whitney Canada to explore all 
reasonable options that can be pursued to support the company's 
future development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister recently met with Pratt & Whitney Canada executives 
to this end.  We believe Pratt & Whitney Canada is committed to 
its Montreal operation and elsewhere in Canada.  The Government 
of Canada is committed to continuing partnership with Pratt & 
Whitney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to employment, the impacts are not as immediate or 
as dramatic as one might be led to believe.  Not until the end of 
1999 would there be a significant reduction of jobs.  This is a 
normal phenomenon for a cyclical industry like aerospace and 
largely the result of the completion of earlier research and 
development projects.  As well the company has indicated this 
will mostly be implemented through early retirement and normal 
attrition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that the aerospace industry is growing at a very 
favourable 14% rate annually.  Although some jobs will be lost at 
Pratt & Whitney, other local aerospace firms such as Bombardier 
and Bell Helicopter are still expanding.
