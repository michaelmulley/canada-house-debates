	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WHEREAS section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982 provides that an 
amendment to the Constitution of Canada may be made by proclamation issued 
by the Governor General under the Great Seal of Canada where so authorized by 
resolutions of the Senate and House of Commons and of the legislative 
assembly of each province to which the amendment applies;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>NOW THEREFORE the House of Commons resolves that an amendment to the 
Constitution of Canada be authorized to be made by proclamation issued by His 
Excellency the Governor General under the Great Seal of Canada in accordance 
with the schedule hereto.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SCHEDULE<BR>AMENDMENTTOTHECONSTITUTIONOFCANADA">SCHEDULE<BR>
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA</A></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. The Schedule to the Prince Edward Island Terms of Union is amended by 
adding thereto, after the portion that reads</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``And such other charges as may be incident to, and connected with, the 
services which by the ``British North America Act, 1867'' appertain to the 
General Government, and as are or may be allowed to the other Provinces;''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``That a fixed crossing joining the Island to the mainland may be substituted 
for the steam service referred to in this Schedule;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, for greater certainty, nothing in this Schedule prevents the imposition of 
tolls for the use of such a fixed crossing between the Island and the mainland, 
or the private operation of such a crossing.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Citation</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. This Amendment may be cited as the Constitution Amendment, 1993 
(Prince Edward Island).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am happy that you have read a fair 
portion of the amendment which we intend to discuss today. The 
amendment is very specific with regard to the terms of reference 
between Canada and Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	I apprise the new Speaker, who has just taken his place in the 
chair, that this is a very specific amendment. Therefore I would 
hope that comments all hon. members make have some 
relevance to the subject matter which we are dealing with and 
not the broad general topic of constitutional reform.
<P>
	One hundred and thirty years ago the Fathers of 
Confederation gathered in Prince Edward Island and created the 
concept of Canada. Thanks to their genius Canada has flourished 
throughout the 20th century. Today Prince Edward Island seeks 
a small but significant amendment to its terms of union with 
Canada. This improvement will create the opportunity for our 
smallest province to take its rightful place in the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	On behalf of the Government of Canada I am honoured to 
place before the House of Commons a formal resolution to 
amend the terms of union between the Government of Canada 
and Prince Edward Island which I am certain all members of this 
House will want to support in the deliberations to follow.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1344"> 1344 </A></B>
<P>
	The amendment, albeit short and straightforward, is 
important for Prince Edward Island, important for the entire 
Atlantic region and important for Canada.
<P>
	The proposed amendment provides the necessary 
constitutional framework for the replacement of the ferry 
service between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick by a 
bridge across the Northumberland Strait. More significantly, the 
amendment provides a bridge for the future.
<P>
	The fixed crossing will allow Prince Edward Island to become 
a full partner in Canada's economy. The fixed crossing will spur 
Atlantic Canada's economy in the short term and create real 
hope for viable long term economic growth.
<P>
	Construction of the 13 kilometre concrete bridge means new 
skills, new technology, new jobs, new enthusiasm and new 
prospects for the future.
<P>
	The amendment before Parliament today will allow a project 
to proceed which is fiscally sound and financially responsible, a 
project which represents thoughtful public transportation 
policy, a project which sets new standards for environmental 
review, assessment and management.
<P>
	The federal government is bound by the 1873 terms of union 
with Prince Edward Island to provide continuous 
communications between the island and the mainland.
<P>
	Since Confederation this obligation has been fulfilled by a 
ferry service. The province of Prince Edward Island now wishes 
to strengthen, modernize and improve dramatically the means 
by which the island is linked continuously with mainland 
Canada.
<P>
	For that reason the federal government and the Government of 
Prince Edward Island signed an agreement committing the two 
governments to make the necessary constitutional change to 
permit the ferry service to be replaced by a bridge.
<P>
	The amendment before us today is the last in a series of 
legislative steps required to enable Prince Edward Island to 
make that move forward. In the spring of 1993 Parliament 
debated and then passed Bill C-110, an act respecting the 
Northumberland Strait crossing.
<P>
	I would be remiss in my opening remarks if I did not pay 
tribute to those members of my own caucus who participated in 
that debate and on previous occasion whereby the House deemed 
it appropriate to pass Bill C-110.
<P>
	I want to congratulate all members, some who are present, 
some who are opposite, who participated in that debate. I wish to 
thank them sincerely.
<P>
	In June 1993 the Prince Edward Island legislature passed a 
resolution authorizing this amendment. In October an 
agreement was signed by the federal government and Strait 
Crossing Development Inc. to begin construction of a bridge 
linking Prince Edward Island to mainland Canada.
<P>
	The agreement is an innovative, prudent and intelligent 
approach to the building of public infrastructure. The agreement 
breaks new ground in government-private sector partnerships. 
Investment of taxpayers' dollars is limited but also protected.
<P>
	The people of Canada will not be responsible for footing the 
bill for delays or cost overruns relating to this initiative. The 
total contribution of the Government of Canada will consist of 
35 subsidy payments to the private sector development. The 
payments will be made annually at a cost of $42 million indexed 
to inflation.
<P>
	This formula effectively caps the cost and limits to 35 years 
the financial responsibilities of the Government of Canada to 
meet its constitutional obligation to the people of Prince Edward 
Island.
<P>
	By contrast, pursuing the option of the ferry service 
indefinitely would subject the taxpayer to undue and unexpected 
cost without any reprieve in sight. As was made crystal clear by 
the Prime Minister both in our election red book and in the 
recent speech from the throne, the government's number one 
priority is job creation. The fixed link and this particular 
initiative will do that. It will create jobs.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreement, 96 per cent of bridge 
construction jobs will be filled by Atlantic Canadians. In total 
over 3,500 jobs will be created in the three and a half year 
construction period. Further, at least 2,000 indirect jobs will be 
created as a result of spin-offs. That addresses clearly and 
unequivocally the government's intent with regard to its priority 
of job creation.
<P>
	The contracts also specify that 70 per cent of the total 
procurement requirements will be provided by Atlantic 
Canadians. Given the size and complexity of the undertaking, 
extensive spin-offs will offer Atlantic Canadians the chance to 
develop new construction, management and environmental 
protection skills.
<P>
	What is most encouraging is that the economic benefits will 
continue to flow long into the future. The tourism industry 
estimates that once the bridge is in operation, the number of 
people visiting P.E.I. will increase approximately 25 per cent. It 
will open up new opportunities for even more employment in the 
vitally important hospitality industry of that province and other 
provinces as well.
<P>
	The Prince Edward Island trucking industry will benefit to the 
tune of some $10 million each year in time savings alone. Mr. 
Speaker, you are very wise and very learned. I have no doubt you 
are probably a very well travelled individual. If you have taken 
or perhaps would like to take a trip in the immediate future to 
Prince Edward Island, you would quickly understand why the 
trucking association is so much in favour of this initiative. It 
will decrease the time you will be parked at the ferry side 
waiting for the boat to transport you to the other side. Not only is 
it time saving but it is also an  economic saving which will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1345"> 1345 </A></B>
<P>
enhance opportunities and provide many spin-offs for that 
sector of our economy.
<P>
	The bridge will provide much greater certainty and reliability 
of delivery for P.E.I.'s farmers and fishermen. There will be new 
possibilities of growth for the province's processing and 
manufacturing industries.
<P>
	P.E.I.'s businesses will be able to improve their bottom lines. 
An improved competitive position for the island's economy 
means an improved future for the young people of the island. I 
am certain all members of the House regardless of political 
ideology will want to support that enthusiastically.
<P>
	Not surprisingly, over the years since the idea of a fixed link 
was first advanced, support has grown to the point where today 
over 70 per cent of islanders are in favour of the bridge. I do not 
mean the people from Cape Breton Island, I mean the people 
from Prince Edward Island. I wish to make that very clear.
<P>
	The bridge is an exciting project for Prince Edward Island and 
Atlantic Canada. I know that some people still have concerns. I 
want to do my best to address some of the concerns this morning 
and perhaps respond to questions that hon. members might have.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the 
commitments enshrined in a tripartite agreement made with the 
provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	The ferry workers who will lose their jobs in June 1997 as a 
result of the ferry closures will be treated fairly. They will have 
first choice of employment on bridge operation and 
maintenance. A fair severance package will be negotiated on top 
of the provisions of the workers' current contract. We will work 
closely with ferry employees to find retraining opportunities for 
jobs in many sectors of the local economy which will benefit 
from the presence of the new bridge.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Fishermen affected by the construction activities in specific 
areas of the Northumberland Strait will be compensated for lost 
opportunity. As part of this particular deal the developer has set 
aside a $10 million trust fund to be administered according to a 
plan developed mostly by fishermen themselves.
<P>
	I also want to reaffirm the commitment to provide financial 
assistance through another agency which I happen to be 
responsible for, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, for 
sound business initiatives in order to help the communities of 
Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick in the coming months 
and years. We will take the appropriate measures to help the 
affected individuals and communities because it is the fair and 
just thing to do. I cannot stress too strongly that the overall 
effect of the bridge will be many immediate and long-term 
benefits. The bridge will contribute to an increasingly dynamic 
economy for those of us who reside in Atlantic Canada. In fact, 
the project constitutes a good  deal, not only for the people of 
Prince Edward Island, not only for the people of Atlantic Canada 
but, I dare to suggest in the House of Commons, for the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	In drawing up this agreement the public servants of my 
department have done a commendable job of ensuring that the 
taxpayers are protected from any unexpected, unnecessary or 
unwarranted costs. All of the risks have been assumed by the 
developer, including financing, design, construction, 
maintenance and operation.
<P>
	I know some people, perhaps in this House, have expressed 
concerns that the ultimate owners of two of the development 
partners are not Canadian. But I am satisfied that this is 
essentially a Canadian undertaking whose benefits will largely 
accrue to the people of this country. It is true that Northern 
Construction Company and the GTMI company are Canadian 
subsidiaries of foreign firms, but both subsidiaries have been 
operating actively in Canada for in excess of 30 years.
<P>
	I wonder if those critics-and I do not suggest for a moment 
that they are here on the floor of the House of 
Commons-wherever they may be, would seriously suggest 
stopping as it would be rather ridiculous if we were to say to 
GM, Ford and Chrysler: ``Because you operate a subsidiary in 
Canada, in Ontario, you should not be allowed to operate 
because your parent company is a foreign one''. That would be 
intellectually dishonest. We are in a globally competitive world. 
I know members opposite would want to agree with my 
conclusion that this is important for Atlantic Canadians and 
important for Canada as a whole.
<P>
	Furthermore, this particular developer should be 
complimented for assembling world class technical expertise. 
The truth is that the proponent of the fixed link, Strait Crossing 
Development, is a 100 per cent Canadian owned company which 
happens to be headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. Who will 
benefit most from the project? The answer clearly is the citizens 
of Canada.
<P>
	The developer was required to have all the project costs in 
trust at the time of closing, plus a 10 per cent contingency until 
substantial completion of the bridge has taken place. The 
developer has posted a $200 million performance bond as well 
as a $35 million compliance bond and a $20 million labour and 
material bond. All these are supported by guarantees with the 
parent companies. The deal was struck in such a way that the 
parent companies are providing the necessary financial backing 
to the developer.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1346"> 1346 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	I want to emphasize that the developer and not the Canadian 
taxpayers will be fully liable for cost overruns. If the project is 
not completed by May 31, 1997, the developer must pay the cost 
of operating the ferry service until the bridge is ready. Once the 
bridge is in operation the developer must operate and maintain it 
to the satisfaction of the federal government before having 
access to the revenues from the tolls.
<P>
	The cost for crossing the bridge will be comparable to that of 
the current ferry service. Over the next 35 years these tolls will 
not be increased in any year by more than three-quarters of the 
annual rate of inflation. Through these and other provisions the 
government has made every effort to ensure that taxpayers are 
properly protected before, during and after construction.
<P>
	Similarly, I want to make an honest effort to answer all fair 
minded questions and reservations raised by Canadians about 
the fixed link. In that spirit I would like to comment on the 
question of the possible environmental effects of this project.
<P>
	This issue has been raised throughout the past five years, 60 
months. I know it has concerned a number of members of the 
House. I do not intend to detail all the environmental studies and 
expert reviews that were undertaken except to say that there 
were in excess of 100 studies, most of them very 
comprehensive.
<P>
	I was going to seek the indulgence of the House and bring 
before it the six feet of studies that have been undertaken with 
regard to this project but I thought it would be rather 
cumbersome to do so. It would be rather costly for the 
Government of Canada, particularly the House of Commons, to 
have reprinted in <I>Hansard</I> each and every word of all of those 
studies.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, from your study of the transcripts 
of this debate at another time, I placed before the House a 
number of studies. I refer to them not in totality but in summary 
fashion, bringing to the attention of the House just how 
important those studies were in answering a number of 
environmental concerns.
<P>
	Today I am tabling with the permission of the House a list of 
all of the studies which have been done, both in French and 
English. If members wish to refer to them I am certain my 
department can make these studies readily available so they can 
examine them, study them at night, take them home on the 
weekend and review them, maybe get an independent study by 
their particular political party or their particular group. Then we 
could hear back from them in the months and years ahead on 
whether the studies, which number in total 100, were 
appropriate.
<P>
	I wish to have the consent of the House to table these two 
documents if members wish to refer to them at a later time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am also prepared if members 
deem it appropriate to bring in the six feet of studies which have 
been done. If members wish me to do that they might want to 
indicate it to me with a note and I would be prepared to do that so 
everyone will understand that there are no secrets, no backroom 
deals that have been consummated with regard to this project.
<P>
	I want to say that the project was subjected to the most open 
and fully transparent public consultation process which 
involved over 80 public meetings attended by over 10,000 
individuals. This is quite remarkable in itself. I believe this 
project sets the standard of environmental review and will 
become a model of environmental management for undertakings 
of similar size and similar scope.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	There is no doubt and there should be no doubt in anyone's 
mind that there are Canadians out there who under no 
circumstances whatsoever would agree to having a fixed link, 
whether because of the environment, personal bias, personal 
views, finances or otherwise. However, the vast majority of the 
people of Prince Edward Island who voted in a democratic 
referendum passed in their legislature voted in favour of the 
fixed link. We as a national Parliament must recognize that fact, 
as I am sure hon. members opposite will want to recognize in 
their interventions that will fall in line shortly.
<P>
	In late August the Federal Court of Canada in response to a 
challenge ruled that the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services had gone well beyond what would 
normally have been expected in meeting the federal 
environmental review guideline order. I will quote from Justice 
Cullen's ruling when he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The criteria accepted and followed by Public Works Canada when making its 
self-assessment was more than adequate for the purposes and complied with the 
(environmental) guideline order.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	However, I assure the House this does not mean the end of our 
environmental concerns. My department, as well as other 
responsible federal and provincial agencies, will continue to 
monitor environmental impacts during the construction period 
and beyond to ensure compliance with the agreement and to take 
action if it should be deemed necessary.
<P>
	The fixed link is a very exciting initiative, a very bold 
initiative. It is an undertaking of historic proportions. It is yet 
another challenging opportunity to open up the country, to unite 
the country and to build it.
<P>
	Yes, the 13-kilometre bridge, the longest ever over waters 
which freeze, is ambitious but so were the St. Lawrence seaway, 
the Trans-Canada highway and the great Canadian railroad. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1347"> 1347 </A></B>
<P>
hallmark of all these endeavours was the determination to bring 
Canadians one step closer together.
<P>
	This undertaking demonstrates that Canada has the ability to 
develop an imaginative approach to government industry 
co-operation in carrying out a major public initiative: 
partnership at its best.
<P>
	I should like to think that the Prince Edward Island bridge 
project, in addition to its other merits, could serve as a global 
model for future joint projects of this type. Closer public and 
private sector collaboration is a major contemporary avenue 
through which we can stimulate investment and create badly 
needed jobs.
<P>
	During the election campaign we heard from every political 
leader talking about a partnership between industry and 
government. There is no other better example than the fixed link 
between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick which 
demonstrates that point more accurately.
<P>
	The Northumberland bridge is a very sound and a very 
important project. The present premier of Prince Edward Island, 
the Hon. Catherine Callbeck, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A tremendous economic boost-that will provide a stable, economic climate 
for business to survive in this province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Jim Larkin of the Prince Edward Island Tourism Association 
remarked that it is ``probably the key to the future of this 
province''. The premier of New Brunswick, the Hon. Frank 
McKenna, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am absolutely confident that history will favourably judge the fixed 
crossing to Prince Edward Island-it's time to seize the moment and opt for 
progress in Atlantic Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clearly the vast majority of the people of Prince Edward 
Island sees this bridge as an important initiative which will give 
the people of the province renewed opportunity to participate in 
the country's economy, renewed opportunity to enhance their 
own lives and the lives of their families. The bridge is creating a 
renewed sense of optimism for Prince Edward Island and for the 
Atlantic region. A strong Atlantic economy is a vital part of a 
strong Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Atlantic Canadians know within their hearts and minds that 
the bridge is only one part of the solution, but as Sir Winston 
Churchill once said: ``The chain of destiny can only be grasped 
one link at a time''.
<P>
	In conclusion I urge members of Parliament from all political 
parties and those who are independents to support the 
amendment before us today. I urge members of the House to 
create the opportunity for Canada's smallest province, Prince 
Edward Island, and the rest of Atlantic Canada to become 
economically stronger. I urge members of the House to give a 
new generation of Canadians who happen to reside in Prince 
Edward Island an opportunity to become full partners in the 
Canadian economy and an opportunity for a better future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have here a situation that has its roots in the distant 
past. When Prince Edward Island entered Confederation in 
1873, the island had set certain conditions which were agreed to 
by the federal government and the other members of 
Confederation at the time, conditions which concerned mainly 
establishing and maintaining a communications link between 
the Island and the continent, so that Prince Edward Island could 
in some way be part of the Canadian community.
<P>
	At the time, this link was provided by a steam service, which 
is how it was described in the terms of the union. Over the years, 
the federal government has met the commitments made in the 
Constitution, which today represent a subsidy of $28 million. 
That is, the original commitment today works out to $28 million 
in constant dollars.
<P>
	My point is that we are not starting from scratch. The province 
is not asking the federal government to build a bridge starting 
from zero funds. The government of P.E.I., from a normal desire 
to adjust to changing times, now asks that the link, formerly 
provided by a steam service and subsequently by more modern 
ships, be made more effective and more continuous by building 
a bridge.
<P>
	My point is, and this may surprise my hon. friend the minister, 
who was furiously defending the government's position against 
the opposition he anticipated from the Bloc Quebecois, my point 
is that the Bloc Quebecois takes a very positive view of this 
project, and it is too bad the minister wasted precious 
ministerial time and energy which would have been better spent 
on other issues, since after due consideration, the Bloc 
Quebecois, feels the economics are sound, the financial 
structures make sense and there is an element of fairness added 
to the Canadian federation as it exists today.
<P>
	If we look at the economics, it is clear a bridge will increase 
economic activity on the Island, that tourism will increase, and 
by the way, I did not wait for the minister's cordial invitation to 
visit Prince Edward Island. I already visited the island as a 
minister at the time, and as a tourist last year. It is a magnificent 
island, and I know tourism will improve considerably once there 
is a bridge that provides for easy access at all times. We agree 
that on the economic side, there is a considerable advantage for 
the government and the people of Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	The financial structure is something which the government 
should monitor very closely. It is true that the financing scheme 
is quite ingenious. There is no undue burden on the federal 
government since the subsidy, which it has to pay at any rate and 
will keep on paying, and which is now $28 million, will upon 
completion, in 1997, be $41.9 million in constant dollars. There 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1348"> 1348 </A></B>
<P>
will of course be adjustments for inflation, but there would be in 
any case.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	As of 1997 we are looking at an annual increase of roughly 
$14 million which the federal government will have to continue 
awarding to Prince Edward Island and, given the expected 
benefits, I do not think it is an exaggerated amount.
<P>
	We applaud this private sector initiative involving the 
construction and the operation of the bridge. A word of caution 
is in order, however. I think that all parliamentarians should 
demand that the government be extremely attentive and monitor 
construction activities closely.
<P>
	I realize that construction will be carried out by a private firm, 
but it is essential that the government monitor the work closely. 
What happens if the project goes over budget? This is the point 
that raises the most concerns. Costs might start to get out of 
hand. After all, we are talking about a major undertaking, the 
construction of a 13 kilometre long bridge across a strait in 
which a great deal of ice forms during the winter. There will be a 
substantial amount of pressure on the bridge footings. What 
happens if there are cost overruns?
<P>
	The documents that we have in our possession do not show 
what the government's responsibility would be if such an event 
were to occur. Legally, I believe the government's responsibility 
is limited to guaranteeing annual payments. However, what 
would happen if during construction, the private sector 
companies fell on hard times, financially speaking?
<P>
	We all know what happened with the Channel. Of course the 
two projects are vastly different in terms of sheer scope, but the 
fact remains that constructing a 13-kilometre long bridge 
capable of withstanding extremely harsh weather conditions is a 
sizeable undertaking. Has the government considered what it 
will do if the project goes over budget? It should shed some light 
on this point and tell us what steps it intends to take to ensure 
that there are no cost overruns.
<P>
	Regarding the environment, I am not as familiar with this 
aspect of the issue as the minister, who clearly has up to date 
information. Opposition members do not have access to files as 
readily as ministers. However, when I was Environment 
Minister, I had sought assurances that a very stringent 
environmental study would be done. I believe that such a study 
was carried out and that the minister is correct in saying that the 
most extensive precautions have been taken.
<P>
	The government should, however, exercise caution during the 
actual construction phase because certain operations will affect 
the environment. The minister has said that he will be taking 
certain measures, but exactly which ones, that remains to be 
seen. Perhaps it would be good to know what measures are being 
planned.
<P>
	Consideration must also be given to what will happen after 
construction is completed and the bridge is in operation. We 
know that fisheries, particularly the lobster fishery, will be 
affected and that some form of compensation is planned. I think 
that during the coming debate, the government should tell us a 
little more about its plans to provide compensation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will say it in English for our friends in P.E.I. We think this is 
an equitable measure of progress which should promote the 
economic development of this province of Canada. That is why 
we will support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to draw the government's attention to a 
problem with the drafting of the constitutional amendment 
before the House. The problem seems to be one of agreement 
between the French and the English versions.
<P>
	This could, in my opinion, cause some major legal problems 
since as we know, following the 1982 amendments, pursuant to 
section 56, I believe, of the current Constitution, both the 
English and French versions are equally authoritative.
<P>
	The same cannot be said for the Constitution of 1982. Despite 
the commitments made in 1982, we are still awaiting the 
official, authoritative French version of the Canadian 
Constitution. In passing, I have one small question. How is it 
that a country like Canada, which claims to be bilingual, still 
does not have an official French version of the Constitution? We 
will get back to that some other day.
<P>
	The fact remains, however, that this amendment which will be 
adopted today will be equally authoritative in both languages 
since the new constitutional system is in place. Looking at the 
resolution, we see that the English version reads as follows:
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``That a fixed crossing joining the island to the mainland may 
be substituted for the steam service referred to in this 
schedule''. May be substituted. In the French version we read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Qu'un ouvrage de franchissement reliant l'île et le continent remplace le 
service de bateaux. . .</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While in English you have something that may or may not 
happen-the government has the power, the option of replacing 
the old steam service by a fixed crossing-in French, the 
government has to do it. There are very significant nuances. I am 
somewhat surprised that the government's legal services failed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1349"> 1349 </A></B>
<P>
to pick up such a significant nuance, one that could certainly, 
under certain circumstances, cause major legal problems.
<P>
	I do not know whether the government intended to be as 
formally committed as in the French clause or to have a way out 
like in the English one. I do not know what they intend to do. 
Perhaps they should tell us which reflects their true intentions 
and make sure both versions reflect the same legal reality.
<P>
	I would like to add that, if this is good for Prince Edward 
Island-and it is-and if the federal government is able to make 
financial commitments that I would describe as reasonable to 
ensure substantial economic development in Prince Edward 
Island for the 125,000 residents of the island, one can wonder 
why the federal government no longer conducts this kind of 
projects which in the past have prompted massively enthusiastic 
responses in terms of economic development. I am thinking of 
the HST, the high speed train, in particular.
<P>
	If the government saw fit-and rightly so-in the interest of 
125,000 people to get involved in this major project which we 
support, it would seem to me that, for the 16 million people of 
Quebec and Ontario, in the interest of connecting the economic 
heartland of Canada to the United States, the largest economic 
market place all of us have access to, it may be worthwhile to 
look into putting into place a link, another type of link, a railway 
link, taking advantage of the very high technology offered by the 
HST as part of the same project.
<P>
	I will not elaborate on this, as some of my colleagues will 
address this specific issue, but I do urge the government to go 
further in the direction it is taking today and to ensure that 
reasonable, practical and forward-looking major projects are 
initiated.
<P>
	Finally, I cannot help but notice that, in response to an 
obvious need, the government has decided to reopen the 
Constitution. We know that the Prime Minister and his 
government are claiming left and right that they do not intend to 
talk about the Constitution: ``We will not touch the Constitution. 
I have absolutely no desire to touch the Constitution''. It has 
become a taboo subject, except when there is a need to address 
this issue.
<P>
	There is such a need today and the government, in a practical 
and realistic fashion, has decided to do what must be done. It is 
no sin to touch the Constitution when it must be done. And, as it 
must be done, we are supporting today's motion.
<P>
	I know that, as far as the Bloc Quebecois's designs for Quebec 
are concerned, it is not a matter of reopening the Constitution to 
achieve Quebec's sovereignty; such a decision will be made 
democratically in due course by Quebecers themselves. As for 
the current, very serious debate on native self-government and 
the extremely pressing and critical issues being raised, I think 
that the leader of Canada's First Nations, Mr. Mercredi, is right 
in saying that the Constitution should be reopened in this case. 
We think that, if the government can accommodate this 
economic need in the case of Prince Edward Island, it should 
also fill this more urgent, political, social, even  ethical need to 
take steps that will, in the long run, solve the native problem.
<P>
	We cannot go on like this, as we are experiencing numerous 
repercussions in every respect. First of all, from a social 
standpoint, the sad picture of what is happening in some 
reserves, the extreme hardships suffered by the people should be 
enough to convince us that we need well thought out instead of 
piecemeal solutions and that the demand for native 
self-government in a framework and under conditions that are 
appropriate should be submitted to the government, which 
should respond with the same realism it is showing today in 
recognition of the need to establish a fixed link between Prince 
Edward Island and the mainland.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	I would like to conclude by appropriating an argument 
invoked by the minister. The minister, perhaps thinking that the 
Bloc Quebecois would oppose this measure, urged us not to raise 
objections and to respect the will expressed by the people of 
Prince Edward Island in a democratic referendum. He made a 
pressing, emotional appeal to respect public opinion as 
expressed in a democratic referendum.
<P>
	We are in total agreement with the minister today and we will 
ask him to stand by his words in due course, if and when Quebec 
makes the decision we are hoping it will make.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to this constitutional resolution under section 43 
of the Constitution Act, 1982 to amend the Prince Edward Island 
terms of union in the schedule, sections 1 and 2. The purpose of 
the resolution is of course as stated, to allow the substitution of a 
bridge for a ferry.
<P>
	This particular resolution comes from a government 
committed to not open the Constitution, to not even remotely 
discuss constitutional questions. At least that is the position as 
we have understood it. But is it really its position to act that 
way?
<P>
	Already this is the second constitutional amendment being 
passed since the defeat of the Charlottetown accord. It is in 
addition to a number of extra constitutional measures that are 
either being taken or being considered, such as aboriginal 
self-government or federal-provincial division of powers and 
overlap and duplication.
<P>
	Therefore the position that we are not going to talk about or 
amend the Constitution or deal with constitutional questions 
seems increasingly to be restricted to one particular issue, which 
is the Senate. When it comes to the Senate we will not discuss 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1350"> 1350 </A></B>
<P>
the Constitution directly, indirectly or even hint at it, but 
everything else appears to be on the table.
<P>
	Since we are talking about the Constitution today, I will use 
this opportunity to discuss some of our concerns on the 
Constitution. I am sure some of my colleagues will do the same. 
I want specifically to discuss our position on the Senate and on 
some of the reforms that could be made to the Senate, 
particularly outside of the constitutional context.
<P>
	Of course, the House is well aware that our party supports a 
triple-E Senate. We believe the Senate should be elected, it 
should be fully effective, it should have full veto powers over 
legislation, and it should be equal. It should have equal 
representation from every province.
<P>
	This particular amendment attempts to update the 
Constitution, to recognize that things are different today from 
what they may have been in 1873. To substitute a bridge for a 
ferry seems reasonable. Why not then recognize that certain 
political and institutional realities are very different today from 
what they were in 1867?
<P>
	To recall our constitutional history, in 1867 the Fathers of 
Confederation established a parliamentary system consistent 
with the political theory of their time. That was the political 
theory dominant in the 18th and 19th centuries, a very different 
kind of theory from what we have today. They established a 
Parliament that would have three parts: the crown, and in 
particular two effective legislative chambers, the Senate and the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	This model was common and still is common in most of the 
world, particularly the anglo-American world. The United 
Kingdom has the House of Lords and the House of Commons. 
The United States has the Senate and the House of 
Representatives. Even in our own provinces at that time we 
generally had two legislative chambers. We had the legislative 
councils and the legislative assemblies. In all provinces the 
upper house has now disappeared, although traces of it remain in 
Prince Edward Island.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	An effective upper house in 1867 was one that was not 
elected. That is very different from the view we have today, a 
very different theory of representation, a very different theory of 
government. I will not get into that at great length.
<P>
	Suffice it to say that an upper house had several features in 
Canada and elsewhere. In particular the principal historic 
function of an upper house had been to represent the propertied 
classes. Under section 23 of the Constitution Act, 1867 there 
were important and the very high property qualifications for the 
time of $4,000 for membership in the Senate.
<P>
	There were also other important functions the Senate of 
Canada was designed to fulfil. It would be a chamber of sober 
second thought. In other words it would fulfil the function of 
checks and balances seen in many constitutional arrangements, 
not just in Canada but in other countries. Sober second thought 
was the term used. As I pointed out to some audiences the use of 
the term sober was probably not entirely accidental during the 
time of our founding prime minister.
<P>
	In that regard the Senate had important characteristics that 
reflected that function. Generally speaking it could not originate 
bills, certainly not money bills; they came and still do come 
from this Chamber. As a chamber of sober second thought the 
appointments were lifetime. People were selected. A very 
different kind of person was expected to sit in the Senate from 
those sitting in the Commons. We find that under section 29 of 
the Constitution Act, 1867.
<P>
	A third function of our Senate originated in recent history in 
the United States. That is the protection of the partners in the 
federation and their role in the federation.
<P>
	Certainly the Constitution of 1867 did not establish an equal 
Senate. I concede that. However it also certainly did not, 
explicitly did not, establish a Senate based on representation by 
population. It established a Senate where there would be three 
regions or what are called divisions under section 22. At the 
time that was a very good reflection of the regional balance of 
power within the country. The provinces of Ontario and Quebec 
which had been recreated by Confederation were constituted as 
regions and the two maritime provinces together were 
constituted as a region.
<P>
	Consistent with the theory that the Senate was not elected, 
unlike the United States the members were not appointed by 
provincial governments but were appointed by the cabinet, the 
executive. The cabinet or executive in that era was expected to 
be much more diverse in a partisan sense than we see today, 
much more diverse in a regional sense, and much more diverse 
in the sense of personality and importance of the various senior 
ministers.
<P>
	The original Senate was selected by a government in which 
party lines were not as clear as they are today. The government 
itself was constituted of people of different political persuasions 
and the Senate was picked in much the same way. That practice 
has of course changed a great deal.
<P>
	The Senate was intended to be and was a highly effective body 
in political terms. It had full legislative powers which remain in 
the Constitution Act today. It had real power in cabinet and in 
the legislative process. Five out of 13 or 30 per cent of the 
original cabinet ministers were senators. Today it is one out of 
30. It would shock many Canadians to learn today that two of our 
prime ministers came from the Senate. They held their prime 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1351"> 1351 </A></B>
<P>
ministership in the Senate rather than in the Commons. Of 
course in Britain it was quite common at  that time for a lord to 
be prime minister as well as a member of the Commons.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	Diversity and important political figures were present in the 
Senate at that time, right from the beginning. The principal 
Liberal leader of the day, George Brown, was appointed to the 
Senate after he failed to secure representation in the election of 
1867.
<P>
	Things have changed. Today we have a fuller and more 
democratic theory of government than we did in the past and 
effectiveness of the Senate, as with any other political body, 
requires that it be elected. This is not just a phenomenon of the 
Senate. I would point out that the House of Commons, as 
constituted in 1867, would not be remotely considered 
democratic today. We will talk on another occasion whether this 
House of Commons is effective and truly democratic. I will 
leave that to a later date.
<P>
	In 1867 members of the House of Commons were elected but 
only by property holders, only by those over 21 years of age, 
only by those who were male. In some provinces of Canada, in 
some parts of Canada and at certain times in our history, 
elections were restricted by racial considerations.
<P>
	We would never for a minute suggest that would be an 
appropriate way of choosing the House of Commons today or an 
appropriate composition for the House of Commons and so we 
have modernized it. We have modernized the House of 
Commons but not the Senate. Why have we done that? I will put 
it in very simple and blunt terms. We have modernized the 
House of Commons because it is the power centre of Ontario and 
Quebec. We have not modernized the Senate because it was 
intended to be the voice for the other regions that have not fared 
as well in Confederation.
<P>
	At the centre of this argument I would only point out to my 
constituents and to those who are watching today the Ontario 
and Quebec alliance that will shove through this particular 
constitutional amendment.
<P>
	It is interesting to see in this century what has happened to 
upper houses, not just in the anglo-American world but across 
the world. Those houses that were built mainly or almost 
exclusively on pre-democratic theory have atrophied or 
disappeared. I think, for example, of the House of Lords in 
Britain which still exists today but which has largely been 
stripped of its powers and exists, I suggest, as a relic of another 
era.
<P>
	In the case of our provinces, the legislative councils, the 
upper houses of the provinces, which really had an exclusive 
pre-democratic function, have entirely disappeared, the last 
being in Quebec in 1968.
<P>
	However, those houses built on the concept of regional 
representation within a federation have remained and by and 
large flourished as legislative chambers. The Senates in the 
United States and Australia have become elected bodies and 
have become very powerful.
<P>
	In the case of the Senate in the United States we know what 
happened there. The United States Senate was not originally 
elected but rather chosen by state legislatures. That manner of 
selection was gradually broadened and eventually some states 
began to have popular elections for their senators even before 
the constitutional amendment proclaiming such a thing had 
come to pass. The Senate was largely elected by the time that 
happened.
<P>
	In Canada the Senate has survived but its modernization has 
been slow. We have attempted to move along with the 
development of the theories but at a very slow pace. We have 
made no attempts in our history to increase the property 
requirement that defined the early Senate. It still exists on paper 
but $4,000 real property is now a modest requirement for many 
people.
<P>
	In 1915 we moved to recognize the west. After the west had 
been in Confederation for about 45 years we decided it was time 
to formally recognize the presence of the west in the regional 
chamber. Before that there had been a few senators appointed 
from various provinces now and again. In 1915 a fourth Senate 
division was created to recognize western Canada. Since then 
other representatives have been added in Newfoundland and in 
the territories.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	In 1965 we took the step of ending lifetime Senate 
appointments. We know there are very few lifers but this has 
been one particular reform.
<P>
	In 1989-90 we had the election of the first senator, the late 
Senator Stan Waters, a member of my party, a good personal 
friend of mine and a ground breaker, as we all had hoped. Just as 
in the United States, when Senator Waters was elected there 
were denials from those who opposed Senate election and 
regional representation, denials that this could happen, that it 
could not happen, that it was unconstitutional, that it was illegal. 
There were a million impediments.
<P>
	It is amazing how things can happen in this country, in any 
country, in any political system when people want them to 
happen. It is amazing how many excuses and roadblocks can be 
created when there is a desire to thwart the principle underlying 
the action.
<P>
	Today the minister, to my surprise, spoke about praising the 
P.E.I. bridge because it had been approved in a referendum. How 
many times since this House has reconvened have we heard the 
government speak against referendums and the danger 
presented in referendums? When the government has an agenda 
it wants to see go through, a referendum is possible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1352"> 1352 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I will certainly not be supporting this 
hypocritical amendment. I suspect that many of my party 
members feel the same way. I will not support a selective 
updating of our federation. I will not support a mentality that 
says some needs are to be addressed while other needs are to 
be laughed at or ignored, depending on crass political needs.
<P>
	Senate reform is important. It is a federalist solution to the 
kinds of regional problems that plague this country and I would 
suggest that in my region problems exist that are much more 
serious than some people here realize. Senate election, which I 
have spoken on specifically, is a partial solution that does not 
even require opening the Constitution in order to proceed. It 
only requires a basic sense of fairness. Without that sense of 
fairness do not expect the support of myself or my riding or the 
taxpayers I represent. Do not expect to keep coming to the 
trough to ask for these kinds of favours when our concerns on 
these matters are not taken seriously.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I would 
like to inform the House that from now on, pursuant to Standing 
Order 43(2), government members will split the 20-minute 
period provided for speeches into two 10-minute speeches, each 
followed by a 5-minute question and comment period.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the government 
whip. Resuming debate with the hon. Secretary of State for 
Veterans.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State (Veterans)):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to stand and support the 
constitutional amendment put forward by my hon. colleague 
from Cape Breton-East Richmond.
<P>
	This constitutional amendment will have a major effect in the 
province of Prince Edward Island. It will start to bring to an end 
a topic that has been discussed in the province for possibly over 
100 years.
<P>
	This is a permanent link to the mainland. In the 1960s we even 
started the bulldozers rolling and started the approaches to the 
fixed link or the causeway, as it was worded at that time. This 
resolution will clear one of the remaining hurdles to the 
Northumberland Strait bridge project.
<P>
	Government has made it clear during the election campaign 
and in the recent speech from the throne that putting Canadians 
back to work is the number one economic and social problem 
facing this country. The number one economic and social 
problem facing this country is jobs.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	We are committed to taking every step within our power to 
support job creation, stimulate economic activity and restore 
hope and confidence in the future for all Canadians.
<P>
	Nowhere is this more the case than in Atlantic Canada which 
has more than any other area of the country suffered too long 
from high levels of unemployment and despair.
<P>
	The House is aware that the building of this new bridge to 
Prince Edward Island will provide a welcome boost to the entire 
Atlantic economy in terms of job opportunity and increased 
business activity.
<P>
	Even more significant will be the long term benefits to the 
region and in particular to the province of Prince Edward Island. 
The bridge project represents a long range investment in 
transportation infrastructure which will almost certainly pay off 
in increased opportunity and in new business development for 
the region.
<P>
	The lack of a fixed and reliable link with the rest of Canada 
has long restricted the commercial and industrial activity in 
Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	Prince Edward Island premier Catherine Callbeck 
commenting on the issue said recently:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The entire course of P.E.I.'s history has revolved around its isolation from the 
mainland. The announcement that the fixed crossing will proceed will 
fundamentally alter the province's relationship with the rest of Canada. In my 
opinion, that change will be for the better.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Northumberland Strait bridge project will have an 
immediate significant impact on the economy of Atlantic 
Canada in general and in particular on Prince Edward Island. 
Building the bridge will create hundreds of direct jobs for each 
of the four years of construction and numerous indirect jobs 
throughout Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Under the terms of the contract between the federal 
government and the contractor over 90 per cent of the jobs will 
come from Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	In an area with high unemployment and needing the jobs, over 
90 per cent of the jobs will come from our region. This will 
provide a tremendous boost for employment throughout the 
region and will provide thousands of workers with gainful 
employment and an opportunity to practice and improve their 
job skills. This will give the tradespeople in Prince Edward 
Island an opportunity to improve their trade skills.
<P>
	Direct employment on this project tells only part of the story. 
The contract also specifies that some 70 per cent of the total 
procurement requirements will be obtained in the region. These 
requirements are massive. Thousands of tonnes of cement, 
reinforcing steel, cable, fabricated metal and manufactured 
components are needed as well as many other service 
requirements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1353"> 1353 </A></B>
<P>
	Given that the total project is in the area of $850 million the 
wages and procurement expenditures paid by the developer will 
inject more than half a billion dollars into the local economy 
in the next four years, the economy of the Atlantic region, one 
of the most depressed areas in Canada. This should be a good 
kick-start to the economy of Atlantic Canada, an economy that 
certainly needs a boost.
<P>
	The massive expenditure will also have a ripple effect into the 
retail and service sectors of Atlantic Canada and Prince Edward 
Island, providing new opportunities for expansion and job 
creation in those areas as well.
<P>
	Given the positive impact this project will have, it is not 
surprising that the majority of islanders support this project. 
One sector that will experience a significant boost will be the 
tourism industry in the province of Prince Edward Island.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	The tourism industry is absolutely essential to the economic 
health of Prince Edward Island. It represents a larger share of 
that province's gross domestic product than any other province 
in Canada.
<P>
	The effects of the permanent link on tourism have been 
carefully studied. It has been concluded that it would result in an 
increase of visitors from the first year of operation. Some 
figures indicate about 25 per cent. It will certainly draw tourists 
to look at this major construction project, this megaproject, 
while it is being built. It will also draw many tourists to Prince 
Edward Island and through Atlantic Canada after it is built. It 
will truly be something to see.
<P>
	An increase in tourists will have a tremendous and positive 
effect on the Prince Edward Island service industry such as 
accommodations, restaurants, entertainment, recreation, local 
crafts, manufacturing, and all other sectors of retail trade. It will 
encourage new investment in the Prince Edward Island 
hospitality infrastructure.
<P>
	Tourism is by no means the only industry that will benefit 
from this link. The availability of a reliable, faster and 
ultimately less costly link with the mainland will certainly make 
Prince Edward Island agriculture and fisheries industries more 
competitive and should help them broaden their markets. While 
the direct benefits may occur to the Atlantic region, it is true that 
the project represents a good deal for all of Atlantic Canada and 
all of Canada.
<P>
	The economic recovery that our government is working for 
must embrace all regions of the country if it is to be successful. 
By giving Atlantic Canadians a chance to go to work, to 
strengthen their transportation infrastructure and to create 
long-term economic opportunities we make the country 
stronger.
<P>
	The most effective way to reduce the escalation of and the 
need for social spending is to put people to work. That is exactly 
what the government plans to do; that is exactly what the project 
will do. It will give workers in Atlantic Canada the opportunity 
for jobs and help them with their trade skills. It will be a major 
boost to the tourism industry in Prince Edward Island. It will 
have a major effect on the Prince Edward Island transportation 
system because there will be no long waits at the ferries.
<P>
	The four years and over half a billion dollars that will be 
injected into the economy are badly needed, along with the link 
we have talked about in the province of Prince Edward Island for 
over 100 years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier my 
leader described to this House the position of our party 
concerning this link. In short, the hon. member from 
Lac-Saint-Jean said he understood the economic requirements 
the government party is faced with. He also noted that the 
concerned minister recognized he was bound by the referendum, 
where the will of the people was made known.
<P>
	With regard to the link we are talking about today, this 
13-kilometre bridge which is going to link Prince Edward Island 
to the mainland, everyone in this House, and especially the 
government party, maintains that this project should contribute 
to job creation and economic recovery, and we agree with that. 
However I would like to ask the previous speaker, in the absence 
of his minister, if there will be an unofficial guideline 
preventing Quebecers and Canadians from Central Canada, that 
is Ontario and Quebec, from working on this project, something 
similar to the official policy concerning the Hibernia project, in 
Newfoundland. We know that Quebecers are systematically 
excluded from this project. On behalf of Quebecers in particular 
and Canadians in general, I would like some further information 
on this issue. Will workforce mobility be hampered by some 
provision, legal or otherwise, concerning this project?
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacAulay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
his question. I am sure the minister is quite capable of speaking 
for himself. I am also sure that no project would be handled by 
public works that would indicate no one in Quebec or anywhere 
else would get a job.
<P>
	I have indicated that we come from an area of high 
unemployment, probably the highest in the country. We need 
jobs and this project provides jobs in our own area. The point is 
that we have the work force and we have the project. We would 
never exclude anybody. The jobs are in the area and the project 
is there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1354"> 1354 </A></B>
<P>
	I thank the hon. member's leader for his support for the 
project. When he comes to vacation in the province of Prince 
Edward Island he will find it much easier to get there in a 
number of years. He would be very welcome to go there to work 
on it or to go there to visit us.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the minister today for bringing this 
resolution to the floor of the House. It is a giant step forward for 
Prince Edward Island, for Atlantic Canada, and for all Canada. It 
takes Atlantic Canada into the 21st century. I am very proud to 
be part of the government that is bringing this resolution 
forward today.
<P>
	My riding of Cumberland-Colchester takes in the northern 
part of Nova Scotia and abuts the Prince Edward Island 
Northumberland Strait. I would like to ask a question of the hon. 
member who has just spoken. The current ferry that joins Prince 
Edward Island with Nova Scotia at Caribou and Wood Islands 
has been a means of transportation for our tourist industry from 
Nova Scotia for some time. I am wondering what effect there 
will be when this bridge is connected from Prince Edward Island 
to New Brunswick.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacAulay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from 
Cumberland-Colchester for raising an important point that 
certainly was an issue for me all during discussions on the fixed 
link. I mentioned that we would have approximately a 25 per 
cent increase in tourism. That means more traffic. Without a 
doubt we will have both the major infrastructure and the fixed 
link. We will also have the vitally important Wood 
Islands-Caribou ferry service.
<P>
	I am very pleased that section 14 indicates that Canada 
acknowledges the distinct and important role the Wood 
Islands-Caribou ferry service provides and recognizes that the 
construction and operation of the fixed link crossing in no way 
diminish the importance of this ferry service which is a vital link 
between Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is with great interest 
and pleasure that I rise to support the proposed constitutional 
amendment which will allow for the construction of a fixed 
crossing, that is a bridge joining Prince Edward Island and New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	We can understand that this project is of particular interest to 
the residents of Beauséjour, since one end of the bridge will be 
in their riding, more specifically in Cape Tourmentine. To have 
access to the bridge, people travelling from Nova Scotia will 
drive through Port Elgin to reach Cape Tormentine, whereas 
those coming from New Brunswick will go through Moncton, 
Shediac, Cap-Pelé, Port Elgin and Cape Tormentine. 
Consequently, people using this bridge will drive through our 
area.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	As the minister said, this is a major project the likes of which 
we have never seen in our region before. It is said to be an $840 
million initiative, over a period of three or four years.
<P>
	This project will of course create employment, probably 900 
to 1,000 jobs per year, for a few years. Mr. Speaker, I can tell you 
that my constituents are happy to see this project being 
approved, for the simple reason that, given the current situation 
in the province and in fact in all of Atlantic Canada, where the 
fishing industry is collapsing, especially as regards groundfish, 
any effort to stimulate employment is welcome and supported. 
People are particularly pleased because we are told, and in fact 
we know, that 96 per cent of workers will be from Atlantic 
Canada, which is not to say that workers from other regions will 
be excluded. You realize of course that people from our region 
will do their utmost to be hired for that project.
<P>
	We are also told that 70 per cent of supplies will be provided 
by contractors from Atlantic Canada. For that purpose, the 
economic commission for south eastern New Brunswick has 
hired one person, with the support of ACOA, the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities Agency, who will be responsible for 
providing local contractors with all the necessary information to 
offer their services.
<P>
	I followed the development of this project because the 
construction of such a bridge has been the subject of discussions 
for many years. In fact, an overpass as well as an access road 
were even built at the end of the fifties when there were already 
talks of building a fixed link between PEI and New Brunswick. 
Indeed, such an initiative has been discussed for a long time, to 
the point that people in our community were wondering if this 
was only a dream. It now seems that the dream will finally come 
true, and we certainly hope so.
<P>
	This project may have been in the offing for a long time, but it 
was also developed very cautiously. A series of public meetings 
were held to inform Atlantic Canada residents on the building 
techniques and to reassure those who had concerns about the 
environment. And I can tell you that a lot of people and groups 
did raise concerns about the environment. I want to say that my 
constituents and myself are also very concerned by this aspect.
<P>
	I do share that concern but, at the same time, I am confident, 
considering what I heard and all the studies which were done. 
The minister was not exaggerating when he said that all those 
studies could make a pile six feet high. Indeed, a lot of studies 
were done and those are public documents to which everyone 
can have access. So I am certain that all precautions have been 
taken to ensure that the environment will be protected.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1355"> 1355 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I also know that all work on the construction sites, on the New 
Brunswick side or on the Prince Edward Island side, will be 
governed by strict procedures, both on land and on the waters of 
Northumberland Strait.
<P>
	The workers will have to follow strict procedures supervised 
by a committee responsible for ensuring that all environmental 
precautions are taken. It is rather reassuring that the contractor 
and all subcontractors must control their procedures and respect 
the environment.
<P>
	Of course, even if we take every precaution, some groups 
might be affected, and I am thinking particularly of fishermen 
here. In order to give these groups some protection, especially 
fishermen, including those who fish for scallops and lobsters, 
who will be most affected, a committee has been set up to 
implement a compensation program. From the very beginning, 
that is what we have demanded, citizens, fishermen and local 
associations alike: that a compensation program be set up before 
work begins so that those people would be compensated for their 
losses if the fishery were damaged.
<P>
	Although the final mechanism has not yet been determined, a 
committee of fishermen, fishermen's association 
representatives and officials is studying this problem.
<P>
	When I spoke of lobster fishermen, the people of Cape 
Tormentine will be the most affected first because a way will 
have to be cleared across the strait where construction will go on 
and the fishermen of other communities away from Cape 
Tormentine, like Murray Corner, Aboiteau, Cap-Pelé, Shediac 
and up the Northumberland Strait to Cocagne, Buctouche and 
even as far as our area could feel the effects from the 
construction. I do not think that these effects will be 
considerable, at least I hope not, but if they were affected, we 
will certainly have a mechanism in place to compensate them.
<P>
	I spoke only of lobster fishermen, but there are also scallop 
fishermen, since scallop banks will be affected by this bridge 
construction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is a group that will be directly affected by the 
construction of this bridge. That group is the families of the 
ferry workers who will lose their jobs after construction of the 
bridge is completed. Right now there are over 400 workers and 
the bridge will provide about 60 or 70 jobs. I want to reassure 
those people and members of the House that every effort will be 
made to offer to those people directly affected a proper 
compensation and training package in order to minimize the 
effects of the loss of jobs when the bridge opens. I have been in 
communication with Marine Atlantic. It has started discussions 
with the unions to try to put a program in place to minimize 
those effects.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I certainly offer my assistance in any way to make sure that 
the jobs available once the bridge opens are offered to those 
ferry workers and to make sure that those unable to get a job 
receive a proper compensation package.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion I support this project. I support it because it will 
create jobs and give new impetus to the tourism industry. Of 
course, my colleague from Prince Edward Island just said that 
Prince Edward Island's tourism industry will develop as a result. 
I am pleased about that, but we in Beauséjour, by offering 
tourism facilities like the land of la Sagouine, which you know 
well, Arboiteau Park, which is now being developed, and other 
projects under consideration, will try to attract visitors either on 
their way to the island or on their way back. We will invite them 
to spend a few hours or a few days with us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I concur with the hon. member that we have given great 
consideration to minimizing the environmental effects and the 
disruption to our fisheries, to guarantee as much as possible that 
this project is of worthy consideration and is first class for this 
day and age.
<P>
	Having said that, when talking about retraining or providing 
job security for those who will be displaced, it has been brought 
to my attention during economic development discussions with 
municipalities in my riding that perhaps we could take our 
training programs to the job site. As these men and women are 
working on the new project they would be given the opportunity 
for upgrading in literacy and computer skills, those kinds of 
things that take them to the next job. Has the member given any 
consideration to this in manpower training programs?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud: </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her 
comments and question. Let me assure her that we will make 
every effort to ensure that all governmental programs, those of 
the local associations as well as those of the government itself, 
will be made available to the workers in order to encourage them 
and help them find a job both during the construction stage of 
the project and once the bridge is finished, through the 
opportunities that will be generated. Every effort will be made 
to ensure that this project brings about the maximum benefits 
possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with 
the amendment to the Constitution and the building of that 
bridge. I think it will promote tourism considerably. I have had 
the opportunity to visit Prince Edward Island; it is one of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1356"> 1356 </A></B>
<P>
most beautiful islands in the world, and I have seen a good many 
countries.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	But I question the job creation aspect of that project. In the 
medium term, it will certainly create jobs, but in the long term, 
there will job losses considering that each year some 400 
persons work on the ferry and in five years those 400 jobs will be 
reduced to about 50. Did he study that aspect of the issue? What 
alternative does he propose? Did he consult the unions?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know the Secretary of 
State for Parliamentary Affairs has found the 10-minute period 
too short. I simply want to remind him that the question and 
comments period is still shorter. Therefore we would appreciate 
a brief comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud: </B>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the members 
from the other side for supporting this amendment and also for 
supporting the project as a whole.
<P>
	Unfortunately, as the member mentioned, some of those now 
working for the ferry system, maybe I should say many of them, 
will not find a job on the bridge.
<P>
	As I mentioned during my speech, Marine Atlantic, the 
company which operates the ferry system, has already contacted 
the unions in order to find ways to minimize the impact of the 
bridge opening and help those people find other jobs.
<P>
	Of course, local communities and economic commissions are 
trying to develop tourism and that could create jobs for the ferry 
workers of today. But I can assure you that every effort will be 
made to help these people adapt to the new situation so that they 
can find other jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, even though 
we basically agree with the government, our comments in this 
House prove that its approach differs vastly from the one 
members on this side would use.
<P>
	Regardless of whether we support this project or not, we are 
concerned by its potential impact on the environment. It seems 
to me, at first glance anyway, that the government is not very 
well equipped at this point to answer the many questions and 
solve the numerous problems which might arise from the project 
in front of us.
<P>
	First of all, I must say that after listening this morning to the 
minister, I was rather shocked to hear that he had assumed, even 
before being aware of our position on the matter, that the 
Official Opposition would oppose this project, at least, that is 
the impression he gave in his argument. It is rather odd. I wonder 
how he came to the conclusion, even before we had a chance to 
express our views on the topic, even before the beginning of this 
debate, that we would oppose this project.
<P>
	He may have forgotten, or perhaps he never listened to the 
Official Opposition when we pledged to Canadians that equity 
and fairness in distribution would be the yardsticks by which we 
would measure proposals submitted to this House. The minister 
might have forgotten that, unless he just never was aware of it. 
Let us give him the benefit of the doubt, but let it be a lesson for 
him in the future. The minister should never again presume to 
think for the Official Opposition, especially given the fact that 
he seems to have enough trouble trying to understand the issues 
he is presenting to this House. He does not have all the answers, 
he has to do more work on these issues, and he should get on with 
it. The opposition will do its job, and the minister should do his.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I heard our friends 
opposite say they have the greatest respect for the results of a 
referendum held in Prince Edward Island that revealed that the 
citizens of this province were very interested in the project, 
were very much in favour of it and considered it a major step 
forward. I think respect for the will of the people as expressed in 
a referendum is very important, and I would remind our hon. 
friends opposite that this should apply to all referendums that 
may be held in this country and that may have important 
consequences for the future of its communities.
<P>
	My own major concern is for the environment. I understand 
the reasons for the project, and I support it, and I understand 
what it means to the people of Prince Edward Island, but I have 
some very real reservations, especially in connection with the 
issue of ice formation. I am not an expert, but I am told that a 
major accumulation of ice near the bridge at certain times of the 
year might alter the ecology of the area and possibly have a 
major impact on the fisheries. I believe the government has 
recognized this by providing, if I am not mistaken, a $10 million 
relief plan to help fishermen who work in the area make the 
transition to other work. This means the government is aware of 
a significant impact on the fisheries.
<P>
	I am one of those who are very concerned about this kind of 
situation, and I would have liked to see the environmental issues 
researched more thoroughly. I am concerned. I know that one 
case has already been brought before the courts. A number of 
rulings have been handed down, and the court has had a second 
chance to rule on the quality of the environmental studies. But I 
must say that a project of this scope, which may have a very 
significant impact-and one does not have to be an 
environmental expert to understand this-it seems to me that the 
whole environmental question should have been researched 
more carefully in order to get more answers and more 
clarification. I still have a number of questions about this 
project. There are definitely negative sides that will affect the 
future of a number of fishermen. There may be a negative impact 
on  climate and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1357"> 1357 </A></B>
<P>
perhaps on certain social aspects as well, as a result of these 
major changes.
<P>
	In any case, I think that instead of hurrying things along, the 
government should dig a little deeper and be in a position to give 
us better assurances that these issues have been given the 
attention they deserve. If there are any problems with this 
bridge, it will not be the people from Ontario or Ottawa, or 
Montreal or Vancouver who are affected, but local people, in an 
area that is economically fragile and has a low population 
density. Yes, a megaproject in this sector may have some very 
positive effects if the project is a good one, but it might also 
have a negative impact if we do not bother to look at all sides of 
the problem because we are in too much of a hurry to get this on 
the road.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	As for the environmental issues, I think they were disposed of 
a bit quickly. I have a feeling that we tried to meet this deadline 
by putting some pressure on the stakeholders. For the time 
being, what I want to do is register my concern in this respect.
<P>
	Financing is the biggest concern for this project. The cost of 
this bridge-which is clearly a megaproject-is estimated at 
$850 million. It would not be the first time that on a project of 
this magnitude, and for which we have no precedents, there 
would be cost overruns.
<P>
	Already, according to my information, a study by 
Wood-Gordon revealed, last year, that the cost could be about 
$1.3 billion. Today-faced with a rather innovative project for 
which experts have already said that the cost could be at least 50 
per cent higher-how can we say with any degree of certainty 
that the cost will be $850 million?
<P>
	I do not want to use this argument to block the project, but I 
am trying to point out to this House, the government and the hon. 
members on the other side, that it would not be the first time in 
this country that the cost of a megaproject balloons way beyond 
the government's initial estimates, and that the government is 
stuck with the deal and forced to pay, at taxpayers' expense, 
millions of dollars more to finish the project.
<P>
	I do not think that we can conclude this debate without the 
minister being present, and he is not in the House right now.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wish to remind hon. 
members that it is our tradition not to make any comments on the 
absence of a member. We all know that hon. members are very 
busy. I just wish to remind hon. members that they should not 
comment on the absence of another member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am willing not to 
mention the absence of the member but I would like to know if 
someone opposite can answer the questions that we are asking.
<P>
	If the issue is worth debating, it would be important to have a 
valid speaker to respond to these concerns. Let me remind you 
that the role of Parliament is really to allow members of 
Parliament to express opinions on projects.
<P>
	I think that the motion before us today is aimed at seeking the 
co-operation of the opposition parties. A number of speeches 
that were made until now are asking for that support. That 
support is being given, but-and this is important-the people 
responsible should at least try and respond to our concerns.
<P>
	I agree not to mention the absence or presence of a member, 
but I certainly wish, and I know I am complying with the 
Standing Orders, that someone could give us an answer and 
listen to us in order to be able to give details and explanations on 
this matter.
<P>
	Therefore, I will go back to the financing issue. It would not 
be the first time in this country that a project costs more than 
expected. How does the government intend to finance cost 
overruns, if any? I suppose that a responsible government has 
thought of something. If this is the case, I would like to know 
about it and we would like to know who will take over the 
responsibilities if the project is a disaster in terms of 
construction. It is important for us to know that.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will appreciate that there was a time when 
the financial situation of the government was sound and perhaps 
those questions were less important. But when the government 
is preparing to cut social programs and health care programs, or 
any other program for that matter, because money is tight, 
because our deficit is over $40 billion a year, we have reasons to 
be concerned with this issue at this point. Surely the government 
has thought of some way to overcome cost overruns, if any, and 
they have to explain what their intentions are.
<P>
	We are also concerned with maintenance. I did not come 
across any estimates in the documents made available to us. 
They probably exist, but I did not find them. I would like the 
government to answer the following: What are the estimated 
costs for the maintenance of this structure each year? Would the 
costs be paid for by the consortium that will be in charge of 
bridge management? Have any maximum costs been 
established? If the maintenance costs are higher than expected 
or if there are major problems, who will pay the tab? Will the 
government take some responsibility then or will the promoters 
deal with the unexpected costs and other potential risks? It 
would be important to know about that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1358"> 1358 </A></B>
<P>
	Although it is not the same type of structure, one knows that 
a bridge built over salt water is likely to be subjected to more 
damage than elsewhere. Therefore, the maintenance costs are 
likely to be proportionate to the  location of this bridge, to the 
fact that it is an extremely long bridge located, one has to admit, 
in an area with a very harsh climate, in the heart of the gulf 
of St. Lawrence and subject to significant weather and climatic 
variations. It would therefore be useful to be given all the 
information regarding the responsibility of the government 
with respect to maintenance costs or in case of possible major 
structural failure.
<P>
	These are matters which require some clarification. This 
project economically is so very important for this region. We 
must therefore ensure that it is a success in terms of both its 
construction and its operation.
<P>
	I know that my colleagues opposite agree that it must be a 
success. But it is not enough to say it. It is not enough to say that 
we want it to be a success in terms of its construction and its 
maintenance, to be a success in social an economic terms, to be a 
success for the company that will be in charge of its operation, 
also for the government which is going to be watching people 
coming and going and which, with this structure, is going to link 
an isolated province with the continent. We all want that project 
to be a success in all those respects, but again, it is not enough to 
just say so.
<P>
	The government must act in a responsible manner. It must 
give all the necessary explanations. It must look for every 
aspect, even the smallest one, which may be a problem or about 
which people may have concerns in order not to embark, once 
again, on an unending adventure which finally will result in all 
Canadian taxpayers paying for something which does not even 
work properly.
<P>
	A lot of questions have been left unanswered. I think it is for 
the House, during this debate, to answer them.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like the people mandated by the 
minister to answer all those questions. Like my colleague from 
Bourassa, I would like to express my concern over the possible 
job losses-nearly 400 jobs, roughly 350 jobs-that this project 
entails, since the bridge's operation will not require as many 
employees as a ferry service.
<P>
	I can understand why so many discussions were held with so 
many people. Before a company closes shop, there are always a 
lot of discussions between manpower centres, economic 
development corporations and other stakeholders, in order to 
find alternatives, retrain employees, etc. Such a situation results 
in a significant reduction of net employment in the area, where 
needs are great.
<P>
	There is no assurance that the people will easily adapt to the 
necessary social reorganization because of job losses following 
this negative change. Will the bridge create a positive spin-off 
in terms of job creation for the residents of the Island and of New 
Brunswick? Maybe. We hope for the best but it is far from sure 
and I see a lot of ill defined areas in the whole employment 
issue. The government would do well to look more closely into it 
in order to come up with better answers than it did up to now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a quick comment on the member's speech.
<P>
	First, there appears to be some confusion between him and the 
Leader of the Opposition on the environmental effects and the 
satisfaction on this. I trust that they will straighten out this 
apparent discrepancy.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that many of the questions which 
he wished to pose to the minister were in fact replied to in the 
minister's address. I do not know whether the hon. member was 
here at the time. Perhaps he was talking to a colleague. However, 
many of the questions that were raised were, as I understand it, 
from at least a failure to appreciate what the minister was 
saying.
<P>
	The hon. member mentions the absence of the minister. I 
would like to point out that almost immediately behind the 
minister sits his parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for 
St. Boniface. I believe it is important for all members to 
recognize the tremendous support that ministers receive from 
their parliamentary secretaries. These members accept 
additional responsibilities and do a tremendous job, particularly 
on detailed questions such as the one the member put.
<P>
	While I do not wish to build up the hon. member's 
performance to levels of high expectation, we fully expect all 
questions of this type to be very carefully analysed and dealt 
with by the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	I have a parliamentary secretary sitting just behind the 
member for St. Boniface and she is of immense help in debates 
such as this in dealing with questions. When she speaks on such 
questions I want it known, just as when the member for St. 
Boniface speaks on such questions, that these people are acting 
on behalf of the minister. In fact, quite often they speak more 
eloquently than ministers. We are very happy with the support 
that is given.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member will want to correct the impression 
given that somehow the parliamentary secretary is not able to 
handle the questions he put. I know full well that when the 
parliamentary secretary rises to speak we will have a detailed 
and careful analysis of the questions. The hon. member I am 
sure, being a man who is very fair in his approach in the House, 
will find the answers extremely acceptable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1359"> 1359 </A></B>
<P>
	It is important to point out that if at any particular moment the 
minister of public works happens to be out of the House we can 
rest assured that the presence of his parliamentary secretary 
backstops very well that absence. The same is true in my case. I 
was away from the House yesterday on business in Vancouver 
and I had absolutely no compunction in leaving everything 
related to my department in the hands of my parliamentary 
secretary who, as I mentioned before, is a person whose skills 
and ability I have high regard for.
<P>
	I trust the hon. member will recognize there are ministers in 
the House from time to time but we have full confidence in the 
ability of our parliamentary secretaries. If the hon. member was 
not here to hear the minister and thus had questions about what 
he did not hear, we would be-
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if I could ask the 
co-operation of the House on the issue of the absence and 
presence of members. As we all know the demands on 
everyone's time are of such a nature that all members are not 
able to be in the House at all times. I know we would want to 
extend that respect to one another.
<P>
	I believe the minister had concluded his remarks. I will now 
ask-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Does the hon. member for Roberval want to add something to 
the comments of the Minister of National Revenue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, when a cabinet 
member hears what he wants to hear, then there is certainly 
reason for concern.
<P>
	Remarks that were never part of my speech have just been 
attributed to me. I never said that the parliamentary secretary 
was unable to answer questions. Never. Is that what the minister 
understood? Such behaviour in the House on the part of a 
minister is cause for concern. I never said any such thing. But I 
did raise many questions to which the minister was unable to 
provide explanations in his speech.
<P>
	The Minister of National Revenue has just told us that the 
minister has answered all questions asked by the hon. member. 
Either the minister hears only what he wants to hear or we are 
facing a problem as far as interpretation or understanding is 
concerned. There is definitely a problem.
<P>
	My questions deserve answers. If the parliamentary secretary 
can answer them, he has only to rise and do so. That is why, 
considering how time is important in the House, I nevertheless 
spent 20 minutes to question a project in a reasonable, correct, 
appropriate and parliamentary manner. I do not want people to 
say that I agreed to a project when I really had reservations. I did 
agree to it but at the same time, I did ask for explanations from 
the minister. There is nothing wrong with that.  This is typical of 
debates in the House, and I would appreciate a more serious 
follow up, instead of having someone put words in my mouth.
<P>
	I cannot understand the minister's approach and, when I look 
at his answer, I wonder if he understands it himself.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the hon. member's 20 minutes and to the speech given 
by his leader.
<P>
	They acknowledge that this is an amendment to the 
Constitution and with glee seem to recognize the government's 
recognition of the referendum that occurred on the island and 
the importance of it.
<P>
	They seem to be setting this discussion up as a precedent for 
something. What I did not hear them speak about is the message 
the minister gave about the importance of this fixed link not 
only for the people of P.E.I. but for all Canadians.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member that if they are looking at 
this discussion today as a precedent for something, they should 
remember that it is important that things discussed in this House 
be for the benefit of all Canadians. I would suggest that some of 
the initiatives which the hon. member might be suggesting in the 
future will not be for the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	I believe that the direction of the party and its focus on 
solidifying Quebec may not be for the best of all Canadians, nor 
in fact for the benefit of all Quebecers. However I hesitate to 
speak on their behalf. I would like to recommend that to the 
member and have him remember that when the minister was 
speaking about the importance of this fixed link, he focused on 
the value for the whole country.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely flabbergasted. I 
can hardly respond to what the hon. member has just said, that 
is, that the results of a referendum on an issue which she 
considers of national interest should be binding but that those of 
a referendum held on an issue she does not consider to be of 
national interest should not have the same value nor should they 
concern this House in the same way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Paul):</B> True.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hear comments to 
the effect that this is true. That is quite serious. If, for the other 
side, respect of the democratic process-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We have to listen to this?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1360"> 1360 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Indeed, you do. If, for the other 
side, respect of the democratic process is important only when it 
suits their purpose, Mr. Speaker, then it is time they say so.
<P>
	I think that, in our country, the results of a democratic 
consultation should always be binding whatever the 
consequences. If, on the other side, there are members who think 
that the results of democratic consultation should not be binding 
when they do not serve their political interest, then I would urge 
them to discuss it with the Prime Minister. They seem to have a 
problem within their caucus. I am not sure the Prime Minister 
would be proud if he knew that his party members plan to apply 
referendum results only when they suit them. We take notice of 
that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for 
me to address this amendment, secure in the knowledge that the 
construction of the fixed link is part of the government's 
program. All that remains is passage of the resolution to amend 
the terms of the union between P.E.I. and the Dominion of 
Canada.
<P>
	I want to thank my colleague, the hon. member for Cape 
Breton-East Richmond, the minister of public works. He has 
been a longstanding advocate and promoter of Atlantic Canada 
and he earned the gratitude of the vast majority of P.E.I. 
residents with his strong support for the construction of the 
fixed link. I have been a supporter of the fixed link since day 
one, having voted for it in the plebiscite in 1988.
<P>
	For all members present, I would like to clarify a topic which 
has just been addressed by the hon. member for Roberval and 
two other members of the House. Prince Edward Island never 
had a referendum on the fixed link. Prince Edward Island had a 
plebiscite on the fixed link. There is a distinct difference 
between the two. A referendum is binding in law. A plebiscite is 
not binding.
<P>
	Premier Ghiz wanted to test how the people of Prince Edward 
Island felt about the construction of a fixed link. Therefore he 
called for a plebiscite. It was not binding on him to continue no 
matter what the result was. All he wanted to do was test public 
opinion to see whether he should go ahead. If the people of 
Prince Edward Island at that time had said they did not support 
the fixed link, he was prepared to endorse the voice of islanders 
and not proceed.
<P>
	There was never a referendum taken of the people of Prince 
Edward Island on the fixed link. If any member opposite or on 
this side believes it was the case, it never was.
<P>
	Since the House gave approval to the project last June 15 in 
Bill C-110, my decision to support the link has been reinforced. 
Even though link construction is really only in its infancy, one 
can feel a sense of hope and optimism permeating the island 
community. An official in the construction industry had said 
that the link is not just an economic boost, it is really the only 
game in town.
<P>
	I realize that on P.E.I. support for the link was not, is not and 
probably never will be unanimous. When the plebiscite was held 
in 1988 the results were 60 per cent to 40 per cent, 
approximately. Since then support has grown steadily. Recent 
estimates indicate that it now ranges in the area of 75 per cent to 
80 per cent in favour of the fixed link. Every effort was made to 
provide forums for legitimate opponents of the project to lay 
before the legislative committee their reasons for opposition.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	During the House of Commons legislative committee 
hearings last March we went to great lengths to promote a 
balance in witnesses between the proponents of the fixed link 
and the opponents of the project.
<P>
	Over 200 new members in the House did not participate in the 
debates of the 34th Parliament when we passed Bill C-110 
which enabled the project to proceed. When the legislation was 
enacted here we had already gone through the questions raised 
by the member for Roberval and other members. They are all in 
the records, whether in the legislative committee record or in the 
House debates of last March, May and June. Many of the 
questions being raised today have already been debated and 
answered to the best of our ability. If hon. members would like 
to read what transpired in the House when Bill C-110 dealing 
with the fixed link went through, they should do so.
<P>
	Today we are mainly concerned with amending the 
Constitution. The legislation to build a fixed link has already 
passed. I can understand the curiosity and the questions hon. 
members are coming up with today.
<P>
	As I said earlier, despite local opposition in some quarters 
support among islanders has continued to grow. We are here 
today to deal with the final legal obstacle, a court ordered 
constitutional amendment which would allow a fixed link, a 
bridge, to replace the steam service guaranteed in P.E.I.'s 
original terms of union. We were ordered to do this by Madam 
Justice Reed in a 1992 decision.
<P>
	I want to remind the House in the strongest possible terms that 
the Government of Prince Edward Island has already endorsed 
this amendment and has done so unanimously. The federal 
government, the Government of Prince Edward Island and the 
Government of New Brunswick have endorsed the project. In 
effect it is saying yes to Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Because of the inefficiencies of the present ferry system the 
project will allow the federal government to fulfil its 
responsibilities to provide an adequate 
transportation-communication service between P.E.I. and the 
mainland. The project will allow P.E.I. to share in the 
transportation vision which opened up other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1361"> 1361 </A></B>
<P>
parts of Canada to growth and development. The project is 
reflective of the spirit of our federal state.
<P>
	This is why I am happy to be here today to speak one more 
time in support of the project. The history of the idea and the 
development of the concept of a fixed link have been discussed 
at length and are matters of record. So too are the numerous 
debates and studies conducted in relation to the particular 
project. As I said earlier we went through the whole process last 
spring and early summer.
<P>
	Since this is the case I want to move to the primary purpose of 
the debate today, that is to amend P.E.I.'s terms of union, and put 
on record the original clause. The original terms of union state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Dominion Government shall assume and defray all the charges of the 
following services-efficient steam service for the conveyance of mails and 
passengers, to be established and maintained between the island and the mainland 
of the Dominion, winter and summer, thus placing the island in continuous 
communication with the Intercolonial Railroad and the railroad system of the 
Dominion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Today's amendment will provide a fixed crossing, a bridge, as 
a replacement for a steam service. As most hon. members know 
we do not have a railway system in P.E.I. any more. We are 
basically connecting our car-truck service to the roads and 
highways of the rest of Canada.
<P>
	It has taken over 120 years and over 90 studies to bring about a 
change that is already providing benefit to Atlantic Canada. In 
1988 the Government of P.E.I. crystallized the issue by holding 
a plebiscite. The positive results of the plebiscite provided the 
stimulus which brought the concept of the link to reality. The 
numerous studies and actions taken subsequent to the plebiscite 
have addressed the concerns of the people and the governments 
involved.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	It is time to recognize that the project makes immense good 
sense. It has united business and labour in Prince Edward Island. 
It has brought political opponents together in common cause. In 
the previous Parliament the Conservative government was 
basically sponsoring the legislation and the Liberal Party at the 
time joined with the government in supporting it.
<P>
	The organization, Islanders for a Better Tomorrow, 
spearheaded support for the link and deserve credit and 
recognition for its efforts. This group and all other link 
supporters believe the project is of tremendous importance to 
the future of P.E.I. and Atlantic Canada. It will provide an 
opportunity for P.E.I. to establish itself as a key player in a 
revitalized economy in Atlantic Canada. It will be an 
opportunity for our province to be recognized for other things 
than its small size, equalization payments and potatoes.
<P>
	The naysayers have raised questions about the environment, 
the fisheries and the ferry workers. The courts have ruled that all 
reasonable measures have been taken. Any potential adverse 
environmental effects of the specific bridge proposal were 
either insignificant or mitigable with known technology. In the 
fishery an agreement has already been reached which will 
provide compensation to fishermen for any disruption or loss of 
access during the construction period.
<P>
	Discussions for ferry worker compensation are under way. 
This booklet will tell us exactly what moves we are making 
toward the ferry workers on retraining, job opportunities, early 
retirement and so on. That will all be developed over the next 
number of years to address the concerns of the ferry workers, 
which is a very important aspect of the whole discussion.
<P>
	The scales are heavily weighed on the positive pro-link side. 
Economic activity will grow. It will grow during the 
construction period and it will grow in the years afterward. The 
link will generate experience and create jobs. P.E.I. has a 
desperate need for jobs.
<P>
	This is the biggest infrastructure program ever undertaken in 
Atlantic Canada. There will never be an opportunity as great as 
the one we now have. It is time to get on with it.
<P>
	In that vein I want to close with a quote from Rob Matthews, 
business editor of the Halifax <I>Chronicle Herald</I> and the <I>Mail 
Star</I>, in his column of February 4. In part he said: ``The issues 
have already been studied sufficiently for elected and appointed 
officials to decide the crossing was worth while politically, 
economically and environmentally. There must be an end to 
discussions at some reasonable point. Sadly valuable projects 
are often beset by those who want the process to deliver only 
their solution or, failing that, another process that will. 
Entrepreneurs and governments have come to understand that 
someone will object to almost any construction project. These 
days there is no single body of opinion on anything. It is much 
the same with public assessments in which the same few voices 
and personalities vie for the spotlight, unwilling to accept 
reality or unable to comprehend that action not paralysis brings 
jobs and development. There are great benefits ahead as a result 
of the fixed link. The sooner we can attain them the better''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
gave his definition of referendum and plebiscite and he 
underlined that since, in this case, it was only a plebiscite, its 
results were not binding on the government, which decided 
nonetheless, as we can see today, to respect the will of the people 
and go ahead with the project.
<P>
	I also wanted to talk about traffic. Having travelled several 
times to Prince Edward Island, I can say that the bridge will no 
doubt have the effect of increasing car traffic on the island. 
Everybody knows that to go to the  Magdalen Islands, one has to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1362"> 1362 </A></B>
<P>
drive across Prince Edward Island to take the ferry at Souris. 
Does the hon. member know about studies on increased traffic 
that could alleviate our concerns about delays on the way to the 
Magdalen Islands? Can he comment on that?
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McGuire:</B> Mr. Speaker, in reference to the hon. 
member's question about a plebiscite, the federal government 
was in no way, shape or form involved in it. The plebiscite was 
strictly within the province of P.E.I. It was held to give the 
government, under Premier Ghiz at that time, an indication of 
what the islanders felt about a fixed link to the mainland. It had 
nothing to do with the federal government. The federal 
government was not even remotely involved with the project at 
that time. It was merely a sampling of public opinion as to what 
islanders actually felt about the fixed link.
<P>
	As far as getting to Magdalen Island, which is part of the 
beautiful province of Quebec, I would think a fixed link would 
make it a lot easier. The member would not have to wait at Cape 
Tormentine for any length of time. He could simply drive up, 
drive over the bridge, continue on his way to Surrey and catch 
the ferry to Magdalen Island. He would be able to spend more 
time there once the fixed link was built.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be very brief. I have a question of clarification 
for the member for Egmont who just spoke.
<P>
	I visited his constituency on several occasions. I find it to be a 
very beautiful part of our country. I am slightly envious of him 
in representing that constituency. I know he would be of my 
constituency as well. I invite him to visit any time he wishes to 
do so.
<P>
	I have two points of clarification. The first has to do with the 
plebiscite. Could the member confirm my recollection that 
when the plebiscite was held the question implied that perhaps 
the fixed link could be a safe underground tunnel as much as it 
could be the construction of a bridge?
<P>
	Second, I heard him say in his speech that the constitutional 
amendment we are discussing today has been dealt with in the 
Prince Edward Island legislature. I was not aware of that. Could 
the member clarify if the amendment has been dealt with in the 
Prince Edward Island legislature, including the parts about tolls 
and possible privatization of the structure?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McGuire:</B> Mr. Speaker, I invite the hon. member to 
revisit Prince Edward Island any time, and all members of the 
House. It is the best place one could possibly visit in the 
summertime. I would not want to visit the hon. member's riding 
in the wintertime either so I do not expect him to come to Prince 
Edward Island.
<P>
	The question on the plebiscite did not include any options. 
The tunnel was never on the ballot as an option. It was strictly: 
``Are you in favour of a fixed link?'' The people who were 
bidding for the fixed link considered in the development of a 
proposal the option of a tunnel. I think they found only one 
bidder who actually went into the matter of the tunnel to any 
great depth. Even that company felt it was much too expensive 
to continue any further exploration of that option and that the 
most economic option was the bridge option.
<P>
	It was not considered at all on the plebiscite. The people who 
did look into it on the construction side and the bidder side felt 
there were many environmental problems with the tunnel. It was 
not an economically viable option.
<P>
	On the member's second question, the provincial legislature 
last spring passed a unanimous resolution endorsing the 
constitutional amendment to the terms of union between P.E.I. 
and the Dominion of Canada. That has already gone through its 
legislature. It is a resolution only. It was directed, as we are 
directed today by Madam Justice Reed, that this had to happen 
before the bridge could be legally used in place of a ferry 
system.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a very great 
privilege to join in this debate today. It is a particular privilege 
to follow the hon. member for Egmont who for such a long time 
has been an advocate in this House for all of the interests of his 
home province of Prince Edward Island. He has been such an 
advocate for the establishment of the fixed link.
<P>
	Before I continue, Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate 
you on your appointment. It is a delight to have you in the chair. 
I am sure you will prosper there with all of us to be your sheep, 
shall I say.
<P>
	With regard to this debate, in the more than five years I have 
been privileged to be a member of this House representing a 
riding in Atlantic Canada, I have stood countless times and 
spoken on matters of great and indeed of crucial interest to the 
people of our region. Frequently we have looked at the 
possibilities of development for employment, development to 
create a better climate for business, development in the area of 
natural resources and so on and so forth. We have met walls 
because of our small population. We have met difficulties 
because of the problem of distances, as in every region of this 
country, et cetera.
<P>
	It is with particular gratification that I stand today to speak in 
support of the constitutional amendment to enable the building 
of the fixed link crossing between New Brunswick and Prince 
Edward Island.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1363"> 1363 </A></B>
<P>
	There are many reasons that this fixed link is a superb idea. 
Members much more involved from the provinces of Prince 
Edward Island and New Brunswick have articulated these ideas, 
but I would like to talk just about one area where I see the fixed 
link making a difference. It was very interesting that a member 
questioned my colleague from Egmont about the traffic and 
about getting to Iles-de-la-Madeleine, which is the area I want 
to talk about.
<P>
	In spite of all of the setbacks and drawbacks in Atlantic 
Canada, we think we really are the most fortunate people in the 
country. If one is fortunate enough to live in Atlantic Canada, 
particularly in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island is normally 
the vacation place of choice. I must say New Brunswick is also, 
but we like to go to P.E.I. for the beaches, the wonderful golf 
courses, the great food, the terrific restaurants, and on and on.
<P>
	I have been visiting Prince Edward Island as a tourist since I 
was a small child. I have jokingly referred to the fixed link from 
time to time as the span of Green Gables. That reminds us why 
young women in this country consider a visit to Prince Edward 
Island to be practically a religious experience: the shrine of 
Anne of Green Gables and that great Canadian writer, and 
feminist I might add, Lucy Maud Montgomery.
<P>
	I have spent many hours as a child, as an adolescent and as an 
adult sitting in a car, usually at Cape Tormentine, waiting for a 
ferry. I remember one particular visit at this time of year. When 
Joe says he does not want to go to the Battlefords in February he 
is probably right. However, getting to P.E.I. in February can be 
quite something too when one is dependent upon the mercy of 
the ferry in the Northumberland Strait when the ice is in.
<P>
	There was a meeting. It was the kick-off to a very famous 
political campaign. The Atlantic provinces student Liberals 
were meeting in Charlottetown in 1968 to decide whose students 
would support the leadership of a great political party. A group 
of us from Halifax headed out for Tormentine. Given that it was 
February we did pretty well. We arrived there in about four 
hours from Halifax. We then waited for six hours until the old 
<I>Abegweit</I> could get into the dock. We got on the <I>Abegweit</I>. I 
think normally it takes about 45 minutes to cross in good 
weather, but seven and a half hours later we landed in P.E.I. It is 
one thing when it is a group of students. We had a good time on 
that ferry.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I suspect you did.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Yes, we did. We really did not mind a whole lot 
the almost seven hour extension of the trip.
<P>
	I remember we were met on that illustrious morning by one of 
Prince Edward Island's most famous sons. I refer to Premier 
Alec Campbell as he then was and who today is Mr. Justice 
Campbell of the island's supreme court. Premier Campbell was 
not very happy on that day. He knew the ferry had been frozen in 
the middle of the  strait for over seven hours. He took the 
opportunity to make a public speech right there and he got a 
good crowd, as island politicians usually do. He spoke about the 
fact that the ferry really did not fulfil the constitutional 
agreement to create a proper link and a proper mode of 
transportation to and from Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	That happened 26 years ago this month. I remember it very 
well. Consequently most of my subsequent trips to Prince 
Edward Island have been by air or in the summertime, but I have 
never forgotten the passion with which Premier Campbell 
addressed this issue.
<P>
	I discussed this issue on many occasions because, as the 
member for Egmont can tell you, I was not a total convert to the 
concept in the beginning. The member for Egmont, the 
Secretary of State for Veterans, two other premiers of Prince 
Edward Island, Premier Callbeck and former Premier Ghiz, and 
the present member for Malpeque have all had a part in 
convincing me that this is absolutely the right thing, not just for 
the people of Prince Edward Island, not just for the people of 
Atlantic Canada but for the people of Canada. It will create the 
access we need and deserve to get to the cradle of Confederation, 
one of Canada's unique beauty spots.
<P>
	Members who have been here for any length of time know and 
new members will learn very soon that being members of 
Parliament gives us a very privileged sense of the country as a 
whole, as a unit from sea to sea to sea.
<P>
	To go to Charlottetown and see where the fathers, sent by the 
mothers, of Confederation first met to discuss what would 
happen in 1867 gives one a very particular and very warm view 
of what the politicians of the day were struggling over, arguing 
over, negotiating and deciding to do for Canadians then and now. 
Young Canadians from the other nine provinces would benefit 
from visiting, seeing and spending time in the cradle of 
Confederation. I agree that we would all benefit, young people 
in particular, from seeing all the parts of this magnificent 
country.
<P>
	Tourism is one of Prince Edward Island's major industries and 
we certainly do not see people staying away because of the 
ferries. However, as we enter a more modern age heading toward 
the year 2000 it is only sensible to ensure that access to that 
province be done in the most sensible, safest and time saving 
way. That is why those of us in this House from the province of 
Nova Scotia stand in great support of our colleagues from Prince 
Edward Island and in great support of our colleagues from New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	Another thing I would like to bring to the attention of the 
House is the fact that this fixed link is going to create an 
incredible number of jobs. In the provinces of Prince Edward 
Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the creation of jobs is 
something every one of us is committed to and I can only say it is 
with an almost spiritual fervour. We do not like to be considered 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1364"> 1364 </A></B>
<P>
the  poor relations of Confederation. We do not like to be called 
the have not provinces.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	This fixed link will create an economic boom and an 
advantage to business and tourism. I am in favour and I say three 
cheers for those who decided to go ahead with the fixed link.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my colleague, the hon. member from 
Nova Scotia.
<P>
	As the member for Central Nova, the issue of the fixed link is 
one of major concern in my riding. It is recognized that the 
Northumberland bridge, the fixed link to Prince Edward Island, 
is a link to economic opportunity and progress for Prince 
Edward Island and all of Atlantic Canada. This link will create 
job opportunities for Atlantic Canadians throughout 
construction of the bridge and maintenance thereafter. It will 
create opportunity for tourism and economic progress.
<P>
	However in my riding of Central Nova some concerns have 
been expressed regarding competition between the fixed link at 
one end of the island and the ferry service at the other end. The 
employees of the ferry service rely upon this means for 
commercial and domestic transport and for carrying tourists 
from Caribou to Wood Islands. The shipbuilding industry and 
Steelworkers of America Union rely upon the building of new 
ferries and the maintenance of those existing for their 
livelihood.
<P>
	I wish to reassure the people of Central Nova that the 
competing interests between one end of the island and the other 
and competing interests between New Brunswick and Nova 
Scotia along with the competing interests of construction 
workers, ferry workers and shipbuilders can be very readily 
reconciled.
<P>
	The fixed link will create employment opportunity as well as 
tourism opportunity for all of us in Atlantic Canada. It will in no 
way diminish the importance of the ferry service running 
between Wood Islands and Caribou. The continuation and 
upgrading of the ferry service between Caribou and Wood 
Islands will create opportunities for tourism and economic 
progress in Central Nova and for the province of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	Therefore on behalf of the people of Central Nova I support 
the motion put forward this morning by the hon. minister of 
public works. I thank my learned colleague for her comments.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. 
member from that great riding of Central Nova which for the 
first time in many years boasts a member from the Liberal Party. 
I congratulate her on her election and on her comments this 
morning.
<P>
	In talking about the benefits of the fixed link to tourism I was 
remiss in not particularly mentioning the Caribou-Wood Islands 
service. It is essentially a summertime service and is also a great 
boon to tourism. The ferries on that line are built in the shipyard 
in Pictou county and all of us want nothing more than to see this 
line continue. It too is a wonderful way to travel between Prince 
Edward Island and Nova Scotia to get the benefits of two of the 
most beautiful places on earth, that is Prince Edward Island and 
Pictou county.
<P>
	I know when the hon. member speaks with her passionate 
devotion to the people of her area they can be assured of the 
safety of that line and the continued interest in both the use of 
that line for tourism and business. The two access points to 
Prince Edward Island, to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia can 
work very well together in harmony and to the benefit of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, in May 
1873 the government of Sir John A. Macdonald passed an act 
admitting Prince Edward Island to Confederation. A month later 
his cabinet approved an order in council which also promised 
the ``efficient steam service for the conveyance of mails and 
passengers to be established and maintained thus placing the 
island in continuous communication with the intercolonial 
railway and the railway system of the Dominion''.
<P>
	The provision of that order in council has now become part of 
our present day Constitution. The promise has been kept for 121 
years. Today it is the intention of both the federal government 
and that of Prince Edward Island to change the wording of the 
clause but not the promise itself, thus committing the federal 
government to a fixed link instead of a ferry service.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	At the outset I want the House to note the intention of our 
forefathers. Their intent was obvious. They were clearly 
intending to obligate the federal government to keep the island 
in continuous communication with the mainland. The mode of 
transportation by ferry was also specified and the federal 
government wishes to confirm that same intention. However, 
today it wants to specify a different mode of transportation.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada does not wish to argue that a 
bridge would not be beneficial to Prince Edward Island. 
Common assent to the plan has been given by provincial 
plebiscite and resolution.
<P>
	The fixed link has weathered protests by environmentalists 
and engineers who argue that the bridge will be unhealthy or 
unsafe. It has endured bad press, public dispute and court 
challenges and now all that remains is to change this clause. No 
one argues that the bridge will mean more prosperity for the 
maritimes and increased economic development for Prince 
Edward Island in particular.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1365"> 1365 </A></B>
<P>
	The principle of a bridge replacing a ferry is not the substance 
of our complaint today. The Reform Party wants nothing but 
increased prosperity for all of the maritime provinces. However, 
the federal cabinet should not pass an Order in Council today to 
change this clause. To alter it today requires an amendment to 
the Constitution, that document foundational to our nation, the 
instrument which defines our political system and, more 
specifically, defines the nature of the relationship between 
provinces and the federal government.
<P>
	I address two different audiences today. To the audience in 
Prince Edward Island, I understand why it needs this bridge or 
why it wants it. It will be good for that province and I think there 
is widespread public support in Canada for the bridge.
<P>
	To my second audience, the Government of Canada, what it is 
attempting to do in this House today is both incorrect and 
unwise. Allow me to explain what I mean.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is proceeding under section 43 of 
the Canadian Constitution which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An amendment to the Constitution of Canada in relation to any provision that 
applies to one or more, but not all, provinces-may be made by proclamation 
issued by the Governor General.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The government assumes that it can safely proceed under this 
section because it also assumes that this issue relates only to the 
federal government and two or three provinces. Is this really the 
case? Could it be true that the provision of a fixed link to Prince 
Edward Island involves all the provinces of Canada, not only the 
maritime provinces? I submit that although this amendment 
does not apply directly to every province of Canada, it affects 
every province in an important and substantive way and 
therefore the government could be acting improperly.
<P>
	If changes are necessary at this time, it should proceed in a 
fairer and more conventional manner by way of section 38 of the 
Constitution, a section which at least attempts to involve the 
input of all Canadians.
<P>
	How are other provinces involved? This venture is a shared 
cost venture and these costs are not shared between just one 
province and the federal government. The subsidy which now 
operates the ferries is taken from the federal government's 
general revenue. Who contributes to the federal treasury, all 
provinces or just a few? All provinces are involved today in 
subsidizing Prince Edward Island's ferries and we are happy to 
do so.
<P>
	However, the estimated cost of the bridge, $850 million and 
climbing, will also be borne in some fashion by all members of 
the federation because the federal government will subsidize 
this bridge to the amount of $43 million per year for the next 35 
years. This is not an insignificant sum. This kind of significant 
commitment requires the approval of all Canadians.
<P>
	However, there is an additional problem. The government 
through a constitutional amendment will continue to commit 
itself not just to the fixed link but to the original intention of the 
clause written in 1873. That intent is to place the island in 
continuous communication with the mainland.
<P>
	What if problems are to develop? What if the bridge suffers 
cost overruns of more than 10 per cent? Another member 
indicated that it may double. Other projects around the world 
such as the tunnel under the English Channel or the Hibernia oil 
project nearby have experienced vast cost overruns. We all know 
the appalling record of past federal governments in this regard. 
We will be committed to a bridge no matter what problems 
occur.
<P>
	What if, God forbid, this bridge should collapse? The 
government will be constitutionally obligated to rebuild it. The 
question I am asking here is a serious one. By constitutional 
amendment all members of the federation will be committed to 
providing a fixed link with the mainland forever.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	If the bridge is rendered unusable for periods of time during 
the winter or encounters other major problems, the intent of the 
constitutional amendment will still stand. Continuous 
communication with the mainland will have to be maintained by 
the government. In other words, if the fixed link proves 
unworkable the government will still have to provide a ferry 
service.
<P>
	Speaking outside of constitutional law, the government could 
not allow an entire province to be cut off from the mainland for 
very long. A ferry would have to be provided if the bridge proves 
to be unreliable. If it comes to a disagreement and finally to law, 
the people of Prince Edward Island could demand a ferry service 
through the courts if necessary.
<P>
	The member for Lac-Saint-Jean noted the ambiguity between 
the French and English versions of this amendment earlier today 
when he mentioned that in one version it says they may and in 
the other it says they will. That is still unclear. It is a moot point. 
We will be obligated and in this case we will be obligated to this 
continuous communication.
<P>
	In that case the cost of this constant communication with the 
mainland would effectively double. This is a much greater 
commitment than the government would now have us believe. 
This is a significant commitment that every province in Canada 
deserves to address through a resolution under the current 
constitutional arrangements by each legislature under the 
authority of section 38 of the Constitution.
<P>
	Although it is clear to me that the government is acting 
incorrectly, perhaps unlawfully and certainly unwisely, I do not 
propose a legal remedy. Constitutional change should never be 
forced on the nation in the name of expediency. If the 
government insists on proceeding in this manner, there is a 
simple resolution which lies in the  decision of the Federal Court 
of Canada given in March of last year. Madam Justice Reed 
there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1366"> 1366 </A></B>
<P>
indicated that a discontinuance of the ferry service must be 
sanctioned by a constitutional amendment. We agree to that. She 
gave the House of Commons no direction as to the wording of 
that amendment in the form of a resolution.
<P>
	If the government must go ahead with this change, and I 
repeat many of us feel this is not the way to go about 
constitutional change, it should reword its resolution to reaffirm 
the constitutional intent to provide constant communication 
with the mainland but to despecify the mode of transportation 
required. To be very clear, the amendment would promise a 
continuous link with the mainland, period.
<P>
	In this way the government would have a free hand to choose 
the least expensive transportation option in the future while still 
carrying through with its plans for a bridge today.
<P>
	Here the Government of Canada would not be committing all 
provinces to provide a fixed link for all time and at any cost, and 
under no circumstances could Canada be legally obliged to 
provide a bridge and a ferry service at the same time.
<P>
	Although this legal argument is significant, it does not form 
the basis of our objection to this resolution. Our objection 
springs from a root that goes far deeper than a simple legal 
technicality. The Constitution of Canada defines the 
relationship between provinces and the federal government. The 
amending formula is the way to redefine or to change these 
relationships. If we redefine these relationships we must be 
careful to do so in a way that shows consideration for all parties. 
We show consideration to all parties in order to preserve good 
will between them. Countries are not built on technicalities. 
They are built on relationships. Those relationships, especially 
in this period of Canada's history, must be preserved at all costs 
or the federation is lost.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada envisions a better process for our 
nation, one that preserves national relationships and respects the 
wisdom of individual Canadians, one that provides popular 
ratification of constitutional change in a bottom-up process, not 
a top-down process like we are experiencing here again today, 
in which each concerned Canadian can participate in 
constitutional conventions and finally have their say through a 
referendum.
<P>
	This government is proceeding today just as it might have 50 
years ago when it would simply pass a resolution to ask Britain 
to change the BNA Act. This process is no longer acceptable to 
Canadians.
<P>
	I think of the case of the Roman Empire. At the start of every 
major undertaking they would pray to the god Janus. Janus was a 
two faced god who looked into both the past and the future. They 
hoped to be guided by this god who would say: ``These are the 
mistakes we made in the past and we will not repeat these as we 
try to guide our nation forward into the future''.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	That god passed into the history books along with the Roman 
Empire but we can learn from that concept. When it comes to 
constitutional change, if we ignore what we have gone through 
in the past few years as we plan for the future, we are making a 
serious mistake in the House of Commons.
<P>
	The Canadian voter is no longer tolerant of politicians who 
fall victim to what we describe as Ottawa fever as soon as they 
are elected. This disease results, as we have talked about before, 
in selective hearing, poor memory and the inability to discern 
the common sense of average Canadians. Ottawa fever killed 
both a government and a national party just a few months ago. 
Has this government learned from the mistakes of the 
Conservatives?
<P>
	I have a genuine fear that this House and this government are 
embarking on a legislative program, including these 
constitutional changes, that shows that they have the early 
symptoms of Ottawa fever.
<P>
	The finance minister talks about filling the loopholes and 
broadening the tax base in the upcoming budget. He puts a pretty 
spin on an ugly subject by saying that Canadians want to 
increase equity in the tax system, which is just another way of 
saying that the government wants more out of the taxpayers. 
This is at a time when taxpayers are pleading with the 
government to stop gouging them and start listening about 
cutting some expenses.
<P>
	On another issue, many voters, especially the voters of 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville, are demanding the right 
to recall MPs but their appeals fall on deaf ears. We cannot see 
any movement on this right to recall. Why is that? Why is it that 
no one is listening to that?
<P>
	Now we see this government promising also an ill-defined 
aboriginal self-government even after the Charlottetown accord 
was soundly rejected by Canadians. How is that possible?
<P>
	This government is running far ahead of the voters. It may 
even be in a different running lane, I am not sure. The House 
needs to stop pushing only the government's agenda and start 
pushing ahead with the people's agenda.
<P>
	Is it any wonder Canadians have a negative attitude toward 
governments in general? If the government will not listen to 
Canadians and cannot put its financial house in order, how will it 
possibly deal with wisdom regarding constitutional issues 
which form the foundation of that house?
<P>
	The Constitution has been the focus of much needless hurt in 
our nation. It started with the patriation in 1981, a unilateral 
action which caused the rancorous constitutional conferences of 
the mid-eighties. These led to the political disasters of Meech 
Lake and the Charlottetown accord. Out of them emerged the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1367"> 1367 </A></B>
<P>
Bloc Quebecois and a full-blown separatist movement that 
threatens to split our nation in two.
<P>
	Today, what do we find? Yet another amendment to the 
Constitution, virtually free of national debate, unfettered by 
consultation with anyone with Prince Edward Island, slipped 
under the noses of parliamentarians as if the last decade simply 
disappeared. It appears that the government has learned nothing 
from the mistakes of the past.
<P>
	Not only that, but the government conveniently ignores the 
voices of millions of other Canadians who have said through 
their votes and through other mechanisms that they are 
demanding other changes to the Constitution, changes that they 
say are at least as important, possibly more important, than 
these.
<P>
	We have long advocated changes like a reformed Senate, 
entrenched property rights over which there is already a lot of 
general national agreement, positive changes such as a 
constitutional ceiling on government spending, something that 
would ensure that undisciplined politicians could never again 
spend our children's inheritance.
<P>
	Last year the ousted Conservative Party barged ahead with a 
constitutional change for New Brunswick, just after that very 
change was rejected as part of the Charlottetown accord. Reform 
voted against it. Now we see this government forcing us to 
accept changes on behalf of Prince Edward Island. Reform once 
again rejects the process that ignores the cries of millions of 
other Canadians. This process should be a source of shame to 
this government.
<P>
	This small amendment is no small matter. It deals with an 
enormous principle. It brings back memories of how our 
Constitution has been mishandled over the past 15 years. The 
Reform Party of Canada opposes this amendment on three firm 
grounds. The first I went over at some length earlier in my 
presentation. It is simply unwise to glibly approve a permanent, 
unqualified commitment to the bridge.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	The second ground is that of consultation. To satisfy voters 
and preserve the relationships of the federation, the government 
should proceed in a way which allows input from every province 
and, through a referendum, every citizen.
<P>
	The third principle is that of common sense. It says: ``First 
things first. We ought not approach the House lightly on such 
weighty subjects. There are other important constitutional 
issues that could be and should be dealt with at the same time''.
<P>
	To sum up, the Reform Party would be very pleased if one day 
at the end of a proper consultative process the House dealt with a 
balanced package of positive, popular constitutional 
amendments that included perhaps a re-worded amendment for 
the benefit of Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	Today the Canadian people expect to participate in the most 
important decision that the House can make. It is foolhardy to 
push their patience once again regarding constitutional change.
<P>
	I would therefore ask the Prime Minister to reconsider the 
process by which this decision has been brought to the House. I 
urge all members to carefully distinguish expedient choices 
from choices that are motivated by a concern for the future, a 
search for wisdom and a love for your country.
<P>
	My concerns and the concerns of each of our constituencies 
deserve more of a hearing than a few short speeches given to a 
basically empty House.
<P>
	This is not mere housekeeping legislation we are considering. 
Any changes we make now become a permanent part of our 
Constitution. The obligations we shoulder today will weigh on 
our grandchildren a century from now. Surely this law should 
not be sandwiched between bills on excise taxes and port 
operations. This process trivializes the Constitution of Canada, 
the foundation of our nation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, just a comment then a 
brief question to my hon. colleague opposite.
<P>
	I did not hear the full extent of his remarks but I did pay 
particular attention to some of his wording. If I quote him 
incorrectly I hope that he will do the honourable thing and 
advise the House that I have done so.
<P>
	The hon. member made reference to this creeping into the 
House of Commons and somehow the guillotine will come down 
fairly soon on a decision which is of gargantuan importance to 
Canada, to the world and to other planets if you will. I am 
paraphrasing of course, but I understand the hon. member is new 
to the House. However new to the House does not give you the 
right to flagrantly abuse-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know the minister is a 
very experienced parliamentarian and that he would want to 
direct all of his comments through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was making my point 
through you to the hon. member, it does not give him the right to 
abuse flagrantly and selectively some of the discussions which 
took place in this Chamber not more than a year ago. He 
suggested in his remarks that somehow this evil thing that we 
put before Parliament today was concocted, if you will, in the 
back rooms. It has been around for five full years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1368"> 1368 </A></B>
<P>
	I cannot understand why the hon. member would try to give 
that impression to his constituents. Perhaps we might wish to 
have a recall of the hon. member's ability to remember all of the 
facts and all of the things that have gone on in this House.
<P>
	The question I have for the hon. member is the following. 
Does the hon. member not think it appropriate that the people of 
Prince Edward Island, who over 130 years ago decided that they 
would become a part of Confederation, have now determined 
through the most democratic way, namely a referendum, that 
they wish to amend those terms of reference which they 
consummated over 130 years ago? Is the hon. member saying to 
Canada's smallest province, to that group of individuals, that 
they no longer have that right as other Canadians in British 
Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and across this country have that 
right?
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Is the hon. member suggesting in a code that because one 
comes from a small province, because one comes from a small 
population base, one does not enjoy the rights that other 
provinces have? Is that not what the hon. member is suggesting?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was moved. I do not know what it 
is that the minister seems to get so apoplectic about every time I 
speak. This is the second time he has become so vociferous in 
his attack on me. I am not exactly sure why.
<P>
	If I could address the points he raised I will go through them 
and try to remember them all. He said that I should not use 
selective memory in my remarks concerning last year's 
discussions but that I should think back to the extensive 
discussions.
<P>
	What I was trying to emphasize during my presentation was 
that I have not forgotten the extensive consultations of last year. 
I have not forgotten that other members of the House, including 
every other party but-not the Bloc perhaps-the Reform Party 
of Canada were in favour of the Charlottetown accord. The 
Reform Party of Canada was in tune enough with the Canadian 
people to know they had rejected it wholeheartedly.
<P>
	I was not dissociating myself from that discussion. Of course, 
I remember that and so should the hon. minister. Of course we 
want all discussions to be out in the open. Of course we want 
things to be decided through a referendum. When it comes to 
recall, if the minister thinks I am nervous of being recalled I 
invite him and his government to bring forward recall 
legislation at the earliest possible moment and we will put it to 
the test. It will not happen here.
<P>
	It will happen first of all in Markham. I am convinced of that. 
As a matter of fact I expect thousands of people to come out to 
the rally tonight to determine that. If the minister wants to bring 
that kind of legislation forward, he will have widespread support 
on this side of the House. I am starting to get a little wound up 
myself but I  mentioned it clearly if the minister was listening to 
my speech.
<P>
	I am not opposed to the idea of a bridge. The bridge may be a 
wonderful idea but to cherry pick your way through the 
constitutional orchard picking a cherry here, a cherry there, with 
the government deciding what it wants to do even if it has no 
support among the Canadian people at large. If there is going to 
be constitutional change the people want to ratify it themselves. 
They proved that during the Charlottetown accord. They will not 
accept anything less. If the government wants to check on the 
pulse of the Canadian people, do not be afraid to go to a 
referendum. The people will give it the answers it requires. They 
may well approve this change. I hope they do but the process 
must remain, involving all Canadians. If it does not it has no 
support from the Reform Party. I believe it has no support 
among the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has a selective 
memory. He should realize and understand that to suggest this is 
cherry picking with regard to constitutional reform is utterly 
wrong.
<P>
	The Government of Canada, the Government of Prince 
Edward Island as well as the Government of New Brunswick 
signed a tripartite agreement. In order to consummate the 
agreement they duly signed after appropriate consultations with 
their constituents. After a referendum in the province of Prince 
Edward Island, the Federal Court of Canada stated it was 
necessary for that document to have full legal effect not only for 
the short term but for the long term to change constitutionally 
the terms of reference affecting the province of Prince Edward 
Island and the Government of Canada.
<P>
	It is quite one thing to stand in one's place and accuse the 
government of the day of cherry picking on constitutional 
reform when it is the exact opposite. The court is saying clearly 
and unequivocally, if you wish to give long-term legal effect to 
a binding agreement duly entered into in good faith by three 
separate parties, you should and must make a change in terms of 
the constitutional reference. That is the rationale.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	I am surprised that the hon. member, who is quite adept on his 
feet, would not be cognizant of that important fact. That is why 
today in this legislature, as some time ago in the legislature of 
P.E.I., this constitutional amendment had to be put forward in 
order to give legal and binding effect to an agreement duly 
entered into by three different provinces and the Government of 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1369"> 1369 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the minister mentioned that 
he did not listen to all the earlier speeches. Perhaps this is the 
part he forgot.
<P>
	I did mention that Madam Justice Reed's decision demands a 
constitutional change. I did not argue with that either. However, 
we are talking about process. Constitutional change affects all 
provinces and all Canadians when it is the foundational 
document that guides us. We cannot say it only affects Prince 
Edward Island. The federal government is obligated for $43 
million and change a year or maybe more. It involves all 
Canadians.
<P>
	It is why we have talked repeatedly of the need to approve 
constitutional change through a national binding referendum. I 
am not afraid of referendums. The government has talked 
several times about referendums and how it enjoyed the 
referendum process in P.E.I., how it was a positive process and 
how it involved people and how it has grown from 60 per cent 
support to 70 per cent support today. I applaud it and I applaud 
the people of Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	I am saying not to be afraid of consulting the Canadian people 
on constitutional matters. When you ask for their opinion they 
will give it to you as they did in the Charlottetown accord. They 
will give it again. If it is properly presented with a bottom up 
consultative process they will approve the necessary changes. 
They would probably approve this one. It is the process and the 
process is wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unlike most of the members opposite I have listened to today, 
both from the Bloc and from Reform, I would like to do 
something interesting and actually speak to the motion that is on 
the floor of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McGuire:</B> That is a good idea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not want to talk about the Senate. It might 
be a neat idea if we actually spoke to what the minister has put 
before the House, the actual motion that is up for debate and not 
hear threats from members of the Bloc about a referendum that 
is looming in their province and their opinion or use this, as has 
been done by several members of the Reform Party, to argue 
about the Senate and the need for constant, daily referendums.
<P>
	We had a very decisive referendum on October 25, 1993. The 
Canadian people spoke very clearly about the vision they have 
for this country. They spoke so clearly that the government has 
had to occupy some seats on the other side of the House. Let us 
not be under any illusion about the authority of this government 
and of its ability to act.
<P>
	I congratulate the minister for his cautious review of this 
project. It was very thorough as he explained the entire 
Northumberland Strait bridge. I applaud and congratulate him 
for the restraint he has shown in the face of comments from 
members opposite which have, quite frankly, been largely 
irrelevant and very much off the topic.
<P>
	I stand in my place today as a member of Parliament from 
Ontario, from the riding of London-Middlesex, to speak in 
favour of the motion. It is disappointing for me to hear members 
opposite, particularly the member for Calgary West who spoke 
earlier today, expressing very parochial views of regional 
self-interest. This is not a time for the narrow, petty objections 
we have heard so much today. It is a time to build this nation, not 
to tear it down. This is not an issue of the west versus Prince 
Edward Island or Atlantic Canada. This is a major project of 
national significance. Certainly it is going to benefit the 
province of Prince Edward Island and Atlantic Canada. If it 
benefits that part of Canada then we all benefit and I am proud to 
support it.
<P>
	As Liberals we are the only truly national party in the House at 
this time. Perhaps that is the reason there is a national 
perspective from this side and a very regional and limited 
perspective from the other side, be it from Bloc members or 
from Reform members.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	We have heard this silly argument that if we are prepared to 
reopen the Constitution in this matter then indeed we have to be 
ready to reopen the Constitution on any matter. To advance that 
in this House as a serious argument is highly ridiculous. This is a 
technical amendment to the Constitution. It was ordered by a 
judge in order to make the project possible. It is a far different 
situation from reopening the entire constitutional nightmare this 
country went through over the past several years.
<P>
	Frankly, my colleagues on the opposite side are making 
irrelevant comments or certainly are groping to hang their own 
particular hobby horse on this motion.
<P>
	I would like to speak to the motion as it is before us. The 
government has used a very open and transparent process to 
build this bridge. There have been massive public consultations. 
It has been one of the most democratic processes on a major 
decision to be made that this country has undergone, yet we are 
still hearing objections.
<P>
	There is a partnership in place with the private sector to build 
this particular project. The development company assumes the 
majority of the financial risks. The whole of the Canadian public 
will benefit from this particular project. The SCDI will own and 
operate the bridge for some 35 years. It speaks very much to the 
idea of partnership our government put forward in its red book 
which was so heartily endorsed by the Canadian people.
<P>
	The process has been very open. The theme is a partnership 
with the private sector. Obviously there are myriad economic 
benefits to be achieved by this project.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1370"> 1370 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian people voted for a government which 
recognized the need to create jobs in this country. That is what 
the message was in October 1993. This project will create a 
number of badly needed jobs. As was stated earlier by the 
minister there will be 3,500 jobs over three and a half years in 
the construction of the project. There will be another 2,000 
spin-off jobs once the project is built with fully 96 per cent of 
these new jobs to be filled by Atlantic Canadians.
<P>
	I could be parochial and strictly take care of the needs of 
southwestern Ontario or address them in my comments today. I 
do not think that is my role as a member of Parliament. We have 
heard too much of that petty approach to politics today in this 
House, not on this side I might add but from members opposite, 
unfortunately.
<P>
	We have to look at this as an important project to a part of our 
country which badly needs an economic boost. I am going to 
support it and I am pleased to see it will do so much for 
employment.
<P>
	The project will also show an increase in tourism of some 25 
per cent. One can readily understand the spin-offs in jobs that 
will create in the service sector as Canadians find it easier to get 
to Prince Edward Island. I have had the opportunity to visit that 
beautiful island as I hope have many other members and I intend 
to go back. It will be a pleasure to cross on the bridge.
<P>
	Concern has been expressed about the ferry workers and the 
loss of their jobs. This is a worry for all of us. I am pleased that 
the minister in tabling his statement has shown very clearly 
there will be fair treatment for the ferry workers. They will have 
the first choice for employment on the bridge project. There is a 
fair severance package to be put in place for the displaced 
workers. As we speak consultations are under way with the 
unions to make sure this takes place.
<P>
	We have heard some concerns raised about the environment. 
One of the few relevant comments from the other side addressed 
the issue of the environment. However it totally ignored the fact 
that a comprehensive environmental review has taken place to 
make sure this project is environmentally sound. In fact a 
federal judge ruled that the government has taken great care in 
meeting the criteria of the federal environmental review.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Frankly, there is no evidence whatsoever that there is any 
serious environmental concern with this project. In fact the over 
90 studies on the environmental aspect alone reached the 
opposite conclusion, that the project is environmentally sound 
and that it will have no significant impact on the environment.
<P>
	Of course that would include fishermen in the area. It has been 
acknowledged that fishermen in the area may lose an 
opportunity during construction to fish certain waters. 
Obviously they will. In recognition of this a $10 million 
compensation fund is to be established by the developer to 
compensate these very fishermen.
<P>
	Again the environmental review has clearly shown that the 
project is environmentally sound and there is to be 
compensation for the fishermen in the area whose livelihood 
will be affected.
<P>
	We heard about the engineering and safety concerns of this 
project. The bridge has been designed to the highest standards. It 
has a life span of 100 years before needing a major retrofit. It has 
been independently assessed by engineers and found to be very 
sound.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for London-Middlesex, I want 
to take a national view on this. I invite members from all sides of 
the House, particularly those members opposite, to rise above 
petty politics. Find some vision and courage and endorse this 
project which is nationally important for this country. Let us 
move forward to the 21st century with the vision that this is our 
nation, all of it, from coast to coast to coast and that is the way 
we have to look after it. Let us not try to set up one region against 
another.
<P>
	It would be nice to hear the members opposite speak to the 
motion with a little more national vision than what we have 
heard so far.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to address some comments to my hon. colleague 
opposite-he often refers to us as being opposite-and two 
questions.
<P>
	First of all, I found his preliminary remarks mean. He said: ``I 
for one will say something interesting''. It is too bad for the 
minister who, I feel, said interesting things, too bad for the 
Leader of the Official Opposition and too bad for the other 
speakers. It was indeed interesting. Congratulations.
<P>
	I would also like to express disagreement with what he said 
about the relevancy of our remarks, and I would like to remind 
him of the Constitution Act, 1791, which established the 
foundation for the system of parliamentary representation. The 
people who elected Reform Party members, or you or us in the 
Bloc Quebecois, know very well that the relevancy of the 
remarks we have to make in this House depends only on our 
opinion. On that point also I disagree with my hon. colleague.
<P>
	I would like to put a question to him. One of his colleagues 
spoke of a plebiscite in the case of Prince Edward Island, 
whereas the minister spoke of a referendum. With regard to the 
referendum, this is the term you used, and we used the term you 
brought into the debate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I call the 
hon. member for Terrebonne to order. I would simply remind all 
members that they should refrain from directly addressing other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1371"> 1371 </A></B>
<P>
members of the House and that they should put their questions 
and comments through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	My first question to the hon. member is this: Is it a plebiscite 
or a referendum that was held in Prince Edward Island?
<P>
	Is the hon. member's disappointment that great because we 
support this proposal? Would he like it better if we opposed it? 
He talks about petty politics and so on, and he seems deeply 
disappointed. I get the impression he feels that way because we 
support this proposal. I am right?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to answer the 
member's questions.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	First of all, if I might correct his comment, what I said was 
that as the minister did, I intended to speak to the motion and 
that I would find that to be an interesting process. I thought this 
House was all about the process of actually rising in our places 
and speaking to what was on the floor, without getting into some 
diatribe about some future referendum in Quebec which has 
very little, if anything, to do with what we are supposed to be 
speaking to here today. My earlier comments were that I would 
try to speak to the motion.
<P>
	As to the member's questions, I agree with him. I have heard 
the term plebiscite used in reference to the vote in Prince 
Edward Island and I have heard the term referendum. I am sure 
he knows some people believe that to be an argument of 
semantics, that the terms are interchangeable. There are others 
who would say no, there is a very real difference between a 
plebiscite and a referendum.
<P>
	My colleagues and friends from Prince Edward Island most 
often referred to the vote that was taken as a plebiscite. It was 60 
to 40 in favour of this project in 1988. Frankly I think it is a 
political science or semantics argument.
<P>
	As to my disappointment that the member asked me about, no, 
I was very pleased to hear the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition rise in his place today saying he would support the 
project. However, I heard Bloc members lecturing the minister 
about anticipated objections from the Bloc. I was in the House 
and heard the minister's statement. Not once did he make 
reference to members of any particular political party and what 
their views might be. He simply invited support from all 
members of the House and he hoped that he would not hear 
particular objections raised.
<P>
	We are a little tired on this side of these gratuitous lectures 
and irrelevant comments and that is the source of my 
disappointment. However, I am very pleased the Bloc has seen 
fit to support the motion. It would just be nice if those members 
would speak to it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Paul):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of the extremely positive aspects of the bridge over 
the Northumberland Strait is that it is one of the first and most 
important capital projects on which the federal government and 
the private sector will co-operate closely.
<P>
	Ten years ago, examples of this kind of co-operation in public 
works were extremely rare.
<P>
	For the public and in practice, the distinction between public 
sector and private sector projects was very clear. One presumed 
that public works like roads, sewers, energy production were 
carried out by governments and financed with tax revenues. This 
perception has changed entirely over the last few years.
<P>
	In all the industrialized world and at all levels of government, 
we see private companies and consortiums take on 
infrastructure work that was previously the preserve of the 
public sector.
<P>
	Conditions can change, but the basic principle is that the 
private sector makes the necessary financing arrangements and 
assumes most of the risks in exchange for the right to acquire or 
rent the facility and charge user fees.
<P>
	It is quite clear that Canadians are also changing their opinion 
on how we can modernize our infrastructure. According to a 
recent study by the Canadian Construction Association, for 
example, close to 58 per cent of Canadians agree that we should 
ask users of freeways to pay for the construction of a network 
which is financed by the private sector, instead of imposing a tax 
on gas or special levies.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	One of the main reasons for this changing attitude is the 
alarming debt burden all levels of government are faced with as 
well as the disgust more and more Canadians feel towards their 
government, which keeps increasing taxes to finance costly 
megaprojects. Yet we must renovate our infrastructure, 
especially in the transportation, communication and energy 
areas, if we want to remain competitive on the world market.
<P>
	That is why the principle behind letting the private sector 
finance and build much needed public facilities is becoming 
more and more interesting.
<P>
	Although Canadians generally support this principle, they do 
have some legitimate concerns about joint participation of the 
public and private sectors in infrastructure projects. The public 
wants to be sure it will not be asked to bail out ill-conceived and 
underfinanced projects. It wants to be sure that private 
contractors will meet environmental standards. It wants to make 
sure that the cost will not become prohibitive, once these 
facilities are put in the hands of the private sector. It wants to 
make sure that the decisions concerning co-operative projects 
are made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1372"> 1372 </A></B>
<P>
openly, in the best interests of the public and not only of the 
government's friends.
<P>
	Given these facts, the Northumberland Straight bridge project 
is of particular interest at this time. During the development of 
this project, public concerns were carefully considered. Thego-ahead was given only after a very open and public review. 
The deal was signed only after financial soundness was 
ascertained.
<P>
	Virtually all the risks associated with the construction and 
operation of the facility will be borne by the promoter. The fare 
structure and the appropriate fees will be carefully regulated 
through federal legislation. Our government is firmly 
committed to supporting the renewal of this country's 
infrastructure both in terms of job creation and in terms of 
enhancing our long term efficiency and competitiveness.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board, who is at the helm of our 
infrastructure program, publicly invited the private sector to 
take an active part in this initiative. With this new approach, I 
think that we have every reason to regard the fixed link project 
as an excellent model of joint venture implementation and 
public interest protection. This project has undergone an 
extremely stringent and comprehensive environmental 
assessment.
<P>
	Allow me, Mr. Speaker, to add a few words to what the 
minister said about how great the project is with regard to the 
environment. Much has been written on this issue. For the best 
part of the five years it took to develop the project, 
environmental considerations have been the primary concern of 
both the government and the promoter. Of course, this project 
has been subjected to the most thorough environmental 
assessment ever conducted on a project of this magnitude. In 
fact, 90 analyses were carried out, as the minister pointed out 
this morning, of the impact the bridge will have on the 
environment. Ten thousand people from both sides of the strait 
were consulted, and the discussions were very open and honest. 
The people have had many opportunities to speak on the 
requirements of the project during the 90 or so public hearings 
that were held.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The project meets all the technical and environmental 
requirements.
<P>
	Let me remind you, if I may, of the result of the last court 
challenge: the Federal Court concluded that the government's 
environmental assessment process had been much more 
thorough than required.
<P>
	I think that this project will be well received by the people for 
whom it is so very important that we pay close attention not only 
to the technical quality of construction but also to the protection 
of the environment.
<P>
	That is also why I am sure that this project will set new 
standards in terms of public consultation and care for the 
environment.
<P>
	I am especially pleased to notice that even if construction has 
already started, this crucial question will continue to be a central 
concern for the promoter as well as for the federal and provincial 
regulatory agencies.
<P>
	The contractor will have to follow a very strict environmental 
management and protection plan. The project will be 
continually monitored to ensure that it remains environment 
friendly.
<P>
	I fully support this project not only because it is a good thing, 
but also because it generates substantial economic activity as 
well as much needed jobs and, more important, it is environment 
friendly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
House of Commons is being called on today to approve or reject 
a government motion to amend the Constitution of Canada under 
section 43.
<P>
	This section enables the House of Commons and a particular 
province to amend the Constitution on various points which, in 
my opinion, are very diversified and wide-ranging. It would 
have been interesting if the Canadian government and the 
provinces had found enabling procedures for Quebec when it 
wanted to endorse the 1982 Constitution Act through the Meech 
Lake Accord, in order to become an equal partner.
<P>
	During this speech, if I may, I would like to go back to the 
Constitution, because that is what we are dealing with here, 
despite the fact that the Prime Minister does not want to talk 
about it any more. I would now like to raise some issues relating 
to Bill C-110, that passed third reading in September 1993.
<P>
	Some Islanders have been worried about the fixed or mobile 
link with Canada's mainland for many years, ever since Prince 
Edward Island joined Confederation. Others prefer to keep the 
island as it is and to lead quiet lives in the country of their 
ancestors.
<P>
	Our fellow citizens in Prince Edward Island wanted a link 
with the mainland so badly that they decided a few years ago to 
settle this issue in a plebiscite. This plebiscite, held in January 
1988, showed that a majority favoured the establishment of a 
fixed link between the Island and the mainland.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	No one in the government or the Official Opposition is against 
the will of the population. But let us not forget that this will is as 
valid for the people of Prince Edward Island as it is for those 
living on Vancouver Island, the Magdalen Islands and even 
Newfoundland, if bridge technology allowed it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1373"> 1373 </A></B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, there are prerequisites to the implementation 
and development of megaprojects. Allow me to point out five 
prerequisites I regard as essential. First, the projects must be 
carried out legally; second, we must have the necessary 
financial resources; third, the environment must be protected; 
fourth, this megaproject must benefit the population and help 
to create jobs; finally, we must ensure that all Canadian citizens 
can be treated the same way.
<P>
	I would like to see if the conditions I just listed are met by this 
project.
<P>
	As far as legality is concerned, as I was saying at the 
beginning of my speech, part of the population, in a plebiscite, 
authorized the Prince Edward Island provincial government to 
go ahead with the project. But the other side, brought together in 
the Friends of the Island Coalition, strongly objected to this 
project for different reasons. First, the dangers for the lobster 
and scallop fishery, migratory birds, the environment and the 
Islanders' tranquillity.
<P>
	We must not dismiss this group which opposes this project. It 
applied to the Federal Court, which issued an order requiring the 
Minister of Public Works to conduct an environmental 
assessment pursuant to section 12 of the Order in Council in 
relation to the developer's detailed construction plan, before 
making any final decisions which may have irreversible 
environmental consequences.
<P>
	On April 22, 1993, the specific environmental assessment 
prepared by Jacques Whitford Environment Consultants for 
Strait Crossing Inc., at Ottawa's request, was presented.
<P>
	Although this study shows that this project is not harmful to 
the environment, as we agree, the Friends of the Island do not 
accept the decision and have appealed. The Court of Appeal 
upheld the lower court's decision, which apparently means that 
the project is now legal, but we must raise questions about its 
morality. The opponents will watch everything the developers 
do as they carry out the project.
<P>
	Now let us talk about the financial resources. A few weeks 
ago, Canada's national debt passed the $500 billion mark, not 
counting provincial and municipal debt. I will be very brief in 
my financial evaluation. The federal government now pays 
Marine Atlantic around $21 million a year for the cost of the 
ferry service between Prince Edward Island and the mainland. 
The ferry service is adequate and fits in with the local 
environment very well.
<P>
	Several years ago, the federal government announced that it 
was considering building a fixed link under one main condition: 
that the costs not exceed the price of the ferry service for the 
same period. Yet, the federal government is about to give to the 
private sector an annual subsidy of $42 million, in 1992 dollars, 
for the construction and management of the bridge, over a 
period of 35 years. This represents close to $1.47 billion,  in 
constant dollars, for the whole duration of the contract. From 
that angle, no one can claim that the fixed link project is 
self-financing. Can Canada afford to spend $21 million a year, 
this on top of what it is already paying for the ferry service?
<P>
	We are not opposed to the principle that Prince Edward Island 
is entitled to a ferry service subsidized by all Canadian 
taxpayers. In fact, this commitment greatly facilitated things 
when PEI joined Confederation; it was an historic constitutional 
compromise.
<P>
	We do not oppose the fact that the federal government 
continues to fully respect this constitutional right, although I 
must point out that this same government was not as generous in 
the past when dealing with Quebec's historic constitutional 
rights. Remember what Mr. Trudeau did in 1982. It is because of 
episodes like this one that Quebec is irreversibly headed for 
sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Moving on to environmental concerns, in spite of all the 
studies conducted and the approval obtained from both the trial 
and appellate divisions of the Federal Court, there is no question 
that during construction and most likely afterward, the lobster 
and scallop fisheries will be disrupted because of the underwater 
movements resulting from the construction of a fixed link. The 
proof is that plans have been made to set aside $10 million every 
year to compensate the 240 fishermen affected by the 
construction of the bridge. We are only talking here about the 
construction phase. What will happen to the fishery once the 
fixed link is in operation? Will the government have to continue 
paying the $10 million in compensation? Are the fishermen 
supposed to rely on unemployment insurance to get by? Will 
they be joining the growing ranks of unemployed fishermen 
throughout the Maritimes and Quebec?
<P>
	I would now like to examine the issue of job creation and the 
benefits to be derived from this megaproject by the residents of 
Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. During the 
construction phase, more than $1 billion will be invested and 
normally, this should result in the creation of temporary jobs 
and bring about some semblance of prosperity.
<P>
	Initially, the project backer will have to bring in workers from 
across North America. This is the case with of all megaprojects. 
Since this is a pan-Canadian venture, we are counting on 
Quebec construction workers to figure prominently in bridge 
construction activities. Quebec workers-and there are many of 
them in my riding of Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans-are 
known for their skills and willingness to work on megaprojects. 
Need we remind people that Quebecers worked on some of the 
largest hydroelectric projects in North America, if not the entire 
world. I am confident that initially, the unemployment rates in 
both provinces affected will decline substantially. However, the 
question we need to ask is this: Does the Government of Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1374"> 1374 </A></B>
<P>
and do the  residents of Prince Edward Island and New 
Brunswick want temporary jobs?
<P>
	The municipal infrastructure program provides for the 
creation of temporary jobs across Canada, including the two 
provinces just mentioned, the aim being to get the economy 
going again. However, we cannot continue to let people dream, 
and then leave them to fend for themselves when the temporary 
jobs end. Creating temporary jobs causes no great harm, but 
eliminating permanent jobs is downright criminal.
<P>
	Currently Marine Atlantic employs 420 persons on a 
permanent basis. These jobs have been around since 1917. Upon 
completion of the bridge over the Northumberland Strait, there 
will be a net loss of 360 permanent jobs. The company will need 
only 60 people to operate the bridge. Of course this does not 
include all the jobs lost in the shipyards in the Maritimes and 
Quebec, including MIL Davie in Lauzon, which builds and 
repairs the ferries that connect Prince Edward Island with the 
continent. What are we going to do with these 360 people? 
Negotiate allowances? Invest in skills upgrading and relocation 
allowances, if necessary? That is a problem we will have to 
consider when we vote on this motion.
<P>
	I mentioned the loss of 360 jobs, but I did not mention the 
potential loss to the communities in Borden and Cape 
Tormentine which will see a significant drop in economic 
activity. A special development fund of up to $20 million will be 
created to help them. However, $20 million can provide relief 
only for a limited period of time. Then what will happen to these 
people? And this amount adds to government spending.
<P>
	A final criterion: fair treatment of all Canadians. As I see it, 
we have a mandate to be fair to the people we represent. 
Although the construction of this fixed link is financed partly by 
the private sector, the Government of Canada is committed to 
paying an annual contribution of $41.9 million in 1992 dollars, 
indexed for a period of 35 years, which, as I mentioned before, 
works out to a total of $1.47 billion.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	This subsidy enabled Strait Crossing Finance Inc. to obtain 
financing through a private bond issue worth $660 million. The 
bonds have a triple-A rating, the best guarantee that can be 
given to the banks. Furthermore, the government agrees not to 
retain from the subsidy money owing from debtor companies in 
the case of tax default, for instance, so that potential investors 
enjoy the same guarantees they would have in the case of 
government bonds.
<P>
	Once again, I would like hon. members to remember when 
they vote on this motion, that we were sent here by our 
constituents to ensure all citizens are treated fairly. If other 
provinces have a similar request, are we in a position to give 
them the same treatment? We do not have to amend the 
Constitution to have an ultra high speed train in the 
Quebec-Windsor corridor. One could  say the same about giving 
the Magdalen Islands a new ferry from MIL Davie Shipyards in 
Lévis. When these items are tabled in the House, we should be as 
open-minded as we are today about the bridge between Prince 
Edward Island and New Brunswick, and our decisions should 
always be based on the five principles I just described.
<P>
	I want to say that this House should always be very 
circumspect when deciding how taxpayers' money will be spent. 
I am convinced that partisan considerations are inappropriate 
when discussing projects that will be part of our legacy to future 
generations.
<P>
	As the Official Leader of the Opposition said this morning, 
the House of Commons should take into account the democratic 
choices made by people in a plebiscite or a referendum.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to say the Bloc Quebecois is 
always glad to talk about the Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wanted to thank my colleague for his speech. I have 
three questions to ask.
<P>
	If I understood correctly, my colleague was saying that it was 
a bad deal. Taking the $40 million or so which the ferries now 
cost and using that amount to build a bridge over a 35-year 
period and then not having any subsidy to pay afterward was a 
bad deal. That is what I understood. Let him correct me if I 
misunderstood; that is why I am asking the question.
<P>
	He also talked about ``temporary jobs''. Of course, when you 
build a bridge, work begins and then it is over. The jobs will not 
continue once the project is complete. But is it not true that there 
is still a possibility, a great possibility, I would add, of creating 
jobs in tourism, increasing trade and so on? Did my colleague 
forget to mention these jobs that no doubt will be created or does 
he believe that no other jobs will be created because of this new 
bridge?
<P>
	Finally, I find it interesting that my colleague, who in a way 
attacked the project, also said, ``Let us be open-minded, 
because when other projects come up, like one for the Magdalen 
Islands or others that might benefit Quebec, we should be 
generous''. Listen, I want to be generous with you, but I would 
like you to be generous in this case too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell the member 
for St. Boniface that I noted the three points. In the first one, he 
says that apparently I find it is a bad deal. I do not know if you 
were here at the beginning of my speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I was here and I listened.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> You were? Great.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1375"> 1375 </A></B>
<P>
	I said that I stand with my party; we are for the project, but 
I simply said that when it comes to megaprojects, we must be 
cautious and take some principles or prerequisites into account. 
I referred to the questioning and the whole process that had 
been followed before. I mentioned the environmental concerns 
of Friends of the Earth and others.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I am not against the project; I do not say that it 
is a bad deal. All I am saying is that we must be cautious about 
investing 1.47 billion in 1992 dollars in a difficult period like 
this. It is simply a message of caution that I was getting across. I 
am not against the project and neither is my party nor was my 
leader this morning.
<P>
	About the temporary jobs, it is the same reasoning as for the 
present infrastructure program. Once the street is paved or the 
sidewalk is built, there is nothing more to do. The street will not 
be repaved for years.
<P>
	What I said is that once the bridge is built, only 60 permanent 
jobs will be created to operate the bridge and the jobs of the 360 
ferry workers will be lost. You mention tourism development on 
Prince Edward Island and I agree with you that it-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would just like to 
remind the hon. member and all our colleagues in the House to 
avoid addressing one another directly and to go through the 
Chair, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was in full oratorical flight, 
since I am a passionate man, but you are right to call me to order.
<P>
	Yes, we agree that tourism will develop on Prince Edward 
Island as a result. The question is, given that it is an island, is the 
tourism structure limited by geography? I agree with the hon. 
member that there will be development, no argument on that 
point, but I was talking about the temporary jobs building the 
bridge.
<P>
	As for open-mindedness, I am sure that my colleague 
understood what I meant. When the time comes to discuss in this 
House or in committee the need for a high speed train between 
Quebec City and Windsor and to give the MIL Davie shipyard 
the contract to the Magdalen Island ferry, which will maintain 
10,000 direct and indirect jobs in the Quebec City region-we 
are talking about maintaining jobs. It is important to create jobs, 
but it is also important to maintain them. The Official 
Opposition has shown that it is not narrow minded. It has shown 
openness and I am sure that hon. members opposite will show 
the same openness when the time comes to discuss the two 
issues that I mentioned, the high speed train and the ferry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Just a 
point of clarification, Mr. Speaker. I think that you can count on 
the Liberal Party to be very open minded. Open mindedness has 
always characterized our party and I believe it will still be the 
case in the future.
<P>
	If I am not mistaken, my colleague said he was in favour of the 
project, and so is his party, but he also pointed out that Friends 
of the Island had some concerns about possible environmental 
impacts.
<P>
	Does my colleague think that these concerns are so 
serious-of course we will be careful but just the same-as to 
warrant stopping the project? Has enough been done so far, with 
90 analyses and the 80-odd meetings? Is there enough evidence 
to allow us to proceed with the project with some assurance that 
it will go well, that it is not too risky?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer is no, the project 
must not be stopped, it must go forward. I think that our stand is 
clear on that. On the other hand, if the project has no impact on 
local lobster and scallop fishermen, why did the government 
feel the need to compensate them? This would mean that 
compensation is paid for nothing.
<P>
	I am not saying that the concerns of the group were futile, just 
this: even if its action was dismissed by the courts, the group 
will have to keep a watchful eye on things to make sure that the 
project will be as environment friendly in reality as studies 
claimed it will be. That is the point I was making about the 
environment.

They have formulated and put into practice innovative teaching

We have been elected by the people of Quebec to promote and

<P>
	The qualification for winning this award is that a teacher must 
have shown a major impact on student performance and interest 
in science, technology and mathematics. Mr. Loree developed 
the Science Can! Foundation. Over 10,000 students in three 
provinces have participated in this highly successful 
organization. Mr. Keith Clark led teachers in developing the 
grade nine destreamed science curriculum.
<P>
	Encouraging the interest and participation of students in the

ensuring that Canada will be able to continue to compete in the

Multicultural week started in 1984 to celebrate our cultures and 
traditions. In British Columbia, where multiculturalism has 
played such an important role, all people come together to share 
and understand each other. Cross-cultural education has 
destroyed many barriers and is helping in the fight against 
racism. Multiculturalism teaches us about people and helps us

<P>
	Multiculturalism applies to all of us. We all have a culture, we 
all have ethnicity. Let us all celebrate in the spirit of 
understanding that permeates this week-long event and that will 
unite all people in British Columbia.

Speaker, I wish to bring to the attention of this House that His 
Lordship Willy Romélus, Bishop of Jérémie, in Haiti, was 
recently recommended for a Nobel Peace Prize nomination by 
Professor Roberto Miguelez, of the University of Ottawa, and 
that since that time, many organizations have also supported his 
nomination.
<P>
	It is worth recalling that for several years already and at the 
risk of his life, on which attempts have been made many times, 
Bishop Romélus has been leading the fight for the liberation of 
the Haitian people. As early as February 1984, Bishop Romélus 
was calling for internationally supervised elections in that 
country and on February 22, 1993, he received the Governor 
General of Canada Medal.

	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Friday, 
February 11, I had the honour of representing the government in 
my riding of Outremont at a ceremony where 97 students from 
the University of Montreal received awards from the Canada 
Scholarships Program. These scholarships are awarded to 
students who excel in science and engineering. During this 
ceremony I was able to witness the attachment of many of them 
not only to their province, but also to Canada. After the 
ceremony, one of the students asked me why the scholarships 
were taxable. They felt the government was giving with one 
hand and taking back with the other.
<P>
	I draw the attention of the ministers responsible to that, 
because these hard-working students are the bearers of the 
values of excellence we seek to promote. They will be the 
leaders of tomorrow, and we should give them all the help we 
can give. Canada Scholarships are certainly a good program but 
if we do not tax lottery prizes, should we tax scholarships?

Liberal campaign platform is getting Canadians back to work. 
One way this will occur is by strenghthening and assisting the 
small and medium-size business sectors.
<P>
	We all know of small businesses that have had difficulty 
obtaining proper financing. The Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business makes the point that equity markets are 
biased toward large firms. The only way to relieve the equity 
problem of small firms is to create incentives for Canadians to 
invest their savings in private businesses to create wealth and 
jobs in local communities across the country.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	With so many Canadians facing retraining, the government 
must begin to acknowledge that informal training provided by 
small and medium-sized businesses is a critical dimension to 
the retraining taking place. The government must develop 
training initiatives which support small businesses involved in 
retraining in the informal setting.
<P>
	Our public funding of skills development should focus on 
literacy and generic skills. Maximum autonomy should be 
placed at the local community level to determine training needs 
and outcomes.

<P>
	Since the end of October 1993 the dollar has lost more than 
two and a half cents, raising the cost of imports and increasing 
the risk of rapidly escalating interest rates in the near future.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has not publicly set a target level for 
either the dollar or interest rate levels. I urge him to do so as 
soon as possible so that Canadian businesses and citizens can 
make plans for future spending.
<P>
	The minister must be aware that upward pressure on the cost 
of living will result from the decline of the dollar. I hope that he 
is not trying to inflate his way out of an impending debt crisis 
rather than take positive action to reduce government spending.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last night on <I>Le Point</I>, Radio-Canada broadcast a 
report from a smuggler which confirms there are close ties 
between the warriors and organized crime in Montreal.
<P>
	In another article published today by journalist Michel Vastel, 
we read that last autumn, the RCMP cancelled two police 
operations that were to take place on a Mohawk reserve near 
Montreal.
<P>
	Could the Solicitor General or the Prime Minister inform the 
House whether they obtained answers from the RCMP to the 
questions I asked yesterday about warriors involvement in 
certain criminal activities of organized crime in Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
discussed the matter with the Commissioner of the RCMP this 
morning. He informed me that the RCMP enforces the law 
throughout the country and that it had no knowledge of a drug 
warehouse on an aboriginal reserve in the Montreal area.
<P>
	I may add that we must take very seriously the information I 
was given by the RCMP commissioner, who is one of the world's 
leading police officials.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with all due respect for the work of the RCMP, one 
nevertheless wonders how the RCMP could be expected to know 
what is happening down there if it does not go there.
<P>
	I also wonder how we can reconcile the minister's answer 
with what was said by the person who appeared on television last 
night and claimed to have been an eye witness to the facts I just 
reported.
<P>
	The Prime Minister says: Name names. Who, who? Well I can 
name Minister Claude Ryan of the Quebec government who, for 
many years, was responsible for the Sûreté du Québec and who 
said yesterday he had known for years that organized crime and 
the warriors were working together. Perhaps the RCMP should 
talk to the Sûreté du Québec or the Solicitor General could talk 
to his Quebec counterparts.
<P>
	Once again, my question to the Solicitor General is this: 
Could he tell the House who in the federal government, at the 
political level or otherwise, ordered the cancellation of a major 
police operation planned last December by the RCMP and the 
Drug Enforcement Agency on reserve territory? Who cancelled 
the operation? There was a government here last December.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
of course I cannot comment on the RCMP's operations. Does the 
Leader of the Bloc Quebecois want to jeopardize the outcome of 
these investigations with his questions? I wonder why he is 
asking me these questions today.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> The 
Leader of the Opposition is merely transmitting questions that 
are being asked all over Canada, questions that are reflected on 
television and in reports in the newspapers. It is a very 
legitimate question. We have a right to know. Canadian and 
Quebec voters have a right to know whether the law is being 
observed and whether there are in this country certain ``no go'' 
zones for law enforcement. And the Solicitor General has a duty 
to answer these questions.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Which reminds me, I have another question which is even 
more specific: Could he confirm the allegations published in 
today's newspapers that the chief of the squad in charge of 
anti-drug operations at the RCMP prevented his officers from 
going on reserve territory to pursue surveillance operations and 
make arrests?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
can assure the Leader of the Bloc populaire, excuse me, the Bloc 
Quebecois-it is not very popular right now-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Very popular!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Thus, I can assure the leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
that there are no ``no go'' zones in this country, including 
aboriginal reserves. I cannot confirm the allegations made in the 
article by Mr. Vastel which appeared today, but I repeat that the 
government intends to ensure that people obey the law across

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, given the 
statements made yesterday by the former Quebec Minister of 
Public Security, it is clear that the only person in Canada not to 
know that the RCMP and the Sûreté will not take action on 
Mohawk land is the Solicitor General of Canada.
<P>
	Both he and the Prime Minister told us during the course of a 
debate that the situation was extremely delicate and that caution 
had to be exercised. Why does he maintain that the RCMP can 
take action on Mohawk land without any problem whatsoever, 
considering that even the Prime Minister stressed the delicate 
nature of the situation several days ago?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to say again that under this government there are no no-go 
zones.
<P>
	I do not know what the situation was when the Leader of the 
Opposition was in the Conservative cabinet. He may want to tell 
us himself, but I can say there are no no-go zones right now. It is 
the intention of this government to have the law enforced 
everywhere in the country. Just because we do not see mounted 
police on television does not mean they are not at work on the 
reserves or anywhere in Canada where there is work to be done 
to enforce the law.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, since RCMP 
authorities have confirmed that in addition to cigarettes, 
smuggling networks deal in luxury items such as clothing, 
jewellery and alcohol, how can the Solicitor General expect us 
to believe that these networks would not be used to deal in the 
most lucrative item of all, namely cocaine?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the opposition House leader must have been in a dream world 
the last week or so. If he had not been, he would have heard the 
leader of our party, the Prime Minister, and myself saying that 
the reason we have to act immediately after years of neglect, 
including the period when the Leader of the Opposition was in 
the Conservative cabinet, was that there were smuggling 
networks involved not only with tobacco but with alcohol, drugs 
and high powered military weapons.
<P>
	We said that right in this House. That is why we have 
enhanced enforcement efforts all over the country. Rather than 
this type of approach by the Official Opposition, I would think it 
would express support for the efforts we are taking which go far 
beyond what was the case when the Leader of the Opposition 
was on this  side of the House as a member of the Conservative 
cabinet.

have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister knows, over 70 per cent of the net 
expenditures of the government are statutory expenditures and 
not voted on annually by the House.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister consent to bring the review of 
statutory spending within the purview of the House and its 
committees on an annual basis?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. leader of the Reform Party will know that there will be 
budget bills in front of the House and that he will be able to 
present amendments. If he wants to reduce old age pensions of 
course we will vote against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

which they are established?

	On January 1 the government imposed a 7 per cent payroll tax

insurance premium increase that came into effect in January was 
a minimum amount. At the same time it was announced by the

of the job creation commitment this government has.

<P>
	In addition to our peacekeeping role which is well known to 
all in this Chamber, Canada has attempted to do its best through 
immigration and refugee policies to try to alleviate the suffering 
in that area.
<P>
	In 1992 the previous government extended a special program 
whereby individuals from the former republic of Yugoslavia in 
Canada on visitors visas would be allowed to reunify with their 
families. We have agreed to extend that program until July of

number from the former republic of Yugoslavia to 2,400. We 
have also provided a reserve of 400 that we would not for one 
moment be shy to use if conditions worsen in that part of the 
world.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in recent days, we witnessed the unfortunate breakdown of trade 
negotiations between the United States and Japan. If the verbal 
escalation degenerates into a real trade war between those two 
countries, Quebec and Canada will likely be adversely affected.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister for International 
Trade. Is the minister not concerned by the adverse effect this 
conflict could have for Quebec and Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, throughout the period of negotiation between the 
United States and Japan we have made consistent and frequent 
interventions with both countries. This was done to ensure that 
any trade measures they contemplate on a bilateral level do not 
sideswipe other GATT members, in other words, that the 
principle of most favoured nation treatment be preserved in any 
such arrangements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister for International Trade agrees with our views.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Prime Minister. Would 
it not be desirable for the Prime Minister to personally inform 
the President of the United States of Canada's interests and 
concerns?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the discussions to which the hon. member refers 
have been broken off, as he is probably aware, and the United 
States is acting unilaterally in the protection of what it sees as its 
trade interests. There is no reason for the Prime Minister of 
Canada to intervene in that situation.
<P>
	The concern we had was centred on whether the United States 
and Japan would agree, which they have not, upon measures that 
could have affected Canadian trade interests. That has not 
happened.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Canadians can remember that the previous Prime Minister 
provided for a federal penitentiary in his riding at taxpayers' 
expense. Now the federal government recently approved $4.5 
million of funding for a museum of industrial history in 
Shawinigan, the current Prime Minister's riding.
<P>
	Is it the intention of the present Prime Minister to equal or 
exceed the former Prime Minister in delivering federal funding 
to his own constituency?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me tell the hon. member that this project was asked 
for many months ago by the local authorities. In fact, the 
municipal government, the provincial government and all the 
political parties in the province of Quebec unanimously support 
this initiative. It is sad the hon. member's party did not run a 
candidate in Quebec because I suspect that party would have 
supported the project also.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	The contribution of the federal government is modest 
compared with the contributions coming from the private sector 
and the provincial government. It will allow the creation of 
employment. It will be a centre of tourism. It will generate and 
spin off a number of financial consequences which will benefit 
the entire region and not exclusively the riding of the Prime 
Minister.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, time 
and time again we hear just what we heard a moment ago. That 
seems to be a commitment of previous governments or of some 
other past groups. The fact is if this government can do away 
with EH-101s it certainly could have prevented this $4.5 
million expenditure.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister today delivering on the promise he made 
last fall in his own campaign to look after his riding? Is the 
Prime Minister saying that he is delivering $4.5 million to his 
own riding at the expense of taxpayers across this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me remind the hon. member that this contribution is 
part of a number of other contributions from the private sector. 
The private sector is investing three times the amount the 
federal government is investing in this project.
<P>
	It will create employment for hundreds in the region and will 
serve the interests not only of the riding of the Prime Minister 
but the entire region.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member that if he visits the area he will be 
proud to see that this region is benefiting from the overall 
expenditures of the Canadian government.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	This morning we learned that Canada's position as an 
exporting country has been deteriorating for ten years. From 
1982 to 1992, Canada's share of world exports was reduced by 
over 5 per cent. This translates into an export loss of $7 billion in 
U.S. dollars and, according to Claude Picher of <I>La Presse</I>, 
represents a 300,000 job loss for Canada.
<P>
	What concrete measure does the government intend to take to 
correct the disastrous situation of Canadian exports, which is an 
important reason for the collapse of our job market?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the statistics the hon. member cites reflect the fact 
that there has been a global recession. Specifically in the case of 
Canada, however, we have put in place a number of initiatives 
intended to take the opportunities offered to Canadian 
companies by the successful conclusion of the Uruguay round at 
the GATT and by the implementation of NAFTA as elaborated 
by this government when it came into office.
<P>
	Our trade promotion programs and activities are intended not 
only to exploit those additional opportunities that result from 
the reduction in trade barriers but also to identify new 
opportunities particularly in Asia and across the Pacific, 
including for  example our friends in Korea who offer us all sorts 
of new trading opportunities.

employees go on training programs to learn and to be able to use 
that as a valuable resource of information when it comes to 
doing their job.
<P>
	I would be happy to look into any of the specifics the hon.

	<B>Mr. Jag Bhaduria (Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of personal privilege to clarify 
an issue that has become a subject of debate not only in this 
Chamber but also across the nation.
<P>
	This has impeded my ability to function effectively and 
efficiently as the member of Parliament for the riding of 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville. This is the earliest 
opportunity for me to address the issue in the House.
<P>
	Approximately two weeks before allegations against me first 
appeared in the media, I was contacted and threatened by an 
anonymous telephone caller. It was suggested to me that I 
should withdraw a pending appeal against the Toronto Board of 
Education at the Court of Appeal level; if I did not I would 
become front page news and suffer dire consequences. I ignored 
this threat and as a result I am standing before the House today.
<P>
	Threats of blackmail or intimidation should not and will not 
compromise my commitment to free speech as a member of 
Parliament. Since this threat was made, accusations about my 
qualifications have been reported in the media.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	These accusations have seriously damaged my personal and 
professional credibility. In fact the media went beyond making 
simple accusations. They carried on a campaign of character 
assassination and were joined by others who jumped on the 
bandwagon to discredit my qualifications. I was accused, tried, 
convicted and executed due to their sheer ignorance. They 
created an hysteria without checking the facts with me regarding 
my academic credentials. Some accusations such as 
exaggerating my qualifications were mild in comparison to 
assertions of outright lying about my credentials.
<P>
	On the public record I categorically refute all accusations of 
lying, exaggerating or misrepresenting any of my academic 
credentials.
<P>
	I have earned a bachelor of science degree, a master of science 
degree in physics, a master of education degree in 
administration, a post graduate certification in education and, 
last but not least, a certification of completion of intermediate in 
laws abbreviated as LLB intermediate from the University of 
London.
<P>
	I would like to add that none of these credentials is honorary 
or purchased from a diploma factory. I would also like to add 
that LLB intermediate is not a degree. It is a recognition of 
successful completion of two years of law education at the 
University of London, England.
<P>
	To clear any doubts whether any such recognition exists, I 
would like to quote relevant information from the certificate of 
completion sent by the registrar of the University of London on 
February 2, 1994. It reads: ``This is to certify that Jag Bhaduria 
passed the intermediate examination in laws in 1976 in the 
following subjects'', et cetera, et cetera. I respectfully request 
unanimous consent to table these documents.
<P>
	I have also been accused of misrepresenting myself or 
representing myself as a lawyer. I have never been a lawyer or 
represented myself as a lawyer to anyone. Even completion of a 
law degree will not entitle me to practise law without fulfilling 
further requirements. There are many persons in Ontario and in 
other provinces who do possess completed law degrees but are 
not lawyers.
<P>
	I can understand the anger generated by these wild, false and 
baseless accusations. I agree with and applaud the right hon. 
Prime Minister when he stated that he does not like being lied to. 
Nor do I. Nor does any hon. member of the House.
<P>
	With my conviction and firm belief in the policy of honesty 
and integrity of elected officials at all levels, I refute these false 
allegations in the presence of my peers in the House. We do not 
have to be saints but we must strive to uphold these principles. I 
invite my colleagues in the House to examine my academic 
credentials and weigh the accusations in a rational and judicious 
manner.
<P>
	In conclusion I request the House to ensure that no Canadian 
be subjected to the demeaning and humiliating accusations I 
have been confronted with since becoming a member of 
Parliament.

	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> Mr. Speaker, even as I 
address this House, Mr. Irénée Pelletier, who was the member of 
Parliament for the constituency of Sherbrooke between 1972 
and 1984 and who unfortunately passed away last Friday, is 
being buried in a religious ceremony in the church at 
Saint-André-de-Madawaska, the village of his birth.
<P>
	Irénée Pelletier died at the age of 54. He was the 13th of 14 
children, something many of us can identify with, and he 
accomplished many things in his life.
<P>
	After receiving a BA from St. Francis Xavier University in 
Nova Scotia, he earned a Ph.D. in political science from the 
University of Toulouse in France. The subject of his thesis was 
Canada's aid to developing countries, and this was in the very 
early seventies.
<P>
	He had a very full life. He was a member of the Canadian 
forces and he was also very active. He travelled extensively and 
after his studies he worked as a professor with the faculty of 
administration at the University of Sherbrooke. In 1972 he ran 
for the first time as the candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada 
in the riding of Sherbrooke. Of course he won that election and 
those that followed in 1974, 1979 and 1980.
<P>
	While sitting in the House of Commons as the member for 
Sherbrooke, he was very active and became interested in several 
issues. For several years he chaired the Standing Committee on 
Regional Industrial Expansion. He was Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Agriculture. He was also very active in 
various interparliamentary groups.
<P>
	He was very interested in peace and disarmament issues. In 
fact-I remember because he told me himself-he had to make a 
personal, very difficult decision when the House held a debate 
on cruise missiles and he felt compelled to vote against his own 
government on a motion to test these missiles.
<P>
	He told me how torn he was feeling during this debate and 
how he finally decided to take a very personal position that, 
incidentally, reflected his deep concern over the hunger problem 
and other issues affecting to different degrees people suffering 
around the world.
<P>
	I had the privilege to face Irénée Pelletier during the 1984 
general election. If I may, I would like to relate an election 
anecdote that says a lot about Mr. Pelletier. We conducted two 
polls during the election. The first one said basically two things: 
first, that Mr. Pelletier was very popular with Sherbrooke 
voters, which was bad news for the other candidates. Another 
piece of bad news at the very beginning of the campaign was that 
Mr. Pelletier was going to win the election. The second poll 
asked the same questions, with the same results.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	At the end of the campaign, Mr. Pelletier was just as popular 
with Sherbrooke voters but this time we found out the wave that 
was about to sweep Canada was also going to have an impact in 
the constituency he had been representing since 1972.
<P>
	Today, it is with some emotion that I join those who have 
known him in saying how much we will miss him. I met Irénée 
Pelletier several times after the 1984 election. He was always 
very generous. I saw him a few days before he died. He was a 
committed man who served his community better than anyone 
else ever did. He left his mark in Sherbrooke in several areas 
because he was a very effective member of Parliament, and he 
always supported those who sought to help the disadvantaged in 
our society.
<P>
	Sherbrooke has a service organization called Cercovie that he 
was instrumental in founding several years ago. We can thank 
Irénée Pelletier for that accomplishment.
<P>
	On behalf of my family and especially of those who knew Mr. 
Pelletier, who had the privilege to be represented by him in the 
House of Commons, I want to say how much we will miss him. I 
especially want to offer our sincere condolences to his family 
and say in closing that the constituency of Sherbrooke and the 
country as a whole have lost a great man.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would also like to speak on this subject. I too would 
like to extend my sympathies to the family of Irénée Pelletier, a 
distinguished member of Parliament who served with me in this 
House for 12 years.
<P>
	In my view, here was a man who truly embodied what Canada 
stands for. Hailing from the Madawaska Valley in New 
Brunswick, he earned a degree from St. Francis Xavier 
University in Nova Scotia. He went on to earn a Ph.D. in 
political science in France before returning to teach in 
Sherbrooke.
<P>
	First elected to the House of Commons in 1972 he was, in the 
words of his successor, an excellent member of Parliament. He 
was extremely dedicated and friends with everyone. He was 
very industrious and keenly interested in international affairs. 
Typically, however, he was deeply concerned about poverty and 
focused a lot of his attention on regional development. Given his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1389"> 1389 </A></B>
<P>
rural roots, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	Individuals like Irénée Pelletier who serve in Parliament are 
fine examples for others to emulate. On behalf of Aline and my 
party, I want to offer my condolences to the Pelletier family. 
May he always be remembered as a gentleman who served his 
riding, his province and his country with distinction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Berger (Saint-Henri-Westmount):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I too served with Irénée Pelletier from 1979 to 1984 
and I was deeply saddened by his demise.
<P>
	Mr. Pelletier came from Saint-André-de-Madawaska, New 
Brunswick. A former university professor in Sherbrooke with a 
doctorate in history, he represented the people of Sherbrooke in 
the House of Commons, as my hon. colleagues pointed out, for 
12 years, from 1972 to 1984.
<P>
	In October 1975 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Agriculture, the Hon. Eugene Whelan.
<P>
	Mr. Pelletier was a great champion of the Canadian marketing 
board system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At a conference of Canadian grocery distributors in 1977 he 
decried the sometimes adversarial relationship between 
government and the food industry.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	He said: ``An effective food policy, supported and 
administered through effective programs, is one that can only be 
achieved by a united approach''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One subject was particularly close to his heart and that was 
aid to developing countries. He even wrote his doctoral 
dissertation on this subject. In 1976 he travelled the country 
with fellow members Andrew Brewin and Douglas Roche to 
make Canadians aware of the needs of developing countries.
<P>
	In a speech, Mr. Pelletier said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Canadians have not only a Christian responsibility but a 
human responsibility to help correct inequalities, and if the 
developed nations do not share with the developing nations 
chaos will result. Fifteen per cent of the world's population 
control close to eighty per cent of the world's wealth. Under 
these conditions we are just not going to have a peaceful world. 
The Third World is just not going to accept it''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	After being defeated in 1984 he became involved in municipal 
politics, was elected alderman and then mayor of North Hatley.
<P>
	Three years ago Mr. Pelletier studied in Rome to become a 
priest. This was to be the crowning achievement of a career in 
which the emphasis had always been on dedication.
<P>
	On my behalf and that of my colleagues, I wish to extend my 
deepest sympathies to his family and friends, as well as to all 
those who were close to him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Madam Speaker, although I 
did not know Mr. Pelletier, I wish to recognize his service in 
government from 1972 to 1984. On behalf of all members of the 
Bloc Quebecois, I would like to offer my sincere condolences to 
the family and friends of Mr. Irénée Pelletier, former member of 
Parliament for Sherbrooke.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to join 
with my colleagues in paying tribute to Irénée Pelletier, whom 
we remember in this House from the seventies and early 
eighties. We remember him to be a very popular member in his 
constituency. Often visitors from the constituency would come 
to Ottawa and he would go out of his way to introduce them, 
particularly to those of us from western Canada. I personally 
always appreciated that.
<P>
	The fact that he won election after election speaks well of the 
kind of constituency person he was. We all remember the issues 
that he was deeply devoted to, not only in terms of overseas 
development from a Canadian perspective but particularly his 
concern for the plight of people living in many of the countries 
in which our aid projects were undertaken.
<P>
	He would share those experiences from his travels and his 
knowledge with us in the House, particularly in those days in the 
evenings over dinner. He would come back from a trip and 
explain the kinds of conditions he experienced. I found him to be 
a very motivating individual and a very kind and compassionate 
member of Parliament.
<P>
	I simply want to join with my colleagues in saying that Mr. 
Pelletier will be missed. Our hearts and our prayers go out to 
him, to his family and to his friends today. Again I want to say 
how sad we were when we learned of his passing.

anything that had to do with the quality of life.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough):</B> Madam Speaker, this is 
the third time that I have had the opportunity to make a 
statement in this House concerning an aspect of the continuing 
saga of the fixed link between Prince Edward Island and the 
mainland.
<P>
	For the benefit of those members who have recently joined us 
in this Chamber, this is an issue which has been at the top of the 
political agenda in Atlantic Canada for many years. The first 
major discussions about a fixed link evolved around a railway 
tunnel in the late 1880s. Then there was a combination of bridge, 
causeway and tunnel in the 1950s and 1960s. Now we are at the 
stage at which the actual construction of a bridge has begun.
<P>
	The construction of a bridge between Prince Edward Island 
and the mainland has not been without controversy. Several 
court challenges have been mounted to prevent the construction.
<P>
	To those who oppose this project I must say I respect the 
passion which they have shown for the cause, but at the same 
time I must respectfully disagree with the positions they have 
put forward. The governments of the Atlantic provinces, the 
Government of Canada and the vast majority of the residents of 
the regions agree that the construction of a fixed link should go 
ahead.
<P>
	One by one the barriers to the construction of this project have 
fallen away. The latest reincarnation of this project, if I may be 
permitted to use that term, came about in 1987. Since that time 
more than 90 studies have been conducted and countless public 
meetings have been held with the general public and with 
special interest groups in all three maritime provinces.
<P>
	Now it has been said, and it is true, that the original generic 
design of the bridge did not pass an environmental review panel. 
However, careful study of the specific design of the current 
bridge did satisfy all of the requirements.
<P>
	A special panel was convened to study the effects of the 
bridge on ice in the Northumberland Strait and it concluded that 
the bridge would have no significant effect.
<P>
	Fishermen and ferry workers were concerned that the bridge 
would affect their livelihood and their specific concerns have 
been addressed with a settlement being reached with the 
fishermen in the area just last week. Talks are continuing with 
the ferry workers. I have every confidence that they too will 
come to a successful and mutually acceptable conclusion.
<P>
	The work on the project has already begun and the economic 
upsurge in the Borden area of Prince Edward Island is noticeable 
already. The construction of the yards for fabrication of the 
concrete piers of the bridge is under way and employment has 
been created both there and in the town of Borden which is 
undergoing a mini real estate boom.
<P>
	Just last week a tender was awarded to a New Brunswick firm 
for $40 million worth of concrete to be delivered to the site, a 
contract which will create some 50 additional jobs. The 
construction will get into full swing in the year ahead and the 
economic spin-offs will be of tremendous importance to Prince 
Edward Island and to the rest of the region.
<P>
	The very fact that the construction is under way has pointed 
out a major flaw which presently exists in our transportation 
system. Because of the geological make-up of Prince Edward 
Island it is necessary to transport gravel and fill from New 
Brunswick for construction of the yards in Borden. The truck 
traffic, as a result of this, has necessitated extra crossings of the 
ferry this year. There have been delays in truck traffic because of 
increased volume. All consumer products that come into Prince 
Edward Island come in by truck, and every delay adds to the 
eventual cost paid by consumers.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Because of the severely cold weather this winter which has 
affected most of Canada there has been a tremendous build-up 
of ice in the Northumberland Strait. Some crossings last week 
took over five hours whereas in summer it would take about 45 
minutes.
<P>
	This shows that an improved system of transporting our goods 
out and our consumer products in is badly needed. If we in 
Prince Edward Island are to prosper and if our economy is to 
recover we must have a dependable and efficient transportation 
link with the rest of Canada. We have gone beyond the time 
where we can adopt a casual attitude when it comes to getting 
our goods to market. The world has become a highly competitive 
place and we have to compete at the very highest level if we are 
to succeed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1391"> 1391 </A></B>
<P>
	A few days ago I spoke in the House about the need for 
continued equalization payments to help the poorer areas of 
Canada carry on while they develop their economies. This fixed 
link project is one of the major construction projects in Canada 
today. When it is completed it will leave the lasting effect of 
an improved transportation system in our area.
<P>
	The benefits will not only be immediate as we enjoy this 
influx of capital into our economy. They will flow to us for many 
years to come. The construction itself will create a pool of 
expertise in Atlantic Canada which will be in demand around the 
world for similar projects. The bridge itself will initiate a 
stability in our marketplace that is not there at the present time. 
In the future people can plan, schedules can be set, and products 
can get to market.
<P>
	The last number of years have not been bright in Atlantic 
Canada. Our unemployment rate is the highest of any region. I 
also said a few days ago that there was not a politician in 
Atlantic Canada who would not be happy to see equalization 
funds flowing out of our region to help other areas of Canada 
rather than flowing in to bring us up to national standards. That 
is what this project is about. It is about creating opportunity for 
Atlantic Canada. It is about creating the opportunity which will 
allow Prince Edward Island and the rest of Atlantic Canada to 
stand on their own two feet.
<P>
	We have tremendous resources in our region. We live within a 
one-day drive of millions of people who are looking for quality 
goods and services. We must be prepared to go after those 
markets and we must have the tools to be able to compete.
<P>
	Since I have been involved in public life, and that goes back 
some 20 years, we have heard among other things two 
prescriptions for the recovery of Atlantic Canada. It has always 
been said, first, that we must add more value to our products 
and, second, that we should extend the length of our tourist 
season. Both these will become easier when the completion of 
the link and the improved transportation network it will entail 
become a reality.
<P>
	The construction of this bridge represents our best hope in 
both the short and long term to create a dramatic economic 
improvement in Prince Edward Island and the rest of the 
maritime provinces. That is why we in the House must show our 
continuing support for the project. That brings us to the debate 
we are conducting today.
<P>
	Transportation has always been one of our most dominant 
concerns in Atlantic Canada. During the age of sail we were at 
the leading edge of the world technology but during the winter 
months we could not sail very far. The age of sail gave way to the 
age of steam and changes had to be made. At the time that Prince 
Edward Island entered Confederation in 1873 and for a number 
of years thereafter, the link between my province and the 
mainland was steamship during the summer months and 
iceboats powered by oars in the winter.
<P>
	The construction of the railway led Prince Edward Island into 
Confederation. Our Fathers of Confederation were sufficiently 
astute to include provisions in the Constitution that there be a 
steam service provided by the Government of Canada. Like the 
transportation systems of the day that was a state of the art 
constitutional provision. It made sense at the time to guarantee 
that the best available transportation system was included in the 
Constitution. That is precisely what this amendment is doing 
today. It is bringing the Constitution and its provisions with 
respect to transportation up to the present time.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	There are those who have argued, even in court, that this 
provision of the Constitution should not be changed. They have 
used that argument to try to prevent the building of the link. That 
argument is no more valid than it would be to argue that some of 
the statutes in some of our jurisdictions which once banned the 
automobile should not be changed.
<P>
	The Constitution is a living thing. Constitutions must change 
and adapt to the changing times in which we live and to the 
advances and changes in technology which affect our daily 
lives. One wonders if the ferry service between Prince Edward 
Island and New Brunswick has been constitutional since the 
steamship gave way to the diesel powered ship many years ago.
<P>
	This amendment will allow for people of one province of 
Canada, Prince Edward Island, to become full partners with the 
rest of the country. The Trans-Canada Highway in Prince 
Edward Island will be joined to the Trans-Canada Highway in 
New Brunswick and islanders will be able to transport their 
goods directly to market in a timely and efficient manner.
<P>
	We are entering an exciting time in Atlantic Canada. A new 
era of prosperity will come to our region fuelled in part by the 
regional economic policies of the government and in part by the 
construction of this very major project.
<P>
	I urge all hon. members to support this constitutional 
amendment and to bring the Constitution of Canada as it impacts 
on the transportation system of Prince Edward Island into the 
21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
glad to be able to make a few comments on the interesting 
speech of my hon. colleague who just spoke.
<P>
	On this side of the House, it is always with interest that we 
observe what is being done for some provinces of Canada, 
especially Prince Edward Island which was able to renegotiate 
its terms of union with Canada and which today sees a project 
which has long been a source of argument on the Island and in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1392"> 1392 </A></B>
<P>
the rest of Canada. The federal government will finally allocate 
the required funds.
<P>
	Considering the expressed desire of the people of Prince 
Edward Island and the willingness of the federal government to 
invest in this project, all we can do is acknowledge the 
democratically achieved decision of the population of P.E.I., 
which was presented with all the facts. It is not for us to decide 
what is good for them. We can only respect their will, although 
we look with some envy at the terms of union of British 
Columbia, which included a railroad from sea to sea, and more 
recently at the promises made to Newfoundland, in 1949, after 
lengthy negotiations.
<P>
	Unfortunately Quebec never really negotiated its terms of 
union. We were, through an Act of the British Parliament, 
incorporated into a union of British colonies in North America. 
In 1867, we did not have much to say. No referendum was held in 
Quebec then, despite the repeated requests of the Liberal 
opposition.	
<P>
	This is why we hope that in a few months, like our friends in 
Prince Edward Island, we will be able to make a wise, 
enlightened and positive decision as to our fate as a nation and 
our desire to negotiate with Canada the terms of Quebec 
accession to full sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
intervention in the constitutional debate that he wants to get me 
involved in. I want to add that this constitutional amendment 
comes about because of the bilateral constitutional amendments 
that are allowed with one province but not more than one. That is 
why this has happened in New Brunswick and in Newfoundland.
<P>
	It is happening in Prince Edward Island today because the 
legislative assembly of Prince Edward Island passed the same 
resolution last year. We are being asked to do so in this House 
today. I am sure the hon. member and his party agree that it 
should go ahead and see no problem in passing it.
<P>
	As far as getting into the constitutional debate of the rest of 
the country, I will let other more qualified people than myself 
get involved in that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on this 
bill, that is this constitutional change.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to speak in support of this resolution which will 
clear away one of the final remaining obstacles to the 
Northumberland Strait bridge project. Before proceeding 
further I want to answer a few questions raised today. Neither 
the minister nor I had the opportunity to provide answers.
<P>
	Some members will recall that a member of the Reform Party 
questioned the process the government was undertaking with 
respect to this initiative. I remind that colleague and other 
colleagues that the judge had directed the constitutional change. 
The judge had indicated the change could be undertaken via 
section 43. It is important to make those points for fear that 
someone may believe proper advice was not followed.
<P>
	I was also somewhat taken aback by that member of 
Parliament who, with a certain amount of enthusiasm, suggested 
the government had received nothing but bad advice, that it 
might even have been proceeding illegally. I have to say this 
person does not lack in confidence and I wonder what credible 
source my colleague was quoting.
<P>
	I underline as well the fact that the people of Prince Edward 
Island joined the union. They made that decision with a 
condition and it is correct for them to amend that condition. It is 
correct for them to determine that condition should be changed 
because they decided to join under it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This morning, I believe the Bloc Quebecois made reference to 
a firm which indicated that some $1.3 billion might be spent on 
that project. If that is indeed the comment made, it is erroneous. 
The fact is that this firm said in 1988 that even if the project was 
to cost $1.3 billion, it would be worth it. This is not the same 
statement at all.
<P>
	I also want to point out that we did have a reliable source, an 
independent engineer, who certified that the project would cost 
approximately $840 million. Again, this amount was certified 
by an independent party.
<P>
	I must add another comment. If there are additional costs and 
if the project goes over the estimated budget, what will happen? 
I think some are under the impression that the government 
would foot the bill. On the contrary, it is the private sector which 
would have to absorb these additional costs.
<P>
	Finally, you are well aware that environmental concerns were 
raised regarding this project. I simply want to remind hon. 
members that more than 90 studies were conducted and over 80 
meetings were held; moreover, two court decisions concluded 
that the project was very reasonable from an environmental 
point of view. Of course, you can never be absolutely sure, but if 
you look at megaprojects, you will see that the government 
proceeded very cautiously with this one, at least as regards 
financing and environmental aspects.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Finally, there was this question about the workers. It is 
unfortunate-and I share this concern with my colleagues from 
both sides of the House-that workers will be displaced. It is 
really very unfortunate. I want to remind this House that this 
government makes it a priority-and I hope it is the same for all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1393"> 1393 </A></B>
<P>
my other  colleagues-to find ways to meet the needs of these 
men and women.
<P>
	With regard to the fixed link project, those workers will have 
hiring preference and some will be able to take advantage of 
early retirement programs. There will be training and retraining 
programs as well. I insist on it and I hope that we will work very 
hard together to try and make sure that these men and women 
will not find themselves out of work because of the bridge.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Having answered those questions I felt needed some 
additional detail, I want to proceed very quickly with some of 
the main points I consider important from my particular 
perspective.
<P>
	Our government made it clear during the election campaign 
and in the recent throne speech that putting Canadians back to 
work is the number one economic, political and social challenge 
facing this country. We are committed to taking every step 
within our power to support job creation, to stimulate increased 
economic activity and to restore hope and confidence in the 
future for all Canadians. This project helps in reaching those 
particular goals.
<P>
	Nowhere is this more the case, the need that is, than in 
Atlantic Canada which almost more than any other area of the 
country has suffered too long from high levels of unemployment 
resulting in dependency and despair. Everyone should welcome 
this initiative for that part of the country which has been hard hit 
economically.
<P>
	The Northumberland Strait bridge project will have an 
immediate significant impact on the economy of Atlantic 
Canada in general and that of Prince Edward Island in particular. 
The rest of the country can expect to feel the positive effects of 
this project in the long term too. That is a positive spin off.
<P>
	Members will recall we have estimated there will be 1,000 
direct jobs for each of the four years of construction or almost 
3,000 person years of employment in all. That is a lot of work for 
a lot of people. Under the terms of the contract between the 
federal government and the contractor, more than 95 per cent of 
these jobs will come from Atlantic Canada. Of course with its 
high unemployment numbers it is of particular importance to 
this area as well as the rest of Canada.
<P>
	This project will provide a tremendous boost for employment 
throughout the region. It will provide thousands of workers with 
gainful employment and the opportunity to practise and improve 
their job skills, quite apart from the work it will provide. 
However direct employment tells only part of the story.
<P>
	The contract also specifies that some 70 per cent of the total 
procurement requirements will be sourced in the region. These 
requirements are massive: thousands of tonnes of cement, 
reinforcing steel cable, fabricated metal, manufactured 
components, et cetera. Given that the total project is estimated 
at $840 million to $850 million, the wages and procurement 
expenditures paid by the developer will inject more than $.5 
billion into the Atlantic economy over the next five years. This 
should give a real kick-start to the economy in a region of this 
great country that badly needs it.
<P>
	It is also important to note that this bridge project most 
definitely is not a make-work project aimed at providing some 
short term relief for some of Canada's poorer provinces. 
Obviously once the bridge is built some jobs will cease, but 
there will be spin-off benefits. There will be an increase in 
tourism and in business opportunities. I could go on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I for one have found the hon. minister's remarks very 
enlightening and convincing today. There is no question that the 
bridge project is a very good deal for the Canadian taxpayers. In 
accordance with the terms of the union act signed with Prince 
Edward Island, the federal government is clearly required to 
fund a link of some kind, whether a bridge or a ferry system, to 
join the island to the mainland.
<P>
	In the case of a ferry service, it would cost Canadians 
taxpayers at least $42 million a year for the next 35 years to 
allow Marine Atlantic to operate the service. This amount 
includes the cost of operating the ferries, the cost of 
maintenance and capital costs, for example, for the purchase of 
new icebreakers during that period. After 35 years, federal 
government subsidies should continue and increase because of 
the demand for service. As the minister mentioned, this would 
lead to uncontrolled spending with no end in sight, and that is 
not a good deal for the taxpayers of this country.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Let me add a few comments to what the minister said about 
the environmental quality of the project. This has attracted a lot 
of attention during most of the five years that the project was 
being developed. The environment was the main concern of the 
government and of the developer. Indeed, this project has been 
the subject of the most thorough environmental studies ever 
undertaken for a project of this size. As I said, there were over 
90 studies, 80 meetings and the public had many opportunities 
to speak on the project requirements at some 85 public meetings. 
This project meets all the technical requirements and all the 
environmental requirements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1394"> 1394 </A></B>
<P>
	In closing, I ask my colleagues to support this project because 
it is sound, it will meet the economic, tourism and other needs of 
the region and I think it is being approached in a most 
appropriate way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the parliamentary secretary's comments cause me to 
think of a couple of questions which would appropriately be 
answered by him. I will have more to say about this motion later 
when I am recognized on debate.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary indicated in his opening remarks 
that the amendment today is required on the word of the courts. I 
think the parliamentary secretary is aware that the Federal Court 
had a number of things to say in regard to this project. Madam 
Justice Reed did say, as quoted by the previous minister of 
public works, that the constitutional amendment is not 
necessarily required until the ferry service is replaced. Of 
course the ferry service has not yet been replaced, yet we are 
going ahead with this.
<P>
	Also the Federal Court ruled that the minister of public works 
had failed to comply with the requirements of section 12 of the 
environmental assessment review process and ruled that no 
irrevocable decision should be taken until this is taken care of. Is 
it the government's opinion that the section 12 requirements of 
the environmental assessment process have been dealt with, or 
does the government now consider that this constitutional 
amendment may not be an irrevocable decision?
<P>
	Finally, the department has given jobs and the economy 
primarily as its reasons for going ahead with the fixed link. 
However in my constituency in the interests of saving money the 
Department of Public Works is closing and perhaps bulldozing 
three buildings owned and occupied by the federal government. 
That is costing us jobs in the prairies and rural Canada.
<P>
	I am wondering how the parliamentary secretary can justify 
closing buildings in my riding and costing jobs while at the same 
time putting money into the waters around Prince Edward Island 
to create jobs there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member's comment 
with regard to the Federal Court indicating that a change needed 
to be undertaken but when that change had to be undertaken is 
quite right. However, it needs to be done and clearly now it is out 
of the way or hopefully soon will be out of the way. It removes 
the last obstacle. I think we are nit-picking a little. I say this 
with kindness to my colleague. It was going to be done. It 
needed to be done. It has been done and this has been the 
appropriate path to follow.
<P>
	With respect to irrevocable decisions, any decision 
undertaken by man or woman is not irrevocable. We are about to 
make a constitutional change. We are in the process of doing so. 
It is quite possible to do so and I  consider this one appropriate. I 
consider it necessary and I argued that in my remarks.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the environmental questions I know of no 
project that has sustained as much scrutiny as this one. I 
indicated in my remarks that nothing is perfect. Certain things 
could have been overlooked. I admit that. I am not foolish to that 
point. However, there were over 90 studies and over 80 hearings. 
Even our colleagues from the Bloc are supporting it in spite of 
the fact that a number of individuals pointed out that Friends of 
the Island had some legitimate concerns. The government and 
the minister have been extremely responsible in this particular 
case. We cannot go on forever.
<P>
	With respect to the hon. member's riding, I do not know if 
those particular buildings are being closed and jobs are being 
lost. However that saddens me whether it happens in Prince 
Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Vancouver, or anywhere else in 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Madam Speaker, my colleagues have 
addressed the legal and political implications of the matter 
before us. I want to step back a little further and consider the 
basic premise.
<P>
	Do we really need a 13 kilometre bridge across 
Northumberland Strait? Why do we want to do this? Do the 
benefits outweigh the costs? Can a near bankrupt Canada afford 
it? These questions have been debated for 30 years, but in spite 
of the signing last October as can be seen in this House the 
debate is by no means over.
<P>
	Let us start by disposing of the fiction that this will be a 
privately financed venture. This is a typical government project 
with the deal structured so that bond holders take no risk and the 
private operators will repay principal and interest out of the 
complete 100 per cent subsidy, $42 million a year indexed to 
inflation for 35 years. This is compared to the current subsidy. I 
must take issue with the gentleman who spoke a few moments 
ago when he said that the subsidy was $42 million. The current 
subsidy is $21.7 million. That is from the public accounts. 
Therefore, we are talking about a virtual doubling of the subsidy 
with the alternate program that is being proposed.
<P>
	The interest on the $662 million initial bond issue is going to 
be about $700 million, all courtesy of the Canadian taxpayer. 
The only difference between the deal closed on October 7 and a 
normal public works tender is that public money will be spent 
without public accountability.
<P>
	This gets better. Of the equity 85 per cent is held by 
subsidiaries of foreign multinationals, Morrison Knutson of the 
United States and the French GTM International. I do not know 
what GTM stands for but I suspect it might mean get the money, 
because get the money they will.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1395"> 1395 </A></B>
<P>
	While we are paying off the debt the operators will be able to 
do whatever they wish with the net revenue from the tolls and 
that includes shipping the revenue out of the country. I have 
nothing against foreign investment. In fact I welcome it. 
However, I strongly object to foreign profit taking without 
significant investment or risk.
<P>
	Still it gets better. The consortium has to post a $200 million 
performance bond, but the premium is being capitalized into the 
project cost so that the taxpayer is going to pick up the tab as part 
of the subsidy payments.
<P>
	If this proposed bridge was between two heavily populated 
areas or if it was on a major transportation corridor it would be 
easier to justify. To spend $25,000 per family to make road 
access marginally more convenient to an enclave of 130,000 
people makes no sense at all.
<P>
	Larger, faster ferries perhaps with better ice capabilities than 
those now in use could be had for a fraction of the cost. First 
class ferry service would not be a discriminatory burden on the 
people of Prince Edward Island.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	There are unanswered questions regarding the technical 
superiority of a high, wind-swept bridge compared to a stable, 
well designed ferry. The consensus, even among proponents of 
the bridge, is that any storm severe enough to stop ferry service 
will also stop traffic from using the bridge. What is worse, even 
if the winds are not quite strong enough to stop traffic, vehicles 
will be forced to proceed at a crawl and empty trailers will not be 
permitted to cross.
<P>
	If one is coming up from Boston for a load of potatoes and 
there is no backup ferry, one had better be prepared to park his or 
her semi until it gets a mite less breezy.
<P>
	As an engineer I am well aware that almost anything is 
technically possible if there is a will to do it and if there is no 
limit to available resources. One takes an idea and just adds 
money. However, the fact that something can be done does not 
necessarily mean that it should be done.
<P>
	Some people may invoke the memory of John Maynard 
Keynes to justify this massive public expense as a 
pump-priming exercise to stimulate the economy. Lord Keynes 
never envisioned a situation in which nearly one-third of a 
government's revenue is being eaten up to pay interest on its 
existing debt. If we had faithfully followed his prescription and 
built up surpluses or at least paid down our debt during the good 
times I could perhaps agree that more government spending 
might be of some economic benefit.
<P>
	Unfortunately during the 1970s and the early 1980s the 
Government of Canada and most governments in the world piled 
up debts in good times, not for any lasting benefit but to finance 
current expenditures. Like spendthrift families, they borrowed 
money first to pay for the groceries and then to buy champagne 
and whisky. They stood poor old Keynes on his head and they 
put us  into a financial box where we have no freedom to move 
about.
<P>
	Even if one accepts the premise that jobs can be created at the 
expense of the greater economy, and I certainly do not, but let 
me play devil's advocate, if spending borrowed money is an 
effective economic stimulus, surely the same amount of money 
could be spent on something which would provide greater 
long-term benefits to more people. Even the people of Prince 
Edward Island are not united on this question. More than 40 per 
cent of them clearly indicated they do not want this gift. This is 
unprecedented. Ordinarily local people in any community will 
fight tooth and nail for a government project because they have 
this perception it is free.
<P>
	Finally, this bridge deal was consummated in the dying days 
of the Tory government, as was the Pearson airport deal. It has 
the potential to be another Mirabel or another Olympic dome. 
Let us slow down and take a cold, hard look at what we are 
doing.
<P>
	The last P.E.I. bridge project was further advanced than this 
one is now when it was axed by the government in 1969. Of 
course there will be economic penalties to pay to the operator 
and to the bondholders if we stop, but surely we can still get out 
of this with our hide intact before the project acquires 
irresistible momentum.
<P>
	The one small lever that we have at our disposal in this House 
is to withhold approval of the proposed constitutional 
amendment. Let us leave the Constitution alone. Let us provide 
first class ferry service in perpetuity as promised and forget 
about completing another monument to Brian Mulroney.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member has spoken about cost reductions and 
whether such a project is one that should be built for practical 
reasons, but in particular the cost of such a project and who 
would be paying for it. I wonder whether the hon. member feels 
the same way about any federal project that may be built in his 
constituency. It is proposed that a healing lodge be built in his 
constituency when there are not many aboriginal people living 
there nor is there proper access to his constituency. Does he feel 
that perhaps that project should be put on hold and studied again 
and maybe should not be built as well?
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, I concur most 
wholeheartedly with the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, very quickly I want to know, and I take it I 
probably do now, that the hon. member's party does not support 
this project. The Bloc does, but his party does not. I am always 
interested in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1396"> 1396 </A></B>
<P>
trying to see the differences, apart from the language 
differences. This is what I understand.
<P>
	My colleague is playing devilish little tricks with the subsidy 
of $21.7 million. He knows full well the figures I used were with 
respect to capital and other costs. As an engineer he knows that. 
Let us not play silly little games.
<P>
	I would like to know what is his definition of an enclave. My 
definition of an enclave is somewhat pejorative. I am sure he did 
not mean that P.E.I. is some sort of foreign territory surrounded 
by others.
<P>
	There is a contradiction here. One of his colleagues said: 
``Let's have a referendum. We'll do whatever the referendum 
results are'' and the member says: ``Hey, let's not do it''. Who is 
speaking for the Reform Party? Is there any consistency?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted that the hon. 
member raised the question of the referendum.
<P>
	First, it was not a referendum, it was a plebiscite. Second, the 
terms of the plebiscite were very clear in that they stated: 
``Would you approve of this project if it is going to be more 
economically feasible than improved ferry service and if there is 
no danger to the environment?'' Since neither of those 
qualifications has been met, I would suggest that if we want to 
have a referendum we should have a real one, make it binding, 
have it now and see how far we get.
<P>
	As far as referring to Prince Edward Island as an enclave, the 
hon. member says that is pejorative. He may think so. He 
obviously reads a different dictionary than I do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> It is a standard one, English.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> It is surrounded by water. Water is a rather 
effective barrier to most means of transport. I refer to it as an 
enclave in those terms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
member mentioned that maybe it is time to move to a first class 
ferry service. I do not know if he is familiar with Prince Edward 
Island and the amount of physical goods and products we move 
off the island. Our experience with the ferry service in recent 
years has been fairly poor.
<P>
	In fact, talking about economic efficiency, I spoke with some 
truckers today. The wait at the ferry for truckers is anywhere 
from three to five hours. As many as 50 to 80 trucks at a time are 
sometimes waiting in line for the car ferries. One can only 
handle 13 and the other at maximum can handle 45. The hon. 
member has to understand that that is just not good enough. We 
believe a link will change that.
<P>
	When we look at the truckers, the fuel they are burning, the 
hours, taking a day longer to get to market in terms of 
scheduling and so on, it is a disaster for them and for the 
agricultural industry as well.
<P>
	What does the hon. member mean by first class ferry service? 
I hope this is not an example.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the time has 
expired for questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to rise today to speak on this 
constitutional amendment regarding the Prince Edward Island 
fixed link.
<P>
	I would like to stress those words; we are talking about a 
constitutional amendment. We seem to be slipping by that little 
bit of information very quickly in some of the speeches we have 
heard today.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I would like to begin by quoting from <I>Hansard</I> of May 19, 
1992 when the House was embroiled in the debate on 
constitutional concerns. ``We believe that the referendum 
should be a permanent part of the process for revising the 
Canadian Constitution; nor can it be restricted to one or just a 
few provinces. The referendum ought to be national so that all 
Canadians in all regions of this country have the opportunity to 
speak on the same issue.'' These are very democratic words and 
I concur with them. They are from the current minister of public 
works.
<P>
	I have no problem with the construction of a fixed link. The 
merits and drawbacks of this bridge have been widely discussed 
and debated in Prince Edward Island, across the nation and in the 
House of Commons. The economic benefits and the costs have 
all been given consideration. The environmental considerations 
have all been weighed. Most important, the people of Prince 
Edward Island gave their assent in a plebiscite held in 1988.
<P>
	The problem is that we are talking about a constitutional 
amendment, something that affects each and every person in this 
country.
<P>
	I would like to paint a picture. Members in this room should 
think of a triangle. A triangle stands on a broad base and rises to 
a point. This is the way I believe and my party believes we 
should approach these matters, with broad consultation and 
moving toward a point where we can get a consensus. With this 
motion the government is turning the triangle so it is inverted 
and there is no broad base of representation from the people of 
Canada. This is something that the Reform Party of Canada 
believes in very strongly, as do many millions of Canadians.
<P>
	We are all aware that Madam Justice Reed decided the 
Canadian Constitution has to be amended in order for the fixed 
link to proceed. However, the reasoning behind the motion in 
front of us is flawed for two reasons: First, the motion is too 
specific. It makes specific reference to a fixed link, entrenching 
it in the Constitution. Second, the motion should entrench the 
intent of the original terms of union, that is to ensure reliable 
and regular travel between Prince Edward Island and the 
mainland, without entrenching the link specifically in the 
Constitu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1397"> 1397 </A></B>
<P>
tion. My  colleague, the member for Fraser Valley East, dealt 
with this issue at great length.
<P>
	I find it inconsistent that this government proposes to open 
the Constitution and make changes only when it suits its 
purposes.
<P>
	I would like to read another quote. On February 3 in the House 
the Prime Minister of Canada stated that: ``No one in Canada 
wants to discuss the Constitution''. Here we are today 
discussing the Constitution.
<P>
	We all saw the rejection of the Charlottetown accord and what 
the Canadian people thought of it. This is just another case of the 
government's agenda versus that of the Canadian people. The 
government has chosen to selectively change the Constitution. 
Canadians do not accept this method.
<P>
	I would submit that any changes to the Constitution should 
involve all Canadians and should be approved in a referendum. 
The Constitution should be concerned with the broad definition 
of matters rather than ways and means of accomplishing the 
intent, such as a fixed link.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	The Constitution should deal with Canada's commitment to 
maintain communications and transportation with Prince 
Edward Island no matter what the method chosen to accomplish 
this.
<P>
	We are running into the danger of making constitutional 
commitments for Canada that may not be in the best interest for 
all of the country. Technology may change. Currently in this day 
and age we must realize the rate at which things change. We are 
going to have to commit to this fixed link throughout time if it is 
entrenched in the Constitution.
<P>
	These are things that we have no control of and that may 
change. I can give members the example of the Florida sunshine 
skyway and the Chesapeake Bay bridge. They have been known 
to close for months at a time. Are the proper plans in place for 
this fixed link?
<P>
	If we are going to have to change the Constitution, it must be 
for a good and sufficient reason. We have all heard the emotions 
of the minister of public works. I would respond that Canadians 
must feel that they are a part of this constitutional amendment.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that this motion is not just a 
simple motion to build a bridge. This is a motion to change the 
fundamental document of how our country operates, the 
Constitution.
<P>
	This is a bridge over the troubled waters of true Canadian 
democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to make sure that my colleague's 
understanding of this constitutional change is the same or 
different from mine.
<P>
	Prince Edward Island 130 years ago decided that it could and 
would become part of Canada with a certain condition, that ferry 
service would be provided forever and a day.
<P>
	Over the years, a number of options have been examined such 
as a fixed link. There is now a project under way. It was a 
judgment of a federal court that unless there were a 
constitutional change indicating simply that ferry service could 
be changed by fixed link-that is all it does-the government 
could be in a position in which it would have to build a bridge 
and continue the ferry service.
<P>
	The subsidies, as I have defined them for the ferry service, are 
going to be used to pay for the bridge. After that, there will not 
be any more contribution by Canada.
<P>
	Is my hon. colleague saying that the elected representatives of 
Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Canada should not be 
determining that it is okay for a fixed link bridge to be replacing 
ferry service? That is the way I understand this change.
<P>
	He understands it differently. Could he tell me how his 
interpretation is different from mine? I have read this several 
times and that is all I am getting from it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Madam Speaker, in response to the question, it is 
my interpretation that the intent 130 years ago was to provide 
communication and transportation.
<P>
	I feel that this motion should not be directly related to a fixed 
link because of what I have said in my address to this House. 
Technology may change. It is wrong to assume that there would 
be no cost to all Canadian taxpayers down the road.
<P>
	We are entrenching this in the Constitution. That means that 
we must ensure over a long period of time into the future that 
this will be maintained.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, there have 
been discussions among the parties and I think you might find 
there is unanimous consent for the following motion:
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That not later than 15 minutes before the ordinary time of adjournment on 
Thursday, February 17, 1994, the Speaker shall interrupt any proceedings 
before the House and shall put, forthwith and successively, without any further 
debate or amendment, all questions necessary to dispose of the motion of the 
Minister of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs for the 
appointment of a Special Joint Committee, (Government business, No. 8), and if 
any division be demanded such recorded division shall be deferred until 
Tuesday, February 22 at 3 p.m.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise and speak on this particular issue again. While 
the issue itself is a very tight one in the sense of dealing with 
constitutional change, it is interesting to listen to some of the 
arguments about what a major issue of constitutional change this 
is.
<P>
	It is simply substituting one method of linking Prince Edward 
Island to Canada with another. While the wording that was 
initially done was probably too restrictive we now have an 
opportunity to correct that situation and yet we hear arguments 
that this is a major constitutional change which is going to shake 
the fabric of the nation. I must look at that with some chagrin 
and state that this is not a fundamental constitutional argument.
<P>
	This is simply whether we are going to change the method of 
linking part of Canada's inhabitants with the rest of Canada's 
inhabitants. The term fixed link in my view is probably a bit of a 
misnomer as well. It conjures up causeways and tunnels and 
linkages. This is a bridge, mind you a big bridge, but just a 
bridge and it is going to join Prince Edward Island with the rest 
of Canada.
<P>
	We have used ferry service before and now we are going to use 
a bridge. I do not know why we are all uptight about the method 
of linking Canadians with Canadians.
<P>
	If we are going to argue some of the issues we have to be fair. I 
heard one of the members opposite talk about how the subsidy 
which is going to support the fixed link is going to be double the 
cost of the present subsidy.
<P>
	What you have to factor into those numbers is a capital 
allocation that must go in with those numbers and therefore 
when we actually compare subsidies of the fixed link and the 
ferry service they are equal
<P>
	We also have to face the reality that if we do not have the 
bridge we are going to need new ferries and there is a very large 
expenditure of moneys necessary to bring those ferries up to 
acceptable service over the next 35 years.
<P>
	We are not comparing doing nothing with doing this particular 
bridge project.
<P>
	I think we also have to look at the situation and its impact on 
Atlantic Canada. The short term impact is great economic 
activity, spending large sums of money. We are going to see 70 
per cent of the procurement come from Atlantic Canada which is 
going to be beneficial to the people who right now have one of 
the largest levels of unemployment in the country.
<P>
	We are going to see 2,675 construction related jobs created in 
Atlantic Canada and that is going to be beneficial. Upwards of 
90 per cent of all labour will come from people who live or will 
live in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	This is not just a five-year project and then it disappears. 
There are tremendous spin-off benefits which are going to assist 
in the tourism industry. Projections indicate that upwards of a 25 
per cent increase will be achieved in the tourism industry.
<P>
	We will also see tremendous savings and I am sure that the 
Reform Party would like to support savings. We have heard 
members of the government side talk about the delays, 
transportation costs. Any industry that is tied in to 
transportation as part of the cost of doing business is going to be 
happy with this project. I believe the estimate is something like 
$10 million annually that will be saved by people who are tied in 
to the transportation side of this problem.
<P>
	In addition, this project is going to create some very high tech 
jobs. We build one of these projects and we actually have a 
spin-off of high tech jobs both in the engineering side of things 
and in the labouring side where people learn how to work on a 
construction facility such as this one.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	In that sense, we are going to have a double benefit, the short 
term benefit of the actual construction and the long term benefit 
in tourism. There will be savings in the area of transportation 
and also the development of new technology and an educated 
work force that will be able to export that knowledge and ability 
around the world.
<P>
	I say to those doomsayers who say that it is not time to go 
ahead and that we should rethink our position on this project, we 
have been rethinking this thing for upwards of 35 to 40 years. It 
is time for some action. This is a project that Atlantic Canada 
made. It is going to benefit Atlantic Canada. I see the members 
opposite shaking their heads. They are more concerned with 
their region rather than helping Atlantic Canada to pull itself up 
by its own boot straps.
<P>
	I say to the hon. members, get on board, support this project 
and make Atlantic Canada one of the stronger participants in 
this Confederation. Do not try to keep us down on the farm or 
locked up on the island. This is a minor constitutional change. It 
needs your support not your negative talk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member's statement.
<P>
	Being from British Columbia, I was just wondering if the hon. 
member could explain to the people of British Columbia, with 
Vancouver Island and all of the economic activity, population 
and traffic which has to travel back and forth between 
Vancouver Island and the mainland, how B.C. is able to sustain 
its economic activity and provide a good enough service with 
ferries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1399"> 1399 </A></B>
<P>
	I have no problem with the bridge if it is the most economic 
way to go about it, but I am not convinced that is the case.
<P>
	I would like the member to explain to the people of British 
Columbia how Vancouver Island can be serviced more than 
adequately with good ferry service but we need this fixed link 
for Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rideout:</B> Madam Speaker, the member opposite has 
raised one of the unique things about Canada and that is that we 
can have differences. Obviously the folks on Vancouver Island 
like having the ferry service. Obviously the people of Prince 
Edward Island would rather have a bridge.
<P>
	I would say to the member that if at some point the people on 
Vancouver Island decide that they want to have a bridge they 
should approach their provincial government for one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
somewhat surprised at the way the debate is developing, 
especially when you consider that, during the election and 1992 
referendum campaigns, the Reform Party was a staunch 
advocate of a Senate based on equality, political equality, which 
means equal representation for all provinces, including, we 
were told, Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	However, there is also such a thing as economic equality. The 
hon. member for St. Boniface made a brilliant presentation on 
the economic aspects, and arguments were made by government 
members as well as by some of my colleagues from the Bloc 
Quebecois. I really wonder what is going on? In the country that 
Canada still is, why should some regions be treated differently 
on the basis of their population. It seems to me that some would 
want to penalize Prince Edward Island on the ground that its 
population of 120,000 or 130,000 does not justify building a link 
which has been the subject of so many studies, environmental 
assessments, reviews and even court decisions. Yet, if there is a 
decision which was based on an extensive review of the situation 
in Atlantic Canada, it is probably this one. As far as I am 
concerned, whether or not we like the idea of a bridge, a tunnel 
or some other fixed crossing between Prince Edward Island and 
the continent is irrelevant.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The residents of Prince Edward Island have made a decision 
which we must respect. Consequently I ask the hon. member: 
Why does he not want to respect the decision made by those who 
live on P.E.I.?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rideout:</B> Madam Speaker, I agree with the comments of 
the member opposite. The debate has taken a strange turn. 
Hopefully as it continues some of my colleagues opposite will 
see the wisdom of the bridge, get on line and support the project. 
I gather that one of the  benefits of being a Reformer is they can 
have free votes. Hopefully we will see a few of them come 
across and support us on this very worthwhile project.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Kamloops-Small Business; the hon. member 
for Wetaskiwin-House of Commons; the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway-Cruise Missile Testing; the hon. member 
for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve-Electronic Highway; the hon. 
member for Yukon-Health Care.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to 
speak in favour of this constitutional amendment which allows 
the federal government to live up to the terms of the 
constitutional agreement with Prince Edward Island with a 
mode of transportation infrastructure that is geared to the year 
2000 and beyond.
<P>
	I want to make it clear at the beginning that the legislative 
assembly in Prince Edward Island unanimously adopted the 
necessary constitutional amendment in June of last year with the 
full understanding the Parliament of Canada would proceed with 
an amendment as soon as possible. Parliament is living up to its 
commitment and I am pleased by the amount of support from 
both sides of the House.
<P>
	Part of the reason for the support is that a lot of Canadians 
off-island want to link up with us rather than the other way 
around. I encourage all members of Parliament to come to 
Prince Edward Island before and after the fixed link is in place, 
spend a few of their hard earned dollars, have some of the best 
potatoes grown in Canada; see some of scenery and have some 
of our lobster. I am getting a little off track blowing up the 
merits of our wonderful isle. We certainly want it to remain that.
<P>
	This new bridge enters my riding at the community of Borden. 
I am well aware of the controversy past and present that 
surrounds the project. The impact of the construction and the 
completion of the fixed link will be felt first by the people in my 
riding and most directly by the people in the community of 
Borden.
<P>
	The issue of the fixed link connecting P.E.I. has been under 
consideration at one time or another since 1885 when the 
possibility of a tunnel connecting the island was first 
considered. I do not mind admitting up front that first I favoured 
a tunnel and I had to be convinced to favour a bridge. I will say 
that the evidence and public opinion now in Prince Edward 
Island is very strongly supportive of the bridge.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1400"> 1400 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	I have had a considerable amount of indirect involvement 
with the Borden-Cape Tormentine ferry crossing. My father 
worked for CN Rail, later Marine Atlantic, as a deck hand and 
eventually a quartermaster for 32 years on that crossing. From 
age 12, as many youth did, we would drive back and forth on the 
car ferries. I have had first hand experience of the delays, of 
being stuck in the ice for as long as 18 hours. As a result of that 
experience I recognize the uniqueness of that particular area. 
Nowhere else in the world will one find the combination of 
wind, tides and ice there is where this bridge is going to be built.
<P>
	It is for those reasons that I had to be convinced and looked so 
seriously at this project with a very critical eye. I have looked at 
the studies concerning the environment, the ice conditions, the 
fisheries, the socioeconomic impact and so on. This morning the 
minister outlined the number and breadth of the studies. I can 
tell the House of the very extensive public consultations on 
Prince Edward Island of those studies and of the bridge.
<P>
	During the election campaign I found a sense of optimism as a 
result of the project, due to the fact that there would be an 
expected increase in economic activity during construction and 
improved transportation infrastructure following construction. 
There were concerns, and I do not think we can sweep those 
under the rug, from the ferry workers, from the fishermen and 
from the people of Borden. We cannot brush them off. They are 
very real concerns in the minds of those people and must be 
addressed. As a result of the studies, government has moved to 
address them in a number of areas. I want to put on the record the 
way they will be addressed.
<P>
	As a result of the environmental review the government 
determined that the construction and the presence of the bridge 
will result in no significant impact on the environment and the 
fishery. In order to overcome the difficulty the developer has 
been required to set aside $10 million as a compensation fund. 
This fund will be administered according to the terms and 
process currently being developed by a fisheries liaison 
committee composed of a majority of fishermen.
<P>
	Quite a number of Marine Atlantic ferry workers will lose 
their jobs. That is reality. The government has made the 
commitment that these employees will be treated fairly and 
equitably. They will have first right of refusal for the bridge 
operation and maintenance jobs. A fair severance package will 
be negotiated between the workers union and Marine Atlantic. 
The government will provide opportunities for retraining, and 
relocation assistance will be made available if necessary. A joint 
consultative committee has been set up to co-ordinate the 
activities dealing with the ferry workers.
<P>
	As well, we have to address the concerns of the community of 
Borden. That is happening on an ongoing basis. One of the last 
studies done looked at the specifics of the project relating to 
SCI's bridge proposal and it passed the test. Justice Cullen of the 
Federal Court stated the following in his ruling with respect to 
the efforts of Friends of the Island to prevent the project from 
proceeding with respect to scientific studies and I think it is 
important to put that statement on the record: ``The scientific 
evidence relied on by Public Works Canada declared all 
environmental impacts or potential environmental impacts were 
insignificant.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	The respondent SCI and Public Works accepted those 
findings, were correct in doing so and thus the decision of Public 
Works was correct in law and certainly not made in a vacuum''.
<P>
	Other members have spoken of the economic impact and 
spin-off so I will not repeat those facts and figures. However in 
the long term after 1997 completion there should be economic 
benefits, savings to transportation costs in the trucking industry 
and more reliable product delivery for our agriculture, fisheries 
and manufacturing products. After all transportation is 
necessary in the delivery of goods to market. We have four years 
to go. I mentioned in a question to a speaker earlier this 
afternoon there are major concerns at the moment and major 
delays in getting our products to the marketplace.
<P>
	The government has committed itself to ensuring that the 
risks to the environment and the fishery are minimized. It has 
committed itself to ensuring that any of Marine Atlantic's work 
force displaced by the completion of the bridge will be assisted 
through retraining, relocation assistance and early retirement 
programs.
<P>
	I want to touch on one final point. It is the growing sense 
among some islanders that the link, combined with the possible 
loss of air traffic control service on the island, could lead 
progressively toward a diminishing sense of full provincial 
status. We may need at some point a full review of the 
transportation infrastucture throughout the Atlantic region, one 
that will allow all the stakeholders to participate in developing a 
system that will benefit the region going into the next century.
<P>
	In conclusion, this project is an investment in our future. This 
amendment is part of the process to allow that to happen.
<P>

inconsistent.

best of them, that one would not get  with a bridge. On the other 
hand, one will not get the sort of wind delays, winter or summer, 
with ferries that one will get with this bridge.
<P>
	The only bridge I am personally familiar with which is in any 
way comparable is the one across the Straits of Mackinaw. It is 
often closed because it is impassable in bad weather conditions. 
By going a couple of hundred miles out of their way drivers can 
get around but it is pretty hard to get around Northumberland 
Strait. Again I am trying to look at this from a practical, realistic 
point of view. I would like the hon. member's comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Madam Speaker, in Prince Edward Island we 
look at the investment and economic activity of this link project 
in the very short term.
<P>
	The minister outlined creating jobs this morning. He talked 
about 70 per cent procurement expenditures in the Atlantic area. 
Ninety-six per cent of the jobs will go to that area so there will 
be an economic boost in the initial stages of the project as a 
result of the expenditure of funds.
<P>
	Our concern in the study on ice was what ice could do to the 
bridge. We were assured by all the experts that the bridge will be 
able to withstand the pressure of that ice.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	The fishermen have another real concern: if the bridge delays 
the ice moving out of the strait it would have an impact on the 
lobster fishery in terms of the waters remaining cooler and the 
lobsters therefore remaining dormant for a longer period of 
time. It would have an impact on lobsters.
<P>
	Studies have clearly shown that the ice delay would be very 
limited and would have minimal effect, if any, on the lobster 
fishery.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. The 
hon. member misunderstood my question. When I talked of ice 
delay I meant delays to ferries due to the presence of ice in the 
channel. I was not referring to delayed breakup of the ice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Madam Speaker, I will just make a comment on 
that. Certainly we are familiar with the ice delays to ferries these 
days. As I mentioned earlier this afternoon, truckers at the 
moment are having anywhere from a three-hour to five-hour 
extra wait due to a slowdown in ferry movement because of ice 
congestion at the terminal and so many trucks moving. Under 
the current scenario with the ferries and the ice it becomes an 
extremely difficult situation in terms of getting product to 
market on time and in an efficient way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to make a statement to the 
House and I wonder if I might have unanimous consent for that 
purpose.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent of the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Madam Speaker, I am indebted to my 
colleagues for their consent.
<P>
	I would like to take the opportunity this afternoon to respond 
to concerns raised this morning in the course of this debate by 
the hon. Leader of the Opposition. He raised concerns arising 
from the translation and a possible different meaning between 
the French and English texts of the constitutional amendment. 
The Department of Justice has now provided an opinion by those 
persons who are drafting experts in matters of this kind.
<P>
	It is the opinion of the Department of Justice that the French 
text and specifically the word ``remplace'' is in the subjunctive 
tense and as such imports a possibility. In other words the 
French text, according to the Department of Justice, says 
nothing more or less than the English text which reads: ``may be 
substituted''.
<P>
	I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition for having 
raised the matter. We respect his concerns but we believe they 
are groundless. I appreciate this opportunity to clarify any 
possible misinterpretation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this constitutional amendment which the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada and 
Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency put 
forward under section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982.
<P>
	I am one of the last members scheduled to speak. I hope that 
the parliamentary secretary of the government party will listen 
to what I have to say. While I will be going over some ground 
that has already been covered, toward the end of my speech, I 
will be voicing several opinions which subsequently will have to 
be analysed.
<P>
	The amendment in question provides for a fixed crossing 
joining Prince Edward Island to the mainland to be substituted 
for the ferry service between Cape Tormentine and Borden. It 
should be noted that one of the terms of Prince Edward Island's 
entry into Confederation was that efficient steam service for the 
conveyance of mail and passengers be established and 
maintained between the Island and the mainland, winter and 
summer, thus placing the Island in continuous communication 
with the Intercolonial Railway and the railway system of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	In 1873 the realization came about that the terms and 
conditions for admission into Confederation, namely the 
promise of efficient steam service, were not being adhered to.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1402"> 1402 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1877 Ottawa agreed to pay a subsidy for the operation of a 
steam ferry boat. The <I>Northern Light</I> was put into service in the 
Northumberland Strait.
<P>
	The idea of building a tunnel under the strait to maintain 
year-round communication was first bandied about in the early 
1880s. However, with the introduction of ice-breaking ferries in 
1917-18, the problem of ensuring continuous communication 
was resolved and the idea of establishing what we now refer to as 
a fixed link was abandoned for the moment. Only then were 
ferries pressed into service twelve months of the year.
<P>
	The amendment in question provides for a fixed crossing 
joining Prince Edward Island to the mainland to be substituted 
for the ferry service between Cape Tormentine and Borden.
<P>
	Let me start by saying that it is rather significant that we find 
ourselves having to debate a constitutional amendment, since 
the present government refuses to discuss any amendments to 
the Constitution which, as noted in section 52 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982, is the supreme law of Canada.
<P>
	In a famous ruling, the Judicial Committee of the Privy 
Council in London compared the Canadian Constitution to a tree 
capable of growing within its natural confines. History has 
proven otherwise. It has taken more than a century for us to get 
around to debating here in the House the construction of a fixed 
link between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	As much as we want to muzzle debate on the Constitution, the 
subject keeps coming up because it is part of an evolving 
process. A country is not frozen in time. It is constantly 
evolving. The constitutional amendment sought under section 
43 of the Constitution Act, 1982, is an integral part of section 38 
and subsequent sections which set out the process for amending 
the Canadian Constitution. We cannot help but recall 1982 and 
the painful memories it conjures up for Quebec. We cannot help 
but remember the rejection of the Meech Lake Accord and the 
rejection by all Canadians of the Charlottetown Accord.
<P>
	This amendment put forward by the government shows us that 
constitutional talks cannot be relegated to the back burner and 
that it is impossible to artificially stop a process which, by 
definition, is constantly evolving.
<P>
	This constitutional amendment will put Prince Edward Island 
in contact with the mainland through the establishment of a 
fixed link. And I am very happy for island residents.
<P>
	Representatives of the federal government and Strait 
Crossing Development Inc., an international consortium, have 
signed a contract valued at $840 million for the construction of a 
bridge. It will cost approximately $800 million to build the 
bridge, while $40 million will go to cover interest charges 
during the three-year construction period.
<P>
	Since the debate began this morning we have heard the same 
speeches. However, the facts cannot be disputed.
<P>
	The proposed bridge will be 13 kilometres long. This 
superstructure will replace the ferry service between Cape 
Tormentine, New Brunswick, and Borden, Prince Edward 
Island.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	It is a fact that the province was given guarantees under the 
Constitution regarding links with the continent. Today, a ferry 
service is provided by Marine Atlantic, a Crown corporation. 
Responsibility for financing, building and operating a bridge 
connecting New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island was given 
to Strait Crossing Development, a Canadian company. The 
company will receive an annual federal subsidy of $41.9 million 
in 1992 dollars, this amount to be indexed for 35 years, starting 
in 1997. This works out to a total of nearly $1.5 billion. The 
company obtained financing through a private bond issue worth 
$660 million. The bonds have a triple-A rating, the best 
guarantee the banks can have.
<P>
	Although I agree with this amendment, since we are bound by 
one of the terms of union under which Prince Edward Island 
entered Confederation in 1873, I nevertheless have some 
reservations about the project. The cost of the ferry service 
operated today by Marine Atlantic, a Crown corporation, is 
around $28 million. There are some substantial differences here. 
The bridge subsequently becomes the property of the federal 
government. The agreement provides that the federal 
government will acquire ownership of the bridge in 2032. In 
what condition will the bridge be at that point? That is certainly 
a question we can address in the House. Does the government 
have sufficient guarantees that the bridge will be handed over in 
good condition and that it will not have to invest in extending its 
useful life?
<P>
	During the first year, tolls will equal the rate charged for the 
ferry, which is $11.05. Subsequently, increases should not 
exceed 75 per cent of the rate of inflation. The promoter will 
collect the toll fees. At this point, one wonders whether this is a 
firm commitment or whether the door is still open for 
renegotiating rates if traffic remains below the forecast levels.
<P>
	Economic spin-offs will include about 2,675 person-years of 
work during construction, or 900 to 1,000 jobs annually with a 
construction season of about nine months. As we said earlier, 96 
per cent of the labour force will be from Atlantic Canada. 
However, what will happen after completion of the project? Is it 
back to the vicious circle of unemployment insurance and 
welfare? Will tourist revenues be sufficient to prevent this?
<P>
	The government admits that about 420 permanent employees 
with Marine Atlantic will lose their jobs when the bridge is 
opened to traffic and that only 60 jobs will be created. This 
means a net loss of about 360 jobs. Further costs are expected, 
including negotiating service allowances and funding for re-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1403"> 1403 </A></B>
<P>
training and relocation, if necessary. We do not have the answers 
to these questions yet.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	It will cost $10 million to compensate fishermen. A 
federal-provincial agreement respecting the construction of the 
fixed crossing was entered into by the Government of Canada 
and the provinces of Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick.
<P>
	Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick will each receive 
$20.4 million toward upgrading their road system. Is equal 
treatment to be expected for all of Canada? Finally, the 
communities of Borden and Cape Tormentine will receive a 
special development fund of up to $20 million.
<P>
	Some 70 per cent of the construction materials for the bridge 
will be purchased in Prince Edward Island. The delivery of fish 
and farm products will no doubt improve. Tourism is expected to 
increase by 25 per cent. Are these estimates based on genuine 
studies, studies demonstrating the feasibility of this project? 
And the island's shipping industry will save $10 million a year 
according to the Liberal Party. I doubt it.
<P>
	Of course, we must not overlook the effects of building such a 
structure will have on shipping, wildlife, fish, migratory birds, 
agriculture and ice.
<P>
	God forbid that this project become another Hibernia, a 
project which has swallowed up in excess of $1 billion in public 
and private funds to date, for the federal government 
contribution to that project presented some fundamental flaws 
as the Auditor General pointed out in his 1992 report. He 
described the Hibernia project as high-risk due to the 
uncertainty of prices as well as technological and environmental 
factors. We hope that the construction of the bridge will not be 
plagued with the same problems.
<P>
	With regard to the bridge project, Parliament and more 
importantly the public should be provided with quality reports 
throughout the project so that corrective action can be taken 
immediately, as required. A work schedule should be submitted 
to Parliament and a special House committee should follow the 
progress made in all areas-financing, construction per se, 
deadlines, environmental studies-and report to the House at 
specific times.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that taking these comments into 
consideration and supporting this amendment will take care of a 
long-standing request. I hope that the Prince Edward Island 
bridge project is built on solid ground because we will be the 
rightful owners of this infrastructure 35 years from now.
<P>
	To be a good deal, this project must be accompanied by a 
comprehensive set of clear and measurable objectives; 
sufficient co-ordination of monitoring of industrial benefits 
must be put in place; environmental damage must be kept to a 
minimum throughout the  project and the rights of the fishermen 
must be preserved during the entire process.
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, hope that the minister will take 
into consideration the points I have just raised and, in the near 
future, respond favourably in this House to the suggestion of 
setting up a special House committee, as major investments are 
at stake and it is essential to monitor carefully the use made of 
Canadian taxpayers' money and hopefully preserve steady, 
structuring and paying jobs for the young people.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first, I would like to congratulate the members of the 
Official Opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, on the facility with 
which they turn any subject discussed here in the House to their 
advantage and bring it around to the only debate that concerns 
them, their only goal and objective, which is independence and 
the separation of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Serré:</B> I am glad that they applaud when I talk about 
separation and independence, because I see that you are sending 
a clear, unambiguous message: Quebec independence is what 
you want, not Quebec sovereignty. I am glad to see the reaction 
of my hon. colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	They have that knack and I see the rationalization they used 
for approving this project. They said, ``Because there was a 
plebiscite in Prince Edward Island, we must respect the will of 
the people''. They draw a parallel with a future referendum in 
Quebec. I would like to make a distinction.
<P>
	The project in question is a bridge, a link, something to unite 
Canada and build Canada, something constructive. The eventual 
referendum in Quebec is a plan to destroy bridges and ties in this 
country. These people do not want a constitutional amendment; 
they want the outright destruction of our country, and I will 
never agree to that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Madam Speaker, I must sincerely tell you that I 
thank the hon. member for his comment. Throughout the 
election campaign-and it was publicized in English Canada 
and in French Canada, in Quebec and elsewhere-we said that 
while we were here in the House, the Bloc Quebecois's mandate 
was to prepare for Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> We did not refrain from saying and explaining 
that during the election campaign. Our leader and other 
members are ready to explain this position throughout Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1404"> 1404 </A></B>
<P>
	Our action and our position today is not to destroy what exists 
but to ensure that there is some fairness. There was something 
unfair about Prince Edward Island's treatment. Today, we are 
trying to repair that error which has lasted over 100 years. So we 
are also seeking this same fairness for the province of Quebec in 
various fields and social areas from the federal government. I 
think that is what our distinguished members on the government 
side do not like; for once, the voice of Quebec is being heard in 
this House defending and safeguarding its interests and giving 
all of Canada clear, precise, unambiguous positions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Therefore, I give the 
floor to the hon. member for Davenport, for a question or a 
comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> No, Madam Speaker, I would like to make a 
speech.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In that case I cannot 
give you the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to make a 
comment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Certainly but are you in 
your seat?
<P>
	I am sorry. I do not want to make fun of you, but you must 
speak from your seat. Twice already members have spoken when 
they were not where they should have been.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He is where he is supposed to be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have never been so properly told off.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I want to comment on the excellent speech by our colleague. I 
could not help making the link with the speech of the previous 
speaker.
<P>
	I imagine that if we, the Official Opposition, had done any 
kind of filibustering regarding this motion, which is so 
important for the quality of life of Prince Edward Island 
residents, we would have been criticized and accused of being 
anti-democratic, of not respecting the result of the referendum, 
and of refusing to promote the democratic process in this 
country.
<P>
	Now that we are co-operating with the government, and I 
think it takes some audacity to rise in this House to say that, 
because we are co-operating with the government, we are 
branded as being biased and anti-democratic and as wanting to 
side-track the debate.
<P>
	We must be clear, and this is essentially what the previous 
speaker meant. There cannot be two types of democracies in this 
country: one which suits English Canada and government 
members, and one which suits the government.
<P>
	The support of the Official Opposition is clearly meant to 
convince the government to make the decision it should make 
for the population of Prince Edward Island. It goes without 
saying that we respect the outcome of any referendum. After all, 
we nationalists accepted  the verdict in 1980 when Quebec's 
National Assembly, which was the first one in the country to 
pass legislation on such public consultations, held its 
referendum.
<P>
	That verdict was not favourable to us, but in a democracy, win 
or lose, you must accept the decision of a public vote. 
Consequently, we accept the decision made by the people of 
Prince Edward Island. In the next few years, when Quebec holds 
a referendum to democratically decide its future, I hope that the 
hon. member, as well as all the members opposite, will accept 
the result of that democratic process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Madam Speaker-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We are not going to have 
a debate between two members of the same party. Do you have a 
brief comment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
make a brief comment since I realize the time for questions and 
comments is about to expire.
<P>
	I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary to consider the 
questions I raised in my speech. I do not want to turn this into a 
nationalist debate. I am sure that the Department of Public 
Works will look at each of these issues and try to deal with them, 
and that a special committee of the House will be appointed to 
monitor the entire project.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Madam Speaker, to 
improve the movement of people to and from beautiful Prince 
Edward Island it seems to me there is an alternative which is 
safer, environmentally preferable and less expensive than the 
proposed bridge. It is an alternative that would create more jobs 
in the long term. That alternative is an improved ferry service.
<P>
	Let me outline the advantages of improving the ferry service 
versus building a bridge 14 kilometres long which in winter and 
early spring would mean keeping a passage open under very 
difficult climatic conditions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1405"> 1405 </A></B>
<P>
	An improved ferry service would cost an estimated $36 
million a year. That includes the continual replacement of 
vessels and building a capital fund for making the ferry 
replacement fund sustainable.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	By contrast, the proposed bridge would cost $42 million a 
year for 35 years which, if my mathematics are correct, would 
amount to $1.47 billion. The difference between the two 
approaches amounts to a saving of some $210 million over 35 
years in favour of the improved ferry service.
<P>
	Also there is the question of additional road construction. The 
improved ferry service will not require such expenditures. 
However, by contrast, the bridge will require an expenditure of 
some $41 million. That is another saving amounting to $41 
million.
<P>
	Then there is the compensation to the towns of Borden and 
Cape Tormentine. The improved ferry service would not require 
such compensation but, by contrast, the bridge requires an 
estimated $20 million for the link. The continued ferry service 
does not require compensation to municipalities. This is another 
saving amounting to the $20 million I just mentioned.
<P>
	If we add all these items the ferry option would result in 
saving some $271 million without taking into account cost 
overruns estimated to be as high as $550 million and without 
taking into account unemployment insurance plus training and 
relocation of ferry workers for an estimated total of some $25 
million.
<P>
	Having compared the financial aspect let me briefly compare 
the question of jobs. During the next 35 years, in the case of the 
improved ferry system there are likely to be some 8,200 person 
years in jobs that could be created in the form of refitting and 
building new ferries. By contrast, during that same period the 
bridge would generate only 2,400 person years in terms of 
construction jobs.
<P>
	After the 35-year period and once the bridge has been 
completed the job picture would be as follows. The improved 
ferry service would provide an estimated 400 year-round jobs 
and an additional 325 summer operating jobs. These figures 
were provided by the union. By contrast, the bridge after 
completion would provide only an estimated 60 to 80 operating 
jobs. In essence the emerging employment picture is very much 
in favour of the improved ferries alternative because it would 
provide more jobs than the proposed bridge, namely 5,800 more 
person years during the next 35 years, an estimated 340 more 
jobs in winter and an estimated 645 more jobs thereafter in 
summer.
<P>
	On the democratic process used in arriving at the decision to 
build the bridge, the public was consulted on a link which many 
understood to mean a tunnel or a bridge. A consultation on the 
construction of the bridge did not take place. Actually my 
understanding is that the vote on this consultation was 
considerably close: 51 per cent voted in favour, 46 per cent 
voted for the improved  ferry service, and 3 per cent expressed 
an undecided position.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Before concluding it is important to make a brief reference to 
studies related to environmental impacts. The studies that have 
been quoted and used were conducted by the proposing 
department, namely the Department of Public Works. When an 
environmental assessment panel was formed and reported it 
recommended against the idea of the bridge. Its 
recommendations were disregarded.
<P>
	Those of us here today who believe in the increasing 
importance of environmental impact assessment believe it 
incumbent that at least a panel be appointed to examine the 
whole proposal again, to point out the weaknesses of the bridge 
and to determine whether the feasibility of the proposal is such 
to warrant it proceeding.
<P>
	What worries me considerably about this proposal is what 
will happen 35 years after the completion of the construction of 
the bridge when the private consortium will retire and the bridge 
will become public property. Obviously the structure will be 
eroded; salt water has that effect. The public will inherit a 
structure to maintain which most likely will require 
considerable repairs, and that after the public having spent or 
invested some $1.47 billion over the next 35 years for the 
construction of the bridge. A corroded structure is what the next 
generation of politicians and decision makers is likely to inherit 
and what the Canadian public is likely to have to cope with.
<P>
	For all these reasons I believe the alternative of an improved 
ferry system would be more desirable and in the public interest.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Madam Speaker, I get the 
feeling that the party to which I belong caught the government 
party by surprise in deciding to support the amendment before 
the House today. I get the feeling that the government party was 
counting on the opposition of the Bloc Quebecois, and possibly 
even that of the Reform Party, to withdraw a proposal that it did 
not care greatly for. The comments of the hon. member who just 
spoke lead me to believe this is so.
<P>
	I think the government party, the Liberal Party, made 
promises to Maritimers, particularly to the residents of Prince 
Edward Island, in an attempt to win votes, 125,000 votes to be 
exact, not an insignificant number. In making this promise they 
were hoping that the other parties in the House would not 
support them. I think they were caught a little off guard when we 
supported them. I would like to ask the hon. member who just 
spoke if he was trying to extricate himself from this matter 
honourably by recommending a ferry when his party, his 
minister and the minister's parliamentary secretary all seem to 
favour a fixed crossing. I wonder if the government party could 
tell the 
<P>
<HR>

opposition if it wants a bridge, yes or no? We are not sure any 
more.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Madam Speaker, I am surprised that the hon. 
member feels somewhat confused or does not understand that 
the Liberal Party, in keeping with a tradition of allowing 
freedom of thought and opinion, has agreed to an open, honest 
debate on an issue of public importance such as this one. I would 
hope that the same spirit of openness prevails within his party. 
Certain members of the Bloc, notably the distinguished 
environment critic, had the opportunity and were able to express 
their opinion freely this afternoon, particularly on such issues as 
sustainable development and environmental protection.
<P>
	I listened with a great deal of interest to the hon. member 
whose position is similar, if you will, to my own. The views he 
has expressed will enrich the debate taking place in the House 
this afternoon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Madam Speaker, this will be a 
brief comment, just to tell the member of the government party: 
good for them if they are free to express themselves without 
necessarily following the party line. However, within the Bloc 
Quebecois, we had a consensus before the election. We knew 
beforehand on what we agreed and disagreed. We solved our 
problems before; then when we came here, we came as a bloc 
and today we think as a bloc.
<P>
	So if the party in power had thought about it before, perhaps 
you could have made promises that would have seemed more 
sincere to your constituents and today you would not need to 
appear divided.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> I am not aware that in the programs of the Bloc 
Quebecois before the election, all members of the party had 
taken a position in favour of building the bridge. But if such a 
position was indeed taken, I would be very glad to see it, if the 
member wants to show it to me one of these days.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs):</B> Madam Speaker, I am speaking 
today in support of this resolution not because I am following 
the party line. However I listened with great interest to the 
remarks of my colleagues. It is an indication our party is willing 
to accept a diversity of viewpoint. I am not affected in my 
decision because I sit beside the hon. member for Halifax and 
the hon. member for Egmont who are speaking strongly in 
support of the resolution.
<P>
	What we have heard today in the debate reflects a very good 
argument for the fixed link and for the constitutional 
amendment. In terms of jobs we have heard that the proposal 
will create 5,300 jobs over a period of three years. Moreover, we 
have heard that 70 per cent of procurement requirements will be 
filled in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	We have also heard that tourism will be increased-and I say 
in respect to my colleague from Davenport that tourism should 
be considered in this respect-by about 30 per cent during the 
period of the bridge construction and about 25 per cent 
thereafter. This is a significant economic stimulus for a province 
and an area which has suffered greatly in the past decades.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	One of the members opposite mentioned that the project was 
supported by a plebiscite in 1988, six years ago. We have also 
heard requests for consultation. Surely six years and 80 public 
meetings is adequate consultation.
<P>
	We heard other members from Prince Edward Island, 
including the member for Egmont, say there are waiting times of 
three to five hours for the ferries. It affects transportation to the 
island. We also heard the hon. member for Halifax describe how 
she had to party for seven hours on a ferry that could not get 
across the water.
<P>
	These are all impressive arguments which have convinced me 
without question that this proposition should be supported.
<P>
	I come from the province of Ontario as do many other 
members on this side. My province through its support of the 
general revenue will support this project. I have heard several 
comments today which made me think that in this kind of basic 
proposition where we share responsibilities, it is not always 
recognized.
<P>
	Someone suggested this particular project affected all parts of 
Canada because of its need for constitutional amendment and 
the general revenues of Canada would be used and therefore it 
should be subject to the interests of all of Canada. That member 
who comes from the province of British Columbia should recall 
there have been many items of this kind in the past, including a 
case in the province of British Columbia.
<P>
	When British Columbia entered Confederation there was an 
agreement in the terms of union for British Columbia that a 
railway would be built with subsidies amounting to $50 million, 
enormous sums at that time equal to the total general revenue of 
Canada. That is in the Constitution, just of course as the ferries 
were in 1873.
<P>
	We have an obligation along these same lines. When a 
constitutional amendment which so clearly affects a single 
province or two provinces in this case, for the sake of the 
efficiency of the Constitution such bilateral amendments should 
proceed without requiring even more protracted consultation or 
negotiation in the constitutional realm.
<P>
	The people of Prince Edward Island have waited a long time 
for a bridge. We heard from one hon. member earlier that it was 
over 100 years ago in the 1880s when a fixed link of a certain 
kind was first proposed. It was again proposed in the 1950s and 
1960s. In those cases it did not come to fruition. Many other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1407"> 1407 </A></B>
<P>
things did in that period, including the CPR and the 
transcontinental railways. It would seem they were not in the 
best interests of Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	If Prince Edward Island has 138,000 people as someone 
referred to earlier, that is a population larger than that of the 
province of Saskatchewan or part of the Northwest Territories 
when the commitment was made to build the CPR or the Grand 
Trunk Pacific or other railways.
<P>
	I do not think it stands simply because the population is of the 
order of 130,000 that this is an enclave and that long term 
commitments this country has made to that wonderful island 
should not be honoured in the most modern ways possible. It 
seems to me this is a very modern way of recognizing the 
commitment we made to maintain a 
communication-transportation link with Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	This morning I toured the Department of External Affairs and 
saw the communications system it is replacing at very great 
cost. I was reminded by the person leading the tour that this 
simply has to be done. It is essential because the link with the 
rest of the world has to be as modern as possible. Here too we 
have no choice. Indeed we have a greater obligation, a moral 
obligation to go through with this project.
<P>
	In summary this fixed link will provide a stimulus to the 
economy of the province that currently requires the largest 
amount of federal government subsidy per capita. It will create 
jobs. It will give an economic boost in procurement, in direct 
jobs and in long term tourism jobs.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	We all know about Prince Edward Island from Anne of Green 
Gables. All of us should have the benefit of visiting that 
wonderful and unique part of Canada. In the case of tourism this 
country is running a deficit on the current account of about $10 
billion. This is an extraordinarily large deficit, one that costs us 
enormously over the long term. Prince Edward Island is one part 
of Canada where tourism has been successful. With this bridge it 
will be even more successful.
<P>
	For that reason I believe the project taken in the longest 
term-and here I dissent from the view of my colleague from 
Davenport-is economically sensible and feasible. The benefits 
will be indirect and long term but they are important to the 
people of Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	As some hon. members have pointed out, the subsidy will be 
larger than the current one, but it would be no more than the cost 
of replacing the ferries.
<P>
	Finally, it is important to carry out the long term 
commitments that have been made to Prince Edward Island to 
link that part of Canada with this part in the most modern and 
efficient way possible. It seems to me this proposal meets those 
obligations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very interested in the comments the hon. member 
made about efficiency. I wonder if he is aware that water freight 
is ten times as efficient as truck or highway. Where is the cost of 
efficiency coming from by moving products from the island to 
the mainland?
<P>
	Has the member done any cost study on how much extra will 
be spent in moving produce from the island to the mainland?
<P>
	<B>Mr. English:</B> Madam Speaker, I have not done any studies but 
I am aware that water transportation is much cheaper for much 
longer distances. However I would say that anyone who has 
waited for a ferry as opposed to crossing a bridge knows one is a 
great deal easier and more efficient than the other.
<P>
	We heard personal accounts from some hon. members who 
have had to wait for ferries. We heard about the three to five hour 
waits and other complaints about the ferry service. Currently it 
is not efficient. I do not think we are living up to our obligation 
that was first made in 1873 and has been made several times 
since then.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member made 
reference to the inconvenience of waiting for ferries. I have 
waited for lots of ferries. I have also waited for bridges to be 
opened when they were closed because of the weather. It did not 
make any difference. It was just as inconvenient and just as 
uncomfortable waiting for one as waiting for the other.
<P>
	The hon. member made reference to tourism. If this is going 
to be such a boon to tourism, I wonder why tourism operators on 
the island are campaigning to keep the Caribou Point ferry 
operating even if the bridge is built. They believe the tourists 
want tourism. They do not want just to get from point <I>a</I> to point <I>b</I> 
like a load of Prince Edward Island potatoes going to market; 
they enjoy the ferry. That was actually brought to my attention 
by a study done by a noted economist from the maritimes, Dr. 
Peter Townley from Acadia University who has panned this 
monument to vanity at every opportunity.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. English:</B> Madam Speaker, I too have waited for ferries 
and have waited to cross bridges. However, studies in this case 
have indicated that it is more efficient.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1408"> 1408 </A></B>
<P>
	On the question of tourism, while it may be true that in 
specific places there may be some thought that a ferry crossing 
is a tourist event of some significance, one does not, to quote the 
hon. member's words, feel like a sack of potatoes on a ferry. I 
would think the majority of tourists would dissent from that 
view.
<P>
	It certainly seems to be true that the people of Prince Edward 
Island dissent from that view. There will be more tourism. There 
will be more economic activity. All of the studies seem to 
confirm that view. The people of Prince Edward Island 
expressed that view in the plebiscite.
<P>
	In that respect the hon. member may have a particular case, 
but it is not the general case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is indeed a privilege to participate in this 
debate on the amendment to the Canadian Constitution as it 
relates to the Prince Edward Island terms of union.
<P>
	I have had two occasions to visit Prince Edward Island. My 
stays were not long enough. The first time I arrived by air and 
the second time I arrived on the island by ferry.
<P>
	The island is beautiful. The residents of Prince Edward Island 
have much to be proud of. There are a lot of farmers on the 
island. Earlier we heard from the hon. member for Malpeque 
whom I notice has the same problem as I do in that he forgets to 
button up his jacket when he is speaking before the House. It 
must be a weakness of those of us who have earned our living by 
farming. I would also just mention that the best bowl of clam 
chowder I have ever had was in Charlottetown, Prince Edward 
Island.
<P>
	I am not opposed to Charlottetown. I am not opposed to Prince 
Edward Island. I am not opposed to building and I am not even 
opposed to this project in principle. However I believe it is time 
to look at the process, to look at cost and to assess whether this is 
the right decision for Canada at this time.
<P>
	Some constitutional issues have been brought forward by 
other speakers, particularly from our caucus. I totally concur 
with the member for Calgary West who questioned why this was 
such an important issue but Senate reform had to be put on the 
back burner.
<P>
	Senate reform seems to be taboo in the House as far as the 
government is concerned, while amendments to the Constitution 
that affect Prince Edward Island, that have affected New 
Brunswick in relation to language laws in the last Parliament 
seem to be no problem whatsoever. The discussion on property 
rights in this House seems to be taboo and cannot be brought 
forward. However the principle of aboriginal self-government 
seems to be quite appropriate and has been discussed at length in 
this House.
<P>
	I do not want to dwell on constitutional issues. I believe the 
fiscal crunch facing Canada is the priority for most Canadians. I 
would like to make my address primarily on the fiscal aspects of 
this project and the priorization we as Canadians and we as 
members of Parliament need to expose ourselves to.
<P>
	Megaprojects are wonderful. They grab headlines. A 
megaproject was completed in my riding. It had been promised 
for many elections before it was completed. Finally in the 1988 
election it was promised and actually was completed, at 
considerably more cost than was projected I might add. In fact 
governments have been trying to opt out of funding this 
megaproject because they were not able to meet the estimated 
cost of the project. However megaprojects do grab headlines. 
They are vote getters and attention getters.
<P>
	Unfortunately tax relief for the middle class does not seem to 
be as popular. It does not seem to get the headlines. Therefore 
politicians and governments tend to forget about that aspect 
when projecting the business of this House and introducing 
orders and bills.
<P>
	A few thousand very costly jobs seem to be quite an attention 
getter. From what I am able to determine the cost of each job 
created, and these are just temporary jobs by the way, is 
approximately $310,000 per person year. That is a pretty rich 
plan if you ask me.
<P>
	However long term low unemployment as a strategy does not 
seem to be attainable by this government. It seems to be a much 
lower priority. Oftentimes it seems to be forgotten. We all know 
that the private sector is the job creator and the way to create 
jobs is to reduce the tax burden on our private and small 
businesses so they can generate jobs and lower the 
unemployment situation which is intolerably high.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Hibernia is another megaproject-no problem. As an 
attention getter, a vote buyer it is going ahead. However, can we 
put a cap on federal spending? No, that is just unreasonable. We 
have to forget that.
<P>
	I believe it is time that the government laid out in frank terms 
its priorities to all Canadians. We have had a lot of motherhood 
and apple pie stuff. A lot of it is in the famous red book. The 
naked truth is that as a nation we are over $500 billion in debt. 
That is over half a trillion dollars in debt and it is not a time 
when we can say we would like to do this or that. Rather, it is a 
time of deciding what we must do to maintain a reasonable 
standard of living and pass on a heritage to our children of which 
they can be truly proud.
<P>
	It is time that we as leaders of our country must listen to 
Canadians to find out what their priorities are and then try to 
represent those priorities in this House in the legislation we 
support and in the decisions we make.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1409"> 1409 </A></B>
<P>
	For the past few years Reformers have been listening very 
closely to Canadians to try to determine what those priorities 
might be. We think we have come pretty close to sensing what 
Canadians feel is important and what they would be prepared to 
see go by the way, at least for the time being. After all, I would 
remind this House that our caucus has grown from one member 
to 52. That was no small feat and no accident. It came from 
listening to Canadians and accurately representing their 
concerns in the election and we are responsible to also represent 
those concerns in this House.
<P>
	Let me presume that the priorities of Canadians are also the 
priorities of Canadians on Prince Edward Island. I know that my 
comments do not remain in this assembly. The people of Prince 
Edward Island are watching me. I am not concerned about that 
because I think the aspirations of the people of Prince Edward 
Island are not that different than the aspirations of most 
Canadians. I want to talk about the priorities that I believe are 
the priorities of the residents of Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	I know that most Canadians place a high priority on health 
care. I would just like to relate a little about what is happening in 
my own province of Saskatchewan. We had governments that 
liked to build monuments, that liked to build hospitals. We 
probably have more hospitals per capita in our province than in 
any other part of Canada. Unfortunately, we now have no money 
to operate those hospitals. Our priorities were probably wrong. 
In fact, I am sure they were wrong.
<P>
	I wonder if the residents of Prince Edward Island would trade 
away their health care system to have a bridge to the mainland. It 
is an interesting thought and I have not heard that thought being 
represented by members on the opposite side.
<P>
	Also, there is concern for the need for funding of ongoing 
education, particularly post-secondary education. It is 
important for young people in every province of Canada, 
including Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	Do we want to build a bridge for the young people of Prince 
Edward Island so they can drive across that bridge and go into 
the United States to find quality post-secondary education? Or 
are we going to place a high priority on education within our 
own country even if it means not expending funds to build a 
bridge from New Brunswick to the island?
<P>
	I think of quality of life for our senior citizens. I would like to 
ask senior citizens if they would be prepared to trade their 
Canada pension plan for a bridge or financial security in 
retirement years for another megaproject. These are the types of 
decision, the types of priorities we need to weigh in our minds.
<P>
	Being a small business person, a farmer, I have to weigh the 
benefits of seeing megaprojects go forward or seeing a tax 
structure which I can live and prosper within and make 
reasonable profits for my business.
<P>
	Canada is facing this fiscal crisis and if we as individuals 
were in exactly the same situation we would be very prudent to 
make wise decisions. Unfortunately, governments do not always 
makes those types of wise decisions. Quite often they are 
thinking about buying a yacht rather than keeping up with the 
mortgage payments. As the Canadian government, we must not 
only maintain the mortgage payments but we need to reduce the 
deficit so that the mortgage does not become totally 
uncontrollable.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	That deficit and that debt also affect the residents of Prince 
Edward Island and I am sure that if they have a bridge that the 
country cannot afford to maintain, if they have an economy that 
does not justify the use of that facility, it will be a sorry day and a 
difficult thing to explain to future generations.
<P>
	These are types of illustrations that we as Canadians need to 
hear if we are going to make wise decisions. We do not want the 
International Monetary Fund making those decisions for us. We 
do not want it lowering our credit rating, increasing the cost of 
borrowing all these dollars that we need if governments are 
going to continue funding megaprojects when we are past the 
half-trillion dollar bench mark.
<P>
	I do not want to carry on too much longer in sort of a gloom 
and doom approach. I do not think it is time to be down on 
ourselves but I do believe it is time to make wise decisions as 
Canadians.
<P>
	As Reformers we talked to Canadians and said that we feel 
governments have to cut spending and one area is megaprojects. 
We received broad support for that position right across the 
country. Even in Atlantic Canada we received quite a bit of 
support even though we were fairly new and unknown in that 
part of the country.
<P>
	We preached the same message of fiscal responsibility, of 
placing our priorities on the things that are really important such 
as health and education, care for our seniors and hope for our 
young people.
<P>
	We do not want to erode our reputation of being a country with 
a high standard of living, one that properly cares for its citizens 
and one that meets the most important needs of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I very much appreciate the opportunity to be able to 
enter the debate here today on this important resolution of the 
House, an amendment to the Constitution of Canada relating to 
Prince Edward Island's terms of union.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1410"> 1410 </A></B>
<P>
	It will allow for a fixed crossing joining the island to the 
mainland. For greater certainty, as I quote from the motion 
before the House, nothing prevents the imposition of tolls for 
the use of such a fixed crossing between the island and the 
mainland, or the private operation of such a crossing.
<P>
	The debate today is of great interest to me for several reasons, 
one of which is that I have a great affinity for the island, an 
affinity that goes back to several visits I have made to the island, 
several by ferry and several by air. The people of Prince Edward 
Island are very kind and generous who care an awful lot not only 
about their own island but about Confederation and about this 
country.
<P>
	All members of this House recognize that not all islanders are 
in favour of the fixed link. There are many people who have 
earned their living off the water as fishers, people in the 
Northumberland Strait, and also islanders who enjoy their way 
of life on the farm, a good, quiet rural way of life. They are quite 
satisfied with the ferry service.
<P>
	I was very pleased today to be in the Chamber when the 
member for Davenport spoke eloquently about the alternatives 
that the government has chosen to ignore. One alternative in 
particular calls for an updated ferry service that would allow for 
the prevention of some of the environmental problems that the 
fixed link proposes.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	That is partly the other reason why I am pleased to speak 
today. The whole issue of environmental assessment is one that I 
have spent a great deal of time working on in the previous 
Parliament and something that is of great concern to me.
<P>
	The member for Davenport spoke about the need to take into 
account what environmental assessment means when 
considering the future of major projects that will be discussed 
and taken care of in our country.
<P>
	We have many major projects under way in this country that 
have not been subjected to environmental assessments and 
others that when they have been assessed under strict 
environmental guidelines have been found to be substantially 
inadequate.
<P>
	The point that I will come to very shortly in my remarks 
concerns the failure of the previous government and now 
apparently this government in dealing with this process of 
instituting an environmental assessment process that will ensure 
that we have an adequate response to the needs of the 
environment on projects such as the Northumberland Strait 
bridge.
<P>
	I hesitate to mention the name of the previous Prime Minister 
in this place. Bill C-110, the act respecting the Northumberland 
crossing, an act debated in this House in June of last year and 
passed by this Chamber, was really one of the very last acts of 
the previous government before it adjourned for the summer 
recess that eventually  ended up in a federal election and the 
election of a new government.
<P>
	The record of the previous government on the environment 
left a tremendous amount to be desired. I am quite surprised that 
the new government would pick up exactly where the old 
government left off, especially on a project in which the one 
single federal environmental assessment review of a general 
nature on this project called for the shutdown of this particular 
project, the bridge. I will come to more of that in just a second.
<P>
	I want to acknowledge that I believe something has to be done 
with regard to the access to Prince Edward Island, to improve 
the access to and from the island for products, for tourists and 
for residents.
<P>
	When Bill C-110 was in the House, an act respecting the 
Northumberland crossing that gave the go ahead to proceed with 
the construction prior to this constitutional change, the debate in 
the House was characterized by Mr. Jim Fulton, then the 
member from Skeena, who had quite a number of things to say.
<P>
	I would like to reiterate for the benefit of the House some of 
the things that Mr. Fulton had to say. Mr. Fulton was a long time 
environment critic for the New Democratic Party. As such, Mr. 
Fulton served our party and our nation very well. This speech on 
Bill C-110 at the time was almost Mr. Fulton's last intervention 
in this House prior to his retirement. One could tell from the way 
he approached this issue how important it was to him and how 
important he thought the environmental assessment process was 
to this country.
<P>
	As I had previously stated and argued very strongly at the 
time, the bridge was never assessed by a public panel. All of the 
studies that the government has talked about, the 90 or 91 
studies, were done in a sense by vested interests in the 
Northumberland Strait and in the bridge construction. The 
environmental assessment review process that I have supported 
very strongly in the development of a new Canadian 
environmental assessment act would require independently 
financed environmental assessment for projects such as this.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Fulton referred to the bridge never having been assessed 
by a public panel. As I indicated a few minutes ago, when the 
environmental assessment review office took a look at a general 
concept of it the generic bridge concept was turned down.
<P>
	The Federal Court ordered that there be no irrevocable 
decisions by government until the provisions of the 
environmental assessment review process had been met. 
Members will recall that prior thereto EARP had also been 
avoided in the Kemano project. The Federal Court also found 
that in the Kemano II project the government had acted both 
illegally and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1411"> 1411 </A></B>
<P>
unconstitutionally. We had hoped to avoid that situation with the 
Northumberland link project. Of course that has not happened.
<P>
	I want to raise as well, thanks to some of the notes Mr. Fulton 
set out in the Chamber in June, the case of the Oldman River 
dam. When we look at that project who do we find there but SCI, 
the very same company involved with the fixed link. When it 
came to damming the Oldman River, SCI joined with the 
Government of Alberta and the federal Conservative Party at the 
time in fighting against the public every step of the way until the 
highest court in the land eventually had to rule that there must be 
an environmental assessment of that project.
<P>
	When the assessment took place it ordered that the dam be 
taken down, that it was neither economically nor 
environmentally sound. The same company that did not believe 
in an environmental assessment process in that case has not been 
participating in a public environmental assessment process on 
the Northumberland Strait.
<P>
	I am quite concerned about this matter. As the member for 
Davenport talked about earlier, the environment assessment 
review process is something that must be taken extremely 
seriously as we look at all projects in the future. It is a process in 
which we have to develop some confidence, or the projects we 
have to deal with will constantly come under pressure from the 
public. Their ability to serve the interests of the public will be 
held in jeopardy.
<P>
	Before closing I would like to put on record what I think must 
be involved in a good environmental assessment process. I 
simply want to indicate I do not think we are being well served 
today to accept this constitutional amendment with so many 
questions having been raised about the project, particularly on 
the environmental side. Members of all parties today have 
raised some of those concerns. None of them, other than the 
member for Davenport, have really expressed them in such a 
way that we should not proceed with the project but should carry 
on.
<P>
	Again I would like to quote former member Mr. Fulton who on 
June 15 said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Until Canadians are assured of what are the impacts of the bridge, if those 
impacts can be mitigated and if they can be mitigated what the costs are, we 
cannot start seriously and intelligently addressing it. Instead what we are seeing 
is the government shoving the project through the House, Prince Edward Island 
squeezing a constitutional amendment through, and SCI out there with its hand 
out.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are very important words to consider during the process 
of consideration of the constitutional amendment today.
<P>
	The ideal environmental assessment process in Canada has to 
take into account many factors. Ideally the environmental 
assessment process should incorporate some of the following 
principles. I stressed once already that the assessment should be 
done by an independent agency free from political pressure or 
influence peddling. The decision should be final and binding.
<P>
	It really does not strike me as unusual, but it is indicative of 
what is happening that a constitutional amendment dealing with 
a structure affecting the environment and others is introduced in 
the Chamber by the minister of public works whose department 
has most influence over the project and specifically wants the 
project to be completed.
<P>
	If anything, the project should be viewed as an environmental 
project as opposed to an economic one. The government should 
not be treating it as another economic project.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	If we wish to create jobs in Prince Edward Island or northern 
Saskatchewan, we could find all sorts of things to do just by 
throwing some money out there and ensuring that it is done. The 
Prince Edward Island link bridge must be tied into the 
environment, the economy of the area, the needs of the 
community, and those types of things.
<P>
	The assessment of the environment is a very key and 
important part of whether or not this project should proceed. An 
independent agency, free from political pressure and influence 
peddling, should be where the decisions are made. It should not 
be made by consultants who are paid by the proponent of a 
project to make the project appear to be environmentally 
friendly.
<P>
	There should also be a very broad definition of the 
environment applying universally to quite a variety of 
initiatives. The government has yet to proclaim the 
environmental assessment act. I am waiting very patiently for 
the Minister of the Environment to bring a new environmental 
assessment act into the Chamber with the amendments 
suggested in the previous House by the member for Davenport, 
members of the other parties, and myself dealing with these 
matters. The definition of environmental effect was expanded in 
the last bill to include health and socioeconomic conditions. We 
must ensure that kind of assessment is also done on projects 
similar to the fixed link.
<P>
	Environmental effect can also take into account physical and 
cultural heritage and current uses of lands and resources for 
traditional reasons by aboriginal people in Canada. The recent 
Supreme Court decision on the Oldman dam assists in 
strengthening the definition of the environment to include the 
community's livelihood.
<P>
	The environmental assessment process should also extend the 
policy and programs. When the Department of Public Works 
wants to proceed with a project and undertakes to proceed with 
it, the policy which guides it should assess the environmental 
rules as well. This is something on which the previous 
government refused to budge. I am hoping that under the new 
legislation to be brought in by the new government the new 
minister 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1412"> 1412 </A></B>
<P>
will budge on this one and ensure that policies and programs are 
covered under the process.
<P>
	The decision maker discretion should be minimized and 
accountability should be ensured. In the environmental 
assessment process and in building confidence among the public 
we cannot be seen as having a strong environmental assessment 
process on the one hand and then later an unaccountable 
decision making process which can ignore the whole exercise 
that has gone on before it.
<P>
	New Democrat amendments in the previous Parliament to Bill 
C-13 went quite far to improve this and remove the tremendous 
amount of discretion in the previous bill where the minister or 
responsible authorities were only bound to act when they were 
``of the opinion that damage to the environment might occur''. 
That discretion for the most part has now been removed and 
assessment or action must be taken if a project or undertaking 
may cause significant negative environmental effects.
<P>
	This now has to be tested in court, but it goes a long way to 
closing a loophole under the guidelines which was used in the 
bridge project assessment and open to industry to influence 
politicians.
<P>
	Proponents should justify the purpose and the need of the 
project. Alternatives should be considered as part of the 
assessment process. What was never considered in this process 
was improvement to the existing ferry system. There is an 
alternative view to what could be taking place here: an injection 
of funds and a maintenance of existing jobs. The assessment 
process that existed on this particular project did not take those 
into account. A new environmental assessment bill should 
ensure that we deal with this sort of thing.
<P>
	I also believe very strongly there should be a significant 
public role early and often throughout the process, including 
participant funding and notice. I will admit and agree there has 
been a lot of debate on Prince Edward Island about the 
Northumberland Strait and the bridge, and perhaps even the 
tunnel the member for Malpeque earlier indicated he originally 
supported. There is no question at all that the whole matter of 
public debate over projects like this one is very important. The 
key thing in all this is that the debate has hinged on economic 
issues, not on environmental issues.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	We have been forced to gloss over the environmental issues in 
the particular debate and not to make our decisions on 
environmental issues but on economic ones because the 
government and the proponents have constantly said: ``Don't 
worry about the environmental things. Our studies indicate that 
environmental matters are not important''.
<P>
	Yet the one federal panel that looked at it in general terms 
said: ``Turn it down. Don't accept it. Do something else''. Many 
of the questions raised in the House today were of an 
environmental nature. They have still not been answered to the 
satisfaction of the people most concerned about it. A full and 
public debate is important but it has to include all issues 
surrounding the project.
<P>
	I feel very strongly about the environmental assessment 
process and what it means for Canada. I also feel very strongly 
about the lack of an environmental assessment process on the 
Northumberland link project. I feel very unhappy the 
government has chosen not to move quickly on a new 
environmental assessment process. It would have avoided a lot 
of problems in dealing with the issue before us today.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I thank you very much for your time and 
attention today. I certainly wish all members well in their 
deliberations on this amendment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
colleague has raised a number of very pertinent questions on this 
issue. He has pointed out that the new Liberal government has 
chosen simply to follow the policies of the previous 
Conservative government. I guess many Canadians will be 
asking: ``What's new?''
<P>
	He raised a very good point with regard to the environment. 
Much of the debate in Prince Edward Island on the fixed link 
was linked to environmental issues. I know my colleague has 
been very involved in studying these issues. Is it not now time, 
as part of the environmental process he described, to look at a 
new form of what is often called green accounting? In other 
words should we not look at projects in a way that takes into 
account other factors than cost, funding and financing? What 
about the effects on health, the effects on the environment and 
other ancillary effects of any project undertaken that can result 
in additional costs to the public, if not well thought through?
<P>
	What does my colleague think of the idea of a new form of 
accounting around major projects like this one? Does he support 
that idea?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate very much the 
question from the member for Yukon who has supported me in 
many of my efforts on environmental issues and for whom I 
know the environment is very important. Her comments about a 
green economy are not only important but most timely. I am 
very glad she raised them and I am very happy to have the 
opportunity to discuss them for a moment in the Chamber.
<P>
	For all too long we have talked about sustainable development 
with the focus on the word development and not enough focus on 
sustainability of what it is that we are doing. There is nothing 
more important in any government decision making than the 
concept of sustainability. If we are spending money on any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1413"> 1413 </A></B>
<P>
project whatsoever, the long-term accountability of the project  
not only to the people but to the planet must be a very important 
part of our consideration.
<P>
	On the new idea of a green economy I attended a conference a 
few weeks ago in which the original discussion was around 
green industries and how we in Canada can develop the 
technology, the skill and the ability to deal with the new green 
industries in our country. Very soon the participants in that 
conference shifted from individual specific industries to the 
entire economy. They began talking about a green economy in 
which decisions are made on the sustainability of our actions, 
the sustainability of our decision making.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Development is not an infinite quantity. Development is 
something that has a finite level to it. We have to be able to 
recognize that level and work within it. We have discovered that 
unfortunately on the Atlantic coast with our cod fishery.
<P>
	We are seeing it in the forests of northern Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, British Columbia where we are not dealing with 
the accountability of our decision-making on the sustainability 
of our efforts. We work ourselves right out of the ability to 
continue to work in that field. As parliamentarians we have to 
start considering green economies within our decision-making 
process.
<P>
	I had a chat this afternoon with the chair of the environment 
committee and I suggested that one of the studies the 
environment committee should be making is on the whole 
concept of greening our economy, about how to tie economic 
decision-making to long-term sustainability in the 
environment. The chair of the environment committee 
responded very positively to me in the context of the response to 
the environmental conference in Rio where they did talk about 
the need for revitalizing the global economy based on 
environmental decision-making. There may be the opportunity 
to begin that discussion in Canada and actually carry it on into 
the economic powers of the country and not just from the 
environmental part.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for her question. It was most 
important and most timely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have a question for the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake but first of all I have a comment.
<P>
	One of the ironies, given the environmental dimensions of 
this question, is that in the throne speech we heard from the 
government about its intention to build a green infrastructure. I 
wonder whether this is what it had in mind when it was talking 
about green infrastructure. It is certainly not incontestable. In 
fact it is quite debatable and arguable whether this motion and 
the megaproject it will bring about is in fact green 
infrastructure.
<P>
	I would have thought it would have been much more wise on 
the part of the government if it is serious about green 
infrastructure, and this is a point I make over and over again, to 
invest money in rebuilding our rail system rather than allowing 
CN and the CP to collaborate in ways to continue the 
dismantling and downsizing of our rail system. That is the real 
green infrastructure as far as I am concerned.
<P>
	It pains me to hear talk about green infrastructure at the same 
time as we allow projects such as this to go ahead and as we 
allow our railways to deteriorate.
<P>
	If we are serious about greenhouse gas emissions, if we are 
serious about putting less hydrocarbons into the air then we 
should be serious about reregulating our transportation system 
so as to give a bias to rail. Right now there is a bias against rail. 
At the very least we could make it neutral.
<P>
	I would prefer a bias for rail because to me that would be a 
bias for the environment. The government has got to stop letting 
the railways react to the effects of deregulation. It has to start 
saying that deregulation has not worked, let us reregulate. I do 
not care what you call it. The former Conservative Minister of 
Transport did not want to reregulate. He wanted to recalibrate. 
That is fine. I do not care whether it is called calibration, 
regulation, ostentation, you name it, as long as we get back to a 
system where we are creating more rail traffic and we are taking 
these trucks that look more and more like trains all the time off 
the road. There are trucks on the road that look more and more 
like trains all the time. They will probably want to go over this 
causeway once it is built, just to get back to the motion.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	The time has come for us to build real green infrastructure. I 
would love to hear the member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake comment on all of this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Madam Speaker, I only need a minute to tell the 
hon. member that I agree entirely with everything he had to say. 
He put it very eloquently.
<P>
	As a matter of fact I have a great bias toward rail myself. I 
want to pass on to the House an illustration of what the hon. 
member is talking about. My mother-in-law has worked for a 
trucking company for most of her life. She has stuck on her 
fridge with nice little truck fridge magnets a cartoon of a train 
stopped at a railway crossing while a truck goes by pulling car 
after car after car of product. The train had to stop to allow the 
trucks to go by.
<P>
	The government's infrastructure program which talks about 
roads, sewer and water is good in the sense of what it is 
covering. However there is not a single dollar going to rail out of 
the government's infrastructure program and I think that is a 
tremendously sad oversight.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SMALLBUSINESS">SMALL BUSINESS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate in this debate on the underground economy and the 
recognition that Canadians generally have lost faith in our tax 
system. Somewhere between $60 billion and $100 billion in 
business transactions now take place beneath the surface in a 
way.
<P>
	My question to the minister the other day was whether or not 
the government was taking any definitive action to encourage 
those people who now want to move their operations above 
ground and become legitimate players in the marketplace. Also 
to what extent would the government introduce programs that 
would encourage that to occur.
<P>
	What is it about the tax system that has upset people? What is 
it about the tax system that has discouraged people who are hard 
working, who are running their businesses or going off to the 
mills or the mines, the farmers, the fishermen? It can be summed 
up in the interpretation bulletin IT-518 from Revenue Canada. 
This was sent recently to various businesses and individuals. It 
gives clues on all the things one can use as a tax deduction, 
legitimately to be fair, within the tax system, particularly when 
it comes to entertainment.
<P>
	For example, this is not an exhaustive list but entertainment 
includes tickets for theatres, concerts, athletic events, or 
whatever the performance might be. Renting or leasing a private 
box at the sports facility and buying champagne for friends is all 
tax deductible. Renting hotel rooms to have a party and entertain 
people is deductible. Buying liquor for a hospitality suite of 
course is tax deductible. Taking a cruise in the Caribbean, the 
South Pacific or to Greece is tax deductible. Taking friends to a 
fashion show is also tax deductible. I guess people want to learn 
how to dress more modernly and so on.
<P>
	If you want to take your guest to a nightclub, Madam Speaker, 
or out to a hockey game, a football game, a baseball game or 
whatever; or if you want to take your friends fishing in northern 
Canada, northern Quebec, British Columbia or wherever; if you 
want to go hunting in northern Ontario, northern Saskatchewan 
or northern Quebec, that is all tax deductible. Generally you can 
say: ``Let us go on a three week vacation in Labrador and we will 
discuss business''. Again that is tax deductible.
<P>
	I am not saying there is necessarily anything dastardly or 
terribly sinister about this. However certain people can go 
fishing, hunting, camping, to the football game, or rent a room 
to entertain friends and it is done with the help of the tax system. 
The taxpayers generally pick up part of that tab. If one is 
deducting up to 80 per cent of those costs obviously then those 
who are at the hockey game watching the people up in the box 
drinking champagne or whatever, who have free tickets or only 
pay 20 per cent of the price, are paying their way buying hot 
dogs and so on.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	In closing, after reading things like this bulletin from 
Revenue Canada is it any wonder that people have become 
absolutely disenchanted and disappointed with a tax system that 
can only be described as unjust, unfair and biased.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, there are many things in the hon. 
member's remarks that I happen to agree with. However I would 
like to begin by saying we know it was the GST in the last three 
years that really exacerbated the underground economy not to 
mention the added paper burden for small business. Most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1415"> 1415 </A></B>
<P>
members would agree with that.
<P>
	We have taken a stand on this side of the House to eliminate 
the GST. It was announced in the finance committee the other 
day that this study would begin right away. By the end of June 
we will have all the possible alternatives which will be much 
more fair, simple and efficient.
<P>
	Recently the government showed it was serious in going on 
the offensive against the underground economy by taking on the 
tobacco issues. The changes in taxation were announced 
eliminating financial incentives that drove the significant 
subsector of the underground economy. Already there have been 
some reports of reductions in the volume of tobacco being 
smuggled into Canada which shows the effectiveness of that 
particular policy.
<P>
	The Department of Finance is working closely with Revenue 
Canada looking for ways to streamline and simplify the system.
<P>
	I also want to say we have to be careful when we loosely throw 
around some of these tax deductions as being special privileges 
for the wealthy. I share the member's view with the Skydome 
box holders. However, with respect to tourism and fishing trips 
these measures were put in to aid small business tourism 
operators. If all of a sudden we were to eliminate all of those 
things it would cause significant unemployment. We have to be 
very careful in how we address those particular deductions. I 
know the member would not want to see an adverse condition 
because of a reckless tax preference cut in our tax act that would 
affect an industry which he too is so proud of.
<P>
	I want to acknowledge that we recognize there are some 
serious flaws in the tax act of Canada. We take all of the 
member's specific points today and hope to address them in the 
near future.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HOUSEOFCOMMONS">HOUSE OF COMMONS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Madam Speaker, my topic 
is really quite timely given the fact that we expected a vote a few 
minutes ago and suddenly it was put off.
<P>
	The other day I asked the Prime Minister when he would 
announce to the House that the government would not consider 
the defeat of a government motion including a spending measure 
to constitute the expression of non-confidence in the 
government unless it is immediately followed by a formal 
motion of non-confidence.
<P>
	It is time to release the members of Parliament from the iron 
cage of party discipline in this country. I think that the House of 
Commons is probably one of the most regimented parliamentary 
systems in the world. We must not forget that we were sent here 
by the people of Canada. We were sent here to represent the 
views of the people of this great nation, not the wills of the 
political parties.
<P>
	It is also time to debunk the myth that the government must 
win every vote or resign. The failure of a government measure, 
even a spending initiative, does not automatically have to mean 
the defeat of the government.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister, the cabinet and the bureaucrats set policy 
and dictate the course of action with the usual assurances of: 
``Don't worry. We know what we are doing. We know what is 
best''. The time has come to give the electorate greater say in 
government.
<P>
	For too long it has been politics first. Now it is time to put 
people first. How can we do this? We can loosen the chains. We 
can allow for free votes in the House of Commons. If for 
example a vote on a budget measure or motion was negative, it 
could be sent back to committee and improved before coming 
again to the House. If the government loses the non-confidence 
motion that follows that motion, then it would have to resign and 
call a general election. The people of Canada want more direct 
democracy and I would encourage the Prime Minister to comply 
with their wishes.
<P>
	The Constitution provides for this. All the Prime Minister 
needs to do is rise in his place and declare that the government 
will not consider the defeat of a government motion including a 
spending measure to constitute an expression of non-confidence 
in the government unless it is immediately followed by a formal 
non-confidence motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister):</B> Madam Speaker, on February 2, 1994 the member 
for Wetaskiwin questioned the Prime Minister on the issue of 
free votes.
<P>
	The hon. member should realize that this government has 
done more to champion the cause of House of Commons reform 
in the first 100 days of its mandate than the previous government 
did in nine long years.
<P>
	On Monday, February 7, the government House leader placed 
before this House a framework for renewal. This framework 
addressed a wide range of issues this government believes will 
reinstate the trust and respect that Canadians want to have in 
their institutions.
<P>
	On the subject of free votes it must be noted that this is not a 
matter dealt with now by the standing orders of the House. 
Instead it is a matter to be dealt with by each party and each 
party's members themselves.
<P>
	This is why the hon. member will note that in part VII of the 
government House leader's motion there is a reference to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to 
examine free votes in the House of Commons and other 
important matters.
<P>
	Therefore I ask the hon. member and his party to fully 
participate in this process. I am sure he agrees with me when I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1416"> 1416 </A></B>
<P>
say that the task ahead is to reinforce the fundamentals of the 
system and restore a more active role for all members of 
Parliament.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRUISEMISSILETESTING">CRUISE MISSILE TESTING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on January 20, 1994 I raised a question in the House 
with respect to the government's upcoming decision on the 
testing of cruise missiles in Canada.
<P>
	This question dealt both with the substance of the tests as well 
as the credibility of the government and the promises it made 
when in opposition. Although the Liberal government of 1983 
had signed the first testing agreement, in opposition it took a 
very different position.
<P>
	The written commitment that was made during the last federal 
election stated it would bring this testing program to an end. It 
went on to speak about the importance of public hearings that 
would involve northerners, peace groups, aboriginal peoples 
and others.
<P>
	What happened? There were no parliamentary hearings. In 
fact there was only one northern member of Parliament who 
spoke in the debate, the hon. member for Nunatsiaq. He spoke 
very eloquently against the testing of cruise missiles. He 
indicated that he was also speaking on behalf of his colleague, 
the member for Western Arctic.
<P>
	I know my colleague from the Yukon has spoken eloquently 
on many occasions both in this House and outside on behalf of 
her constituents in the Yukon against the testing of cruise 
missiles. Of course the Reform Party was ready. It supported the 
testing of cruise missiles.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I must admit that I was really shocked and disappointed by the 
Bloc's position on this issue. At the same time, I was not overly 
surprised because Mr. Bouchard had gone to Washington to 
reassure the Americans that an independent Quebec would 
remain a faithful and loyal ally, that there would be no change in 
Canadian policy, that the policy would remain obedient to the 
United States.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	The sad thing is that today, just two hours ago, I have heard a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois say: ``Now, the Bloc is thinking 
as a block''. If that is the case, it is sad indeed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Quite clearly there is no legal obligation whatsoever to 
conduct these tests. In fact the minister himself said it was a 
courtesy that he was extending to the United States. I suggest 
there was an alternative. The alternative was to say no. There is a 
foreign policy review. There is a defence review.
<P>
	Let us look at strengthening multilateral institutions. Let us 
look at working toward peace. Let us look at ending the tests of 
low level flights over Innu lands as some Liberals have called 
for on a number of occasions. Indeed today I met with Daniel 
Ashini and Elizabeth Penashue from the Innu nation who talked 
about the devastating impact of these tests over their lands.
<P>
	Let us support the World Court project. The World Court 
project is a very important project in which Canada is being 
called on to join in submitting a legal brief to the International 
Court of Justice making the use of nuclear weapons illegal under 
international law.
<P>
	Those are the kinds of alternatives that the government could 
have had. Those are the kinds of alternatives that would have 
meant that we had a truly independent foreign policy. In fact 
retired U.S. Admiral Eugene Carroll, one of the most respected 
commentators on this question, said that any decision by the 
Liberal government to end the testing would be viewed as ``an 
assertion of Canada's independence'' and have no negative 
ramifications.
<P>
	That is what we thought the Liberals were promising in 
opposition. That is what they talked about in their red book. 
Certainly that is not what they deliver.
<P>
	Let us hope these tests will be the last tests and that Canada 
will have an independent foreign policy based on peace and 
preservation of the environment and a respect for aboriginal 
peoples and northerners.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I was in opposition and asked questions of the 
government I never got any answers. I can tell the hon. member 
that he is going to get an answer. In fact he has answered his own 
question so I really could sit down now.
<P>
	However, I will say that in 1993, two months before the 
election took place, the hon. member would know that the 
previous government authorized these tests. They were due to 
take place on January 25, 1994. After this government came to 
power and while in opposition we promised a parliamentary 
debate on this subject.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Public hearings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> We promised a debate on this subject. When the 
government was formed we had a debate on it in a reasonable 
time, on January 26 as a matter of fact. Twenty-nine members 
participated in the debate and 30 or so participated in question 
and comment.
<P>
	I have to tell members that the preponderance of the debate 
and the comment was in favour of testing. As a result, the 
government made the decision and on February 3 announced 
that the test would be authorized to continue. We expect they 
will be done this month.
<P>
	At the same time, the government made it clear to the United 
States government that it should not presuppose any outcome of 
the parliamentary debate and the public hearings on both the 
defence policy and the foreign policy which will address, and 
the hon. member is right, the very strong feelings still in this 
<P>

<P>
country on testing. This is one of the subjects that will be 
addressed.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that as the quarterback 
parliamentary secretary for this debate I promised to get him on 
about 7.30 and in fact he got on at 7.43. I am sure he appreciated 
the co-operation and the credibility of the government.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would have liked the Minister of Industry to be with 
us. I am sure his parliamentary secretary is very competent, but I 
would have liked him to be present since I asked him a question 
on the electronic highway on February 4 and the minister was 
rather evasive and tight-lipped on this issue. The population is 
rather concerned about this, as we do not really know where the 
government is going. We are under the impression that the 
Minister of Industry is not really in on it and that he has his foot 
on the brakes.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	The information highway is a very important issue, for it is a 
great adventure that could link all Canadians with national and 
international networks that could give us access to hospital and 
school data banks and to all kinds of information.
<P>
	It is an important issue that needs to be debated. I would have 
liked to ask the minister because whenever we ask him about it 
in the House, we get the impression that he leaves everything to 
the private sector and that he does not intend to spend 
government funds on this.
<P>
	When we look at what is happening in the United States, we 
can see that if Canada, which has a very good track record in the 
technology, communications and telecommunications sectors, 
is to enter the information highway, the minister should give 
clear indications and invest money.
<P>
	I was concerned to hear that he wanted to set up an advisory 
committee. My concern is that this issue was examined last year 
by another committee chaired by Mr. Ostry, the president of TV 
Ontario, who tabled a report outlining very clearly the 
legislative and regulatory measures the government must take to 
build this electronic highway.
<P>
	I am wondering if the minister, who is acting a little slowly on 
this issue, is not trying to divert our attention by striking a new 
advisory committee whose mandate is still unclear. I hope that 
the parliamentary secretary will be able to tell us exactly what 
this committee is supposed to do. What are the government's 
intentions? Will public funds be made available? Will he be able 
to gather around the same table representatives of the private, 
institutional and public sectors to finally turn the information 
highway into a reality?
<P>
	I would like to give him a warning, Madam Speaker, since this 
electronic highway could also become a very effective 
instrument of centralization through its impact on education and 
training.
<P>
	I hope that we can rely on the parliamentary secretary to speak 
on behalf of the minister and promise this House on his honour 
that, in building the electronic highway, the government will 
respect areas of provincial jurisdiction and ensure that 
communications linking us to Internet are also in French. I know 
that is one of his concerns. Having said that, I will now let him 
have the floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, let me begin by saying to the 
hon. member that I can assure him that the Minister of Industry 
does not have his foot on the brakes on this particular issue. In 
fact, it is quite the reverse. He has the pedal right to the metal, as 
they say, and we are going full bore on this particular issue of the 
electronic highway.
<P>
	I want to remind the House that, first of all, it was announced 
in the speech from the throne that we were going to develop a 
strategy for Canada's information highway. On February 2 the 
secretary of state for science and technology committed the 
federal government to a number of objectives and principles to 
guide and develop the approach.
<P>
	We talked about the advisory council because it is a very 
important issue. It is a complex issue and we wanted to make 
sure that the council would have a broad range of groups and 
organizations that would help formulate Canada's strategy in 
this particular area. Also, we want to make sure that there is 
representation from not just industry but from labour, education 
and consumers.
<P>
	The council, which is in the process of being put together right 
now, will be announced very soon. This council will provide 
advice to the government and it is going to be active on line. I 
can tell the member that this government is putting incredible 
resources behind the information highway, the electronic 
highway.
<P>
	I can speak about our own case in which we are beginning to 
put information out. In the Toronto region we are doing some 
testing which will go into other regions. We are looking at ideas 
for community access centres. Let me reassure the member that 
this government is committed in a very serious way and will be 
moving very fast. We welcome his input.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTHCARE">HEALTH CARE</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
on a question that I asked the Minister of Health on February 10, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1418"> 1418 </A></B>
<P>
1994 on health care and on her position on the reduction of taxes 
on alcohol products which the Distillers Association of Canada 
the day after the reduction of taxes on cigarettes began to 
advocate for.
<P>
	The response to that question was in effect no comment. The 
response of the Minister of Health to the reduction of taxes on 
cigarettes was in effect no comment. The reaction of the 
Minister of Health to the proposed federal idea of taxing the 
health benefits of employees was in effect no comment.
<P>
	This is not good enough for the future of health care in this 
country. Within the next two years we will be undertaking a very 
comprehensive discussion right across the country on the future 
of the health care system. It seems to me that the Minister of 
Health by refusing to take a stand, including a response to my 
question on her position on the reduction of taxes on alcohol, is 
not being an advocate for health care in this country.
<P>
	The lowering of federal tax on cigarette products clearly is 
going to be a major cost to the economy. The estimates are that 
over some $300 million a year will be added to the federal 
deficit as a result of this and this does not account for revenues 
that will be lost by provinces and territories if they too reduce 
and follow that lead.
<P>
	Clearly, when people are concerned about the debt and deficit 
in this country this rather odd move by the government in an ad 
hoc policy attempting to resolve what is clearly a very difficult 
problem, that of smuggling, has created many others. We simply 
do not have a Minister of Health prepared to stand up and be 
clear about her philosophy about health care in this country.
<P>
	We see by the most conservative estimates that the true cost of 
tobacco related illnesses to the health care system in this 
country is about $9.6 billion a year with indirect costs being 
some $15 billion a year. Clearly, the refusal of the minister to 
take a position on these issues jeopardizes the health care 
system in this country.
<P>
	There have been many comments on this issue. There are 
many points of view on this issue. Surely Canadians can expect a 
minister of health to stand up for the health of Canadians and to 
be that strong advocate.
<P>
	I want to assure all Canadians that the New Democratic Party 
will continue to be a strong advocate for a strong health care 
system in this country that meets the needs of all Canadians.
<P>
	One commentator, Dalton Camp, commented that this policy 
clearly was joining the Reform Party too soon.
<P>
	My question to the parliamentary secretary is simply is it the 
government's intention to reimburse provinces and territories 
for lost revenues with this policy of reducing taxes on cigarettes 
and potentially on alcohol products?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health):</B> Madam Speaker, the question as the hon. member has 
said is a very complex one and to try to boil it down to a 
simplistic answer is impossible.
<P>
	I will take on the issue first and foremost of the problem of 
tobacco smuggling. When the Prime Minister stood up in this 
House on February 8 and announced his national action plan on 
tobacco he said very clearly that smuggling is threatening the 
safety of our communities and the livelihood of law-abiding 
merchants. The problem of tobacco smuggling is an 
increasingly complex one because it touches on the very fabric 
of our Canadian identity which is dedicated to peace, order and 
good government. It touches on the safety of our communities. 
It touches on respect for law and order. It also affected the 
economy and, as the hon. member mentioned before, the health 
of Canadians.
<P>
	Organized crime networks have been responsible for 95 per 
cent of the tobacco smuggling that was going on in Canada. 
They were also responsible for smuggling liquor, drugs and 
firearms at the same time. Tobacco and alcohol were controlled 
drugs as were firearms. We would have lost control over these 
controlled substances if we had not done something 
immediately to deal with that smuggling and to deal with the 
smuggling of liquor.
<P>
	In order to deal with the matter the government took 
unprecedented action. I want to remind the hon. member that the 
issue is not a new one. It has been going on for years. The past 
government tended to ignore it and to pretend it did not occur. 
We took immediate unprecedented action. We increased the 
number of RCMP and customs officials dedicated to fighting 
tobacco smuggling. They are using new strategies. They are 
accompanying these resources with other strategies to crack 
down and to keep surveillance on smugglers starting 
immediately.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about the lack of a response from the 
Minister of Health on this matter. The Minister of Health is 
responsible and has worked very hard for the major health 
strategy found here. We have invested about $185 million in 
funds from taxing the tobacco industry. They will be dedicated 
to prevention and promotion. We have already seen the launch of 
a media campaign aimed at kids, the proclamation of the 
Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act, and legislation to 
eliminate kiddie packs, to increase the age and to crack down on 
sale to minors. The minister has responded.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but the time 
for the member's response has expired.
<P>
	It being 7 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7 p.m.)
