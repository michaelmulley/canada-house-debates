	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in 
both official languages, the government's response to 8 petitions.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-382, an act to amend the Criminal Records Act 
(sexual offences against children).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to table a bill that would 
amend the Criminal Records Act to change the way the government 
deals with pardons for those convicted of sex offences against 
children.
<P>
	As it now stands, once a pardon is granted to a person who has 
served his time, the information about his crime is removed from 
CPIC, the Canadian Police Information Computer database. If the 
former offender then wants to apply to hold a position of trust with

welfare cannot check his record because his record will not appear 
on CPIC.
<P>
	The recidivism rate for pedophiles is very high so it is very 
important that community groups have access to this information.

in order to protect Canadian children.

sufficient financial means to meet their obligations.

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) 
</B>moved that Bill C-66, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code 
(Part I) and the Corporations and Labour Returns Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to have this 
opportunity to address the House on Bill C-66, the purpose of 
which is to amend Part I of the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	Today we are undertaking the third reading of this bill, which 
means we are approaching the end of a significant step in the 
modernization of the Canada Labour Code. Passage of Bill C-66 
will mark the first in-depth revision of Part I of the Code since the 
1970s.
<P>
	It is very important for our government that the code be 
modernized. This was, in fact, designated as a priority in the most 
recent throne speech, since the favourable management-labour 
relations it will create will work in favour of economic growth and 
job creation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8871"> 8871 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At the outset I would like to paraphrase the Sims task force 
report entitled ``Seeking a Balance'' and say to the House that with 
this bill we sought a balance and I believe we found it.
<P>
	While there may be differences of opinion concerning the 
precise drafting of specific provisions I am of the view that Bill 
C-66 faithfully reflects the outcome of the review process. All 
labour code issues covered in the bill were addressed by the task 
force or discussed during the subsequent consultations that took 
place.
<P>
	I must say that one of the most rewarding aspects of this entire 
amendment process has been watching the result of consultations 
turned into action.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	Too often, during my time in opposition, I witnessed the 
government of the time launching a process of public consultation, 
only to shelve the results afterward. There is nothing more 
discouraging than having one's opinion asked and then to see it 
being ignored.
<P>
	I am pleased that, through the concrete measures contained in 
Bill C-66, we have been able to compensate those who contributed 
to our discussions for their trust and hard work.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	The latest step in the consultation process took place just before 
the Christmas holidays, when the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development examined the bill.
<P>
	I am also very grateful for the contribution made by many 
members of the labour movement, management representatives, 
academics, authorities responsible for enforcing labour laws, other 
experts and private citizens who also looked at our proposals and 
made sure that the proposed legislation was a realistic response to 
the current situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All of these different groups have played a part in designing the 
bill. As a result of the divergent opinions that were evident on some 
issues it is to be expected that people would react differently to 
various elements of the bill. We have witnessed this reaction to 
such matters as the provision dealing with off site workers, grain 
shipments and replacement workers.
<P>
	Take the example of off site workers. The changes the bill makes 
will allow unions to contract employees who work outside 
traditional workplaces. Some have expressed a concern about this 
development raising issues of privacy and security. I can assure the 
House that these worries are groundless. Access to such employees 
will be overseen by the new Canada industrial relations board 
which will assure that the privacy and the personal safety of the 
affected people is protected. I see this amendment  as one element 
in our government's attempt to deal with the workplace of the 
future and I will not allow this new access to be used in 
inappropriate ways.
<P>
	Another sensitive area of this bill is our amendments affecting 
the shipping of grain. In this area we are introducing amendments 
to require parties in the ports to continue providing services to 
grain vessels in the event of a work stoppage. In other words, from 
now on all grain that is brought to the dockside will have to be 
moved regardless of work stoppages in other port activities.
<P>
	This amendment is very important to Canada. The shipment of 
grain is a multi-billion dollar industry. We export to over 70 
countries. The livelihoods of over 130,000 farmers and their 
families depend on our reputation as a reliable supplier and 
exporter.
<P>
	The importance of grain exports to the Canadian economy, in 
particular the economy of the prairie provinces, cannot be over 
emphasized. In fact, the grain industry has been declared to be for 
the general advantage of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another advantage is that these changes will help improve 
labour relations in our ports. We all know that when a work 
stoppage interrupts grain exports, Parliament intervenes without 
delay to stop and settle disputes in our ports which threaten these 
exports.
<P>
	The parties have come to expect Parliament to intervene, which 
releases them from any responsibility for dealing with their own 
problems and lets them blame Parliament for any negative 
repercussions. This goes against our resolve to promote 
constructive and positive labour relations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some members of the House want all labour management 
disputes in the ports and in the entire grain transportation industry, 
including the railways, to be resolved by a binding arbitration 
process known as final offer selection. I do not favour this 
approach, nor do the vast majority of federally regulated 
employers, nor do the unions, nor did the Sims task. It pointed out 
that final offer selection is not effective appropriate dispute 
resolution mechanism for complex disputes.
<P>
	The task force advocated a less individualist approach, which is 
reflected in Bill C-66. It is an approach which illustrates how our 
government is acting as a catalyst for positive change. We will 
encourage parties to settle their differences in a less adversarial 
manner.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The most controversial aspect of Bill C-66 remains the provision 
on replacement workers. The long-standing differences between 
labour and management on the  subject is one of the items on which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8872"> 8872 </A></B>
<P>
the labour management consensus group of the Sims task force 
could not agree.
<P>
	In fact, even the members of the Sims task force failed to 
produce a unanimous statement on this controversial issue. The 
provision on replacement workers was drafted so as to include the 
text of the majority recommendation of the Sims task force. 
Basically, what we are saying is that there should not be a general 
ban on the use of these workers. In fact, they can be used to pursue 
legitimate bargaining objectives.
<P>
	Employers cannot use replacement workers to undermine the 
ability of the unions to represent their members. That would be an 
unfair practice. If the new Canada Industrial Relations Board 
concludes that is the case, it will have the authority to order the 
employer to stop using replacement workers.
<P>
	I believe that the proposed amendments will help us take a 
balanced approach to a delicate and complex issue. Employers will 
always have the right to use replacement workers, but there will be 
two major restrictions on that right. first, employers will not be 
able to use replacement workers for illegitimate ends; second, they 
will have to rehire workers who were on strike or locked out, rather 
than their replacements, once the work stoppage has been resolved.
<P>
	Some employer groups have contended that the wording of this 
provision is too broad and absolute and that it allows the unions to 
contest any use of replacement workers. These groups have cited 
suggestions by union representatives to the effect that the mere 
presence of a replacement worker would undermine union 
representation.
<P>
	I have to say very clearly that this interpretation is not valid and 
is not the intent of the bill. I can assure the House that, if it were the 
intent, the wording of the provision would be more restrictive.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In contrast, the Canadian Labour Congress expressed its worry 
that the section will be applied very narrowly and come into effect 
only when the employer's behaviour is particularly egregious. That 
labour and management have taken opposite positions on this 
section suggests to me that we have achieved the right balance.
<P>
	In any event, I am confident that the new board, representative 
and balanced in nature, will interpret the provision intelligently and 
appropriately. Indeed, I believe that the Canada industrial relations 
board may prove to be the most important feature of the 
modernized labour code.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The task force and the labour management working group both 
proposed this new body. The Canada industrial relations board 
would comprise a neutral  chairperson and vice-chairpersons, three 
full time members representing labour and three full time members 
representing management.
<P>
	Part time members will also be appointed, in the regions. The 
addition of union and employer representatives to the board will no 
doubt make it more sensitive to the needs of those it serves. It will 
also guarantee the parties that the board's members properly 
understand the situation.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	The parties will also likely find the decisions of a representative 
board more credible. The bill provides that the board's 
representative members are to be appointed after the minister has 
consulted the appropriate union and management organizations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While on the question of board membership, I wish to emphasize 
that as a result of the legislation the major criterion for 
appointment as chair or vice-chair will be competence and not 
political affiliation.
<P>
	A new clause has been inserted which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The chairperson and vice-chairpersons must have experience and expertise in 
industrial relations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The new board will be given additional powers and 
responsibilities and greater flexibility to deal quickly with routine 
or urgent matters and to avoid undue delays.
<P>
	The board's remedial powers will be expanded to ensure good 
faith bargaining. An amendment will confirm the ability of the 
board to direct that a party include or withdraw specific terms in a 
bargaining position in order to rectify a failure to bargain in good 
faith.
<P>
	As important as it is to enhance the board's powers, the 
government has accepted two standing committee suggestions that 
will ensure they are not abused.
<P>
	These are intended to place a reasonable check on the board's 
powers to compel the production of documents at any stage of a 
proceeding and to amend collective agreements following a 
restructuring of bargaining units.
<P>
	Finally, I mention another change contained in the legislation, 
that is the one regarding the federal mediation and conciliation 
service or FMCS. As a result of Bill C-66 the critically important 
role of this body will be recognized in the code.
<P>
	Its role will be spelled out and the head of the service may be 
delegated new powers. It is worth noting that in the new code the 
head of the FMCS will report directly to the Minister of Labour as 
was suggested in the Sims report.
<P>
	Careful study of changes to the bargaining cycle will reveal that 
they all lead to the same goal: streamlining the conciliation 
process. This is something that both labour  and employer groups 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8873"> 8873 </A></B>
<P>
have been asking for, for a long time. I am proud our government 
has delivered.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to say in closing that Bill C-66 represents a great 
step forward in preparing the Canadian workplace for the advent of 
the next century.
<P>
	The increasingly competitive world economy requires our 
businesses to be as effective and productive as they can be. The 
improvement in labour relations resulting from the amendment of 
the code will lead to increased productivity, greater job security 
and more say for workers in decisions taken at the workplace.
<P>
	Bill C-66 shows that good labour policy is also good business 
policy. However, although we are getting to the end of the process 
with regard to Bill C-66, in the House at least, there is still a lot to 
do to get the Canada Labour Code ready for the next century.
<P>
	Within the next few months we will propose changes to bring 
other parts of the Canada Labour Code up to date. These changes 
will focus on health and safety issues and on labour standards.
<P>
	It is my hope that the government will be able to count on the 
same level of energetic co-operation from members and other 
stakeholders as we did during the Part I review. I hope that all the 
members in this House will join me in supporting Bill C-66.
<P>
	Before concluding, allow me to thank all the members, 
especially those on the House of Commons Committee on Human 
Resources Development, who have done a tremendous job in such 
exceptional circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	I would like to thank two of my colleagues, the critic for the Bloc 
Quebecois and the critic for the Reform Party, for their 
co-operation. We want to pursue this issue in this same spirit of 
co-operation. It is my hope that we will always be able to count on 
their co-operation, and that this bill will pass in this House and in 
the other place and will soon become law in the true meaning of the 
word.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I, too, want to welcome this bill. We will have the 
opportunity to come back to it, but I must say this bill needs some 
significant amendments. We wish the minister had been more 
courageous as far as replacement workers and technological 
changes are concerned and he is aware of that, but nonetheless, I 
am convinced that the minister acted in good faith and gave the 
committee all the information we asked for and I want to thank him 
and his associates, Albano Gidaro and Pierre Tremblay, for that. I 
also want to thank our researcher, Marc-André Veilleux, who 
worked hard in order to propose some very appropriate 
amendments.
<P>
	That being said, we must remind the House that this bill is far 
more than an ordinary law, more than a simple  law, because it 
deals with the Canada Labour Code. Authorities will be required to 
make some extremely important rulings based on the wording of 
the code, as these rulings will impact on labour democracy and on 
the balance we have the right to expect in labour-management 
relations.
<P>
	I wish the government had done much more. I understand that 
the conditions one must deal with as Minister of Labour in a 
continental country like Canada, where conservative forces are 
extremely active, are not the same as in Quebec. We will have the 
opportunity to come back to this, but, as you know, in Quebec, the 
whole issue of labour democracy and replacement workers has 
been settled for at least 10 if not 20 years.
<P>
	Let us start at the beginning, that is with the positive aspects of 
the bill. I believe that all the parties mentioned that the Canada 
Industrial Relations Board, which will replace the present Canada 
Labour Relations Board, will be much more representative. The 
concerned parties had asked to be associated with the appointment 
process and, indeed, the new board will have three permanent 
members appointed from among the employers and three 
permanent members from the union movement. That is positive.
<P>
	There is also in the bill a willingness to give the board more 
power to avoid what happened a few months ago, when a major 
crisis almost split the board-those who followed the issue will 
understand-while at the same time defining the scope of the board 
and the powers given to the chairperson, and this is positive as 
well.
<P>
	We also welcome the possibility for the board to have a panel of 
one. This will make the process much more efficient. Work will 
proceed faster, and this should be to the advantage of all parties 
involved.
<P>
	We are also pleased by the willingness of the government to 
redefine the role of Director General of the Federal Mediation and 
Conciliation Service. That person, a man at the present time, 
intervenes at every stage of a labour dispute and is responsible for 
making very important recommendations to the minister. To that 
extent, we believe it is wise that his or her role be clearly defined.
<P>
	One of the most remarkable achievements of the bill is probably 
the addition to the new labour code of a single-stage conciliation 
process, something which had been requested by all parties. I will 
come back to that point, but let me say that the previous two- or 
three-stage process was extremely time-consuming and probably 
not very conducive to bringing the parties together.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	That being said, it would have been possible for the minister to 
be much bolder, much more enterprising.
<P>
	We have to admit that, even though a number of amendments are 
worthwhile, this reform is incomplete.  Still, extremely important 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8874"> 8874 </A></B>
<P>
demands were made, by both management and labour, but the 
government did not respond favourably to them.
<P>
	I will give some examples. First, it has long been recognized that 
RCMP officers and workers are being discriminated against. The 
Sims report, which the minister likes to quote at length, shows it 
makes absolutely no sense for the RCMP to be the only police force 
in Canada not to have access to collective bargaining.
<P>
	We are not talking about the right to strike. No RCMP 
spokesperson, both in the recent past and in the evidence submitted 
to the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development, 
asked for the right to strike. They understand the nature of their 
work. However, they legitimately asked to be able to negotiate, to 
have access to collective bargaining, like all other public sector 
workers.
<P>
	When they were on this side of the House, the Liberals moved 
some motions calling for the right of RCMP officers to unionize. 
Now in government, the same Liberals are cruelly letting them 
down.
<P>
	The House will recall that the official opposition tabled a motion 
but the Liberals refused to debate these matters. Today, we are 
faced with this kind of discrimination being perpetuated, 
maintained and condoned by a government, which should be 
ashamed of itself for denying people as central to the functioning of 
society as RCMP members the right to unionize.
<P>
	Same thing with the Public Service Alliance of Canada and the 
Professional Institute of the Public Service. Both unions have made 
representations to the government in order to come under part I of 
the Canada Labour Code. This demand was made in committee. 
They met privately with the minister, but in the end, although this 
would be in their best interest, these workers are still not allowed to 
negotiate under part I of the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	Why did PSAC and PIPS members ask for this right? Quite 
simply because, being subject to the Public Service Staff Relations 
Act, PSAC cannot negotiate provisions as important as those 
governing job security, protection against technological 
changes-I will come back on that-job classification, 
appointments, promotions, transfers, all very important aspects of 
a career plan.
<P>
	What difference would it have made for the government to 
recognize that it would be beneficial, a very significant motivating 
factor for public service employees to be able to bargain under part 
I? It must be recognized that there was serious lack of sensitivity on 
the part of the government on this issue in particular. Sensitivity is 
what sets great reforms apart.
<P>
	This is an amendment that would not have cost the public purse 
tremendous amounts of money. We can see in what shape public 
finances are in Canada. This is an amendment that would have 
represented a very  significant motivating factor for workers. It is 
sad to say the least-and that is what bothers me the most-that the 
government turned a deaf ear. And I know my colleagues are as 
disappointed as I am.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> I am grateful to them for sharing a sorrow as deep 
as it is obvious, when all is said and done.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary is laughing, but he did go along the 
government. He said nothing. He remained silent, close-mouthed. 
He did not let on anything, when he should have come to the 
defence of civil servants on this issue.
<P>
	The bill has another flaw, another major shortcoming, which 
concerns the committee. All the hon. members in the House spend 
a lot of time in committee; come would even say too much time. 
We wanted the committee to be involved in the appointment 
process, to be involved in certain strategic decisions regarding the 
Canada Industrial Relations Board.
<P>
	We have been extremely supportive of the government's 
amendments, when these resulted in allowing the Board to act more 
expeditiously, much more diligently. We believed, and we still do, 
that one way to improve the labour relations process, as far as 
appointments, or certain strategic decisions, are concerned, would 
be to establish a link between this process and the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development, which includes 
elected members of all political parties. Sadly, we met with nothing 
but indifference in this regard.
<P>
	The bill has another flaw, and I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that you 
will agree with my analysis that the situation is perfectly 
ridiculous. On a bright sunny day, the CSN appeared before the 
committee. The very vocal CSN came to see us, and so did workers 
from Ogilvie Mills, who went through a long, hard and risky work 
conflict that left very concrete scars, all this because of the lack of 
antiscab provisions in the federal legislation. But I will get back to 
this issue later on.
<P>
	We proposed a seemingly unimportant amendment, which did 
not ask the government to spend more or to change its philosophy. 
What did we ask? You will not believe this. We asked that flour 
mills come under provincial jurisdiction. Believe it or not, our 
amendment was not taken into consideration. And yet we had made 
it very clear that mills had to come under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Could someone in this House, perhaps the parliamentary 
secretary, tell us for what reason mills were under federal 
jurisdiction in such unusual circumstances as World War II? We 
can understand why, in that specific context, mills would come 
under federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8875"> 8875 </A></B>
<P>
jurisdiction, but what was the rationale behind this? I am  
convinced that if we did a little survey and asked people around 
why, in 1997, flour mills are under federal jurisdiction, no one 
would be able to provide an explanation.
<P>
	Everyone knows that it would be much simpler, wiser and 
smarter to have mills come under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Believe it or not, the government bluntly rejected our 
amendment. I made a wager, something I very seldom do, I bet that 
if there were an amendment from the Bloc Quebecois that had a 
chance to be well received by the government, it was not the one 
about replacement workers nor the one about the right to strike, but 
the one about flour mills. Well, my amendment was defeated. I 
found myself with both feet in the flour.
<P>
	I want to quote what the CNTU people told us: ``Most people 
who get involved in our labour relations for the first time are 
always surprised to find out that mill workers come under the 
Canada Labour Code. As for us, after having been a union for more 
than 30 years, we are still wondering about this situation. Why is 
that? Because before modern laws governing collective labour 
relations came into effect, the federal government, using its 
declaratory power-and I know the hon. member for Chambly, 
being a lawyer, understands the impact of the declaratory 
power-ruled that flour mills came under its jurisdiction''.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	The witness went on: ``Such an initiative may have been justified 
in an era of world conflicts and protectionism, but not today, 
especially since the Americans have gained control over most of 
this production, and especially since the Crow's Nest rate was 
abolished and it is easier to move wheat across the U.S. border. The 
argument no longer holds''.
<P>
	It is not the Bloc saying it, nor the opposition critic for labour 
relations, it was a witness as neutral as the CNTU. So the CNTU is 
telling us that there the argument no longer holds. Just like beer 
production-an example that strikes a chord with about 
everyone-flour production should fall under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	It was useless. I pleaded, I presented a brief, I asked questions of 
witnesses, but I got nowhere. That is what happened with the flour 
production issue.
<P>
	The government is quite silent on another extremely important 
change. Unions have been making demands that are eminently 
sensible in a context of technological change. Everybody is talking 
about technological change. We all know this is an issue we should 
be discussing. Chances are that a worker who is 20 years of age 
today will have five, six or seven different jobs during his or her 
adult life. Our context today is quite different from the one my 
father knew.
<P>
	My father, who must be listening today, worked at the same job 
for 30 years, and was quite happy with that. His career started in 
one company where he obviously had successive promotions, but 
he always worked for the same company doing the same kind of 
job.
<P>
	Workers today will have five, six or seven careers. What does 
that mean? It means that individuals need mobility, and that is why 
we talk about ongoing training. It also means that production 
cycles keep changing. Chances are any given product is not 
manufactured the same way today as it was in 1985 or will be in 
2003 or 2004. That is why unions have asked that every 
technological change implemented led to the reopening of 
collective agreements.
<P>
	Not content with reopening collective agreements, unions wish 
to take part in the implementation of the technological change, 
because for the production processes to be successful, they have to 
be agreed upon. Employers and management not only have to 
advise workers, they have to work hand in hand with them. Believe 
it or not, the supposedly modernized Canada Labour Code remains 
absolutely quiet on such an important issue as technological 
change.
<P>
	Again, we have played our part as the opposition, we have put 
forward an amendment, we have pleaded with the government, but 
what did it do? It rejected our amendment out of hand. I want the 
viewers from every region of Canada to know that the Bloc 
Quebecois came up with about fifty amendments. Unfortunately, 
the government did not approve any of them even though we 
worked very hard on them, attended all the committee's hearings 
and put questions that helped with the testimonies of witnesses.
<P>
	Even though we co-operated, even though we took part in all the 
committee's hearings, believe it or not, the government did not 
approve any of our amendments. Let that be a lesson for things to 
come.
<P>
	The biggest flaw of this bill, the area where the minister was the 
most overcautious, where he lacked fortitude, where he showed no 
backbone, if I may say so, is the provisions concerning replacement 
workers.
<P>
	I will only say a few words about this issue, because, as you 
know, two of my colleagues in this House have introduced bills 
related to this matter.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Bourassa, who himself came from the 
great central labour body that is the FTQ introduced, soon after 
taking his seat in this House, a bill to that effect. He has always bee 
concerned with the issue of replacement workers. We know this is a 
significant factor for striking a balance in a conflict. I will come 
back to this point later. I know the hon. member for Bourassa will 
speak on this issue. If I am not mistaken, our colleague, the hon. 
member for Manicouagan, also introduced a bill very early on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8876"> 8876 </A></B>
<P>
	When we formed the official opposition, we asked questions to 
the government, we asked it to step in, we introduced bills. What 
are we talking about? We talk of the following fact. A strike is 
the ultimate stage, the last resort the union has to get its point 
across. Nobody goes on strike deliberately, for the fun of it. When 
people finally accept a strike, it is really because they feel this 
is their last resort in making their point.
<P>
	It is important to know that pursuant to the Canada Labour Code, 
no strike can be authorized without the consent of the Minister. 
Therefore, this is not a process marked by anarchy but a controlled 
process. Steps and deadlines are set out. Conciliation is even 
possible in one single step, and this is one of the improvements 
brought in by the bill. What, however, is the use of all these 
amendments if the employer can still use replacement workers? 
What does this mean?
<P>
	This means that when a bargaining unit is on strike, with the 
Minister's consent, it is possible that workers who are duly 
authorized to strike see part of their duties done by what we call 
scabs. This is extremely negative in the workplace, since two 
categories of workers are thus created. This also breeds hostility.
<P>
	We would have liked the Canadian government to use what was 
done in Quebec as a model. In 1977, in Quebec, the then minister of 
labour, Pierre-Marc Johnson, a member of the Lévesque cabinet, 
introduced legislation to include in Quebec's labour code a 
provision declaring it an unfair practice to use replacement 
workers.
<P>
	When an employer resorts to replacement workers, this gives the 
union an automatic right of recourse. It is considered an unfair 
practice subject to legal action and fines. There is nothing 
ambiguous about it; it is clear. It is an accepted rule of the game 
recognized by everyone. It is a final resort, I repeat.
<P>
	We are not saying that the parties are not first asked to negotiate, 
or that the possibility of turning to conciliators and mediators does 
not exist. We are saying that when all avenues have been exhausted 
and it is impossible to reach agreement, the right to strike ought to 
be exercised with the assurance that replacement workers will not 
be used.
<P>
	The Canadian government has not had the courage of its 
convictions. When the Liberals were in opposition, they favoured 
the adoption of policies limiting recourse to replacement workers. 
Now that they form the government, they have shied away from 
that position.
<P>
	Let us be clear. Can there be consensus on this issue in society? 
Of course not. Pierre-Marc Johnson did not have it when he 
proposed his legislation in Quebec in 1977. The Conseil du 
patronat threatened to take the matter to the courts.
<P>
	Pardon me, Mr. Speaker. I am getting over a cold. However, I 
would like to reassure the government that I will be there for the 
next election. I am amazingly resilient. Give me two days and I will 
be a new man.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	Regarding replacement workers, I want to remind members that 
the argument used by the government, when it says there was no 
consensus in the Sims report, does not stand up to close scrutiny.
<P>
	Of course, there was no consensus. Could one have been reached 
on such a delicate issue? Do you think that if the Government of 
Quebec, which was headed by René Lévesque at the time, had 
waited for a consensus, Quebec would now have legislation like the 
measure I referred to? Of course not.
<P>
	There are times in politics when you cannot rely on consensus 
but rather have to act with courage and have a certain vision. You 
will understand that the government in front of us has failed 
miserably, on both these counts.
<P>
	What impact has the act forbidding the use of replacement 
workers had in Quebec since 1977? There have been fewer labour 
disputes. The act did not automatically ensure settlement of 
disputes, but there have been fewer of them and, most importantly, 
they have been shorter and less violent.
<P>
	You will understand that there is less violence because 
replacement workers are no longer allowed. Should we not 
consider what happened during the labour dispute at Ogilvie Mills, 
which was a long, violent and a very bitter dispute? As lawmakers, 
is it not our duty to remember that it is not only the workers who 
suffer during a strike, but also their families?
<P>
	When a worker is on strike for a year and a half or even two 
years and a half, his family must bear very serious consequences. 
There is a loss of income and, in a number of cases, 
discouragement and depression, which are very normal and human 
reactions, set in.
<P>
	They could have taken up the defence of workers if they had had 
the courage of their convictions. Had this government called on us 
to pass an anti-scab clause, it would have gained the unfailing 
support of the official opposition. All members of the official 
opposition, whatever region they come from, their education or 
their age, would have agreed to such a clause. Unfortunately, the 
government refused to go ahead.
<P>
	As I said, the official opposition's arguments about flour mills, 
scabs and technological change were ignored. The opposition's 
willingness to co-operate was turned down. It is unfortunate, and 
we will never forget it. We will not live long enough to forget the 
contempt we endured as the opposition here. I am not afraid to say 
so, because I worked very hard on this issue. If we had to start all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8877"> 8877 </A></B>
<P>
over, we would still move the same amendments  and make the 
same arguments, because we have principles.
<P>
	There is another shortcoming in this bill. The government could 
have built on Quebec's experience. In Quebec, there is an 
evergreen clause, when a collective agreement has expired. Which 
means that until a new collective agreement takes effect and is 
signed by the parties, there is what is called an evergreen clause.
<P>
	I would not be able to say it in Latin, although others may be, but 
the fact remains that, in principle, workers are not deprived of the 
protection provided to them by their collective agreement because 
they are engaged in a collective bargaining process.
<P>
	You can guess what happened. The government disposed of our 
amendment as it did with everything else. This amendment was 
defeated. I know this may come as a surprise to my colleagues, but 
that is the reality.
<P>
	I am afraid that my time has expired. Mr. Speaker, can you tell 
me how much time I have left?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> You have ten minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted. Ten minutes is far 
more than I need.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to bring to your attention what the Sims report 
said. Although a number of provisions in the bill have been 
improved, the fact remains that this bill is, in some respects, quite 
paternalistic.
<P>
	Think of the power that the minister has to impose, to demand 
that the parties hold a secret strike vote. This is a very paternalistic 
element, because what the unions told us is that they do not need 
the minister telling them to hold a secret ballot, that this is already 
union practice. This authoritarian, paternalistic, backward-looking, 
outdated, old-fashioned power is not granted to the minister. 
However, in collective agreements, in union practices, it is 
recognized that, such an important decision, a decision as strategic, 
as binding on the parties as the decision to strike, must be voted on 
by the workers. This power that the minister is claiming for himself 
is simply in bad taste. We, of course, had to put forward an 
amendment to limit this power.
<P>
	The Canada Labour Code contains some shameful remnants 
from a paternalistic era. Indeed, the Sims report suggested that 
eight powers presently exercised by the minister be transferred to 
the federal conciliation and mediation service.
<P>
	I am speaking, of course, about section 57.5, which makes 
reference to the power to appoint the arbitrators and arbitration 
boards; the power conferred by section 59 concerning the 
possibility of receiving, first and foremost, in a privileged way, 
copies of arbitral awards; the power conferred by section 71 
concerning notices of dispute; the power conferred by section 72 to 
appoint conciliation commissioners and conciliators; the power  
conferred by section 105 to appoint mediators; the power, which is 
probably the most outrageous, conferred by section 108.1 to order a 
vote on the employer's last offers; and section 97(3), which 
provides that the minister can authorize one of the parties, the 
union, to file a complaint with the Canada Industrial Relations 
Board concerning allegations of bad faith.
<P>
	It is crystal clear; according to the Sims report, all these powers 
had to be transferred to the federal mediation and conciliation 
service.
<P>
	Again, these are amendments that would have been in the best 
interests of the government and that would have allowed it to 
comply with the requests of the official opposition and to 
co-operate with it.
<P>
	To summarize, I must once again say this: we recognize that the 
bill has been improved because of a number of clauses that allow 
the Canada Labour Relations Board to act more expeditiously. We 
recognize that the Canada Labour Relations Board, which will 
become the Canada Industrial Relations Board, will be more 
representative of the stakeholders, and we welcome this change.
<P>
	But we think that the minister could and should have shown 
more leadership and courage by including in the code some very 
clear clauses designating the use of replacement workers as an 
unfair practice, as the Quebec government did.
<P>
	We also believe that the Canada Labour Code should deal with 
the inevitable technological changes and that it would have been 
profitable, innovative and visionary for the government to let the 
unions not only participate in the implementation of technological 
changes, but also, in case of disagreement, to give them the 
opportunity to re-open collective agreements.
<P>
	We also think that we should have taken this opportunity to 
extend Part I of the Canada Labour Code to the members of the 
Public Service Alliance of Canada and the Professional Institute of 
the Public Service of Canada, as they have been asking for almost 
ten years now.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	But the government will suffer even more disgrace when the 
Canadian people realize how it keeps discriminating against RCMP 
employees by refusing them the same access to collective 
bargaining as all the other police forces in Canada.
<P>
	Is it acceptable that, in the RCMP, a grievance from an employee 
must be heard by the RCMP commissioner, which makes him both 
judge and jury? This goes against one of the most basic principles 
of natural justice.
<P>
	So the reform did not go far enough and, I think it must be said, 
lacked vision and breath, but we were vigilant and we moved 
amendments. Everybody must know that the government did not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8878"> 8878 </A></B>
<P>
pay due consideration  to our amendment proposals. They were 
rejected offhandedly, yet they would have greatly improved the 
bill.
<P>
	I want to tell you-and I will conclude on this-that if the same 
bill were to come up for study once again, we as people of principle 
would not hesitate to move exactly the same amendments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first 
phase amendments to the Canada Labour Code will soon be sent off 
to receive their rubber stamp from the other place. It also appears 
that changes to parts I and II of the code will have to wait for 
another Parliament. Hopefully the next Parliament will be more 
even handed with the revisions than this one was.
<P>
	During the debate at report stage I proposed 16 amendments to 
the bill. Reformers thought these would clarify and improve the 
legislation. We wanted to give labour and management the 
mechanism to solve their differences. The government, however, is 
more interested in courting the favour of the separatists than in 
bringing in balanced labour laws.
<P>
	Federal jurisdiction in labour matters is interprovincial and 
international in scope. While less than a million Canadians work in 
industries covered by the Canada Labour Code, federally regulated 
businesses are service oriented and involved in the free movement 
of goods and services, capital and people across Canada. Because 
of the unique nature of the federal system, alternative sources are 
often not available. The operation of these industry sectors are vital 
to the nation's economy and to the nation's daily functioning.
<P>
	Canada has a world class transportation system and a 
communications infrastructure that should not be allowed to 
become vulnerable to closure. A disruption in the day to day 
operations of vital transportation sectors would inhibit the 
functioning of the national economy. The potential impact of even 
a short disruption of many federal operations would not only be 
catastrophic to Canadian businesses but to the Canadian economy 
as a whole.
<P>
	A strike in either the rail, truck or sectors that service the 
Canadian automotive industry which has to move its finished 
products, raw materials and parts throughout North America on a 
daily basis could also be catastrophic. For example, two million 
manufacturing jobs depend on the federally regulated sector to 
provide the services and infrastructure vital to their existence. 
Many manufacturers operate on the just in time principle and 
disruption in the source of supply is felt immediately.
<P>
	For instance, at General Motors over 100 rail cars and 925 trucks 
deliver components to their Canadian plants daily and over 225 rail 
cars and 180 trucks are required to ship finished products across the 
country and United  States every day. A work stoppage in these 
vital sectors affect all GM employees who face layoffs when the 
parts and components are not available. Companies must be 
flexible, adaptable and efficient to meet changing conditions and 
the changing needs of their customers.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	The government should be minimizing the intrusions into labour 
markets and employer-employee relations by passing legislation to 
ensure that both parties negotiate within an equitable and fair 
bargaining environment.
<P>
	Legislation and regulation should help create an environment 
which encourages economic growth, investment and job creation. 
Collective bargaining is about compromise and negotiation. We 
cannot legislate good labour relations.
<P>
	I would like to talk a while about final offer selection arbitration. 
This certainly is not the first time I have spoken on that concept in 
the House. It is interesting to note that the previous speaker, the 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, went on and on about the 
need in his estimation for anti-replacement worker legislation.
<P>
	With the adoption of final offer selection arbitration there would 
be no need to have anti-replacement worker legislation. If the two 
parties could not come to an agreement they would have an 
agreement imposed on them from one of their positions. We as a 
party prefer this method to the other one that has been used in the 
House many times.
<P>
	When back to work legislation is used as it has been 19 times in 
the last 20 years, we find that after the parties have been legislated 
back to work they have to go through final offer arbitration as a 
result and come to an agreement at that point.
<P>
	If it is good in one situation why not make it available at the 
beginning? The parliamentary secretary has agreed with us that the 
method of legislating workers back to work has not been effective. 
As a matter of fact in his own words-and I agree with his 
summation-it encourages both management and labour to depend 
on back to work legislation.
<P>
	One of the unique things about final offer selection arbitration is 
that it does not in any way diminish the negotiation process. It is a 
tool that will help improve the bargaining process by having both 
parties get their positions as close together as they possibly can, 
knowing that if they are too far apart they may be risking a final 
arbitration decision that would not be anywhere near what they 
would like.
<P>
	The thing about a final offer arbitration that makes it rather 
unique is that while it is there to be used in a situation where the 
parties cannot agree, the ultimate use of final offer arbitration 
selection would be not to use it at all. It would encourage the two 
parties to come to  agreement on their own. Any agreement the two 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8879"> 8879 </A></B>
<P>
parties can come to on their own is the best possible agreement for 
all involved.
<P>
	Stable labour relations will provide investment and reinvestment 
in a country that does not have what is considered to be by 
management stable labour relations. Management will be tempted, 
if not forced, to look to other countries in which to set up their 
businesses.
<P>
	Our economy is such that we cannot afford to have job producing 
businesses move out of the country. It is entirely incumbent on us 
as legislators to create a climate in which as many people as 
possible can be kept employed within our borders. We should be 
encouraging businesses, manufacturers and employers of all kinds 
to set up shop and employ Canadians. If we do not, we certainly 
risk our reputation as a worldwide exporter and supplier of goods. 
We also risk the possibility of employers moving to other countries 
where labour laws are a little more beneficial to them.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Final offer selection arbitration does not favour one side or the 
other. It is an equal tool that can be called for by either party. The 
two parties have to agree on an arbitrator. They have to put forth 
the respective parts of the agreement that have been agreed and not 
agreed on and their final positions on the items on which they do 
not agree.
<P>
	From that the arbitrator chooses all of one position or all the 
other position. Through this process the two parties will come as 
close as they can to an agreement, knowing full well that the 
arbitrator can select all of one or all of the other. The arbitrator's 
decision would be binding.
<P>
	A permanent and fair resolution process must be put in place that 
is removed from the whims of government. Back to work 
legislation has become all too predictable. Management and unions 
have become accustomed to it and in some cases rely on it. 
Permanent legislation would provide both sides with predictable 
rules and a timetable by which to negotiate.
<P>
	We have talked about Canadian jobs. I do not think there is a 
member of the House who is not concerned about the high rate of 
unemployment in Canada today. We should all be, as I am sure we 
are, thinking of ways to ensure that more and more Canadians are 
employed. The risk to Canadian jobs should be minimized by what 
happens in the House.
<P>
	Not only will there be a significant impact on the number of jobs 
lost in the export sector if disputes cannot be resolved, but jobs at 
the ports will be at severe risk. We are in a position where shippers 
and receivers of goods will be looking to other ports if we cannot 
resolve the issue of work stoppages, particularly on the west coast 
ports of Canada. We have to compete whether or  not we like it with 
ports along the west coast of the United States, most notably the 
port of Seattle.
<P>
	Any interruption in the services covered by part I of the Canada 
Labour Code can have a very devastating effect on the Canadian 
economy. There must be some regulation by various levels of 
government. It is unnecessary to put unnecessary measures in place 
each time labour and management are unable to reach a satisfactory 
agreement. That is what has happened in the past. Resolving the 
differences of the two groups can be achieved without interrupting 
the regular flow of government proceedings.
<P>
	We are not talking about doing anything whatsoever to inhibit or 
endanger the collective bargaining process. We are talking about a 
way to enhance it and that way is final offer selection arbitration.
<P>
	Each time we have used back to work legislation in Canada the 
legislation has the effect of doing what is not supposed to be done 
in Canada. It takes away the right to strike or to lockout and it 
usurps the collective bargaining process. That practice should be 
replaced with final offer selection arbitration.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Some people will see the inclusion of grain and the loading of 
ships for which the grain is already in port as an improvement. As 
the previous speaker pointed out, since World War II flour mills 
and grain elevators have come under federal jurisdiction. They 
were considered essential to the national interest.
<P>
	It is a slight improvement that grain at the port will now be 
loaded on the ships. In other words it is declaring it an essential 
service of one particular group of people. I am really quite 
surprised it has not been reported as such by declaring a group of 
people an essential service.
<P>
	Under the general terms that grain has been essential to the 
national interest, many other commodities fit into that category. 
Potash, coal, sulphur and timber products have a huge impact on 
the national economy as well. The bill is deficient in that those 
other commodities are completely absent.
<P>
	Parliament has been asked or at least felt obligated to end 19 
work stoppages in the last 20 years through back to work 
legislation. Now we find that once the grain reaches port section 
87.7 will ensure that it will be loaded. There is no provision 
whatsoever to ensure that the grain will actually reach the port. 
Many work disruptions could take place between the farmgate and 
the port that could tie up the system. The House could be called 
upon or feel obligated to use back to work legislation again and 
again.
<P>
	We should be grateful for half measures, but I do not know why 
we have to move in half measures. I do not know why we could not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8880"> 8880 </A></B>
<P>
make some changes to the  system to keep us competitive with 
aggressive operating ports like the port of Seattle.
<P>
	With regard to final offer arbitration, in the national interest final 
offer arbitration would be a far more effective way to ensure a 
continuous flow of grain to national markets.
<P>
	Grain represents about 30 per cent of the business going through 
the port of Vancouver. I agree with the government that it is a very 
important commodity. However it is not the only commodity that is 
important to the national economy. Groups such as the B.C. 
Maritime Employers Association represent 77 wharf and terminal 
operators and stevedore firms at Vancouver and Prince Rupert. 
They fear that the grain provision could worsen the already rocky 
history of labour disputes at the port. If some longshoremen can 
keep earning wages for loading grain they might have less 
incentive to end the strike quickly.
<P>
	We must maintain our reputation as a reliable shipper of goods. 
If we do not, I do not have to say how easy it is for our credibility to 
be damaged and for our customers to look elsewhere. Customers 
are being wooed by other very aggressive marketers. Their bottom 
line is that they cannot sit in port waiting for a load. They have to 
get their load and they have to get it delivered in order to keep 
paying their employees and to satisfy their customers. We are in a 
position where we have to compete whether we like it or not with 
these aggressive and market oriented ports.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	It is certainly in our best interest to settle these disputes as 
quickly as possible and to make sure that whether the ships are 
arriving for coal, grain, lumber or whatever it is, they are assured 
that when they get there they are going to get a hold full of 
whatever they came for and be impressed enough to come back 
another time.
<P>
	That fits very well with the government's suggestion that it 
would like to create jobs and of course it cannot just create jobs out 
of thin air but it certainly can create an environment in which 
business and industry can thrive and prosper, and they will 
certainly create the jobs. Creating jobs is not an end in itself but we 
have to have a customer to purchase the things that those jobs 
produce.
<P>
	In 1994 the west coast port strike was estimated to cost 
Canadians over $125 million. The indirect costs are to be probably 
double that. If we were to talk about the possibility of losing grain 
sales in the future the estimated cost to the Canadian economy 
could run to $5 billion.
<P>
	What I am saying is there should be some provision in this bill 
that protects the economy and the innocent third parties from work 
stoppages in the public sector for which there is no alternative. We 
use the public sector to transport our goods or we do not transport 
them. Canada has a world class transportation system and  
communications infrastructure that should not be vulnerable to 
closure.
<P>
	Some of the witnesses who appeared before our standing 
committee had some very interesting points with regard to the 
provision on grain. I would like to quote Donald Downing, 
president of the Coal Association of Canada: ``This amendment 
cannot be allowed to stand. It discriminates between commodities 
and makes a special case for one. It suggests the Government of 
Canada places a priority on special status on grain that would be 
impossible for us to explain to our valuable coal customers in over 
20 countries''.
<P>
	Sharon Glover, senior vice-president of the Canadian Chamber 
of Commerce, suggested: ``The negative impact of any port dispute 
is not limited to grain, nor is its economic impact greater than the 
implication of a port shutdown or the exporters or importers of 
other commodities including forest products, coal, sulphur, potash 
and petrochemicals. We firmly believe the inclusion of provisions 
such as this one that would create an unlevel playing field among 
various sectors of the economy are unnecessary and not helpful in 
making Canada an attractive place to invest''.
<P>
	My colleague spoke at length about his thoughts on the need for 
anti-replacement worker legislation. We are talking about roughly 
700,000 employees of Canada when we talk about who the 
Canadian Labour Code affects.
<P>
	I would submit for the umpteenth time that if we were to adopt 
final offer selection arbitration there would be no need to come up 
with anti-replacement worker legislation.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	If the two parties could not agree on the contract or on the items 
that were up for discussion, they would submit those items to the 
arbitrator and a solution would be arrived at, knowing full well that 
if they cannot arrive at a solution one of the parties will ask for an 
arbitrator to be brought in.
<P>
	The uniqueness of final offer selection arbitration is that when 
used to its ultimate it is not used at all. In other words, the parties 
will arrive at their own solution without any interference from 
government.
<P>
	The anti-replacement worker legislation is there, but it is neither 
fish nor fowl. The government did not declare any services to be 
essential services and it did not put a ban on replacement workers.
<P>
	However, this bill gives the power to the Canada industrial 
relations board to rule whether the use of replacement workers is an 
infringement upon or undermines the union operation. We all know 
that the union hierarchy is going to put tremendous pressure on the 
board to say that any use of replacement workers will  be deemed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8881"> 8881 </A></B>
<P>
as undermining the union. Certainly that is going to be the union's 
position.
<P>
	The minister has assured us that the appointments to the board 
are not going to be political, that they based on merit and ability. I 
very much look forward to that happening. Regardless of the 
qualifications of the board members, one of the qualifications will 
have to be strength of purpose because the members will be lobbied 
long and hard, particularly by the labour movement, to treat this 
provision as a replacement worker ban.
<P>
	I do not envy the members of the CIRB their task in any way 
when it comes to dealing with these provisions. If the government's 
intention was to have anti-replacement worker legislation, then it 
should have stepped up to the plate and written it into the 
legislation.
<P>
	We have often seen government take this type of approach. It 
takes an idea from an opposition party and waters it down so badly 
that the opposition party cannot possibly live with it. Later on 
government members say ``we did our best, we tried to give you 
what you asked for and you turned it down''. That is exactly the 
position that the Bloc Quebecois will be in when this bill is voted 
on.
<P>
	This provision leaves too much control in the hands of the CIRB. 
Its members will have pressure put on them, particularly by labour 
and members of the board who come from a labour background. 
Pressure will be put on the board to view any use of replacement 
workers as undermining the union.
<P>
	This does not in any way achieve a balance. The minister has 
stated that his goal is to achieve a balance. That is a worthwhile 
goal, but I cannot see how this bill achieves that goal.
<P>
	Nancy Riche said: ``I would go so far as to suggest that anybody 
who does work of a member of a union undermines the 
representative capacity of that union. None of the bureaucrats are 
going to agree with me, but we will have to wait and see. The board 
will rule''.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	She is absolutely right about that, the board will rule. On any use 
of replacement workers, whether it is management or union 
members who do not agree with the strike and try to cross the 
picket line, there will be representations to this board and it will 
have to rule.
<P>
	Mr. Ed Guest, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator 
Association, had this to say: ``We strongly oppose the proposal 
contained in the draft legislation to create potential liability for 
employers who use replacement workers. The proposed legislation 
injects the Canadian industrial relations board into the dispute and 
gives only one party the right to take proceedings on the issue, the 
parties being the union. This, in and of itself, creates a tremendous 
imbalance in the legislation. A one sided concept preventing an 
employer from operating by  whatever means during a labour 
dispute removes any notion of a balance in the economic test 
between parties''.
<P>
	There is that word again, balance. There is another person who 
suggests that this legislation has not attained the balance that it set 
out to.
<P>
	On the subject of off site workers, Bill C-66 gives authority to 
the CIRB to order an employer to release the names, addresses and 
other relevant information of off site workers to unions and to those 
seeking union certification. Having to hand over information on 
home workers and even give unions access to the company's 
electronic communication systems raises serious personal privacy 
and safety issues. Individual rights are being trampled on here by 
allowing the disclosure of names, addresses and so forth of off site 
workers.
<P>
	Many witnesses appearing before the committee expressed 
concern over the potential for invasion of privacy if unions are 
given access to employees personal addresses without their 
approval. That is the key phrase, without their approval. If 
employees have no concern with having this information given out 
to union organizations, fine and dandy. It is a contract between the 
two individuals or the individual and the union. However, if they 
object they should be allowed to opt out. There is no provision in 
this legislation for that. We put in an amendment that kind of went 
the way of all amendments that are put in by the opposition parties 
in this House. Our amendment had to do with the employer's being 
given the choice of whether they wanted to have this information 
shared with the union or not.
<P>
	On September 3, 1996 the Minister of Labour appointed a 
$600,000 commission to study the changing workplace, yet another 
commission. This should be one of the items under consideration 
that requires consultation and study before implementation. 
However, the government is intent on having this legislation passed 
and gone through the other place as soon as possible. As a matter of 
fact, it would like to get it out of the way this afternoon and get on 
to other pieces of legislation according to the Order Paper.
<P>
	However, we believe this does not achieve the balance that the 
minister seeks. It tips the balance in favour of the union and not the 
employee or the employer.
<P>
	Again, I have comments from witnesses. Michael McCabe, 
president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, 
said: ``We believe it is necessary that the union have the ability to 
contact all employees within the bargaining union. However, we 
are concerned that nowhere in proposed subsection 109.1(1) does it 
require that employees' permission to release such personal 
information be sought and received. If the employer gives the 
union this information without employee consent, the 
employer-employee trust and confidentiality relationship will be 
breached. Further-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8882"> 8882 </A></B>
<P>
more, many  employees do not want personal information released 
for fear of personal safety''.
<P>
	I concur completely. The unions should be allowed to certify and 
to organize, but it should be done with the complete compliance of 
the people from whom the information is being sought. It is a very 
basic question, whether private information about a person should 
be released by statute or by permission.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Again I would like to quote Mrs. Sharon Glover, senior VP of the 
Chamber of Commerce: ``The provisions dealing with offsite 
workers, which were not part of the general consultations over the 
last two years and which appeared in the Simms task force report, 
should not have been addressed in this legislation''.
<P>
	The Canada Industrial Relations Board, renamed from the 
Canada Labour Relations Board, has been given vague yet 
significant powers on replacement workers. It also has to deal with 
off site workers and successor rights.
<P>
	The government attempted to rectify the original problem 
contained in the bill by amending the section dealing with the 
airline industry. It could not resist, however, adding a provision 
that would give the cabinet the authority to extend successor rights 
provisions to any part of the airline sector where the government 
deemed it appropriate. Once again we have another bill going 
through the House in which the governor in council has been given 
sweeping authority and latitude.
<P>
	We realize that the governor in council must have some latitude. 
We do not feel it is necessary to deal with every intricacy of every 
bill. The minister and cabinet should have some latitude. But I 
believe the airline industry or other sectors gives the minister too 
much latitude.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to stress that labour and management 
must be given the tools to solve their disputes in a fair and 
equitable manner without the threat of government intervention. As 
a matter of fact, I often think that if government were to back away 
from a lot of areas that Canadians would see an improvement in the 
economy. There is very little incentive to bargain earnestly when 
back to work legislation is inevitable. It is a fact of life.
<P>
	I would like to put in another plug for final offer selection 
arbitration. I know the minister is no fan of final offer selection 
arbitration, but it could be a solution. Despite what the minister 
says there is widespread support for it and it would be a great 
improvement to the labour-management situation.
<P>
	The purpose of a strike is to force a settlement and final offer 
selection arbitration is a mechanism which will force a settlement 
but with the unique attribute that when used to its ultimate, it is not 
used at all. It encourages parties to reach a solution.
<P>
	As I have said many times, a solution arrived at by the parties 
involved is certainly the very best solution for everybody. It puts 
the onus on both sides, rather than saying: ``It really does not 
matter if we go out on strike or if we are locked out, it will only be 
for a short duration''. I do not think that is productive for anybody.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Final offer selection arbitration does not remove the right to 
strike. The fact that back to work legislation removes the right to 
strike should have been taken into consideration here. This 
legislation should have been rewritten so that it was not necessary 
to use back to work legislation ever again.
<P>
	These Canada Labour Code amendments will not be more 
conducive to business, investment and job creation. Payroll taxes, 
like labour-management regulations, will raise the cost of doing 
business and discourage investment. That is a sad thing.

	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> I rise on a 
question of privilege. I feel my rights as a MP have been interfered 
with as a result of a misinterpretation and misapplication of 
Standing Order 108(2).
<P>
	Bill C-46 has come before the House and is currently being 
debated. This legislation pertains to the production of records in 
sexual offence cases. I spoken to this bill at second reading and 
expressed grave reservations about it because I feel it would 
interfere with the fundamental rights of the accused to defend 
himself or herself.
<P>
	The House will carry on consideration of this very bill this 
afternoon. It still has not finished second reading. Yet as I speak, 
the justice committee is considering this very legislation under 
Standing Order 108(2). That makes it very difficult for me because 
I want not only to hear the debate in the House but I want to put 
questions to the witnesses who are appearing before the justice 
committee. I cannot until the debate is concluded in this House.
<P>
	The justice committee has given itself the mandate to deliberate 
the subject matter of Bill C-46 pursuant to Standing Order 108(2). 
When a bill is before the House, the subject matter and the bill are 
one and the same. If the House is going to consider Bill C-46 right 
now, it cannot consider it without considering the subject matter. 
Therefore, if the bill is before the House, the subject matter of Bill 
C-46 cannot be considered without considering Bill C-46 itself.
<P>
	Standing Order 108(2) gives the following authorizations to the 
standing committee to consider the subject matter of a bill or to 
consider a bill. In fact, when I examine Standing Order 108(2), I do 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8883"> 8883 </A></B>
<P>
not find that the  standing committee has the right to consider a bill 
before it has completed second reading.
<P>
	I draw members' attention very quickly to the points made in 
Standing Order 108(2). It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In general, the committees shall be severally empowered to review and report on:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the statute law relating to the department assigned to them;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I submit that Bill C-46 is not law yet. It is still a bill, therefore 
the standing committee does not have the power to consider it at 
this stage. The points go on further and say that the standing 
committee is able to review:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) the program and policy objectives of the department</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That does not apply in this case. It can review:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) the immediate, medium and long-term expenditure plans</BLOCKQUOTE>
	of the department. That does not apply in this case. It can review:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) an analysis of the relative success of the department,</BLOCKQUOTE>
	et cetera, et cetera. However, that does not apply in this case.
<P>
	Finally, it says it can review:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(e) other matters, relating to the mandate, management, organization or operation of 
the department,</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I submit that it does not fall within the mandate of the justice 
committee to deprive a member of Parliament of the opportunity to 
take part fully in the deliberations of a piece of legislation that is 
coming before the House.
<P>
	I wish to hear and to be a part of the full debate of Bill C-46 as it 
appears in this House so that when the committee does deliberate 
it, I can go before the committee having all the issues aired so that I 
can be a part and ask the relevant questions of the witnesses who 
appear before the committee.
<P>
	The committee, because of its interpretation of Standing Order 
108(2) is denying me the right and privilege of appearing and 
taking part in the deliberations that are of importance and interest 
to all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank very much the hon. member. The 
chairman of the justice committee is not in the House at the 
moment because, as the member has indicated, the committee is 
sitting.
<P>
	Could the Chair take note of what the member has said and with 
the member's permission I will show the blues of what he has said 
to the chairman of the justice committee. She may be able to come 
here to give her side of the matter if she wishes at four o'clock. 
With the member's indulgence I will put the matter over until four 
o'clock. If he wishes to come back it would be most helpful.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-66, 
an act to amend the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the 
Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise this morning 
to speak again to Bill C-66, an act to amend part I of the Canada 
Labour Code which was introduced by the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	I know there will be many more speakers today but I want to 
congratulate the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and 
the hon. member for Wetaskiwin for putting forward their 
comments, concerns, suggestions and fears for some of the things 
that are or are not in this bill. We think this is a very well balanced 
bill. Although it will not go all the way in doing the things we need 
to do for the workers and the employers under federal jurisdiction, 
it will still go a long way.
<P>
	The legislation has a couple of very important objectives. The 
first objective is to update the provisions related to the collective 
bargaining process so it can function more effectively. The second 
objective is to improve the efficiency with which federal labour 
law is administered.
<P>
	I strongly support the bill because I am a firm believer in the 
collective bargaining process. In my view the bill deserves the 
enthusiastic support of the House because it is good for workers, it 
is good for employers and it is good for the Canadian economy.
<P>
	Members may recall that in November 1994 the federal 
government issued a document entitled ``Building a More 
Innovative Economy''. In this paper the government acknowledged 
that workplace organization and labour-management co-operation 
were among the key factors contributing to both employment 
growth and productivity growth. It states: ``Well-trained workers, 
adaptable work organizations, effective labour-management 
relations, employment-employee involvement in the enterprise and 
safe and healthy workplaces all contribute directly to a firm's 
economic performance and the well-being of individual workers''.
<P>
	In other words, the federal government recognizes that economic 
betterment and human development depend not only on 
technological hardware and scientific virtuosity but also on our 
social relations and our social processes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8884"> 8884 </A></B>
<P>
	The mechanisms set up to deal with political, economic and 
social conflict are as important to national well-being as the 
structures built to manufacture robots, produce new software and 
transport resources. The collective bargaining process has 
generally worked very well in Canada. Indeed, the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce has written: ``The fact of the matter is that 
the existing collective bargaining system, imperfect as it might 
be, has served Canada well in these turbulent times which are 
dominated by global economic competition and massive 
restructuring''.
<P>
	In its brief to the Sims task force the Canadian Labour Congress 
noted that despite complaints and suggestions for improvement, 
the code's constituents accept the code.
<P>
	I am sure members have heard many times that the vast majority 
of collective bargaining settlements are arrived at without a work 
stoppage. I believe the proportion is over 95 per cent. However, 
when impasses do occur, the parties have available to them highly 
skilled, well respected and successful mediators in both the private 
and public sectors. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service 
has been particularly effective in preventing and in helping to 
resolve labour-management disputes.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	The amendments presented to us by the Minister of Labour are 
an important investment in the country's social capital. They 
modernize the federal labour law without altering its basic 
structure that has the overall support of both labour and 
management. They will produce a greater efficiency in the 
administration of law and in so doing will enhance legitimacy of 
the collective bargaining process.
<P>
	I will dwell for a few minutes with the code amendments 
pertaining to bargaining rights. The amendments improve the way 
employees obtain union representation. An important and timely 
amendment in this section provides that when an undertaking 
moves from provincial to federal jurisdiction, say because of a sale, 
both bargaining rights and the collective agreement will continue.
<P>
	At the present time the code permits the continuation of 
bargaining rights in the collective agreement only if the seller and 
buyer are both in the federal jurisdiction. This change is welcome 
because of the speed with which capital can move these days.
<P>
	As the Sims task force report stated ``successful businesses 
rarely remain static''. Reorganizations, mergers, acquisitions, 
divestitures and transfers in leasings in whole or in part of 
enterprises have become common place. Changes in ownership can 
occur very quickly and very frequently resulting in changes in 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Members of the task force reported hearing of the use of 
deliberate steps by some enterprises to change  jurisdictions to 
avoid their bargaining obligations. This kind of behaviour is 
unacceptable. It is one thing for a firm's employees to vote not to 
have a union. It is quite another for a firm to engage in various 
tricks to evade its bargaining obligations. For this reason I support 
the amendment.
<P>
	The second amendment under the general category of bargaining 
rights has to do with successive contractors. The minister is 
proposing that an employer succeeding another as provider of 
preboard security screening services to the air transportation 
industry be required to pay employees who perform these services 
the same remuneration the employees of the previous contractor 
received.
<P>
	The amendment has been advanced because in the past changes 
of contractors in this sector have resulted in loss of remuneration 
and employment at the end of each contract period for workers, 
many of whom are women and immigrants.
<P>
	The minister's proposal will deter competition based on who can 
pay the lowest wage. It will create an even playing field for 
contractors whose employees are unionized. It will help to reduce 
turnover rates, an important security consideration in the air 
transport industry.
<P>
	The amendment is intended to apply only to security screening 
the air transportation industry. However on the recommendation of 
the Minister of Labour the government would be able to extend the 
application should similar circumstances arise in other federally 
regulated industries.
<P>
	Finally, an amendment to the code would allow the Canadian 
Industrial Relations Board to grant an authorized representative of 
a trade union a list of the names and addresses of employee that 
normally work in locations other than the employer's premises.
<P>
	The board will also be able to authorize a trade union to 
communicate with those off site employees in whatever is 
practicable. However, such an access order will have to spell out 
the necessary conditions under which communications with the 
employees could take place so that the privacy and the security of 
the off site workers can be protected.
<P>
	The amendment is a timely one given the rapid growth of 
non-standard employment, especially home based employment. It 
will give workers in the federal jurisdiction a choice. If as a result 
of the amendment the board grants a labour union access to off site 
workers, the workers will be able to decide for themselves whether 
or not they wish to be represented at the collective bargaining table. 
Right now they are without that choice.
<P>
	Those are the major legislative proposals regarding workers' 
bargaining rights. They are fair and reasonable. They deal 
appropriately with some of the workplace realities of the 1990s. 
They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8885"> 8885 </A></B>
<P>
will do what they are designed  to do, namely to improve the 
collective bargaining process for all concerned.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	I do not think any employer in the federal jurisdiction could in 
all honesty describe them as onerous. Both workers and employers 
coming under the Canada Labour Code ought to be pleased with the 
balance of the amendments brought before the House by the 
Minister of Labour.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
rising today to take part in the third reading debate of Bill C-66 to 
amend the Canada Labour Code. It is a reform of part I of the code 
dealing with labour relations.
<P>
	Key changes include the creation of the Canada Industrial 
Relations Board; the modification of the conciliation process; the 
clarification of the rights and obligations of parties during a work 
stoppage; a requirement for parties involved in a work stoppage to 
continue services necessary to protect public health and safety; 
making the undermining of a trade union's representational 
capacity during a strike or lockout an unfair labour practice; and 
improving access to collective bargaining for off-site workers.
<P>
	The Canada Labour Code has not undergone major changes since 
the early 1970s. We all know that labour relations are a fast 
evolving area. In 1995, the then Minister of Labour established a 
task force composed of labour relations experts, including 
Rodrigue Blouin, professor of industrial relations at Laval 
University, and Paula Knopf, under the chairmanship of Andrew 
Sims.
<P>
	The mandate of the task force was to recommend changes to part 
I of the code. Its report entitled ``Seeking a Balance'' was made 
public in February 1996. Labour unions and employers under 
federal jurisdiction in the private sector agreed with several general 
recommendations made by the task force. However, there was no 
consensus on some very important issues such as replacement 
workers. I recognize that this bill contains certain positive 
elements, but it also contains many flaws.
<P>
	It must be noted that the Canada Labour Code applies to some 
700,000 workers and their employers under federal jurisdiction. 
This sector includes banks, interprovincial and international rail 
and road transportation, pipelines and shipping, airports and air 
carriers, broadcasting and telecommunications, port operations and 
longshoring, grain handling and other industries declared to be to 
the general advantage of Canada, as well as some crown 
corporations. The code also applies to private sector employers and 
workers in the territories.
<P>
	The Canada Industrial Relations Board, composed of a 
chairperson and vice-chairpersons and an equal number  of 
members representing employers and workers, will replace the 
present Canada Labour Relations Board. These individuals will be 
appointed by the government. My fear is that here, as with other 
organizations like the IRB, the main criterion for appointment will 
be the political affiliation of candidates, not their ability, despite 
the labour minister's earlier attempts to reassure us.
<P>
	The board is expected to deal rapidly with routine and urgent 
matters. Certain cases will be able to be heard by the 
vice-chairperson alone, rather than by a panel of three, as is now 
the case. One of the major difficulties today is the length of time it 
takes the board to process cases.
<P>
	I have already spoken to the labour minister about the serious 
problems existing within the board, particularly the chairman's 
lack of leadership. The minister's response was neither satisfactory 
nor appropriate.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	I hope that, with the amendments introduced by this bill, the 
operation of this organization will improve in future. Certain 
powers of the board need to be clarified, particularly with respect 
to the review of bargaining units and the sale of companies. It will 
also have to take the appropriate action with respect to certain 
unfair labour practices, such as those involving bargaining in bad 
faith. It will also be able to certify a union, even if it does not have 
the support of the majority of members, in cases of unfair practices 
by an employer.
<P>
	The board will have the discretionary power to give an 
authorized union representative the names and addresses of 
employees whose normal workplace is not on the premises of the 
employer and to authorize the union to communicate with those 
employees.
<P>
	I am opposed to Bill C-66 for a number of reasons, although I do 
acknowledge that it contains some positive points. This is an 
inadequate and incomplete reform. The Liberal Government has 
lacked courage on some very significant points, such as anti-scab 
clauses. Replacement workers can still be used, for the minister has 
made only one cosmetic change in that area.
<P>
	In this connection, the government has shown itself incapable of 
siding with the workers. It has shown itself instead to be 
pro-employer. As in other bills, it has accentuated its slant to the 
right by giving in to pressure from employers. It must be kept in 
mind that the Liberal Party of Canada had voted in favour of the 
anti-scab measures when in opposition.
<P>
	My major criticism of this bill is the lack of real anti-scab 
measures. As you know, I was involved for 19 years in the FTQ, the 
major central labour body in Quebec, which has a membership of 
close to half a million, 480,000 to be exact. This past February 16 
marked the 40th anniversary of its founding. I attended 
celebrations at the Chateau Frontenac in Quebec City. These were 
held in exactly the same room its founding  assembly had taken 
place in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8886"> 8886 </A></B>
<P>
1957. A very well made video on the history of the FTQ was 
shown.
<P>
	It was a moving experience to hear the first leaders, many of 
whom are still alive, of a labour congress that today plays a major 
role in Quebec society. I am very proud of the years I spent in this 
organization with outstanding leaders like Louis Laberge, Fernand 
Daoust, Clément Godbout, Henri Massé, Claude Ducharme, Émile 
Boudreau, and so forth.
<P>
	It was after a strike that went on for more than 18 months at 
United Aircraft, today Pratt &amp; Whitney, in Longueuil, a strike led 
in 1974-75 by the Canadian Auto Workers union affiliated with the 
FTQ, that the Parti Quebecois government and the National 
Assembly adopted anti-scab legislation in 1976. It was the first 
legislation of its kind in Canada and came into force in 1977.
<P>
	Unlike the Quebec system, because of the lack of anti-scab 
provisions in the Canada Labour Code, employers can resort with 
impunity to using replacement workers during a labour dispute. 
This also creates an imbalance that prevents free bargaining in 
good faith. It is also a source of frustration and violence. The 
presence of scabs, escorted by private security guards and often by 
the police, is unacceptable and indeed shocking. Workers who built 
the reputation of a business or an institution see scabs walking past 
them every day.
<P>
	Previously, I spoke out in the House of Commons against the use 
of replacement workers at Ogilvie Mills in Montreal, where the 
workers are represented by the CSN. We also saw instances of 
violence in other labour disputes, especially in the railway sector.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	I therefore tabled in the House on October 22, 1996, Bill C-338, 
legislation that would add anti-scab provisions to the Canada 
Labour Code and the Public Service Staff Relations Act. The bill 
also contains provisions to ensure that essential services are 
maintained in the event of a strike or a lock-out.
<P>
	If passed, the bill will apply to more than 700,000 Canadian 
workers in federally regulated sectors.
<P>
	By tabling this bill, I kept a promise I made before I was elected 
as a member of Parliament. Unfortunately, up to now, it is still at 
first reading, as it has not yet been selected in the draw.
<P>
	However, many union leaders, lawyers, university professors 
and labour relations experts have expressed their support for it. 
Some union people have even written their members asking them 
to vote in favour of C-338 when the time comes. Despite the fact 
that the government showed no courage in this area, I know that a 
number of Liberal members agree with such legislation. Naturally 
my own party, the Bloc Quebecois, has expressed its approval and 
supports my efforts. The  union movement is also going to have to 
exert a lot of pressure to get the federal government to introduce 
anti- scab legislation, finally.
<P>
	Bill C-66 before us does not contain a blanket prohibition 
against the use of replacement workers during a work stoppage or a 
lockout. It prohibits their use in one very limited instance. Thus the 
new section 94 of the code will read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No employer or person acting on behalf of an employer shall use, for the purpose 
of undermining a trade union's representational capacity, the services of a person 
who was not an employee in the bargaining unit on the date on which notice to 
bargain collectively was given and was hired or assigned after that date to perform 
all or part of the duties of an employee in the bargaining unit on strike or locked out.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Unfortunately, in his speech this morning in response to criticism 
from management, the minister interpreted this section even more 
restrictively.
<P>
	The industrial relations board will decide if an unfair practice 
undermines a trade union's representational capacity. This is hard 
to prove. If it is proven, the board will order the employer to stop 
using replacement workers as long as the dispute lasts. I hope the 
board will act quickly on issues of this kind. If it were to wait too 
long before coming to a decision, clause 94 would be inoperative. 
And the dispute would be settled before the board handed down its 
decision, probably to the detriment of one of the parties.
<P>
	The government should look into the Quebec's experience since 
1977, which has been very positive. Its antiscab provisions have 
resulted in less violence and reduced tension on the picket line. 
Members will remember that, at the time, this legislation met with 
a lot of anger and negative feelings on the part of Quebec's Conseil 
du patronat, which even challenged it in court. A decision of the 
Supreme Court of Canada allowed it to proceed as the 
representatives of employers. However, subsequently, the Conseil 
du patronat decided to drop the challenge because it felt that the 
labour relations climate in Quebec had changed a lot since passage 
of the legislation and, consequently, it did not want to antagonize 
labour. Canadian business leaders should show similar open 
mindedness.
<P>
	I have other criticisms of Bill C-66. For instance, too many 
conditions apply to the right to strike or to lock out. Why should a 
union have to hold a secret ballot within 60 days before a strike? 
Why should it have to give notice of a strike 72 hours in advance?
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	This provision obliges the union to hold several ballots 
whenever negotiations drag on. Also, strike mandates will tend to 
disappear. The notice period is too long, even unnecessary. Because 
of these hard to meet requirements, many strikes will become 
illegal. But what is even more unacceptable is the labour minister's 
powers to impose a secret ballot on the employer's last offers. I  
condemn this undue political interference in labour relations. It is 
unwar-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8887"> 8887 </A></B>
<P>
ranted meddling in the collective bargaining process, by a third 
party.
<P>
	I already condemned the use of this provision, passed by 
Parliament in 1993, during last year's dispute between Canadian 
International Airlines and the CAW. The vote was held. The 
employees agreed to new cuts in salary and new concessions, over 
and above what had been imposed previously. But it is not sure yet 
if Canadian will be able to survive.
<P>
	I already mentioned some operating problems in the Canada 
Labour Relations Board. The bill provides for some reforms to this 
organization, but it should have gone a little further. For example, 
the government is committed to consult labour and management 
with regard to appointments, but it has refused to make such 
appointments based on lists provided by the parties. The minister 
missed a good opportunity to ensure that the board becomes truly 
representative of the parties. Political patronage, which is a 
trademark of this government, will continue.
<P>
	Also, the board did not receive extended powers allowing it to 
order any compensation that, according to its judgment and 
experience, would reasonably correct any violation of the code and 
any harm that such violation may have caused.
<P>
	Moreover, the bill does not deal with a demand that was made 
several years ago by the Public Service Alliance of Canada, which 
is that public servants come under part I of the Canada Labour 
Code. At the present time, the alliance cannot negotiate the issue of 
employment security, protection against technological change, job 
classification, appointments, promotions, transfers and so on, 
because it is governed by the Public Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	Also, the bill does not allow RCMP officers to unionize and to 
resort to collective bargaining for their working conditions, which 
is unfortunate.
<P>
	In the area of technological change, the government could also 
have been a little more daring. It could have gone further in this 
area, which is essential to the economic development of any 
country today. Workers and unions must be involved in 
technological change.
<P>
	I would like to talk briefly about preventive withdrawal from 
work. Women's reproductive function causes serious 
discrimination in the workplace. Still today, the Canada Labour 
Code does not adequately protect the rights of pregnant women and 
nursing mothers. This is why I support the campaign launched by 
the Public Service Alliance of Canada to address this rather 
regrettable situation.
<P>
	Under normal circumstances, pregnant women should be able to 
work. However, safe and healthy working conditions will have to 
be provided to ensure nothing  threatens the woman or the child she 
is carrying or nursing.
<P>
	Unfortunately, not all employers apply this principle. Instead of 
making the workplace a safer and healthier place-which would 
benefit all workers-several employers take the easy way out and 
withdraw pregnant women from work.
<P>
	This is why the Canada Labour Code should include special 
provisions to ensure pregnant or nursing women can continue to 
work in a safe and healthy environment or receive compensation 
equal to their pay. In addition, it is important that this legislation 
apply to all Canadian women. It is time society assumed its 
responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Women should not have to put up alone with the drawbacks of 
reproduction. Again, I call upon the government to introduce 
legislation on this.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Sims report recommended that some powers 
held by the Minister of Labour be transferred to the federal 
mediation and conciliation service, which, unfortunately, has not 
been done.
<P>
	Finally, I regret the government majority defeated every 
amendment moved by the Bloc Quebecois, although these were all 
amendments designed to improve the bill. For these reasons, I will 
vote against Bill C-66.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to add my voice to those who are speaking 
on Bill C-66.
<P>
	I want to begin my comments by relating to the House the 
importance of this issue, in particular as it affects prairie grain 
producers who are often the victims of labour disruptions in the 
grain transportation system.
<P>
	It is easy to become removed from the realities of how this 
actually affects people. We as members of Parliament have to be 
careful that we do not lose contact with the realities and the 
hardships that are imposed on innocent people when something 
totally beyond their control happens that affects their livelihood.
<P>
	If it is something like a flood, such as we have seen on our 
television screens from time to time, the last one being in the 
United States, where somebody's home is washed away or their 
property is destroyed, we feel for them. We think that they did not 
deserve this. This should not have happened to them. They had no 
control over the weather. Oftentimes there is charity shown to these 
people and that is the way it should be. We acknowledge those who 
help others in times of need.
<P>
	When it is something like a labour disruption which affects the 
livelihood of others in just as real a way as a flood that sweeps 
through someone's property and washes away their life's belong-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8888"> 8888 </A></B>
<P>
ings, we do not always have that same emotion. We do not 
recognize the seriousness of the situation.
<P>
	There are thousands of farm families across the prairies whose 
livelihood is dependent on moving their grains to port for export. 
That is what pays the bills. That is what puts food on the table for 
many of my constituents in Kindersley-Lloydminster. That is 
what pays for the little things like buying that new dishwasher, or 
paying for music lessons, or perhaps buying that new piece of 
equipment that the farmer has been waiting so long for, for the 
money to actually make that purchase.
<P>
	These are real decisions that real people have to make. It is very 
disheartening when one is trying to pay the bills and trying to get 
ahead, in particular if commodity prices are on the rebound as they 
were two or three years ago, and then one sees a labour disruption 
wipe out any potential for recouping losses of the past. It is pretty 
hard for a member of Parliament to go home and talk to people and 
say the House did not really care about the plight of these people. It 
was more interested in other issues like distinct society for Quebec 
or in their own MPs' pensions and so on and it was not particularly 
concerned that these strikes and lockouts keep reoccurring and very 
little over the past 30 or 40 years has been done to remedy the 
situation.
<P>
	People who live in the agricultural community are used to taking 
risks. They understand that they are in a risky business. Their 
success is determined by the weather, by international markets. 
They recognize that they do not have total control over their future. 
But the problem of unsure markets because of transportation 
problems and disruptions in our transportation system is one added 
risk that is not required. That, added to the other risks which are 
unavoidable, is certainly a real problem.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	To outline how serious the situation is, it was highlighted just a 
few weeks ago when we saw over 40 ships anchored in English Bay 
in Vancouver costing prairie farmers about $10,000 a day every day 
that they sat there waiting to take on their cargo of grain.
<P>
	This problem in the grain handling system was not the result of a 
labour disruption but more often than not when these things do 
happen it is because of a labour disruption somewhere in the grain 
transportation system.
<P>
	Whether it is a labour disruption, an equipment problem or a 
weather problem, of course the person who pays for the problem is 
the producer. In every instance the producer has had absolutely no 
control over the situation that has been thrust on them.
<P>
	I want to recall a situation when I was first elected in 1993. It 
was actually in early 1994 when there was a labour disruption on 
the west coast. We brought the problem to the attention of the 
House. The minister at the time, currently the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, said:  ``I think we can get this problem resolved''. The 
minister of labour at the time said: ``We think this is not going to be 
a serious problem. This lockout will pass. We trust that the two 
parties will come together and resolve their differences''.
<P>
	I do not know why the minister thought that. History tells us that 
is not the way these labour disruptions, these work stoppages are 
resolved. In fact, since 1972 six labour disputes related to the west 
coast ports were settled by federal back to work legislation. Two 
other labour disputes were settled by federal back to work 
legislation in 1988 and 1991. That is a total of eight disputes in less 
than 20 years, each one costing millions of dollars to producers.
<P>
	We had two bills that we brought to this House, one in 1994 and 
one in 1995 that legislated workers back to work. I would contest 
that it is not the primary responsibility of this House to be bringing 
and introducing into this House back to work legislation on a 
regular basis.
<P>
	Certainly we have the power to do that as legislators and we have 
done that. Members would think when we keep returning to this 
process time and time again that somebody somewhere would 
wake up and recognize that we are not solving the problem, that it 
seems to be getting worse.
<P>
	It is a bit like raising children. If they do not deal with the 
difficult situation they are facing it is apt to repeat itself. People 
need to find some solutions if they are having problems, whether 
they be problems with a child's attitude or problems with a child's 
health.
<P>
	If a problem does not go away, if it keeps repeating, they will go 
to a doctor or to someone who will offer some advice about how to 
correct the situation.
<P>
	Here we have these recurring labour problems on the west coast. 
It is not necessarily the problem of labour all the time or 
management all the time. They probably both share equal 
responsibility for the problem.
<P>
	Nevertheless, we keep blindly introducing back to work 
legislation, clean up the little mess and meanwhile there are 
millions of dollars lost to prairie producers. Then we go on our 
merry way, hoping that it does not reoccur.
<P>
	Of course a few months later or the next year the situation does 
reoccur and we go back to the same debate. They will solve the 
problem. Government drags its feet. Finally the situation becomes 
intolerable and the government grudgingly brings in back to work 
legislation, has another debate, passes the bill and forces the 
workers or management to restart operations while the problem is 
resolved.
<P>
	What happens in this case is that the two parties that disagree 
have no incentive to resolve their problems. They recognize that 
Parliament will do it for them.  Therefore they are intransigent in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8889"> 8889 </A></B>
<P>
their positions. They fail to maximize the potential of the collective 
bargaining process.
<P>
	If we were just talking about a trucking company, if we were just 
talking about a department store or if we were just talking about 
some other entity where there is a lot of competition, it would not 
matter so much if the two disputing parties could not resolve their 
problem and management locked out the workers or if the workers 
went on strike. That is fine because if we are talking about a 
trucking company there are 1,000 other trucking companies we 
could use. If we are talking about buying an automobile, if it is a 
major automobile manufacturer which has a work stoppage, there 
are other companies that we can buy our automobiles from.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The interesting thing on the prairies when there is a labour 
disruption on the west coast or through the Great Lakes-St. 
Lawrence seaway system is that it stops the flow of the lifeblood 
income for a major industry in Canada. That is why this situation is 
so serious. That is why it needs to be addressed with constructive 
and progressive legislation.
<P>
	I am speaking about grain today because as the agriculture critic 
for the Reform Party it is my responsibility to represent the 
industry and the people who earn their livelihood from it. However, 
it would be the same for potash or coal. The large mining and 
forestry industries are affected in the same way. They also have a 
strong case to make in calling for adequate and uninterrupted 
service in getting their products to market.
<P>
	If we take all the sectors together, millions of jobs and 
livelihoods are dependent on the efficient movement of product for 
export. Canada, after all, is an exporting country and when we do 
not export efficiently we suffer immensely on the domestic scene.
<P>
	I talked about all the labour disruptions and that emergency 
legislation was brought into the House. Finally, the minister of 
labour at the time recognized that it was important to end this 
labour disruption and something had to be done. At that time I was 
House leader for the Reform Party. We got together and we agreed 
to speedily pass legislation through the House. The second time we 
introduced legislation when another labour problem reared its ugly 
head, there was not as much co-operation in the House. I believe 
the House had to sit over a weekend, including Sunday, to pass the 
legislation because not all parties in the House co-operated.
<P>
	Emergency legislation is required when the government has 
waited too long to introduce legislation. There are the technicalities 
of trying to get the legislation through the House quickly, before 
further damage is done. That does not always happen. Sometimes 
some  parties, the NDP or the Bloc Quebecois, do not co-operate. It 
could even be the Liberals. When in opposition they flip-flop on 
these types of issues. Nevertheless, the legislation is not guaranteed 
an easy ride through the House of Commons.
<P>
	The disputing parties have no incentive to reach an agreement 
because they know that if they do not reach an agreement the House 
of Commons will legislate them back to work, at extra cost to 
taxpayers. Oftentimes the cost to the parties involved is less 
through back to work legislation than if they resolve their 
differences in a more constructive way.
<P>
	Finally we did pass emergency legislation at a cost to the 
taxpayers. The taxpayers are the innocent third parties. The prairie 
economy lost millions of dollars. Basically nothing was resolved 
because the same situation could occur within months. It certainly 
will occur within a year or two.
<P>
	What are we going to do about this? I have identified the 
problem. I believe my colleagues in the House would agree that it 
is a recurring problem. However, to identify a problem is not 
enough.
<P>
	The government launched an inquiry. It is pretty good at holding 
inquiries. This inquiry was called the industrial inquiry on west 
coast ports. That inquiry was given a mandate and it held hearings, 
primarily in western Canada because its focus was on the west 
coast ports. The problem is not solely in the west coast port region. 
There are labour disputes right across the country which affect the 
movement of our products for export. However, the primary focus 
was on the west coast ports when the inquiry was commissioned by 
the new Minister of Labour, who retains that portfolio today.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Hearings were held and Reform was privileged to present a brief 
to the inquiry. In that brief we identified the costs of the 1994 west 
coast port labour dispute directly was over $125 million. The 
indirect costs which included lost future contracts was over $250 
million. A figure given by the former minister of labour, the current 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, suggested that threatened grain sales 
was around $500 million. These were the potential costs of the 
1994 west coast ports labour dispute.
<P>
	The commission heard briefs from various parties, including 
Reform. Reform's position on the movement of grain since we first 
addressed the issue even before the 1993 election was that initially 
we had suggested that the movement of grain should be declared an 
essential service. We recognized the importance of the industry, the 
importance of moving the grain in a timely and efficient manner. 
As we spoke more with people across western Canada and across 
the entire nation, as we talked to the players in the industry and 
reviewed the situation, it became apparent there might even be a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8890"> 8890 </A></B>
<P>
better solution  to the problem, the implementation of final offer 
arbitration.
<P>
	Our member from Lethbridge introduced a private member's 
bill. It was debated in the House. It called for that resolution 
mechanism to be put in place to resolve labour management 
disputes that affect the movement of grain to port position. 
Unfortunately members opposite did not support that piece of 
legislation. I want to speak in defence of that concept with regard to 
Bill C-66 which unfortunately does not support the concept of final 
arbitration.
<P>
	Reform believes in the collective bargaining process. It is a 
process whereby management and labour come together and try to 
resolve their differences and to agree on a new contract sitting 
down at the bargaining table. We respect and support the right of 
management and labour to follow that process.
<P>
	Anything we have suggested in the way of final offer arbitration 
would not stifle or hinder the collective bargaining process from 
doing its thing, from undergoing its usual process. What would 
happen at the end of collective bargaining if it failed, and 
sometimes collective bargaining does fail, rather than seeing a 
lockout or a walkout, the two parties would get together and 
commit to a final offer arbitration process. Our legislation calls for 
the two parties to sit down and try to agree on an arbitrator and 
present that arbitrator as the person who would mediate their 
dispute. If they could not agree on someone then the powers in the 
legislation would be given to government to find a neutral 
arbitrator who would select the person who would be responsible to 
oversee the process.
<P>
	Then the two parties would come before the arbitrator and would 
explain where they had reached an agreement or where they had 
failed to reach an agreement. In the areas where they had failed to 
reach an agreement each party would be invited to bring forward 
their best offer. Both parties, not having seen the other party's best 
offer, would then wait for a ruling by the arbitrator. The arbitrator 
would look at the two offers and see which one was the most 
reasonable based on the positions they both held, where they were 
able to agree and where they were not in agreement. It would 
therefore select all of one offer or all of the other.
<P>
	It does not take a rocket scientist to recognize that this makes 
unreasonable negotiators become reasonable very quickly. If one 
side in the dispute were to put forward a very unreasonable position 
they would be at great risk because the other side may put forward 
a more reasonable position and they would therefore win the final 
offer selection arbitration process. They would come out on top in 
the process.
<P>
	Instead of being unreasonable the two parties will attempt to be 
as reasonable as possible and have a slightly better offer than the 
offer proposed by the other side.  That is quite a change in the 
dispute settlement mechanism. It is a very constructive change, I 
might add.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I know my time has almost expired. This is not some untested 
resolution mechanism. It has been used many times. In the 
government back to work legislation passed in 1994 the legislation 
implemented the process of final offer selection arbitration. That 
mechanism was legislated to solve the dispute.
<P>
	If that is what the government imposed on the two parties, why 
not put it in Bill C-66 and nip the problem in the bud so that we do 
not have to keep on reviewing the issue, bringing in emergency 
legislation and perhaps even implementing final offer selection 
arbitration anyway?
<P>
	It makes sense but unfortunately the Liberal government does 
not seem to be very interested in making sense. It seems to want to 
complicate everything as much as it can.
<P>
	I remind the government that while the grain companies, the 
railroads, the shipping companies and the customers will continue 
and probably survive for quite some time, it is the farm families 
and the millions of people who make their livelihood from 
Canadian exports who will not be able to live up to the standard 
they should be able to live up to in Canada. Simply because the 
labour dispute settlement mechanism is antiquated they will not be 
able to provide their kids with some of the basic pleasures and 
privileges of life most Canadians enjoy.
<P>
	I bring the matter to the attention of the House. I ask the 
government to hear what we are saying and to fix the problem 
rather than to continue in this makeshift, Mickey Mouse, haywire 
manner that has been followed for the past number of years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a 
brief question with regard to the ongoing discussion. Is there a 
better solution to the whole question? In terms of the legislation 
before us, is the new board that is being constructed under the 
legislation adequate to meet any of the demands of farmers?
<P>
	Being in the industry myself I recognize that farmers do not have 
a representative in the process. Is the government putting in place 
any structure that will pick up the representation required by 
farmers to protect the industry somewhat and to maintain its 
viability?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Lethbridge for his question. He has very accurately pointed out a 
problem. As usual farmers have been overlooked in the entire 
process. The new structure does not put innocent third parties in a 
position of being involved in creating solutions to the labour 
disruptions we have seen in the past.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8891"> 8891 </A></B>
<P>
	Farmers are the spectators in the whole process. They have 
always been the spectators. It is a painful sport to watch. They 
are the ones being hurt. They have no defence mechanisms.
<P>
	The minister proposed Bill C-66. We are now into third reading 
stage and it is pretty hard to fix it. The government has missed its 
opportunity to bring about some constructive solution. It could hear 
from all the affected parties in the dispute, not just the management 
and labour sectors. The whole industry may be permanently injured 
when there is a major disruption in the movement of grain or any 
other Canadian product to export.
<P>
	The member is correct in his observation that farmers have been 
overlooked. It is not unusual for farmers to be overlooked by the 
Liberal government. It is not for lack of alternatives that have been 
suggested by the Reform Party.
<P>
	As I mentioned, the hon. member for Lethbridge put forward a 
private member's bill that would have resolved the situation. 
Reform MPs brought forward briefs to the west coast port inquiry 
that would have brought resolution to the issue. We have also 
brought constructive amendments to Bill C-66 which would have 
included farmers' voices as well as those of other innocent third 
parties. It would give them a role in resolving labour-management 
disputes. It just has not happened because the Liberals were not 
prepared to see it happen.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, has 
my colleague from Kindersley-Lloydminster noted the portion of 
the bill that allows for the continuation of service in a strike or 
lockout situation if there is danger to the public health or safety? 
How would he feel about the inclusion of detrimental effect or 
hardship to the Canadian economy?
<P>
	We have had strikes and lockout situations on the west coast port 
particularly and in the rail transportation industry that would have 
had a more devastating impact on the Canadian economy if the 
participants in the work disruption had not been legislated back to 
work.
<P>
	Could my colleague speak on the possibility of the inclusion of 
detrimental effects on the Canadian economy?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Wetaskiwin for his question. He raises a very good point.
<P>
	When we talk about emergency back to work legislation or 
essential services we usually think about health care workers like 
doctors or the police force. If they remove their services we could 
have chaos, death or serious injury that is unattended to.
<P>
	We have never really considered the impact of our 
labour-management resolution process when it comes to  industries 
at risk. We cannot necessarily categorized it as having an impact on 
public safety, for instance, or as bringing the country's security into 
question. That is not the case but it is just as real a problem.
<P>
	The member raised a very real problem which is why I agree 
with him. Economic issues should be considered when we are 
discussing and putting forward this type of legislation, in particular 
where innocent third parties are affected.
<P>
	If we had good train and port facilities on the four borders of the 
country and the west coast were on strike, we could go to 
Mississippi or Churchill or the east coast. We would have other 
options and we would not need legislation.
<P>
	That is not the way it works. Almost all our product goes to the 
west coast or through the St. Lawrence. The greater amount goes 
through west coast ports. There is no other way. We need to make 
more ways and we are in favour of making more ways to get our 
product to port and to our customers. The infrastructure in place is 
not adequate to allow competition to have its proper role in the 
marketing and transportation of our goods.
<P>
	With that restriction upon our industry it is important that we 
have a resolution mechanism in place to prevent serious economic 
injury which can almost reach the intensity of being harmful to 
public safety. We need that resolution mechanism in place in such 
serious instances as the shutting down of an entire industry through 
labour disruption.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
with a feeling of unfinished business that I take part in this debate, 
at third reading, on a bill that is so important for Canadian workers. 
It is also a bill that will have an impact on provincial labour codes. 
The work remains unfinished because of the incredible speed with 
which the Standing Committee on Human Resource Development 
conducted its business, even though a parliamentary committee is 
supposed to be the place where issues are reviewed and discussed 
thoroughly.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	The minister chose to rely on a working group whose decisions, 
we are told, were put in a bill hastily thrown together. Then, and 
with practically no changes made, that bill was referred to the 
human resource development committee. I should also point out 
that the government bypassed second reading, preferring to send 
the bill directly to committee, supposedly to provide more 
flexibility during the debate, something which we would have 
loved to see, but which definitely did not happen.
<P>
	I am making these preliminary remarks because it is extremely 
unfortunate to have missed this opportunity for an in depth review 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8892"> 8892 </A></B>
<P>
of the Canada Labour Code. I can  only conclude that it is because 
here, in Parliament, we pass various types of bills.
<P>
	Some of the bills we pass, such as those dealing with the budget, 
will never be challenged in any way. They are a means for the 
government to codify its decisions. However, when a bill is to 
become the law for parties, to be interpreted, and might be 
challenged in court, possibly all the way to the Supreme Court, it 
should be carefully reviewed.
<P>
	The parties should be given every opportunity to reach an 
agreement, to discuss and to express their views, something which 
was not done. I deeply regret that. Be that as it may, I wanted to 
make these comments for the record. I hope that Quebec will no 
longer be represented in this House the next time the Canada 
Labour Code comes under review. My remarks are valid for any 
opposition party in a similar situation.
<P>
	Since my time is short, I will move on to the main concerns I 
have about this bill. This bill will radically change some of the 
proven mechanisms we have, for instance, the Canada Labour 
Relations Board will change name and become the Canada 
Industrial Relations Board. This indicates that the government 
wants to change the nature of the board, but in what sense is really 
not clear, since the first thing we are told about this new Canadian 
board is that it will be representational.
<P>
	However, right from the beginning, there seemed to be some 
confusion about the term ``representational''. An board is 
representational when its members actually represent a group or an 
entity that designated delegates to the board. It represents the 
groups or entities that appoint delegates.
<P>
	In this case, the board will be made up of representatives of the 
employers and workers who will be appointed by the minister, after 
consultation with groups chosen by the minister himself. These 
members will represent the workers and the employers, but they 
will also have to please the minister.
<P>
	To say that such a board will be representational of the workers 
and employers is a gross overstatement. It could even have serious 
consequences in a crisis, because the board really has to be above 
suspicion.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	It must be able to arbitrate this country's most important 
conflicts, those with the heaviest economic and social impact. First 
and foremost, it must not be constituted on a false premise, and this 
bill misuses the word ``representative''.
<P>
	I personally was extremely astonished, yet pleased, to hear the 
CLC representative tell us that the CLC had not been in the least in 
agreement with the so-called representativeness mechanisms. She 
shared our point of view totally. There are no representativeness  
mechanisms, yet representativeness is presented as one of the 
cornerstones of this bill.
<P>
	This bill is also intended to prevent recurrence of the problems 
experienced by the board, which had repercussions right up to the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development, and 
which paralyzed the board for too long. Unfortunately, the clauses 
in the code would not prevent a crisis like the one experienced by 
the Canada Labour Relations Board from recurring.
<P>
	Conflict between the chairperson and the members was what lay 
behind that dispute, and the contents of the code address only the 
behaviour of the members, not that of the chair. The minister has 
not equipped himself with the means to deal with a crisis like the 
one experienced by the Canada Labour Relations Board in its last 
two years of life.
<P>
	This bill, which is intended to settle conflicts, by creating 
regulations to govern all aspects from applications for 
accreditation to initial collective agreements and negotiation of 
collective agreements when a union is already in place, is 
characterized by major changes to the body of the code itself.
<P>
	The purpose of these changes was to update the legislation and 
expand the ability of the Canada Industrial Relations Board to deal 
with the problems experienced in the labour world today. However, 
instead of giving the Canada Labour Code this flexibility and 
giving the board an instrument it could more readily use to help 
finalize collective agreements under difficult circumstances, we 
are seeing a tendency to make the rules of the code as they apply to 
strikes and lockouts more rigid which, in turn-and far be it from 
me to call them that-could lead to illegal strikes or lockouts, 
considering the problems with enforcement.
<P>
	I will mention the new rules very briefly to show to what extent 
things are changing. And I have not yet discussed essential 
services. Unions or companies that wish to strike or announce a 
lockout will have 60 days to seek and exercise a mandate.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	If they fail to exercise their mandate within 60 days, they must 
go back and seek another mandate. It would seem that instead of 
promoting dispute settlement, this provision is more likely to have 
the opposite effect.
<P>
	Unions covered by the Canada Labour Code are often national 
unions, and it takes time to organize a vote on a strike mandate. 
They are not really given much time, because although the very 
fact of organizing a strike vote may speed up the collective 
bargaining process, enough time should be allowed for the process 
to run its course.
<P>
	So, what we see is that, if at the end of the 60 days, the union and 
the employer were on the verge of resolving the dispute, but needed 
more time, they would not succeed in doing so. The union, if it 
needed the  employer's approval first, might well refuse to get into 
such a situation. Instead of continuing the negotiations, either the 
union or the employer-because we know that the positions are 
interchangeable depending on the source of the initiative or the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8893"> 8893 </A></B>
<P>
balance of power-could decide to not run the risk of letting its 
mandate expire before the end of the negotiations.
<P>
	Instead of putting all its eggs in the bargaining basket, the union 
will stop negotiations in order to obtain a new mandate to 
negotiate. This is a real risk, and I hope it does not produce the 
effects I foresee. Rather than make things more flexible and help 
the parties reach a solution, the code restricts the conditions under 
which a strike may be held.
<P>
	However, a strike may not be held without 72 hours' notice, in 
some cases, by the union or the employer. The representatives of 
the ports unions told the committee that, if the longshoremen in a 
port along the St. Lawrence gave their employer 72 hours' notice of 
a strike, no ships would unload in the port affected as they would 
all go elsewhere. In fact, this provision takes away the right to 
strike, plain and simple.
<P>
	Also, this 72-hour notice provision, whereby an employer has to 
give advance notice of a lockout, could prove so inconvenient that 
employers will want to declare a lock-out on the spot instead of72 hours later.
<P>
	It seems to me that anyone who knows anything about labour 
relations would know better than to impose rules like these, 
especially as they apply to the private sector as a whole. These 
rules cannot be enforced. An eight-day notice would at least have 
provided a degree of flexibility. While neither the union nor the 
employer has to put its cards on the table, in this case, it is quite the 
opposite.
<P>
	Therefore, I doubt very much these provisions are relevant in 
fostering harmonious labour relations. I now come to the provision 
on essential services.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Notwithstanding what our colleagues from the third party said, I 
think this kind of provision on essential services was missing in the 
Canada Labour Code. I want to reaffirm a universally recognized 
principle: the right of association, whenever it is granted to 
workers, entails the right to strike. If there are indications that a 
strike may jeopardize public safety, workers are then asked to 
maintain a number of essential services.
<P>
	Any attempt to prohibit strikes altogether has been a complete 
failure; the strike takes place even if it is illegal. What every 
country is seeking to ensure is that, even in case of a labour dispute, 
public health and safety remains paramount.
<P>
	So, the provisions on essential services are valid, except those 
dealing with replacement workers. It seems to me that, even in the 
case of western grain, they could be an improvement, since it is 
recognized that workers and  employers are required to ensure 
uninterrupted loading of grain.
<P>
	As far as the west is concerned, grain movement was raised as 
the most urgent issue. Unfortunately, it is in the case of western 
grain that the government had to resort to special legislation. There 
are two problems with these essential services, a minor one and a 
major one.
<P>
	The minor problem is that the board does not have to rule on an 
agreement reached by the workers and the employer. Other codes, 
including the Quebec code, provide that even when an agreement is 
reached, that agreement must still be submitted to the board. What 
is really much more serious is that, since the code does not prohibit 
the use of replacement workers, we could find ourselves in the 
absurd situation where the provisions on essential services would 
be used, meaning that the employer and the union would be 
required by the board to meet a set of conditions to ensure public 
health and safety, with the employer using replacement workers at 
the same time.
<P>
	There seems to be a gap in this code and this could create huge 
problems, instead of settling the issue and ensuring that a conflict, 
while still a conflict, is kept under better control. We are creating 
conditions that could have the opposite effect and make the conflict 
more disruptive for the company, the workers and the employer.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that the major flaw in this code is that 
the use of replacement workers is not prohibited. Unfortunately, 
these workers are the source of many problems, including violence, 
in labour relations governed by the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member mentioned the grain concerns on the west coast. I 
appreciate that very much. She indicated that disruptions to that 
industry should not interrupt the loading of grain and getting it on 
to the international market.
<P>
	As the member quite respectfully said, it is an urgent subject in 
the west. I would like to underline that very much. It is an urgent 
subject in the west.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	It was not a labour problem that stopped grain shipments in 
January and February this year, it was the railways. They did not 
deliver the grain. We had interference in the marketplace and 
farmers in western Canada are now picking up a bill of somewhere 
between $65 million and $100 million in demurrage charges. This 
is lost income in the current fiscal crop year.
<P>
	In this Parliament we have had a labour stoppage on the west 
coast that cost western farmers $20 million to $30 million. I would 
like to ask the hon. member a question concerning keeping the 
respect that we want in  terms of the collective bargaining process. 
How does the farmer as a producer and a shipper into the 
international market have a say in that bargaining process and at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8894"> 8894 </A></B>
<P>
the same time try to keep the ideal model of a collective bargaining 
arrangement in place?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, I hope I have understood my 
colleague's question. When there are unions and employers, the 
only thing to do is to negotiate. There is no other solution. The 
provisions in the code with respect to essential services are 
intended to regulate what happens in times of conflict.
<P>
	This is still an improvement over the previous code. I remember 
saying as Bloc Quebecois critic in the rail strike: ``If the Canadian 
economy cannot afford the Canadian Labour Code then change it, 
but until then, we defend those who abide by the Code''.
<P>
	We are now at the stage of amending the Canada Labour Code, 
and there is no doubt that this code regulates labour relations 
between workers and employers. I saw many problems. I do not 
think these changes improve bargaining rules. I cannot tell you that 
it contains all the solutions, but there is at least a provision 
regarding essential services that should change the situation for the 
west.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, one of the 
suggestions the Reform Party made to this assembly was the idea 
of having final position arbitration. The farmer as a producer is not 
in the loop in the bargaining process, and at least it would give the 
farmer some security in getting his or her grain to market.
<P>
	Could the hon. member look at that concept and comment on it 
or are there other ways that the farmer, the producer, the person 
who depends on the shipping of the grain into the international 
market can get into the loop in some way?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, I taught labour relations for 
many years and final position arbitration never struck me as a 
means of resolving anything, as a substitute for bargaining, even 
after one party has made use of its position of strength. I think it is 
a bit of an illusion, because if this mechanism does not really 
provide a means of resolving problems and is only the 
unsatisfactory conclusion of an aborted bargaining process, then 
the problem will not be resolved.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The problem will manifest itself in another way, legally or not. I 
understand that this is intellectually satisfying. They say: ``We are 
sure that there will not be a strike because, at the end of the process, 
we will make the workers choose between the employer's offer and 
the union's offer''. Except that one can think of many  situations 
where this does not resolve the problem. Then you would have a 
conflict that would not be orderly, a conflict that would explode 
and would not be subject to the rules set out.
<P>
	In the end, final position arbitration is an attempt to prevent a 
strike or a lockout. If this approach were as successful as it is 
supposed to be or as you claim it is, it would have quickly become 
widespread, which is not the case. If there were a solution, I would 
love to know what it is, but there is not.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
know the hon. member for Mercier's party would have liked to 
have seen more definition about the anti-replacement worker 
legislation.
<P>
	Are there any instances in which she would suggest that 
replacement workers could be used without having the union side 
saying that the use of such workers would undermine the position 
of the union?
<P>
	I recognize that the member for Mercier has an extensive 
background in this area and I would be interested to know on which 
side of this she would come down. Are there any specific instances 
in which the member would support replacement workers?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, in the Quebec code-I will 
refer in my response to a code that exists-as long as a strike is 
legal, replacement workers cannot be used.
<P>
	Either labour relations are based on mutual recognition of the 
rights of the employer and the rights of the workers-and if this 
recognition is reciprocal, these unionized workers and their 
employer are responsible for there being a properly controlled 
relationship, or the rule that applies between labour and 
management is the law of the jungle. Then might is right, and 
violence breaks out.
<P>
	When it comes down to it, these are not choices, but two 
different types of arrangements. If the desire is for a properly 
controlled relationship, for unions to be responsible, the unions 
must be recognized. If they are not, and they are replaced by 
replacement workers at the first possible chance, with the hope that 
even the union can be replaced, then there is no possible outcome 
except disrespect and irresponsible, even violent, attitudes.
<P>
	To repeat, and for a purpose, when Premier Robert Bourassa 
regained power in 1985, after the Parti Quebec adopted the 1977 
anti-strikebreaker legislation, he told the employers: ``Do not try to 
convince me otherwise; we have social peace in Quebec and that is 
a valuable commodity''.
<P>
	Indeed, Quebec is the place where you will find what I would 
call the most responsible management-labour relationships. They 
work together to develop positions aimed at job creation. It seems 
to me that this is the type  of working relationship that arises out of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8895"> 8895 </A></B>
<P>
mutual respect and recognition. Not that the interests of both sides 
are always the same, but they are orderly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-66. I would like to talk about three main 
areas in my presentation. First, I would like to talk about the 
current situation in the grain industry and the problems that farmers 
are facing because they cannot move their grain from the farm to 
the coast. These are not new problems, but I want to talk about that 
a bit.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Second, I would like to talk about why we are in this situation 
and what changes should have been made by governments that 
would have made the situation that we are in unlikely to happen.
<P>
	Then I am going to talk about what Reform has done in this area. 
I am going to include the amendments that we proposed to this 
legislation, amendments which unfortunately were not accepted by 
the government and throughout I will be referring to this bill.
<P>
	As any member in the House who knows anything about western 
Canada and the agriculture industry would know, a crisis situation 
exists once again on the prairies. Grain is not moving. As a result 
grain is backed up on the farms, bins are full, grain is piled in the 
fields and spring is coming on. That is a dangerous situation. A lot 
of spoilage is a possibility.
<P>
	Farmers are facing the difficulty of purchasing inputs for this 
year's crop, having sold very little of last year's crop. Although I 
certainly do not know what sales the wheat board, or others in the 
case of non-board grains, had lined up, the major reason is that the 
railways are not moving the grain. Why is that? I am going to talk a 
bit about that later.
<P>
	I have had farmers tell me, and I have no reason to doubt what 
they say, that they will not be able to afford to put in a crop this 
spring if they do not move some grain and move it quickly. It is bad 
enough that the projections the wheat board made for the price of 
wheat are not anywhere near being met. The price of wheat is about 
two-thirds of what the board estimated, and in some cases lower. In 
many areas of the prairies the quality is very low, so that has further 
reduced the price.
<P>
	Farmers are not going to have nearly the income that they 
anticipated they were going to have. This is a reality that farmers 
deal with from year to year. Added to that, even the grain they do 
have, whether it is low quality or not, is not moving.
<P>
	This problem keeps coming up again and again. Even since I 
have been in the House we have had to deal with back to work 
legislation for grain handlers at the west  coast. The second speech 
I gave was on that subject. I am going to talk a bit about that later.
<P>
	Farmers and grain companies are captive shippers. They have no 
economic option for moving their grain other than by rail. I 
acknowledge there are others in the same situation. Coal, forestry 
products and potash are in a similar situation of being captive 
shippers, having no other economically viable options for moving 
their products.
<P>
	Through no fault of their own, once again, the livelihood of 
farmers is being threatened. It is a very serious threat. In my part of 
the country I believe there will be farmers who will lose their farms 
as a result of grain not moving. They just will not have the money 
to purchase inputs for this year's crops. The banks are getting really 
tight with operating money for farmers who have had problems 
year after year.
<P>
	In my part of the province farmers have had a lot of difficulty 
over the past several years due to drought and due to poorer quality 
grain than normal. That is the situation.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	The situation we are in has led to income instability and 
uncertainty that their product will get to market so that they have 
income when they need it. The situation of grain not moving as it 
should has led to lost sales. This is a long term problem many 
farmers and I are extremely concerned about. We have had 
stoppage after stoppage and problem after problem in the system 
that cause serious economic loss to farmers. Lost sales is one of 
their biggest losses.
<P>
	In the 1994 lockout grain was not moving through the west coast. 
Estimates were presented at that time of the loss in long term 
markets. The estimates were in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
of lost sales. There is no way to absolutely determine the value of 
lost sales and future lost sales, but clearly many of our customers 
for grains, oilseeds and similar type products are getting tired of 
Canada being an unreliable shipper. Canada is viewed by many 
buyers around the world as an unreliable shipper.
<P>
	Is the problem one of farmers not being able to produce or not 
producing? No, not even in drought years is that the problem. They 
can produce enough to meet expected needs. Is it a problem of 
farmers not getting it into the system, to their local elevators or to 
an inland terminal or wherever? No, that is not the problem. 
Farmers will deliver whenever the opportunity is there and often 
even if the price is not what they think it should be. They know the 
system does not work well and they had better take advantage of 
any chance to move grain. That is not the problem.
<P>
	The problem is the grain movement system from one end to the 
other, from the local elevator system to the rail system and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8896"> 8896 </A></B>
<P>
handling system on the west coast or  through the lake system. That 
is the problem and that is where the legislation comes in.
<P>
	The legislation deals with changes to the labour code. It deals 
with work stoppages that affect grain shipment, as well as the 
shipment of other commodities. Unfortunately the small part of the 
legislation that deals with grain movement directly is not adequate. 
It is one clause of over 90. I will talk a bit about that later.
<P>
	Farmers have clearly been put into a situation once again that is 
not right. It should not be happening again. The problem is caused 
by grain movement. What will the legislation do to improve grain 
movement? Maybe this question should be asked: What has past 
legislation the government has put through done to improve the 
transportation system? I would argue it has done very little. In 
some ways the system may not be as good as it was before the 
changes.
<P>
	Reform supported, for example, the elimination of the Crow 
benefit. We had a plan that would help deal with the problems that 
would result from that elimination. The government ignored the 
plan but eliminated the Crow.
<P>
	I do not remember Liberal members across the floor 
campaigning on eliminating the Crow benefit. I do not remember 
these members across the floor campaigning on major changes to 
the Canadian Transportation Act or privatizing CN Rail. I do not 
remember them campaigning on those things. I never heard it in 
one single speech because they were not proposing during the 
election campaign major changes that affect many Canadians.
<P>
	They made changes and we supported some of them such as 
getting rid of the Crow benefit. We had a plan to help deal with 
some of the problems. Certainly the privatization of CN was the 
thing to do, but there were many problems with the bill.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	We argued throughout the whole process about the three major 
pieces of legislation: the budget implementation bill that 
eliminated the Crow benefit, the major change to the Canadian 
Transportation Act, and the privatization of CN. We argued that 
changes must be made before the legislation passed. We argued for 
changes that would first make the system competitive and would 
therefore help to drive costs down.
<P>
	In grain we argued for changes to the car allocation system. They 
still have not come. They should have come before any of these 
changes were made. That was crucial. We pointed this out again 
and again. It did not happen. We are in a mess.
<P>
	The government has to start listening to farmers and to us 
because we are the voice of western Canadian farmers more than 
any other political party.
<P>
	We also called for changes that would have given captive 
shippers like grain farmers some power to deal with a railway that 
was not performing as it should. That was ignored.
<P>
	In terms of labour laws specifically we called for changes 
starting from my second speech in the House on February 8, 1994. I 
heard the hon. member across the floor say that he wished he had 
never heard it or something to that effect. I can understand that 
because the chances of him winning his seat in the next election are 
very slim. It is because we have been saying these things. It is 
because we have been proposing these things. Western Canadian 
farmers know that so I can understand his concern.
<P>
	On February 8, 1994 we started with my speech on ending the 
lockout on the west coast. I proposed that we put in place final offer 
selection arbitration as a way to prevent future disputes from 
happening. The hon. member for Lethbridge tabled a private 
member's bill which we debated in the House. Had it passed it 
would have put in place final offer selection arbitration.
<P>
	Those changes would have made it so there would be no 
stoppage in grain movement right from the local elevator to the 
coast. It would still allow the collective bargaining process to take 
place. It would allow both things. It was the real solution to the 
problem. Every time a dispute and a deadline would come up the 
final offer selection arbitration could be put in place. If the 
collective bargaining process did not work as it should and so often 
does with unions and management, the arbitrator could call for the 
best final offer from both labour and management. The arbitrator 
could pick either all of one offer or all of the other. There could be 
very serious offers from labour and from management in this 
situation. The collective bargaining process could take place right 
down to the final stage.
<P>
	It is very effective. It really leads to honest negotiations between 
labour and management. It would help to end some of the hard 
feelings built up between labour and management as a result of bad 
labour legislation. That was the solution we proposed. Had it been 
in place I am convinced we would not have many of the problems 
we have had related to labour-management disruptions.
<P>
	The member for Wetaskiwin is guiding the bill through the 
House for the Reform Party. He proposed final offer selection 
arbitration. Our agriculture critic, the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, also proposed that solution. So far the 
proposals have fallen on deaf ears. Having heard from labour on 
the matter, while there is not open arm support for the proposal it is 
a very weak negative reaction. It knows this is far better than the 
solution 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8897"> 8897 </A></B>
<P>
chosen by the government and by former Conservative 
governments. Their solution was to let the whole thing collapse, to 
let the collective bargaining process collapse. Management and 
labour know that when it collapses Parliament steps in and puts in 
place  back to work legislation. That is their solution to the 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Is that allowing the collective bargaining process to take place? I 
think not. That is not a reasonable way to deal with these problems 
at all. Yet that is what the government has done. In fact that is what 
past governments have done for the last 20 or 30 years.
<P>
	As a young fellow I grew up on a grain farm. We depended on 
grain and livestock but we depended on grain to quite a large extent 
for our livelihoods. Time after time during my formative years my 
father was pacing the floor and was put under unreasonable stress 
for any bread earner because we could not move our grain. Often it 
was because of a dispute between management and labour. That 
should not have happened.
<P>
	The government says that these issues are issues between 
management and labour. It is not entirely true that they are the only 
people who are important in these negotiations. For example, tens 
of thousands of grain farmers rely on the system working. 
Management and labour can beat it back and forth and what do they 
really lose? They will lose some wages and that is difficult for them 
as breadwinners in the family, I am sure. However what about 
farmers? They have lost businesses year after year after year. Yet 
they have no place at the table in these negotiations. They are 
innocent victims who have no say whatsoever. That has to change.
<P>
	The final offer selection arbitration will help change that. It is 
time the government looked to our proposals and avoid 
partisanship when they are probably the best options that have been 
presented. These are not only Reform MP solutions. They are 
solutions from farmers across western Canada and indeed others.
<P>
	I just had pointed out to me by one of my colleagues that the 
hecklers across the floor do not rely on the grain handling system 
for their livelihood. They do not fall under the jurisdiction of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	We called for other changes to the Canadian Wheat Board so that 
farmers would have a choice to ship through the board, through a 
private grain company or on their own. That would result in 
competition for the board.
<P>
	The board can continue its work but if farmers choose they can 
ship around the board. That too was one of the changes that should 
have been made before any of the legislation was put before the 
House. I am talking about legislation that eliminated the Crow 
benefit and changed the Canadian Transportation Act.
<P>
	In conclusion, the things I have been saying are important to 
Canadian farmers and to people in the potash industry, in the 
forestry industry and in the mining industry who are captive 
shippers. They are innocent victims who have no place at the 
bargaining  table. They will not be helped one iota by the 
legislation presented to the House.
<P>
	The one clause dealing with grain reaching the west coast being 
put through the system just does not cut it. It is a positive part of the 
legislation but it does not help its movement from the elevator to 
the west coast.
<P>
	Unfortunately I have to say I cannot support the legislation. It is 
a backward move rather than a forward one. I hope the government 
sees the error of its ways and brings in final offer selection 
arbitration as an alternative.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, just to remind the hon. member, 
Saskatchewan is under the Canadian Wheat Board, for his 
information. Maybe they do not look across the border but we 
know what the Canadian Wheat Board is. That may be a surprise to 
him.
<P>
	He made reference to a strike in 1994 which dealt with the 
transportation and movement of grain in western Canada, and in 
Canada generally, and the extremely high cost which resulted, 
which was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. At that time the 
cost to the Canadian economy was in the range of $200 million per 
day as a result of that strike. As a result, the government decided 
that it was important to sit on Saturday and Sunday to pass back to 
work legislation to ensure that people got back to work and that less 
money would be lost to the Canadian economy. That was done and 
people got back to work.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member can tell us why on the Saturday only 6 
Reformers were present and why only 12 or 13 showed up on the 
Sunday to vote when there was no-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Madam Speaker, I would call to your attention the 
words the hon. member is using. If that is in order, as long as we 
know the rules of the game, we will certainly make reference to 
their attendance record. It is my understanding that attendance 
records are not brought up in debate in this House. However, if that 
is the rule of the Chair, I would be more than happy to play that 
game.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I have taken 
into consideration the point of order from the hon. member and I 
agree that members should not refer to the presence or absence of 
other members in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Madam Speaker, I will rephrase the question. With 
respect to the back to work legislation which required the House of 
Commons to sit on a Saturday and a Sunday, perhaps the Reform 
member can indicate how his party showed concern for western 
Canadian farmers on that particular weekend when we  were 
dealing with that legislation, getting the workers back to work so 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8898"> 8898 </A></B>
<P>
that grain could move in western Canada. How did Reformers show 
any concern on that particular weekend?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, if the hon. member would check 
the record he would see that we supported that back to work 
legislation. I spoke in favour of it, as did many of my colleagues.
<P>
	For the hon. member to say that back to work legislation is the 
way to solve these continual disruptions in the grain handling 
system is asinine. I would like him to go to the rural areas around 
Saskatoon, where he is from, to tell farmers that back to work 
legislation is the way to fix the problem. Clearly it is not.
<P>
	In terms of the House sitting over the weekend, let us end the 
charade. We know that if the government wants to put any 
legislation through the House it will put it through. Liberal MPs 
and opposition MPs could all go home and the Prime Minister and 
his little group of two, three or four people could continue to make 
the decisions, as they do now. It would not make one bit of 
difference. We could all go home.
<P>
	The only reason for opposition members to be here is to impact 
public opinion. The hon. member and other government members 
may as well go home because they are not allowed to speak in 
opposition to anything the government proposes. Let us end the 
charade. They can ram this stuff through. They have invoked 
closure dozens of times in this House in record numbers.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister has let it be known how he looks at 
democracy. Only 3 Liberal members voted against the gun bill out 
of the roughly 60 government members who said there constituents 
wanted them to vote against the gun bill. What was their reward for 
representing their constituents? They were kicked off their 
committees. The Prime Minister said publicly after that if any 
government members in future dare to vote against a piece of 
government legislation he will not sign their nomination papers 
and their political careers will be over. That is the kind of 
democracy this party believes in.
<P>
	Let us end the charade and start talking in an honest way in this 
House. If we have different opinions on issues, that is fine. If the 
Liberals have a different view of democracy, as clearly they do, 
then that should be expressed. We will continue to express our view 
of democracy which is giving our constituents real say in what goes 
on in this place.
<P>
	Reform has proposed to do that through several mechanisms, for 
example, right of recall of an MP, the ability to fire an MP. There 
might have been some who would have been fired had that been in 
place. Freer votes in the House of Commons would have made it so 
that a government bill defeated does not necessarily defeat the 
government. It takes a separate non-confidence motion  which 
passes to defeat the government. Another is the use of referenda on 
key issues like capital punishment and abortion. That along with a 
triple E senate would make this country truly democratic. Reform 
put forth legislation in all of these areas.
<P>
	The member talks about doing things for constituents. Did he 
vote in favour of the gun bill? He voted in favour. Did his 
constituents want him to? They did not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
understood that we were debating the Canada Labour Code. If the 
Chair can demonstrate to me how the most recent exchange has 
been relevant to the Canada Labour Code I would be forever 
indebted.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> We have two 
minutes left in question and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to explain the connection between a democratic 
process and this piece of legislation, Bill C-66.
<P>
	If we had a true democracy in the House, if we had recall, the 
ability to fire MPs, if we had freer votes in the House of Commons 
which this government promised and has thrown out, if we had 
referenda to decide issues like capital punishment and abortion 
then I suggest that the legislation-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would 
like to ask a relevant question of the hon. member for Vegreville if 
he would give me that opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Absolutely, Madam Speaker. Let us have the 
question and I will give a quick answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member for Vegreville made reference to the one 
clause in the bill that pertains to grain shipments. I think we all 
agree on both sides of this House that is an incredibly progress step 
to limit the stopping of grain shipments as a result of third party 
work stoppages.
<P>
	Because that clause is so important and so progressive and it is 
going to do so much to encourage the movement of grain, is he 
going to reject the bill because it does not do everything else he 
wants, therefore rejecting that clause as a consequence?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, while it is true that clause is 
important to grain farmers and will at least allow grain that makes 
it to the coast to be loaded, what about the rest of the system? They 
have done nothing to deal with the rest of the system. We proposed 
a substantive alternative, final offer selection arbitration, so there 
will be no stoppages in the system whatsoever.
<P>
	They have counterbalanced that move which is positive with a 
negative move which would outlaw the use and prevent the use 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8899"> 8899 </A></B>
<P>
through the Canada industrial relations board of replacement 
workers. This change will do farmers a lot more harm than good. 
On balance the  legislation is going to hurt farmers a lot over the 
years. That change is positive. The other changes will actually do 
more harm than that change will do good.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to continue the debate on the matter before the House, the 
Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	One major concern we have is the way the government has 
behaved since it took office in 1993. It does not always act on the 
problem or deal with the problem but after the problem becomes a 
crisis it reacts. It has always been that way. For eight years those 
members sat in opposition on this side of the House. According to 
Beauchesne the definition is when a party is the official opposition 
it is supposed to prepare itself for government.
<P>
	We had the whole crew of Liberals sitting on this side of the 
House with the hon. Prime Minister as the leader and the House 
leader of the current Liberal Party sitting on this side of the House 
trying to prepare themselves. They did not prepare themselves to 
legislate and act as leaders of the country. What happened?
<P>
	We came to Parliament and in 1994 there was a work stoppage. 
We had to sit over a weekend to deal with it and we co-operated as 
members of the opposition. We were here to help deal with the 
issue but the government came with crisis management. That is the 
point I want to make in the early part of my remarks.
<P>
	Legislation was passed which brought in a system of arbitration 
to bring about a solution to the strike and force the workers back to 
work. That is what happened. They were forced back to work. It 
was crisis management. That is what we have had from the 
government since 1993, over and over again.
<P>
	Now we are looking at Bill C-66. Are we dealing with a potential 
problem that will happen again in western Canada? Will farmers be 
able to sell their wheat with confidence to the international market? 
There is nothing in the bill that ensures or guarantees that in any 
way.
<P>
	It says that if the wheat is at the coast, sitting next to the boat, the 
government has now put in an extra clause saying it will get it into 
the boat, which helps a bit, but what about the wheat sitting on the 
prairies and the farmers who are being injured by the lack of 
capability to deliver their product to the international market? It is 
not there.
<P>
	These people across the way are more interested in being 
government and having power. However, in terms of planning and 
thinking through the legislation, there is nothing. They protect the 
vested interests of labour and big business and the Liberals. They 
continually protect their vested interests. In terms of really dealing 
with the issue, that is not the way it is.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is now almost two o'clock. We will proceed to 
Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate the Scarborough School Board on a 
successful program in the schools of the city of Scarborough.
<P>
	Weapons related violence in Scarborough schools has dropped 
61 per cent on a monthly basis since the board introduced a zero 
tolerance policy three years ago.
<P>
	Under the Scarborough safe school policy, expulsion hearings 
are mandatory for a variety of violent weapons offences. School 
violence has decreased substantially since the policy was 
introduced.

	Perhaps if amalgamation occurs this program could be

Scarborough have benefited greatly by the ability of the board to 
provide programs and services they need, while maintaining the 
lowest cost per pupil in metro.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the report

antisemitic incidents in Canada had dropped substantially, by26 per cent, between 1995 and 1996.
<P>
	In Quebec, whose Jewish community is one of the largest in 
Canada, the drop in the number of such incidents was 40 per cent. 
Renowned for its tolerance, Quebec has now become the region 
where the plague of antisemitism is the least widespread, with12 per cent of the incidents for 24 per cent of the population.
<P>
	In September 1996, I visited the Holocaust Museum in 
Washington. There I saw the extent of the tragedy and suffering 
endured by the Jewish people during the second world war. I 
encourage governments to keep up the fight to eradicate 
antisemitism in our societies.

	Make sure that the wheat board directors guilty of criminal 
offences cannot be punished. Make sure that farmers who sell their 
wheat for the best price go to jail. Prosecute people for refusing to 
fill out census forms. Protect senior Liberals by threatening Justice 
Krever at the blood inquiry. Shut down the Somalia inquiry so we 
will never know who covered up the murders. Promote alternative 
sentencing so that a rapist in my riding is let off because at times he 
showed compassion. Hit race car drivers with huge fines if they 
speak the name of a tobacco company on TV. Pay millions for 
lawyers and settlement costs in the hopelessly botched Airbus and 
Pearson airport deals. Allow known criminals deported from other 
countries to claim refugee status in Canada.

and the government is to allow killers like Clifford Olson a national

sincere condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Dan McNeil

Canada.
<P>
	Mr. McNeil's death should remind us that every day of every 
week Canadians are working in potentially deadly circumstances 
and that we should be grateful for their service in such 
circumstances. The railway is one such industry, mining is another, 
police and firefighting are other such areas and of course there are 
many others.

	Later this year we will mark a national day of mourning for 
workers killed on the job, a day that owes its existence to the work

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the agreement concluded between the Prime Minister and B.C. 
Premier Clark on March 6 ended some serious conflicts, notably 
the provincial government's three-month residency requirement on 
out of province people seeking welfare benefits in B.C. and the 
adverse differential treatment in federal transfer payments to B.C. 
to cover costs of integration of immigrants into community life.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	The agreement is groundbreaking. First, it recognizes that most 
problems today need all levels of government, federal, provincial 
and municipal, to work together for their rational solution. It is not 
possible to continue outmoded confrontational federalism with 
separate, watertight compartments of sovereign power, federal or 
provincial, and no possibility for decision making in partnership.
<P>
	Second, while the Constitution Act of 1982 may have erected 
major legal barriers against future amendments, constitutions can 
change by developing custom convention through 
intergovernmental accommodations and administrative 
adjustments based on ordinary common sense and reciprocal give 
and take.

The Dalai-Lama has been representing Tibetans in exile and 
peacefully crusading for his people's sovereignty and

in Tibet and will not act on UN resolutions demanding respect for 
the fundamental rights of the people of Tibet, including their right

<P>
	When I first became involved with the Reform Party of Canada, 
almost 10 years ago, it was out of concern for their generation. I 
realized then that for the youth of our country to have the 
opportunities we have enjoyed, major reforms would be necessary.
<P>
	In 1987 our national debt was half the $600 billion that it is today 
and Reformers were concerned about interest cutting into social 
spending then. In 1987 tax revenue was around $97 billion. Now it 
is $135 billion. And we felt overtaxed then.
<P>
	In 1987 we suspected governments cared more for the rights of 
criminals than the rights of victims. Today they have proved it. In 
1987 we thought Parliament needed a complete democratic 
makeover. Now we know it. In 1987 I believed the only hope of a 
brighter future for our children was the Reform vision of a new 
Canada. Today I am sure of it. 1997 is the year of a fresh start for 
all Canadians.

	Revenue Canada considers their tips to be taxable income and 
use it to calculate eligible child tax benefits and GST rebates. 
However, they cannot use these tips to claim UI benefits, workers' 
compensation, Canada pension, bank loans, nor is it added to 
calculate their RRSP allowable contribution. There seems to be 
some inequities when a government considers tips as income for 
tax purposes but does not consider tips for benefit purposes.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	I urge the government to consider changes to enable waiters and

	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Resources I congratulate the government and the Minister of 
Natural Resources, in particular, for the response to our 
committee's final report on streamlining environmental regulations 
for mining.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that the reforms put forward fully reflect the 
committee's recommendations which were formulated following 
extensive consultations with stakeholders. These reforms will 
provide investors with greater certainty of requirements, reduce 
unnecessary delays and costs, and ensure the need for a strong and 
effective environmental protection regime.

	The mining industry provides jobs for some 350,000 Canadians 
and supports hundreds of communities in rural and northern 
regions. It is an important component of the government's 
commitment to rural Canada.
<P>
	The committee's report and the department's response are 
further evidence of the government's commitment to economic 
growth and job creation, to sustainable development and creating 
efficient and effective regulation for business.

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver-Est, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, many 
Canadians are very concerned about the cuts at the CBC. The issue 
is a very emotional one. It is a question of unity, of one message 
from the Atlantic to the Pacific to the Arctic.
<P>
	The CBC has been with us all our lives and has become a part of 
our existence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the last year I have held three town hall meetings on the CBC. 
The last two meetings, held in the last two months, were very well 
attended. During the meetings support for the CBC was expressed 
very strongly.
<P>
	At the time of the last meeting Nigel Peck, a constituent, had 
collected over 23,000 signatures. I was informed that as soon as the 
signatures reach the 50,000 mark they will be delivered to me. Of 
these, almost 13,000 signatures have already been received. The 
petitioners ask that the cuts to the CBC be stopped and funding 
restored. The minister has listened and has restored $10 million.
<P>
	The main concern is the cuts to regional programming. By 
cutting them, you silence the voice of Canadians outside of Ontario 
and Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
again to express my concern about the erosion of universal, single 
tier health care in Ontario. The Queen's Park government seems to 
be charging more and more fees every week. We have fees on 
prescription drugs and now patients waiting in hospitals for 
transfer to other care facilities are being charged $43 for every day 
of their wait. Imagine what this daily charge does for the health of 
already sick people.
<P>
	The federal government is the only level of government that can 
protect health care for all Canadians. I urge the ministers of health 
and justice to carefully consider whether the Government of 
Ontario is meeting the requirements of the Canada Health Act.

session of the UN Commission on Human Rights has just opened in 
Geneva. This important exercise provides an opportunity for the 
international community to learn and consult about serious human 
rights violations.
<P>
	In these days of market imperatives, the government must 
uphold its past reputation. It must break the silence that confers a 
sort of international impunity on regimes that are trampling the 
most elementary rights. It must vigorously denounce the sorts of 
actions taking place in Burma, Turkey, Algeria, East Timor, 
Nigeria and the Great Lakes region of Africa.
<P>
	This government has given itself the mandate of promoting 
Canadian values. Will it take a stand and assume leadership on the 
fundamental issue of human rights? While it continues to conduct 
trade with impunity, men, women and children are being tortured, 
imprisoned and killed daily. It is high time to move from 
denunciation to concrete and decisive action.

	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
used to be a justice system in Canada has gradually deteriorated 
into little more than a legal system, no longer serving the needs of 
society and the victims of crime, but concentrating instead on the 
bizarre promotion of the so-called rights of the criminals.
<P>
	The Olson section 745 hearings which begin today are an 
example of that bizarre promotion of the rights of criminals. Thank 
goodness Olson is likely to be one of the few criminals for whom 
the faint hope clause is truly a faint hope clause.
<P>
	For about 80 per cent of criminals who apply, as everyone except 
the government seems to recognize, section 745 is actually the sure 
bet clause. It forces the victims of crime to relive the events which 
so dramatically changed their lives.
<P>

<P>
	Does the PQ leader intend to infiltrate the Bloc Quebecois

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEDEFICIT">THE DEFICIT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance forecast a deficit of $24 billion for 
1996-97. Three weeks ago, in his latest budget, his forecast were 
adjusted downward to $19 billion.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Today, after ten months, the cumulative deficit is 
reported to be $7.3 billion, which could mean a real deficit of 10 or 
12 billion in 1996-97 instead of the $19 billion he announced three 
weeks ago.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Finance. Either the 
minister was aware that he had this kind of flexibility and hid this 
from the public, or he did not know because he had no way of 
telling this would happen. Is the Minister of Finance sneaky or 
incompetent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
considering how my predecessor was criticized when he was 
incapable of meeting his objectives, I must say that being criticized 
because I did far more than meet my objectives is a criticism I am 
entirely prepared to accept.
<P>
	As the Leader of the Opposition must know, we have a month 
and a half left before the end of the year. We have no figures for 
February and we have none for March. Meanwhile, the Leader of 
the Opposition must  know that a lot of adjustments are made in 
March which may alter the figures.
<P>
	What I gave is perhaps a very prudent forecast, but I am 
convinced that once again, we will be able to build on the 
credibility the government has established.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government would have to produce a deficit of $12 
billion in two months to get the extraordinary figures the Minister 
of Finance gave us three weeks ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Aha, Ms. Copps' flags.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> He knows this does not make sense-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> This will not fly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> -being a reasonable man. And I know his 
answer does not hold water.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> So he is incompetent. It is sheer incompetence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> I want to ask him, why, with this kind of 
flexibility, did he do nothing for the poor and the unemployed who 
are legion in Canada, instead of the measly measures listed in his 
latest budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
consider what we have done: we spent $850 million to help poor 
families with children, and add to this our investments in tourism, 
in research and development and in education, all in order to create 
jobs.
<P>
	So the question I might ask the Leader of the Opposition is this: 
at the request of Mr. Landry and other finance ministers, the 
President of the Treasury Board extended the infrastructures 
program, in order to create jobs. Why has Mr. Landry yet to accept 
the offer made by the President of the Treasury Board concerning 
the infrastructures program?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, with a miscalculation of about $12 billion in his estimates, 
the Minister of Finance should not have cut $4.5 billion from the 
provinces and $5 billion from the unemployed.
<P>
	Are we to understand that what the Minister of Finance is about 
to do, with this incredible security of some $12 billion, is sprinkle a 
few billion dollars here and a few billion there across Canada 
during the next election campaign, to curry favour with the 
electorate?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
life must be tough for the Leader of the Opposition when his only 
criticism of the Minister of Finance is that he was too prudent in his 
forecasts.
<P>
	May I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he ask his 
head office to accept the government's offer to extend the infra-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8904"> 8904 </A></B>
<P>
structures program, so that we can start  creating jobs in Montreal 
and in Quebec as soon as possible?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	We learn, three weeks after the budget, that the Minister of 
Finance has a much greater leeway than the Bloc expected. It is 
beyond all. As of this year, the Minister of Finance will have at 
least $12 billion more than he projected in his 1996 budget. Next 
year, it will be $17 billion.
<P>
	Today in Canada, three million people are on welfare and one 
and a half million children live in poverty. Why did the Minister of 
Finance prefer to keep this colossal float rather than use this money 
to give people hope once again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, in responding to a question from the Leader of the 
Opposition, I wanted to quote someone and I was cut off.
<P>
	I would like to quote the same person today, in response to the 
hon. member. I will be much shorter: ``We are on the right road. 
This is not the time to quit; we must keep going. Economies are 
changing. We must fix public finances, control the deficit and let 
interest rates drop''. That was Lucien Bouchard. He is right and so 
am I.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have never denied that a zero deficit had to be reached 
at some point. But here he is going too far.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Is the minister aware that he could reach a zero 
deficit before the year 2000 by not cutting $4.5 billion in social 
programs; by leaving the unemployed their $5 billion surplus; by 
giving substantial help to job creation and by paying the $2 billion 
it owes to Quebec for harmonizing the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
here again, the member has not asked a question. He has made a 
statement.
<P>
	I will simply say that, when you look at the fact that the federal 
government transfers over $10 billion a year, including 45 per cent 
of equalization payments to Quebec.
<P>
	We have to look at the technological partnership my colleague 
has set up, at the number of aeronautics companies in Quebec that 
benefited.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is amazing, but we have now had five questions from the 
official opposition and its main criticism of the Minister of Finance 
and of this government is that we have beaten our deficit targets 
every year. We accept the criticism and we are going to keep on 
beating our deficit targets.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this morning in Vancouver a preliminary hearing began 
into child killer Clifford Olson's appeal for early release under 
section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	This hearing will be an indescribable horror for the families of 
the victims. It should not be happening and it would not be 
happening if the government had acted sooner and if it had repealed 
section 745 instead of tinkering with it.
<P>
	Outraged Canadians are holding rallies today in Vancouver and 
elsewhere, asking how the government could be so callous and 
insensitive toward the victims of Clifford Olson's crimes.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, how could the government be 
so utterly insensitive to the families of Clifford Olson's victims as 
to permit this hearing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, every member of this caucus has 
nothing but profound empathy for the tragedies suffered by the 
families of those victims and for the people who have lost loved 
ones to crime.
<P>
	It is because of the victims, it is in their interests and in their 
name, it is for them that the government has acted so often to 
change the criminal law so that it might be more responsive.
<P>
	With regard to section 745, it was after I met with the widow of 
an RCMP officer who was murdered in Saskatchewan who 
explained to me how awful it was for her to be at the 745 hearing 
but not be allowed to participate, it was after that meeting with 
Marie King Forest that I proposed in the House a change to section 
745 to guarantee victims a role in such hearings.
<P>
	It was because of the government's concern with the plight of 
victims that last year we introduced in the House Bill C-45, which 
ensures that section 745 of the code will be used only in the most 
exceptional cases, not at all for those who have taken more than 
one life, and for all the others only after a judge agrees that their 
case is meritorious and only when a jury unanimously agrees that 
they should have consideration. This government has acted on 
behalf of victims.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister professes this great empathy and sympathy 
for victims of crime and he gives us a list of tinkering measures.
<P>
	What has the government done to actually act on its sympathy 
and empathy? It tinkers with section 745 rather than repealing it. It 
pays lip service to our victims bill of rights and then allows it to 
languish in the Parliamentary committee. It spends hundreds of 
man hours and  hundreds of thousands of dollars on ensuring that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8905"> 8905 </A></B>
<P>
Clifford Olson gets a hearing and it invests no time, no money and 
no energy in the victims of his crime.
<P>
	If the justice minister is so sympathetic, so empathetic to the 
victims of crime, will he commit today to enact a victims bill of 
rights that was presented to the House 11 months ago by the 
member for Fraser Valley West?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wrote to the chair of the justice 
committee requesting that it undertake that task, designing changes 
to the Criminal Code in addition to what we proposed on behalf of 
victims.
<P>
	Let me point to the record of the government in establishing that 
we have done more for victims in the justice system than any 
national government in memory.
<P>
	The drunkenness defence was available until we acted on behalf 
of victims to make sure that it would not be. On behalf of victims 
we have introduced changes to provide for DNA testing in criminal 
law for the first time, putting it on an express basis.
<P>
	If we look at the record of the party opposite we find an entirely 
different story. When we proposed changes in Bill C-37 to the 
Young Offenders Act to provide for victim impact statements, the 
Reform Party voted against it.
<P>
	When we proposed in Bill C-41 elaborate provisions to help 
victims get restitution, the Reform Party voted against it.
<P>
	Last year when we proposed the changes to section 745 which 
would prevent multiple murderers in the future from applying the 
Reform Party voted against it.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the bottom line is that Clifford Olson, as a result of the 
actions of this minister, gets a national soapbox. What victims get 
is a study.
<P>
	In the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the section 
on legal rights there are 16 provisions affirming the rights of 
persons suspected or charged or convicted of crimes. There is not 
one section, not one clause, dealing with the rights of victims of 
crime. Right across the country Canadians are sick and tired of that 
imbalance. They want a justice system that puts the rights of 
victims ahead of the rights of criminals like Clifford Olson.
<P>
	Will the justice minister commit today to pass the victims bill of 
rights that is languishing in committee or will the Liberals fail 
Clifford Olson's victims yet again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at a certain point one wonders why 
the hon. leader of the third party would ask, since every time we 
come forward with a measure  on behalf of victims his party votes 
against it. If we are to have further amendments, indeed if we are to 
have an amendment to our charter, perhaps it should be against the 
shameless exploitation of victims.
<P>
	One could understand why those victims were on the stage 
yesterday in Vancouver. They are driven by the pain of the 
tragedies they have suffered. One also understands why Reform 
members are on the stage and why Reform members are leading 
this band. They are exploiting the very tragedies which they 
pretend to decry.
<P>
	Perhaps most important of all, by behaving as they are, Reform 
Party members are giving Clifford Olson exactly what he most 
wants, the only thing they can give him, a platform on which to 
become even more infamous-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since 1993 the American legal system has been asking 
Canadian authorities to extradite the Jacques Émond, of the Hell's 
Angels. Mr. Émond, who is now living in British Columbia, is 
accused of conspiring to traffic in large quantities of hashish and 
cocaine and of having been a full time member of a criminal 
organization between January 1976 and February 1990.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Justice explain that after three and a

times at the request of the crown and that Jacques Émond is still in 
Canada?
<P>

this case. I will raise the matter with my officials and I will reply in

<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, by postponing the case in this way, the minister must be 
aware that there is a risk of abuse of process.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice realize that his department is 
creating conditions that will make it impossible to extradite 
Jacques Émond, thus protecting a criminal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

case right now, but I intend to ask justice department officials for

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we all

application the families of these children have to relive their pain 
and their agony.

<HR>

<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice, who is directly responsible for 
letting this reprehensible occurrence take place, what action he will 
take to ensure that these 11 families will never have to go through 
this agonizing and painful ordeal again.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this government last year 
introduced and this Parliament last year adopted legislation to 
change section 745 of the Criminal Code to ensure that it will be 
used only in exceptional cases.
<P>
	That legislation changes the system so that such applications 
will never be brought by those convicted of taking more than one 
life. It provides for a screening mechanism by a judge in advance of 
any application by those eligible and it requires that the jury on any 
such application be unanimous before any relief is granted.
<P>
	It seems to me that is exactly the way to prevent future victims' 
families from having to experience such proceedings while at the 
same time providing for the exceptional cases in which such 
applications are appropriate.
<P>
	In those circumstances one wonders why the hon. member and 
his colleagues in the Reform Party voted against those 
amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, every family 
member of victims who appeared before the standing committee on 
Bill C-45 opposed the bill. That is why we represent their concerns 
here today.
<P>
	Private member's Bill C-234 would have eliminated section 745 
from the Criminal Code entirely. The justice minister voted against 
this bill. By doing so, he voted in favour of Clifford Olson and 
against the 11 families that lost their children to Clifford Olson.
<P>
	Can the justice minister today explain to these families and to all 
Canadians why he voted for Clifford Olson and against the families 
of these victims?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the three and a half years that it 
has been my privilege to serve the Prime Minister in my present 
occupation I have met with dozens of family members of victims of 
crime. I have met with mothers who have lost children. I have met 
with husbands who have lost wives.
<P>
	The importance I place on their experience, the importance I 
place on respecting victims, is reflected in the many pieces of 
legislation we have brought forward in the House to protect and 
safeguard the position of victims in the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Mr. Olson's case is now before the court. It is inappropriate to 
comment on the merits, but let me say this. Whatever else can be 
said of Clifford Olson's application, it would be proceeding in 
obscurity now in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and the 
pain felt  by the families of the victims would be of a different 
order than that which they face today if it were not for my hon. 
friend and his colleagues in the Reform Party who are providing 
Clifford Olson with exactly what he wants, that which he can get 
from no other source: they are satisfying his lust for notoriety.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Since August 1995, when young Daniel Desrochers died as the 
result of the explosion of a vehicle boobytrapped by organized 
crime, there have been a number of other explosions. Innocent 
people have been wounded, blood has been shed. Whole cities and 
towns are in shock. Municipalities such as Saint-Nicolas, Montreal 
and Quebec City have no idea how to cope with a problem of this 
scope.
<P>
	On September 21, 1995, the minister said that he was carrying 
out consultations and that he was optimistic about finding a 
solution. Since the problem is still there, worse in fact than in 1995, 
can the minister tell the House what solution he has found to the 
problem of motorcycle gang wars?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I met with the mother of the boy 
who was killed on the Montreal street, Daniel Desrochers, last year.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	I have also worked with my colleague, the Solicitor General of 
Canada, and with the police chiefs of Quebec and elsewhere, to 
find ways of improving criminal law to back up our police forces in 
their battle against organized crime.
<P>
	Last September, the solicitor general and myself held a 
symposium here in Ottawa on organized crime, to which we invited 
police chiefs, lawyers, and provincial attorneys general. We 
discussed various approaches to provide police forces with the 
tools to combat organized crime. We identified about a dozen

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, outside of these empty words by the minister, which quite 
obviously do nothing to solve the problem, since it continues in 
Quebec, what does the minister have to say today to the family of 
little Marianne, who was hit by shards of glass in her own home, in 
her own crib? Or to the people of Saint-Nicolas, who watch 
helplessly as criminal organizations occupy their entire territory?

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to such Canadians who live in fear 
or with the pain of the consequences of that kind of crime, the 
government pledges again to renew its commitment to improve the 
criminal law to provide police with the tools they need to combat 
the activities of gangs.
<P>
	There is no single simple answer to this complex issue. One 
speaks of an anti-gang bill. It is very difficult to define such a bill 
in ways that would make it valid and effective. Simply to 
criminalize organizations is not an answer. The simple response to 
that by the gangs is to change the name or the nature of the 
organization.
<P>
	What is more effective in the long run for the victims of which 
the member spoke and for Canadians everywhere is to work 
constructively with the police to change the criminal law in ways 
that will make it easier for the police to gather proof and evidence 
against such illegalities.
<P>
	That is what we had in mind when the solicitor general and I 
convened our anti-gang symposium last September. We left with a 
dozen concrete proposals for changing the criminal law. We will 
act upon them in the weeks and months ahead so that we will give 
police the tools to combat the very activity of which the hon. 
member spoke.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Christine, Colleen, Daryn, Sandra, Ada, Simon, Judy, Raymond, 
Sigrun, Terry Lyn and Louise. These are the names of Clifford 
Olson's victims and it is their families that are being victimized, 
again thanks to the Liberal government.
<P>
	Thanks to the Liberal government, Clifford Olson gets a soapbox 
while his victims have to fight to be heard. Why will the Prime 
Minister not put the rights of victims ahead of the rights of 
criminals like Clifford Olson and enact a victims' bill of rights?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if there is anyone who is providing 
a soapbox, it is the hon. member and colleagues in her party who 
are providing a soapbox to Clifford Olson. It is a tactic of which 
they should be ashamed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are glad that someone is willing to speak up for the 
families and the victims in the right way.
<P>
	It is clear the Liberal government is determined to put 
consideration for brutal criminals ahead of consideration for 
innocent citizens. How can Canadians trust their safety to a 
government with such skewed priorities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government's priorities from 
day one in the criminal justice system  have been to make our 
society as safe as it can and to show respect for the victims of 
crime.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	Through all the legislation in the three and a half years of the 
government there is a single thread, that is to make the system 
more responsive to and respectful of the needs of victims. Yet time 
and again the hon. member and her colleagues in the Reform Party 
have voted against initiatives we have introduced on behalf of 
victims.
<P>
	In Bill C-41, changes to the sentencing law, we provided for 
restitution to victims and the Reform Party voted against it. In Bill 
C-45 we proposed to change the very section of which the member 
complains. The hon. member and her colleagues in the Reform 
Party voted against it.
<P>
	The Canadian people will have an opportunity in due course to 
look at the record.

question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	This morning the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported that Mr. Justice 
Krever complained in a letter about the government's interference 
with the work of his commission. He stated that the government 
had threatened to shut down the commission if it insisted on laying 
blame on certain senior officials and ministers.
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister again justify her 
government's interfering with a commission of inquiry that should 
normally be able to finish its work without government 
interference?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member will know that in December 1995 the Minister of 
Justice made application to the court to have certain matters 
adjudicated.
<P>
	The court that heard the application by the Minister of Justice 
denied the application. Thereafter certain individuals and 
stakeholders appealed to a higher court.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member would want the record to show that 
the Government of Canada did not appeal the decision which I 
believe was reached in June of the following year.
<P>
	I make perfectly clear that the government looks forward to the 
report of Justice Krever. We look forward to examining his 
recommendations. To the best of my knowledge there was never 
any intent whatsoever to try to close down the Krever inquiry.

one particularly disturbing fact in this whole affair. Both the Krever 
and Létourneau commissions were targets of all kinds of 
obstruction from the government's officials and its ministers.
<P>
	Does the Deputy Prime Minister realize that with this kind of 
approach she has discredited commissions of inquiry, and could 
she tell us if any judge would, in the future, agree to preside over an 
inquiry, in the knowledge that the government can intervene at any 
time to prevent the chairman from doing his job?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I can well understand the desperation of hon. members opposite 
when they make such ludicrous charges.
<P>
	The House should be informed that the commission has held 
over 250 days of public hearings. It has heard over 350 witnesses, 
almost half of whom were the victims.
<P>
	Testimony has been recorded on over 40,000 pages of 
commission transcript. Over half a million pages of exhibit 
evidence has been filed. The commission's deadline has been 
extended not once, not twice, but three times and the commission 
has a budget of well over $15 million.
<P>
	We were the ones in opposition who called for a judicial inquiry 
into the blood system. I am happy Justice Krever is heading that

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take 
particular note that Thornley did not receive a single, solitary 
heritage contract until the minister took over. Since the minister 
took office in January 1996, Thornley has managed to secure at

	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Four years ago, Karim, the son of Micheline Tremblay, was 
kidnapped by her ex-spouse who is hiding him somewhere in 
Egypt. Mrs. Tremblay made numerous representations to the police 
and judicial authorities. Interpol issued an arrest warrant against 
the former spouse. The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. 
André Ouellet, promised early in 1996 to sign a bilateral agreement 
with Egypt that would have made it possible to bring the child 
home. However, Mrs. Tremblay only saw her son for three hours, 
and she is still calling for help because nothing has really changed.
<P>
	Can government members, who like to travel with Team Canada 
to promote economic ties, remain insensitive to this very disturbing 
humanitarian case? Will they promise today to intercede with the 
Egyptian government to make sure Karim returns to Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no sensitivity in terms of 
dealing with this case. We are very sensitive to the situation that 
exists. The Minister of Foreign Affairs has met with the mother and 
we continue to make representations to the Egyptian government.
<P>
	We will be sending an official of our department to Cairo within 
the next week to continue that dialogue to try to bring a successful 
resolution to the matter.
<P>
	I also understand the matter is due to be coming before the 
Egyptian courts later this year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, ever since 
1993, every time the government has been asked about this 
question, the answer has always been the same. They promise an 
agreement will be reached, they promise something will be done, 
but although the government seems to get moving every time a 
kidnapping causes a media storm, there are never any concrete 
results.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>

will return to Canada?

recently confirmed that Madam Tremblay's son is in Egypt.

question is for the minister of defence.
<P>
	This morning Major Vince Buonamici, who is testifying in the 
dying days of the Somalia inquiry, accused the government of 
covering up what was ``at least a manslaughter and at worst a 
culpable murder''. He said that there was a ``high level 
conspiracy'' to stonewall the investigation into the shooting. This 
stonewalling almost certainly led directly to the death of Shidane 
Arone.
<P>
	If the minister is intent on shutting down the Somalia inquiry, 
how will he get to the bottom of these incredible allegations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member is well aware that since the inquiry began, and particularly 
since I have been the Minister of National Defence, I have not 
commented on the testimony of witnesses before the inquiry 
because it is the job of the commissioners to prepare their 
recommendations.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member is as anxious as I am to see those 
recommendations. As a result of the government having given the 
commission of inquiry a third extension but asking it to report by 
the end of June, no doubt it will be an area the commission will 
address when it makes its report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
us be perfectly clear what the government is doing.
<P>
	A Somali was shot in the back. There was a cover-up. There was 
a high level conspiracy to delay the investigation. This delay 
resulted in the torture death of Shidane Arone. Military officials 
then destroyed, shredded and altered documents to keep it a secret. 
Now the defence minister is ensuring that the cover-up will 
continue and Canadians and Somalis will never learn the truth.
<P>
	Why is the minister so determined to hide the truth about the 
high level cover-up at National Defence headquarters?

gentleman has referred to began on March 15, 1995. The 
commissioners have had nearly two  years to call a roster of 
witnesses and to make sure they determined who they wanted to 
hear from.
<P>
	The testimony to which the hon. member refers was heard, as he 
indicated himself, this week. There was nothing that precluded that 
evidence being heard a year and a half ago. The commissioners 
knew exactly what had taken place with respect to the people who 
were looking into the incidents.

	As you know, Mr. Speaker, the very nature of work is changing 
these days. It is more and more difficult to adapt to its needs. This 
is something that we try very hard to do as a government.

working very well at the employment centres and that we have a

programs to help Canadians find jobs.
<P>
	The new electronic labour exchange which matches employers

brought up this morning. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Yes, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	This morning the member for Hamilton-Wentworth raised a 
question of privilege concerning the operation of the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. His allegation is that the 
committee has misinterpreted Standing Order 108(2) and in so 
doing has violated his rights as a member of Parliament.
<P>
	By a motion on report of the subcommittee on procedures, our 
steering committee, the committee on justice and legal affairs 
which I chair agreed unanimously to embark on a study of the 
subject matter of what has now become Bill C-46 which is 
presently before the House at second reading. It is an act to amend 
the Criminal Code with respect to the production of records in 
sexual offence proceedings.
<P>
	The member objects and claims his privileges have been 
breached. I did not have notice of his objection this morning but I 
do have the blues now. From the blues, as near as I can tell his 
allegations rest on the following: first, he has expressed grave 
reservations about the subject matter of the bill and second, he 
wants to stay in the House during the debate and at the same time 
wants to put questions during committee hearings. He says that he 
cannot ask those questions until after he has heard the debate.
<P>
	In support of his position he argues that nothing in Standing 
Order 108(2) gives us the authority to discuss, deliberate or 
consider the subject matter of a bill before the House. He also 
argues what I would suggest is a tautology, that the bill is the 
subject matter and the subject matter is the bill, et cetera, forever in 
a circle.
<P>
	In response I would argue that in June 1985 the McGrath report 
was published. It suggested that committees of the House of 
Commons should have more power. As a result Standing Order 
108(2) was enacted. It is a successful attempt to give committees 
more power by allowing them to very much control the process as 
well as the subject matter that is studied. In addition to studying 
matters referred to them by the House, committees on their own 
initiative can undertake other endeavours which are thought 
important.
<P>
	In this case, the agenda is very full. The justice committee has 
probably the busiest agenda of any committee in the House. We 
wanted to take a look at policy initiatives which are now embodied 
in Bill C-46 and are the subject matter which we resolved to study 
as a priority. Because the committee is busy its work had to be 
prioritized. One priority was Bill C-55 dealing with dangerous 
offenders. It was reported last week. The committee then wanted to 
study Bill C-46 which it suspected was coming or knew was 
coming.
<P>
	A great deal of attention has been paid to the subject matter of 
Bill C-46 in terms of letters and public response. As a committee, 
all parties, including the one  that is heckling me right now, 
unanimously agreed that the subject matter of this bill would be a 
high priority.
<P>
	Section 108(1)(a) gives us the authority to sit while the House 
sits. I want to point that out because that is one of the objections 
that the member raises.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	Section 108(2) empowers committees to study and report on all 
matters relating to the mandate-and I am paraphrasing-of the 
departments of government which are assigned to it and that 
includes the Department of Justice which is the primary source of 
the legislative agenda at this time.
<P>
	In the commentaries in the Annotated Standing Orders at page 
324 the author states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Standing committees are now empowered by the House to inquire into and report 
on all aspects of the departments assigned to them-the Standing Order includes a 
blanket reference permitting the standing committee to examine any matter relating 
to the department as it deems necessary and worthwhile.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are doing exactly that.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With the end of term approaching and knowing that the agenda would be very 
full, members of the committee really cannot afford any down time and that is why 
we prioritize our work.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The policy initiatives in Bill C-46 are a subject matter that we resolved 
unanimously to study as a priority. There are precedents for this. The finance 
committee was the first committee to do this during the last Parliament and our 
committee has done this with Bills C-45 and C-110. As well, I understand the 
transport committee has studied some subject matter in the same way.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The hon. member's specific argument that he wants to hear the debate and then go 
to committee and question people can be responded to this way. First, the blues are 
available to him almost immediately. I had the blues of his motion by noon today. 
<I>Hansard</I> is available to him. The committee briefs are public and are available to 
him. Witness lists are public and are available to him. Department officials and 
briefings are available as they have been to all members who require them. All of 
these could help him prepare for committee work.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would suggest that section 108(2) gives committee members the power to do 
what we are doing. Really, all we are doing is controlling our own destiny and 
determining what work we will do at what priority.</BLOCKQUOTE>

interpreted the new powers of the committees. I think there is a rule 
providing that, following second reading, the committee receives 
the bill, hears witnesses and so on.
<P>
	There are two questions I would like you to answer The first is 
this: What rule prevails under the Standing Orders? The second 
question I would like you to answer to help the committees 
eventually is: If the members of a committee, in this case the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, unanimously 
agree to proceed other than in the way the rules provide, is it legal 
for them to do so?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
without prejudice to whether this may be a point of privilege, I 
thought that since the hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair 
mentioned the McGrath reforms, I might intervene very briefly as 
the last surviving member of the McGrath committee.
<P>
	It was certainly not the spirit of the McGrath reforms to have 
things happen simultaneously. In fact, the intention of the entire 
reform with respect to reorganizing the hours of the House and of 
committees, et cetera, was to make sure that a situation would not 
occur in which things were being considered both in the House and 
in committee at the same time.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Committees are still masters of their own destiny or at least 
should be if we were able to change the political culture such that 
parties still did not run the committees.
<P>
	Technically speaking, the member is right. I just want to indicate 
that the spirit of the McGrath reform was that things would not be 
happening simultaneously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
be brief and say thanks to the member for Hamilton-Wentworth 
for raising this question of privilege.
<P>
	When you consider your decision on this matter, I urge you to 
consider that this really does affect every member of this House 
even though it was raised by just the one member, the member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member spoke this morning. It was his 
question of privilege. Does he have anything new to add to what he 
said this morning?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I think I am getting the gist of what has gone on. 
Of course, you will permit me to take the time to review everything 
that was said, including the information presented by the member 
for Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
	I will have a look at everything that was said today. I will have a 
look at the precedents and I will try to ascertain what has occurred, 
what was intended in the McGrath report and, if necessary, I will 
address myself to the two questions that were brought up by the 
member for Berthier-Montcalm.
<P>
	In that way, hopefully we will all be able to better understand 
what has transpired and possibly have some direction as to which 
way we should be going in the future.
<P>
	I will get back to the House after I have made a review of the 
facts put before me and through my own research.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADALABOURCODE">CANADA LABOUR CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-66, 
an act to amend the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the 
Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in speaking 
to Bill C-66, we must be cognizant of what this act attempts to do. 
It is an attempt by the government to change the framework 
somewhat for the collective bargaining process.
<P>
	I want to put on the record that sometimes the Reform Party's 
position with regard to collective bargaining is misunderstood. 
This should be made clear at this point in time.
<P>
	We believe that the collective bargaining process is a fair way in 
which results can be brought about so that there is fair 
remuneration for work performed in industry or in government 
and, on the other side, that management is treated fairly and is able 
to continue its business or the public is able to afford the results of 
the collective bargaining process.
<P>
	We also believe that the collective bargaining process does 
include the right to strike, that it is part of the process that should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8913"> 8913 </A></B>
<P>
be there. In saying that, I also have to say that those are the 
conditions under normal circumstances where there is management 
and there are employees who wish to negotiate. The two are able to  
negotiate and participate actively together and both be represented 
adequately at the bargaining table.
<P>
	My colleagues and I have great concern with this bill that there 
are circumstances that are not normal, that those participants who 
have to pay for the results of the collective bargaining process are 
not at the bargaining table. We believe that something should be 
done to protect their interests and their rights when they are not at 
the table.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	As has been made very clear in the House by the member from 
Kindersley, the member from Alberta, the member for Vegreville 
and the member for Wetaskiwin, the farmers, the producers of 
grain and a variety of farm products, including alfalfa or hay 
products that are shipped into the international market and in high 
demand because they are a quality product, are not being dealt with 
in the collective bargaining process in a fair way. We believe that 
something should be done in terms of protecting their rights.
<P>
	What solution have we arrived at? We should look at final offer 
selection arbitration as an option. We put that before the House. We 
said that it would prevent the opportunity for all those unions, some 
30 of them, between the farm gate and the hold of the boat, from 
striking and causing a circumstance whereby grain cannot reach the 
port on time and be shipped into the international market. We know 
the results of a labour strike because of what happened in January 
and February of 1997 whereby our grain was not able to reach the 
coast and it became a major cost to the farmers.
<P>
	Mr. Hehn of the Canadian Wheat Board has said that the latest 
intervention in our rail traffic to the coast has cost the farmer, in his 
estimation, at least $65 million. However, there most likely are 
many additional indirect and direct costs that are not accounted for 
in that $65 million. It could most likely reach up to $100 million. It 
is a major cost.
<P>
	If we look at the province of Alberta, $100 million would mean 
that every farmer on an acreage basis would receive a cheque for at 
least $14 per acre from that $100 million. I have worked with a 
variety of programs whereby we have delivered cheques to farmers 
in Alberta, and $100 million divided on an acreage basis is about 
that much per acre.
<P>
	If we look at that in terms of the cost of fuel to operate one's 
irrigation equipment, which is around $19 to $20 an acre, $14 is a 
substantial loss to that farmer. If we look at it in terms of fertilizer, 
where fertilizer is anywhere from $30 to $60 per acre or more in 
some cases, such as in specialized crops, that $14 or $15 is a 
substantial loss to the farmer.
<P>
	We could go on down the line in terms of taxes and fuel costs 
which are $10 to $15 an acre in terms of farming an acre of land. 
That money is taken out of the  hands of the farmer, wasted and in 
most cases is paid in demurrage which we all know is about 
$10,000 per boat. In the last couple of weeks there were some 32 
boats circling around the Vancouver harbour and $320,000 per day 
was being given to those boats. Those people take the money into 
their home harbour, which is certainly not Canada, and all of that 
money is lost to the economy of Canada. That is just an 
unacceptable thing to happen in the farm communities.
<P>
	Something has to be done about this. We made the suggestion 
that one of the solutions is final offer selection arbitration.
<P>
	In Bill C-66 there is a reference to farming but, as usual, farming 
is at the bottom of the list. The mention here is with regard to the 
work stoppages and lockouts that could be dealt with in terms of 
the process relative to the grain industry.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	We must be clear about what this does. If the wheat gets to the 
harbour and the strike occurs, that wheat must be put in the hold of 
a boat. But what about all those other unions between the farm and 
the hold of a boat? They can stop the flow of grain into the market 
and, as I said earlier, that would result in a major cost to the 
industry. Something has to be done about it.
<P>
	One of the other things we have suggested in the House is that 
the government should deal with the Canadian Wheat Board. We 
should look at a dual marketing system rather than the single 
marketing desk system we have in Canada today, especially for 
western Canadians. We have this special law called the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act under which we must behave as farmers and 
produce our product while we do not have the right to market it 
without the intervention of the Canadian Wheat Board. That causes 
problems.
<P>
	If we relate that situation to Bill C-66 in terms of marketing of 
our grain, it creates a major problem. We sell our wheat into the 
pools with the Canadian Wheat Board monitoring what goes on. 
The Canadian Wheat Board has a lot to say about what rail traffic is 
available to us, about the cars that are available to us to take our 
grain to the coast so we can put it into the holds of boats and ship it 
to the international market. There is an intervention there that does 
not let the free market system work. It is not possible for farmers to 
use that kind of system without the intervention of government.
<P>
	There is this secondary intervention, although in a sense it is 
primary. Because of the way it is, if there is an intervention via a 
strike by any one of those unions, farmers are affected because that 
is the route by which our grain is shipped between the farm and the 
boat. The alternate routes down into the United States by truck or 
by a variety of other routes are restricted because of the 
intervention of the Canadian Wheat Board. That is actually an 
unfair 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8914"> 8914 </A></B>
<P>
intervention that we do not need. It is  just another good argument 
for a dual marketing system for grain in western Canada.
<P>
	As an independent farmer, if I wish to move my grain around the 
west coast shipping facilities, through Montana to Washington 
where I can ship it through an American shipping facility, I could 
do so. But today I cannot do that kind of thing. Immediately when I 
start to do that I have an intervention by the Canadian Wheat 
Board. There is this intervention in the free market system.
<P>
	Some people say that all farmers would not have access to that 
kind of facility. They can group together as a co-operative group if 
they want if they believe in that kind of format or legislative 
framework under which they can work. They can legally set 
themselves up as an entity if they wish. They can work through the 
Alberta Wheat Pool, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool or any other 
united grain growers or any other type of grain marketing agency to 
market their grain. They can contract with other private grain 
marketers in the field and they would have options and alternatives 
to what is there.
<P>
	Has this government really done anything? Has it looked at 
anything new? No, it has not. It has protected the historic system. It 
says ``we'll nudge the collective bargaining process a bit, we'll do 
a little intervention at the ports, we'll do a little intervention in 
terms of one labour group, in terms of the longshoremen''. But that 
does not resolve the problem. The labour act is only paying lip 
service to the major problem we have here in Canada. The 
government is not dealing with it, not at all.
<P>
	Why does the government not look at alternatives? Who could 
expect a Liberal government to ever look at alternatives? The 
Liberals want to preserve the status quo. They want to keep things 
the way they are. They want to keep their heads down and the only 
ambition they have in life is to have political power where they 
have position and authority, supposedly to run this country, but that 
is where it ends in terms of new ideas, options and alternatives and 
trying to look at doing things in a more progressive and positive 
way.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	The minister of agriculture tried to resolve the latest intervention 
in terms of moving grain from farms in Alberta Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba to British Columbia and off to the ports.
<P>
	What did he do? There was a last minute knee-jerk reaction to a 
problem. It was a crisis when he finally called a meeting in 
Calgary. He brought in those who were responsible, the grain 
companies, the CPR, the CNR and a variety of shipping agents, to 
sit at a round table. I hope he brought in a few farmers, but I doubt 
it. He brought in government officials and they talked about the 
problem.
<P>
	The only solution they arrived at was that there was a crisis and it 
would be six weeks before the grain was moving again. In the 
interim farmers lost millions of dollars.
<P>
	Why did they not come up with some solutions? Why did the 
minister not come back into the House and say that he would deal 
with the problem and come up with solutions?
<P>
	What are some of the solutions? It is time farmers are not the 
only people who take the knife in the back from the government, 
the unions, management and people responsible for getting their 
product to the coast. It is time somebody else started to pay such as 
grain companies and the management.
<P>
	When there is a slowdown in shipping or when there is a 
stoppage in shipping it is time the grain companies and 
management pay because they are not alert to making it happen. It 
is time the Canadian Wheat Board stood up. It is farmers' money 
again but it is not sharing in the cost the way it should.
<P>
	The Canadian government has a responsibility. As it stands right 
now the only representation farmers have at the bargaining table, 
often in a very informal way, is the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and the Minister of Labour. They should be held 
accountable. If they are acting on behalf of other taxpayers and 
farmers are losing money they had better share in the cost of the 
loss. It is time to bring accountability to a broader group than 
farmers. It is time farmers stopped paying the whole bill.
<P>
	Then there is another big group that walks away scot-free, the 
longshoremen who belong to various labour organizations. They 
strike. Most longshoreman who work on the coast have never been 
on a farm. They do not even understand the problems at the farm. 
We pay their wages but we have nothing to say about their 
remuneration or their actions. When they go on strike they had 
better start paying the farmers' bill. The producers should not 
suffer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Lethbridge certainly has a lot of expertise in the 
farming industry as well as considerable expertise in the legislative 
world.
<P>
	I draw his attention to a comment made by the parliamentary 
secretary on March 3, as recorded in <I>Hansard</I> when he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I will now turn to the grain provision. Grain has been declared for the general 
advantage of Canada. It is a multibillion dollar industry which exports to over 70 
countries worldwide. The livelihood of 130,000 farmers and their families depend-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Certainly I would not want to diminish in any way the 
importance of agriculture to the Canadian economy, but when a 
provision in the labour code bill says that grain arriving at port will 
be loaded we are possibly asking longshoremen to cross picket 
lines set up by other unions to load the grain.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8915"> 8915 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	When we single out grain as being ``declared for the general 
advantage of Canada'', practically every other major export good 
produced in Canada such as potash, petrochemicals and forestry 
products could be construed as being for the good of Canada as 
well.
<P>
	Would the member for Lethbridge give us his thoughts on those 
items?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, we should adhere to 
the basic principle that all parties affected by the collective 
bargaining process in any way should have the right to be at the 
table. That should be a basic principle in the agriculture industry, 
the potash industry or the other industries the hon. member noted. 
They should have some right to representation at the table.
<P>
	In my earlier remarks I indicated that this was not the way it 
happened at the present time. That has been a major deficiency in 
the Canada Labour Code as long as I have been in politics. It is a 
matter I have made representation on in the Alberta legislature and 
to previous federal ministers of agriculture. I told them they must 
deal with it.
<P>
	In coming to Ottawa I had aspirations that the new Minister of 
Labour, appointed prior to the 1994 work stoppage, would try to 
resolve the matter. The ministry changed hands and we have a 
subsequent Minister of Labour who looks at the matter in a 
different way. That was unfortunate and now the problem 
continues.
<P>
	Shortly we will be going into the next federal election and most 
likely we will not have the matter dealt with and will have to come 
back to it in the next Parliament.
<P>
	The issue is not finished. We still must deal with the matter in 
some way. I can only hope in my final days in the House that 
somebody here is listening who will pick up the cudgel and deal 
with the matter. It should be the best effort for the people not 
represented today such farmers, producers of a variety of products 
or industries transforming raw materials into other marketable 
products in the world. It is a necessity that they be given an 
advantage and a sense of safety in the collective bargaining 
process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not often I get to question 
someone with so much legislative experience. It may be my last 
crack at him.
<P>
	My colleague is a great supporter of final offer selection 
arbitration. Does he think that final offer selection is a detriment in 
any way to the collective agreement process? Or, does he think that 
back to work legislation is more an erosion of the collective 
bargaining process? Maybe we could have some of his thoughts on 
those two items by comparing one to the other.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I addressed the 
question of final offer selection arbitration in a similar way to the 
hon. member for Mercier earlier in the debate.
<P>
	The first part of collective bargaining is a matter where 
management and labour sit down at the table and through best 
efforts attempt to reach a satisfactory conclusion to both parties. 
That should happen. They should move through the process and 
take whatever time it takes to bargain in good faith and attempt to 
reach favourable conclusions. That is not affected by final offer 
selection arbitration.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Then we go into mediation. Mediation is the intervention of a 
third party that informally and without authority tried to bring the 
two parties together to discuss the issue. The mediator does not 
have the authority to say do this do that. However it is part of the 
collective bargaining process. That is good.
<P>
	Then we get to the point where we could move to arbitration or 
there could be a vote to strike or a lockout. At that point the third 
parties, the farmers, the producers of potash or those who wish to 
ship on the rails, must get their product to market to the 
commitments in the international market, to keep good faith and to 
keep a good name by marketing appropriately. When the rail line 
stops because of a strike or a lockout somebody is affected who is 
not at the bargaining table so there must be a quick resolution to the 
problem.
<P>
	All the labour unions between the farmgate or the potash plant 
and the coast must understand that at that point in time they are in a 
special circumstance. That is why we recommend final offer 
selection arbitration so that an arbitrator can quickly be put in 
place. The two parties, because they have worked at trying to bring 
themselves to a final position, will most likely be fairly close. They 
will be asked to give their final position and the arbitrator will 
choose <I>a</I> or <I>b</I>. Then there is no strike. The workers and 
management must accept the arbitrator's decision and the main 
producer, the farmer who is an innocent third party, is not affected 
in an adverse manner.
<P>
	That is the logical way to go.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-66.
<P>
	There has been a fair bit of discussion today about grain farmers 
and the problems they face as a result of transportation to the coast 
and getting their grain loaded on to ships. I thought I would 
introduce a slightly different perspective to the bill by dealing with 
a letter I received yesterday from a man in my riding whose name 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8916"> 8916 </A></B>
<P>
is Brian Coles. He has been a longshoreman for 32 years.  He has a 
fair amount of experience on the waterfront in Vancouver.
<P>
	My riding of North Vancouver is on the harbour. There is a major 
grain terminal in the riding so any stoppages that occur affect the 
people who live and work in my riding.
<P>
	Mr. Coles has been a resident of North Vancouver for 21 years. 
He wrote to me expressing some of his concerns from the union 
perspective. I thought it only fair that I read his concerns into the 
record.
<P>
	In his letter he stated that since the sixties there has not been an 
opportunity to negotiate in good faith with the BCMEA and that 
locking out and refusing to let them work the grain has always been 
the problem even though they have been willing to work the grain. 
He said they had even sent officials to Parliament at various times 
to guarantee the grain would be worked and there would be no need 
to bring in repressive legislation. However he feels it has always 
been in vain and has always gone the company's way, thereby 
forcing the government to force them back to work. That has 
concerned him.
<P>
	Keeping in mind that this is the union perspective, he feels that 
the BCMEA has the best of everything. It is the most productive 
workforce in Canada. It can pick up the telephone 24 hours a day 
and get any type of tradesman, driver, switchman, machine drivers, 
labourers, carpenters, anything it wants and also has government as 
its ally.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	He also feels that his counterparts in Montreal, the 
longshoremen who went on strike for three weeks, have ended up 
away ahead of them in manning, wages and benefits. He feels he 
lives in a free and democratic country but it is being run by big 
business and a Liberal dictatorship. He finished his letter by asking 
me to clarify my position on the subject and Reform's approach to 
the whole thing.
<P>
	It is important to note from this that sometimes a fair amount of 
tension builds between companies and unions, each believing it is 
being unfairly treated by the government of the day. That was one 
of the reasons why the member for Wetaskiwin proposed 16 
amendments to the bill. It was felt they would clarify and improve 
the legislation, not just for the companies and unions but for a lot of 
the other people who are affected by the bill.
<P>
	A key factor was giving labour and management the mechanisms 
to solve their differences. It appears that the government is more 
interested in courting the favour of the Bloc Quebecois than 
bringing in balanced labour laws.
<P>
	We probably all agree that there is a unique nature within the 
federal system of labour controls because there are not usually 
alternative sources available for transportation, for example, of 
grain to the coast or  longshoremen to load the ships. If the 
situation is unique then unique solutions must be found to any 
problems that develop.
<P>
	As the member for Wetaskiwin said earlier, Canada has a world 
class transportation system and a communications infrastructure 
that can handle the materials when it is working properly. But if 
trouble develops, then right away major problems appear, whether 
it is moving materials for General Motors or grain to the coast. It 
has a dramatic impact on workers right across the country. It does 
not take long until people are laid off, for businesses to be 
catastrophically affected. The impact is felt by the entire economy, 
including the tax and spend government side of the House which 
loses some income as a result and has to borrow more on the backs 
of our children and grandchildren.
<P>
	I read out the letter from Mr. Coles earlier. I mentioned that it 
was from a union perspective. The companies clearly have their 
perspective on this as well. It creates a unique problem when 
tensions build between the company and the union and they cannot 
solve their problems. They are heading for a strike and the entire 
country will be affected.
<P>
	Frankly, legislation that attempts to force solutions really is not 
satisfactory. If a solution is imposed on one side or the other, all we 
end up with is a level of dissatisfaction on one side or the other. 
Good labour relations cannot be legislated. However, government 
can provide an environment which encourages settlement. It gives 
a strong incentive to actually go ahead and settle. That was the 
basis for Reform's proposal that we should have final offer 
selection arbitration in these cases.
<P>
	The aim is not to tie the hands of labour or management, but to 
give them a major incentive to talk together to reach a solution, 
without this terrible thing hanging over their heads that some 
mediator is going to come in and do things that are really not for 
the good of either side.
<P>
	By giving them the tools to resolve their differences and saying: 
``Listen, you have the opportunity to sit down and negotiate. You 
had better come up with your best offer, because if we are going to 
put you to the final offer arbitration, one side or the other is going 
to be chosen''.
<P>
	It is in the interests of labour, management, producers and 
processors that these disputes be resolved without parliamentary 
intervention if possible. It has to reach crisis proportions for that to 
happen. It happened in 1994 when the House ended up sitting on a 
Saturday and Sunday in order to put through the legislation because 
it was so important to the business of the country.
<P>
	It is in the interests of all Canadians to have reliable access to 
essential services. We want to keep employment within our borders 
and not lose it to the United States.  The port of Seattle is very close 
to us in Vancouver. Every time there is a problem at the Vancouver 
dockside, and it really does not matter who causes the problem, if 
the port is shut down Seattle is there trying to get the business. The 
salesmen are very aggressive at taking business away from us. It is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8917"> 8917 </A></B>
<P>
essential that we keep these jobs in Canada. Everyone agrees on 
that. That is why it is important that the government provides 
incentives rather than big sticks to get these situations resolved. As 
I keep mentioning, the incentive should be there and not a big stick. 
Final arbitration does not favour one side or the other. It provides 
the tools needed to come to a very close position, close enough that 
probably either side could live with the decision in the final offer 
arbitration.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	If and only if the union and the employer cannot come to an 
agreement by the conclusion of the contract, the union and the 
employer would provide the minister with the name of the person 
they jointly recommend as an arbitrator. Then the union and the 
employer would be required to submit to the arbitrator a list of 
matters that were agreed on, all the stuff that is finalized. They 
would have no problems.
<P>
	Then they would submit a list of the matters that are still under 
dispute. For the disputed issues, each party would be required to 
submit a final offer for settlement.
<P>
	Under most labour negotiations that occur in the private sector 
outside of federal control, there will be employers or unions who 
will say that it has made its final offer. We all know that these are 
often posturing positions, that it is not a final offer. It is sort of a 
threat. When a strike vote is taken, or a lockout vote is taken, then 
an endorsement by the employment association or by the union is 
asked for to have a strike. It helps build the pressure on the other 
side.
<P>
	Because this is final offer arbitration, this had better be a final 
offer. It brings it home to each side that they have to get really 
focused on what they want to come out of this negotiation.
<P>
	The arbitrator, of course, would then select either the final offer 
submitted by the trade union or the final offer submitted by the 
employer. It is all of one position or all of the other. The arbitrator's 
decision is binding on both parties.
<P>
	The point that I made earlier was that because of this, it is a 
strong incentive to get close together. Probably both parties would 
make sure that they were giving as much as they could and that 
they were trying to retain as much as they could, knowing they had 
to get pretty close together before they submit matters to the 
arbitrator.
<P>
	From Reform's perspective, we believe that a permanent and fair 
resolution process has to be put in place like this to take it away 
from control by the government. The two parties in this dispute 
would be selecting their own arbitrator. Then they have complete  
control of the final position they give to the arbitrator that they 
have selected. There is no government with a big stick to force one 
side or the other to take some sort of unpredictable settlement.
<P>
	The risk to Canadians' jobs would be minimized. The risk of loss 
of business across the border to Seattle or to some other port in 
other parts of the United States would be minimized.
<P>
	We cannot allow the situation to deteriorate as it has in the past. 
Business does move to the U.S. ports it sees as more reliable and 
we lose the cargo and jobs in the British Columbia ports.
<P>
	This government and the one before it have shown that they are 
in the habit of reacting to emergencies rather than putting in place a 
workable process that can be used whenever we run up close to an 
emergency situation. They tend to wait until the crisis is there 
before they act.
<P>
	One major advantage of final offer arbitration is that it is already 
there. It is already in place. It is a known end to the process. It does 
not require Parliament to be called on an emergency basis when 
everything is in crisis to pass things in the middle of the night or on 
a weekend. It certainly does not interrupt the business of the House 
for other matters and keeps the level of upset in the business 
community to a minimum.
<P>
	It is important to stress that we are not talking about ending the 
collective bargaining process. We are talking about making it work 
better so that the incentive is there to come close together before 
both sides get to an arbitration point.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	Now the minister unfortunately says that he does not support the 
final offer arbitration situation. I guess that is par for the course. 
Maybe he is just opposing it because the idea came from the 
Reform.
<P>
	It is quite amazing how often good ideas are promoted by people 
in the business sector or by the average Canadian. We bring the 
issues to the House only to find that they are opposed by ministers 
even though many members on the government side support the 
positions that we take. It raises the question of how democratic this 
place is when those sorts of good ideas can be suppressed by one or 
two people running the whole show.
<P>
	My riding has some major grain elevators, and a lot of pigeons as 
a result. Maybe Census Canada, instead of wandering around trying 
to fine people for not filling out their census forms, should take a 
count of the pigeons in my riding. I think they would get a surprise. 
I guess one benefit of a strike is that the number of pigeons 
decrease because they run out of food for a little while.
<P>
	Grain shipments are very important to my riding but other 
shipments go through the port as well. Potash, sulphur and wood 
chips are major shipments that occur  in the area. There is a large 
sulphur depot on the north shore and in Port Moody from where I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8918"> 8918 </A></B>
<P>
believe potash goes as well. Therefore, disruptions in the 
transportation system do affect other sectors.
<P>
	I am aware that many of the members on the Reform side of the 
House are from rural areas where they are involved with farming 
interests so there has been quite a lot of talk about those farming 
interests in the discussion on the bill. However, it affects many 
other industries when the port is locked up for some reason.
<P>
	Clause 87.7 of the bill ensures that grain, once it reaches the 
port, will be shipped out. However there is no provision to ensure 
that the grain gets to the port. What is the point of having a 
provision in the bill which states that the grain will be shipped out 
once it gets there when there is no provision for it to actually get 
there in the first place? That is a major flaw in bill and makes one 
wonder how such a half measure could get in there. Maybe 
someone was not thinking straight when the legislation was drawn 
up.
<P>
	As part of the national interest, perhaps final offer arbitration 
would have been a more effective tool to ensure the movement of 
grain to the markets and to ensure the movement of other 
commodities as well.
<P>
	We know that technology is advancing all the time. There is 
going to be a new generation of container vessels soon surfacing at 
Vancouver's new terminal. It will require 15 double stacked trains 
for complete discharge or loading. These are huge volumes of rail 
cars and huge volumes of products that have to be moving to 
service these ships. With the improved technology, the grain can be 
loaded quickly and the port will be empty and idle before a 72-hour 
strike-lockout notice would appear if we were to remain under the 
old situation.
<P>
	Grain represents about 30 per cent of the port of Vancouver's 
business so it is very important that we consider grain along with 
the other commodities.
<P>
	Groups such as the BCMEA-I guess I should really expand that 
out so that people know the meaning of the acronym-the British 
Columbia Maritime Employer's Association represents about 77 
wharf and terminal operators and stevedoring firms at Vancouver 
and Prince Rupert. They fear that the grain provision would worsen 
an already rocky history of labour disputes at the port and this bill 
has not addressed the problems. They feel that if some 
longshoremen can keep earning wages for loading grain they might 
have less incentive to end a strike quickly.
<P>
	Grain customers are using United States ports like Seattle where 
they know that the commodity will be delivered as promised. We 
cannot ignore the threats from ports that are so close to Vancouver. 
With Vancouver now being the largest port in terms of volume for 
Canada, we really have to make sure we have stability and can 
deliver on our promises. Therefore, as we  gradually eliminate 
government subsidies, farmers are not really captive to Canadian 
ports and transportation systems any more. All parties to this, the 
port employers and the unions, have to recognize the fact that there 
is decreasing incentive for farmers to keep using these routes if 
they are unreliable. We have to make sure that we put in place 
something reliable. Final offer arbitration would be one of those 
things.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I could move on to other topics in more detail, but at this point I 
should wind up and give members a bit of an opportunity to 
question me on some of the provisions in the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to comment briefly on my 
colleague's speech regarding the man who wrote him a letter 
dealing with the longshoring industry. He can assure the gentleman 
that the bill resolves the question he was asking.
<P>
	For years longshoremen said they would look after longshoring 
activities while the grain handlers loaded the vessels and BCMEA 
or whatever the company was would not allow them to do it. That 
now is part of the process of the bill. The bill allows that to happen. 
They have to look after the grain vessels.
<P>
	I have heard a lot of talk today from my colleague from 
Wetaskiwin and others on the final offer selection. People in labour 
and management call this the one armed bandit of 
labour-management relations. However the bill does not impose 
conventional or final offer selection. It expressly recognize the 
right of the parties to agree if they want to. If they want to agree to 
it, it is there for them. If it is as good a way of resolving the 
situation as I hear expressed across the way, certainly they can 
agree to do it.
<P>
	This resolves the question of the man who wrote the letter as far 
as longshoremen doing the work. Now they will be able to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know 
whether or not to thank the member for the intervention but I can 
certainly answer the questions.
<P>
	He said that the bill resolves the question that was in the mind of 
my constituent who wrote the letter. That must be a Liberal view of 
the bill. I will quote again from the letter that says quite clearly:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I thought I lived in a free and democratic country. However I believe it is run by 
big business and a Liberal dictatorship.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I do not think that my constituent is convinced that the Liberals 
have acted in his best interest in this bill. It is certainly not the way 
he sees it.
<P>
	The member also mentions that the bill recognizes the ability of 
the parties to agree to final offer arbitration if they want to. There is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8919"> 8919 </A></B>
<P>
ample evidence that when there is a bit of friction between a 
company and its union as  bargaining time approaches for a 
contract it is not easy for them to agree on anything. If in the 
traditional way their ``final offer'' is not a final offer but is part of 
the posturing that goes on as they come to a final offer, we could 
hardly expect them to agree to final offer arbitration.
<P>
	If the government had put that in the bill and they knew they had 
final offer arbitration at the end of the process, their final offer will 
truly be a final offer. It really is the incentive to make it the final 
offer.
<P>
	By just saying to them that they can agree to final offer 
arbitration if they want to, we can see what would happen. Let us 
say the union side truly comes up with its final offer. It knows it 
cannot budge. It says to the employer that it would like to go for 
final offer arbitration. In the meantime the employer has done the 
posturing thing and has put forward a final offer that is not really 
the final offer. Of course they do not want to agree to final offer 
arbitration. We see the conundrum that results immediately.
<P>
	Including that provision is a non-issue. It must actually be in the 
bill that the process ends with final offer arbitration so that we get 
to final offers. I think that answers the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly 
my colleague is very familiar with the port of Vancouver and the 
immense amount of goods shipped through there to various places 
all over the world. Therefore, how does he view the special status 
afforded to grain that the bill allows for? How does he see it 
affecting other products that are certainly important to B.C. and the 
Canadian economy as a whole?
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Both forest products and the petrochemical industry are similar 
to grain as far as their impact on the Canadian economy and on the 
value added industries they spawn is concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for raising this point. Earlier in my speech I mentioned 
the special status of grain. It is true that many other commodities 
are moved through my riding and loaded at the port. He mentioned 
some, but the ones I can think of are coal, sulphur, wood, lumber 
products, potash, petrochemicals and grain.
<P>
	Many constituents have asked me what is going on and why the 
bill gives special provision to one commodity while the rest are 
being ignored for some reason. I cannot suppose for the 
government side why it made this decision, but there is always a 
feeling that because many of these other products are B.C. based 
maybe the west is being picked on again. I should not say that. I am 
sure it was just an accident that those things were left out of the 
bill. The government simply has no idea what happens at a port. It 
never realized that coal, sulphur, wood, potash,  petrochemicals 
and a lot of other things went out of that port along with grain.
<P>
	That is clearly an area that needs to be addressed. It is very 
distressing the government has not dealt with it. A sense of 
frustration is felt not only by me but by my constituents and 
certainly the companies and workers in my riding.
<P>
	I thank the member bringing that matter to the attention of the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to speak to the changes to the labour code 
proposed by the government under Bill C-66 which will affect 
about 700,000 workers in federally regulated industries.
<P>
	I oppose the legislation because it attacks the wrong problem. 
The problem as government members see it is labour disputes that 
must be dealt with in a specific way. It will be much better in the 
long run to deal with the real problem, the existence of federally 
regulated industries.
<P>
	Let me summarize my argument. Unions exist to get higher 
wages for their members. They might often say they just want job 
security and all kinds of other goodies like work regulation and 
safety. All that can be translated into higher income. Basically 
unions exist to benefit workers.
<P>
	It is true by definition that if enterprises are suddenly required as 
a result of unionization to pay higher wages to their workers the 
extra money must come from somewhere. There are only four 
logical possibilities.
<P>
	First, the money that has to be paid to workers could come from 
the profits. An old ideological position is that it is a struggle 
between capitalists and the working class. Many people will know 
this position will not likely have a very strong effect. If the profits 
of companies are squeezed too much it may seem as if they are 
stuck where they are at the moment, but the fact is that they can 
always leave. More important, in a region in which unions are very 
strong factories simply will not be established. There will be no 
investment. The extent to which higher wages going to the worker 
come from profits is extremely limited. In some types of industries 
it is more possible than others. I will explain that in a moment.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The second possibility is that the employer simply raises the 
prices of the product and services produced by the unionized firm 
that suddenly faces higher labour wages. Under those 
circumstances the benefits to workers come directly from the 
consumer. It would tend to be consumers of only a very small 
proportion of the product. Therefore it does not totally come out of 
their pockets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8920"> 8920 </A></B>
<P>
	If everyone in society were unionized and insisted on higher 
wages it is quite clear there would be higher prices and the gains 
made by workers with the higher nominal wages would be wiped 
out by what they had to buy. This kind of situation existed in 
countries like Sweden where unionization was almost universal, 
at which point there had to be tripartite agreements between 
government, industries and workers to ask how they could prevent 
this cycle of inflation from taking place.
<P>
	The third way in which workers can be compensated when they 
insist on higher wages is at the expense of other workers. In a sense 
the higher costs of production due to the higher unionized wages 
are passed on in higher prices. It is the consumers who pay in the 
end for the workers whose union action brought higher wages.
<P>
	The other possibility is that workers induce a substitution of 
capital for labour so that the company will make the same profits 
and will not have to pass on higher costs through higher prices for 
their output. They would save labour. As a result the workers in the 
industry before the wages were raised are now thrown into the 
non-unionized sector where, if they are to be absorbed, they get 
lower wages. This is what economists have found. Everything else 
remains the same between industries. The workers who are 
unionized have 10 per cent to 15 per cent higher wage rates than 
those who are not unionized.
<P>
	When a union is squeezing a higher wage out of an employer 
through unionized action, where does the money come from? It 
comes in some industries from government.
<P>
	There is no sense for any reasonable government in the industrial 
world to attack the activities of unions, as self-serving as they are. 
The right to organize and the right to try to get more money for 
their members are such ideological issues that any government 
which tried to confront the ability of unions to do so directly would 
suffer greatly. It is a cause that makes workers go to the barricades. 
People have been prepared to die for the cause. It is not worth any 
government taking on the unions directly, but society has an option 
to strictly limit the power of the unions by certain policies. The 
policy which I would recommend is to remove situations where 
there is an unlimited pot of money or a very large pot of money. 
That large pot of money has been created by government policy 
itself.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	I would like to elaborate on that basic idea by considering that 
unionization can take place in four analytical classes of industries.
<P>
	The first business that I would like to discuss involves small 
privately owned firms, where entry is easy. A lot of capital is not 
required. They typically have no more than ten employees. It is a 
mom and pop shop, a tailor or even  a small manufacturer of drapes 
or whatever is locally produced.
<P>
	In that kind of business everyone is just scraping by. Often the 
employers are just making enough money to stay in business. They 
do it because they feel that someday they might hit it big or they 
like to have their freedom. They are their own bosses. If these 
people rationally calculated how many hours they work and what 
their income is, they would realize that they work for very little 
money. They could probably earn more on the outside.
<P>
	When I return to the university and to the Fraser Institute after 
the next election, a study of small business will be one of the 
projects which I hope to undertake. I want to know what makes 
them such good employers and what they give to society.
<P>
	Unions in the small business sector are non-existent. Why? 
Everyone knows that if they unionize those small shops to get a 
higher wage the employer might just throw in the towel and leave. 
He is not making enough anyway. Alternatively, the company 
could be driven out of business because it cannot pass on higher 
wages through higher prices. Try to sell ice-cream, shoes or drapes 
at a higher price than the neighbour charges. They would be driven 
out of business.
<P>
	The second category of business that I would like to discuss is 
where they have a small element of monopoly power. For example, 
the steel industry used to have a certain amount of monopoly 
power. I say used to have. So did the automobile industry. That was 
before transportation costs fell dramatically and before technology 
spread throughout the world at the push of a button.
<P>
	In the past those kinds of industries had what we call an 
oligopoly position. They were protected by natural processes in the 
economy. The cost of transportation was high. There was limited 
entry because of the scale that was required to build an automobile 
factory or a steel factory. Under those circumstances workers were 
somewhat successful in organizing because they were able to drive 
up the price and the price could be passed on. The price of steel in 
an automobile is still relatively low and automobile prices are not 
affected if unions in the steel industry raise the price a bit.
<P>
	In the sixties, seventies and into the eighties we had huge, very 
disturbing strikes in the steel and automobile industries. They are 
gone. The reason is there are no oligopoly profits and there are no 
opportunities to pass on increases in the cost of production through 
higher product prices. That is because of free trade. It is because of 
the low cost of transportation.
<P>
	We have now a very strict limit on the power of unions. Even 
international unionization has been shrinking where it was once 
almost universal. Even in Canadian industries where this is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8921"> 8921 </A></B>
<P>
case, they have  strong limits on their ability to push through the 
benefits that they think their union members deserve.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The third category in which unions have been very powerful in 
the past were industries in which there exists what we call 
economic rent. Economic rent is a surplus in the value of a product 
above the cost of production. This typically is found in natural 
resource industries.
<P>
	Let us take gold. A gold mine may have a cost of production of 
$100 an ounce but the price that the gold fetches is $450. The 
question is what to do with the $350. It is in industries like these 
that unions were strong because they wanted a bigger share. It can 
be applied to copper, to tin, to whatever can be mined.
<P>
	It was also true in the B.C. forest industry. We inherited from 
nature, undisturbed for millennia, for hundreds of thousands of 
years, mature forests where it might cost $3,000 to cut down a tree 
but the price would be $10,000. The government did not at that 
point try to get that $7,000 but took only the residual of whatever 
the cost of production was.
<P>
	It can be imagined that under those circumstances, unions were 
happy to go on strike and the employers were happy to give in to 
get a bigger share of that $7,000 difference between what it costs to 
cut down the tree and get it to market and the $10,000 it sold for. 
That is how British Columbia in the post war years got itself the 
highest wages in the forestry industry anywhere in the world.
<P>
	The honeymoon of natural resource industries has ended. There 
are very few resources left right now where it is possible for unions 
to tap into this economic rent. The power of unions in British 
Columbia has decreased and is decreasing continuously with the 
disappearance of this economic rent.
<P>
	I now would like to turn, as my time is winding down, to the 
fourth category of industries where unions are powerful. The most 
powerful unions are typically found in industries that have a deep 
pocket. Who has the deepest pocket? The government.
<P>
	Therefore government owned industries typically have the 
strongest unions. When they raise the wages of their members, who 
pays for them? Not at the cost of capital. It is sometimes through 
higher prices but it is typically, simply at the cost of subsidies.
<P>
	The world has realized that this is the case and that is why 
everywhere in the industrial world we have privatized those 
industries that previously had been owned and run by government. 
Subsidies have ended but there is a very subtle additional area that 
we are now talking about, industries that are regulated by the state.
<P>
	In Canada we still have 700,000 workers employed in this sector. 
Here the action is subtly different. Regulation means that the firms 
are allowed to operate a monopoly.  They have the protection from 
the state that there will be no competition. For example, the airlines 
used to be that way. Courier services are that way. There are 
700,000 workers still working in this kind of field.
<P>
	We now know from studies that as a result of the monopoly 
guaranteed by the government and the regulation, costs in the 
airline industries around the world rose dramatically.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	I will never forget started it all, the deregulation movement in 
the United States which spread to Canada. There were airlines that 
flew between states and therefore were subject to federal 
communications agency regulations. However, there were some 
that were not regulated because they were intra-state flights.
<P>
	What we had as a result of this was that a flight between Boston 
and Washington D.C. cost exactly twice as much as a flight 
between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The former was regulated 
and the latter was unregulated.
<P>
	How does regulation affect the whole situation? What happens is 
that the pilot unions say: ``My responsibility for flying a 747, 
which costs $100 million, is very large. I am responsible for the 
lives of 500 passengers. I shall not take on this job unless I am paid 
$300,000 a year''. At that point the employer says: ``No, you 
cannot have $300,000, $250,000 is enough. No, you have to take a 
strike''. What did they do? After a song and dance, very 
occasionally taking a strike, the employer said: ``Sorry, here is your 
$300,000''. The civil aviation board now has to raise prices 
because its costs have gone up. That is how we got double the cost 
of tickets in the regulated and non-regulated sector.
<P>
	It is quite clear that what we have in Canada with 700,000 
workers being subject to such regulations is they are facing exactly 
the same incentives as do the regulated airline industries. Imagine 
if the Canadian regulations would allow the diversion of wheat 
board exports to any harbour on the west coast other than 
Vancouver and Prince Rupert. Does anyone think that the unions 
would have as strong a position as they have now? No way. They 
would know, almost like the guys in the small shops, that if he 
strikes his business will go away and there will be fewer jobs in the 
end.
<P>
	My conclusion is that Bill C-66 is attacking a symptom when we 
have a much more serious malady which is regulation and 
government ownership in industries where as a result there is 
practically no competition. Let us restore competition and see what 
happens to the power of unions. That is the way to go.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the Reform Party member for Capilano-Howe Sound. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8922"> 8922 </A></B>
<P>
It is distressing in 1997 to hear  what could, if we were not afraid of 
calling a spade a spade, be described as an anti-union plea.
<P>
	Among other things, the hon. member is critical of unions for 
defending their own interests. If unions do not defend the interests 
of workers, who will? Employers? The government? I do not think 
so. If unions do not have the right to defend workers' interests, 
what then are businesses defending, within their corporations and 
within chambers of commerce?
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Does the member for Capilano-Howe Sound not think that the 
pay of unionized employees has an upward effect on the pay of 
non-unionized employees? I think it does, and I think it absolutely 
essential that it do so.
<P>
	Does he think that by keeping workers at minimum wage, he is 
helping to put money in the pockets of the men and women of this 
country? In the end, if people are not paid fairly for the work they 
do, what must be put in place? A social safety net to help offset the 
poverty created by businesses that do not pay their workers fairly. I 
therefore presume that the member for Capilano-Howe Sound is 
also against the establishment of a minimum wage.
<P>
	I ask him one last question. Do we really need businesses that are 
unable to pay their employees fairly? I say we do not. If businesses 
are unable to pay a fair wage, they have no right to exist, because 
they are generating poverty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. One would expect it from someone representing a union.
<P>
	The question to me is what is fair or give an operational 
definition of fair. I do not know what it is, but I do know that if we 
provide conditions where there are no deep pockets we can let the 
unions fight it out.
<P>
	I am not against unions. I am against, as in the case of the wheat 
transportation agency, a monopoly protection being granted to an 
industry, to a bunch of workers who then take the power given to 
them by the state and exploit others.
<P>
	There is always the belief that wages would not increase if it 
were not for unions. I sat next to a gentleman on a flight to 
Vancouver last week. He was being sent by his Canadian company 
to Singapore. He was telling me about the business they had there. 
One of its biggest problems was that every year it had a turnover of 
30 per cent to 40 per cent of its workers. He said they get their 
training from his company and then go to better jobs. I said there 
was a solution and he agreed that the company would have to pay 
higher wages.
<P>
	This is how in a free and competitive economy the wages of 
workers rise. If a company cannot get the quality of workers it 
wants to stay remain with the  company, it has to pay higher wages. 
If the company lags behind and does not pay enough it will not get 
them. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	I do not know whether the company was unionized, but it costs 
the employer to train the workers. It has to make a very careful 
calculation between the extra cost of training people who then 
leave and paying higher wages and having fewer leave. There is a 
very nice calculation which at some point indicates it is worth the 
company's while to have higher wages and less turnover.
<P>
	That is how in a free society the average living standards of 
workers rise without any government help. It is just a natural 
process without, I might say, interminable wrangling over the 
definition of what is fair. What is a fair wage? Something that 
might be fair to one member may not be fair to another. How do we 
know?
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	By all means the answer is unions. Let them be allowed to 
organize but remove as much as we possibly can the monopoly 
powers granted to them and their employers through government. 
In my judgment that is the way to stop the deplorable situation of 
our transportation system being periodically paralysed by strikes.
<P>
	If workers knew of an alternative way of moving the goods they 
would be very much more reluctant. Either they would drive the 
company out of business or it would be diverted so that the 
business would continue to operate at a much lower level. All the 
workers would be laid off and would put pressure on the union to be 
reasonable.
<P>
	I have used a somewhat different approach to solving a problem 
that has plagued the House. In my training as an economist and 
having thought about the issues for a long time, I believe it is best 
solution possible for all of us.
<P>
	Whether government is doing it in this session or the next one I 
predict herewith that this will be the trend around the world to 
make unions serve both their members and the interest of society as 
a whole.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
colleague outlined his position very well. He indicated there were 
four categories of industry on which his principles would apply. 
Those seem to be somewhat traditional industries. He applied 
deregulation, less government ownership and competition in the 
marketplace as solutions to the problem.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development talked about the 
new economy relative to unemployment insurance and so on. I 
know my colleague is a rather futuristic thinker. In terms of the 
technological world we are facing, the different kinds of world 
communications and the spatial arrangement of workers in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8923"> 8923 </A></B>
<P>
workplace, do the principles he enunciated apply, or is there  
something more futuristic the member could suggest to the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague to look at an 
article that appeared in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> a couple of weekends 
ago wherein the issue was discussed. There is a wide diversion of 
opinion but basically unemployment is not caused by technological 
change or union action. I come down on that side. It is caused by 
the existence of generous welfare programs. That is a widely 
accepted view among a large portion of economists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me reiterate what has been said many times today to 
make sure everyone understands. The legislation we are debating 
deals with the federal labour code. It does not deal with provincial 
codes. However, things set in motion at one level of government 
often eventually see their way to the other end.
<P>
	I come from British Columbia, a very strong labour province 
with an NDP government. When it is not in power the NDP 
represents the unions. It talks about the rights of workers and all the 
great things it will do for them. However, once the NDP takes 
power it often finds its policies have changed considerably and it 
does not represent the people it claimed to represent before getting 
there. Such has been the case in British Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	When we talk in terms of unions we go back to their history and 
ask ourselves if they are necessary. Historically unions were not 
only necessary but absolutely essential. The conditions under 
which workers toiled were absolutely deplorable. In eastern 
Canada, in one case I read, in the last century if workers banded 
together to ask for a raise they could be sent to jail. Those were 
conditions that people worked under in Canada.
<P>
	There was child labour and slave labour. There were improper 
breaks. Working conditions were dangerous, totally unhealthy and 
unsafe. The wages were such that a person could not eke out a 
meagre living. The unions when they came in were absolutely 
necessary.
<P>
	The model of a union is very simplistic. The workers band 
together as a group, go to the employer and ask for conditions that 
are safe or wages that allow them to live. If their demands are not 
met they withdraw their work until such time as the company 
listens and grants them a reasonable wage or better working 
conditions.
<P>
	Time moved on and that model continued. It continues basically 
unchanged today. It started in North America in the 19th century 
and now, as we are about to move into the 21st century, we are still 
working with that same model.
<P>
	One of the many attributes of Reform Party members is that we 
listen to what constituents have to say. We  listen to what different 
groups in our society have to say. Not only do we differ from other 
parties, but from time to time we differ within our own party. We 
represent the things we were elected within our various ridings to 
represent, having in mind the common goal of Canada.
<P>
	In my riding of Kootenay West-Revelstoke, in southeastern 
British Columbia, there are two very big companies and two sets of 
unions at each company. As well there is considerable union 
organization throughout the workforce in other areas.
<P>
	I have sought out these union groups and have talked to them at 
length about the various problems they are facing. Union 
popularity is falling. Right or wrong union popularity and 
membership are falling. The pendulum has swung a little too far to 
the other side for some unions but not for all, not by any stretch of 
the imagination. For a few very powerful unions the pendulum has 
swung too far. My hon. colleague from Capilano-Howe Sound 
alluded to some of them. All unions are tainted when a couple of 
unions get too powerful and demand too much.
<P>
	I talked to them about alternatives to this model and why we are 
going into the 21st century using a 19th century model for labour 
dispute settlements.
<P>
	One principal item the legislation the government is bringing 
forward deals with is the banning of replacement workers. I cannot 
speak for all members of my party, but I can say from my 
perspective that I am not in favour of replacement workers. I agree 
with the concept of not allowing replacement workers. The reason 
is that union workers, if they are on strike, cannot replace the 
company. Then why should the company be able to replace the 
workers if the kind of system to be used is one where either the 
employees withdraw their services or the company locks them out? 
It seems absolutely ludicrous that a company could lock out 
employees and simply go to other people.
<P>
	The greater problem is that strikes in themselves do little good 
for anyone. It is an economic battle between the employer and the 
employee. Unless there is something very lucrative at the end or 
huge concessions neither side wins. The greater loser is all the 
collateral damage it does. When we talk about it from the federal 
perspective in terms of the transportation system in particular the 
losses are catastrophic.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	There are not only the losses. We talk in terms of hundreds of 
millions of dollars while those strikes are under way with the loss 
of confidence by foreign purchasers of our products and our goods 
and our services who start to think perhaps they should not order 
from Canadian companies because there are too many strikes and 
they may not get what they need when they need it. They better 
look at some area that is more reliable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8924"> 8924 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the ironies of the government's putting in a restriction 
on replacement workers is the government knows full well that 
if it sets up some kind of legislation which ends up in a full blown 
strike with both sides at an absolute impasse, it would legislate 
everybody back to work.
<P>
	What it is really doing is setting itself up to have more power in 
terms of legislating ends to strikes. What happens? We have a grain 
shipment strike. The government legislates the grain handlers back 
to work. We have a longshoremen strike in the harbours. The 
government legislates them back to work. It has done so in British 
Columbia twice in this Parliament. The rail companies go on strike. 
The government legislates them back to work.
<P>
	The government has made one error in its philosophy. For years 
the air traffic control system, the air navigation system, was under 
federal law. During that time air traffic controllers were not 
allowed to strike. Technically they were allowed to strike but they 
were all designated in the event of a strike. They had to go to work. 
They had to do their normal designated duties. That was the 
government's idea of how to allow a strike. What it is doing is 
either playing games with the unions, pretending to help them 
when the reality is it is doing the exact opposite, or it has just not 
thought out this legislation very well at all.
<P>
	The public has certain notions. We build a lot of our laws, our 
regulations and our policies based on this perception by the public. 
It is absolutely unthinkable to have the concept of a policeman 
standing on the sidewalk watching somebody being mugged, raped 
or murdered and doing nothing because they are on strike. The 
public will not accept that. The police understand this and they too 
accept that they are an essential service. Consequently no one sees 
that situation occur.
<P>
	It is equally unthinkable for a group of firemen to stand on the 
sidewalk watching someone's house burn down, perhaps with a 
small child still inside and not do something about it. They are very 
important. They are an essential service. Those firemen accept this 
and the public has a right to expect that kind of service.
<P>
	How do we deal with these people? Look at a smaller company. I 
do not want to name one because no matter which one I name, I 
take risk of offending the industry. If there is something of lesser 
importance than those two examples it can be said that it is all right 
for the employer and the employee to have the economic tug of war 
to see who could do without wages or corporate revenue long 
enough to be declared the winner.
<P>
	Generally that is where the struggle is. There is some collateral 
damage in terms of the family of the workers or perhaps if it is in a 
small town, some of the other businesses, because some of the local 
spending is down. However, primarily it is between that company.
<P>
	Essentially what we are saying is that because they are not 
important we will let them withdraw services, lock their employees 
<P>
out, let them have this economic tug of war and may the richest 
person win, because that is what it is sometimes almost amounts to.
<P>
	There is something terribly wrong with the system. It says that 
police, firemen, air traffic controllers, because they are important, 
their right to have a strike will be restricted. Other companies, 
because they are of lesser importance, will be allowed to have it.
<P>
	Then there are those in the middle, like the rail companies. They 
are allowed to go on strike for a while and then we say this has gone 
on long enough. We have made our point. We cannot let them 
strike. We legislate them back.
<P>
	If there is an essential service, there needs to be a mechanism 
that ensures that they are dealt with fairly. If something can be 
brought up that truly is fair, why not apply it to all people.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that I have sought out union groups and I 
have asked for their input. I have spoken to them about alternatives 
to the dispute settlement mechanism of a lockout or strike.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	When we talk about final offer selection arbitration a lot of 
people think we are completely subverting the whole negotiation 
process. It has been mentioned but perhaps it needs to be clarified. 
When we talk in terms of final offer selection arbitration all the 
other mechanisms of collective bargaining still exist. They still go 
through the whole negotiation process. They can have conciliation. 
If they agree they can have arbitration. They can have virtually 
anything they agree to. But there has to be something at the end of 
the day when negotiations break down, when all other means have 
been exhausted, that they use for that final dispute settlement 
mechanism.
<P>
	Some of the union leaders I have spoken to point out that rarely 
in the event of collective bargaining do unions end up in a strike 
position. He is absolutely right, but it is those times when they do 
that cause the problem. Their argument is that the reason they 
rarely end up going on strike is the hammer, the hammer known as 
the strike.
<P>
	We have to reinvent the hammer. I believe that the new hammer 
should be final offer selection arbitration. It has been spoken of at 
length today. Perhaps if we speak of it long enough and often 
enough the government might finally start to listen to it. It is a 
workable solution.
<P>
	If someone has something better, I am certainly prepared to 
listen to it. That is what I have been saying to the union groups and 
the corporate groups that I have talked to about this.
<P>
	As has been pointed out, they still negotiate, go through the 
process and try to move as close as possible. What invariably 
happens where final offer selection  arbitration is used is usually 
each party knows that if they are too far away from the norm of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8925"> 8925 </A></B>
<P>
where they should be, then they are likely to lose when this is 
submitted to the arbitrator.
<P>
	If industry standards, for example, suggest that a company 
should pay a $1 raise to its workers and the company says it will 
give them 90 cents and the union says it wants $3.75, if that goes to 
arbitration the company will win. If, however, the company says it 
actually cannot afford to give a raise this year and was thinking of 
asking employees to take a cut but is prepared to sign at the same 
rate, and under those circumstances the union asks for $1.35, the 
union would prevail.
<P>
	What happens is both the union and the company know this and 
they move much closer together, often to the point where they may 
ultimately finally agree to settle. That is often the case.
<P>
	I have heard people argue the concept that perhaps that works if 
it is just wages or it is just something else. But they are afraid of 
what will happen is the company will offer a big raise, something 
that is equal to or which even slightly exceeds the industry standard 
that they are entitled to. The company will offer the hours that they 
want and several other advantages but it will slip something else in 
with no particular monetary value that would be catastrophic for 
them to lose and they lose that.
<P>
	There is nothing that says that in a model to be set up for final 
offer selection arbitration those items cannot be separated. There is 
nothing that says it has to be done all in one full package.
<P>
	These are things that need to be determined if the government 
would ever become willing to give meaningful discussions and 
debate to the concept of considering final offer selection 
arbitration.
<P>
	What happens too often is we end up in an antagonist position 
where people have to take one side or the other. What happens too 
often with unions is unions get their back up and all companies are 
bad and the companies in turn get their back up and all unions are 
bad. This is the method by which we approach it.
<P>
	There is an old theory in psychology, theory X and theory Y. 
Theory X says everybody is lazy and everybody does not want to 
work and on and on. Theory Y says the exact opposite. These sort 
of ideas were really pushed hard in past decades, suggesting that 
the only way we can have workers work is to squeeze them. Most 
people want a decent job. They want a decent wage.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Now in this time of restraint most people recognize you can only 
push a company so far and a lot of concessions have been made by 
unions. With certain exceptions, unions are getting a bad rap, just 
as some companies are. During a time of restraint, of  
unemployment, of all kinds of problems in our economy, there are 
chartered banks reporting profits of over a billion dollars. They are 
coming out and saying ``this year it is even bigger, we are doing 
better and we are so happy about it that we are giving $1 million to 
$3 million salaries to our presidents''.
<P>
	No wonder people get their backs up. No wonder people start 
talking about rich corporations and how we should go on strike and 
force them to pay more. Just as a couple of militant unions can taint 
the unions, a couple of greedy corporations can taint the corporate 
side. Most jobs out there are not high income corporate jobs but 
regular companies struggling to continue to make a living in a time 
of economic restraint and recession. This is the kind of attitude we 
have to come up with.
<P>
	That is why we have to move to something that provides an 
alternative to this confrontational type of approach to labour 
settlement. ``You give me this money or I will withdraw my 
services. You take this cut in wages or we are going to lock you 
out''. That was a 19th century solution. We are going into the 21st 
century; we need a new solution.
<P>
	I call on the government to consider this whole concept of final 
offer selection arbitration. I have never heard a meaningful 
discussion from the government side on this topic. I would love to 
have some input. I trust the parliamentary secretary to the minister 
will make an appropriate question or comment to this to the effect 
that the government will open meaningful dialogue and discussion 
on this. That would be progress, and progress is much better than 
playing games.
<P>
	I fear the Liberals are playing games with this legislation. They 
put in provisions to make unions stronger while they recognize and 
by example demonstrate that they are going the opposite way. They 
set them up so they can go on strike but legislate them back once 
they do. They are playing cat and mouse. They are putting a 
bandage on a serious labour hemmorhage. We have to solve some 
of the problems in this country instead of continuing to put 
band-aids on them.
<P>
	If the Liberals are really concerned about the workers why did 
they hike the Canada pension plan by 70 per cent? This is an 
enormous hike in costs to employees. Why would they do such a 
thing at a time when they are saying that they are going to do 
something good for workers, that they are going to give them more 
power so they can go out on strike and demand higher wages? They 
have just put the need for a demand for a $700 raise on all the 
workers in this country and said ``We are going to take your money. 
We are going to take an extra $10 billion out of the economy just 
for the Canada pension plan payroll tax alone, but we are going to 
strengthen the labour code so you can go on strike and extract that 
from your employers''.
<P>

<P>
	If the government wanted to do it right, it should not have put 
that on in the first place. I look forward to the comments of the 
parliamentary secretary saying he will consider final offer 
selection arbitration.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' and

<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion is acceptable.
<P>
	Before going to questions and comments, I have to get this in 
before five o'clock.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Frontenac-bovine somatrotopine.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest, as I always do, when my friend from Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke speaks. I was very pleased to hear that he has 
taken the time to speak with and to ask for advice and glean 
information from the union members in his constituency. After all, 
they are his constituents.
<P>
	I heard him say that we have to look for alternatives to the 
system we have now which seems to pretend nothing is happening 
and then, when the services of the workers are withdrawn or they 
are locked out, then the federal government gets in a sweat and 
recalls Parliament if necessary and brings in back to work 
legislation along with a final settlement to the situation.
<P>
	Final offer arbitration was not recommended in the Sims report 
because it was felt it created a loser-winner scenario. However, I 
would like to ask my colleague if he would comment on the 
winner-loser scenario as may be set up when back to work 
legislation and arbitration is imposed on the parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to speak on that 
variance and the winner-loser concept in normal labour 
negotiations as well.
<P>
	One of the problems that occurs is that when we talk in terms of 
the power of the union moving from the oppressed to, in some 
cases-and I stress not all of them but a few certain unions-the 
oppressor deals with whether or not we are in an inflationary time 
or are we recessionary time.
<P>
	In an inflationary time the unions are very powerful. As my 
colleague from Capilano-Howe Sound said, when  this cash flow 
is coming in the unions can demand a larger portion of it. Those are 
the times when the unions say they want more. They may be 
justified in saying that in some cases because they took it on the 
chin during the last recessionary time, but right now we are in a 
recessionary time. The companies are saying that it is now their 
turn. They are saying that they can now drive the union wages 
down, ask for concessions, ask for cuts and ask people to do twice 
as much work with half as many people. They can ask for all kinds 
of things. It does not mean they are always going to get it but they 
can ask.
<P>
	Curiously, my colleague from Wetaskiwin made a comment on 
the fact that I have taken the time to go out and speak to the unions. 
The results that I have received from these discussions are that 
there is always a bit of hesitation about something new and 
different. We all have that. It goes into every aspect of our life.
<P>
	However, union members are saying it has some merit. They are 
interested in it because most of them are looking for a reasonable 
alternative to going on strike, losing wages and the problems 
associated with their families. They do not like putting companies 
in jeopardy which, in some cases, strikes do.
<P>
	Interestingly, because we are in a recessionary period, when I go 
to the companies and talk to them, the larger companies say they 
are not really sure if they like that. They think the system is 
working just fine because the pendulum happens to be at a certain 
point. One thing about a pendulum, it continues to move back and 
forth.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	There is no right time in the future. The right time to make these 
kind of changes is now. If we wait until the companies say yes, the 
pendulum is over here now and we can do it. Then the unions will 
be saying no. It has to be brought in. In the long term I believe both 
companies and unions will benefit from it. Unions will still have 
the full right of collective bargaining.
<P>
	All we are changing is the final dispute mechanism. Companies 
will have the surety of knowing when they sign a contract they will 
be able to fulfil the contract and that any change in the conditions 
of employment for the workers will be dictated by the marketplace, 
by the ability of the company to pay, by similar wages in 
comparable industries, all the different factors that can be put in. 
All kinds of safeguards can be put into this and that is the direction 
we have to move.
<P>
	I welcome the question from my colleague but I am disappointed 
that I did not hear comments from the other side suggesting that 
they would look favourably on some of the things we have been 
talking about today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like thank the member for a 
very enlightening answer. I have one further question. When he is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8927"> 8927 </A></B>
<P>
talking to union people in his riding, as he indicated he has done, is 
it the fact that the unions are looking for higher wages at this point 
or is  it as I suspect that job security and simply having a job in 
these difficult economic times is one of the things that the 
organized labour people are really looking at present.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, job security is very big for people 
nowadays. For most job security is bigger than wages. Overall, if 
we want to put a broader title on it, people are looking for justice. It 
pervades every aspect of our life and it is no different in the 
workplace. People want a just wage. A just wage is one that will 
sustain them, that the company can afford to pay because they do 
not want to be the highest paid unemployed workers in my riding. 
They want to have a good liveable wage that will sustain their jobs. 
These things go hand in hand. They can have job security by 
working for $1 an hour but they want job security at a sustainable 
wage under reasonable working conditions.
<P>
	Yes, there are a few radicals who would ask for the moon. And 
yes, there are a few companies out there who exploit workers every 
opportunity they get. Most are prepared to work together. Our 
problem is a confrontational labour-management system. We have 
to find a way to get around that. When we do that we will find that 
both sides will be working toward a more common goal than they 
currently are. Things like job security are in the best interest of 
both the workers and the company because job security for a 
worker means wages are coming in. Job security for the company 
means products are continuing to be made, which it sells to sustain 
itself.
<P>
	Companies and workers have to learn to work together instead of 
confronting one another. That is what Reform's proposal is all 
about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today as the labour critic for the New 
Democratic Party to speak to third reading of Bill C-66, the 
amendments to part I of the Canada Labour Code. This is important 
legislation and for the most part quite supportable by all members 
of the House.
<P>
	Despite the fact that a number of critical amendments to the 
legislation have not been accepted by the Liberal government, I 
think the legislation in front of us is still acceptable because it 
represents a significant improvement over what exists in the 
Canada Labour Code today. Despite the fact that the government 
did not go far enough in drafting the bill, the minister is to be 
commended on the consultative process in which he engaged prior 
to the drafting of the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	Collective bargaining, as we have heard in the debate today and 
in public practice, is the cornerstone of effective 
labour-management relations. Even the minister acknowledges 
that. Anything a government can do to protect, support and enhance 
the collective bargaining process is worthwhile.
<P>
	Of course we realize that the Canada Labour Code part I 
amendments apply only to areas of federal jurisdiction. It is the law 
governing collective bargaining for private sector employers and 
unions within federal jurisdiction. These include Canada's 
railways, airlines, broadcasters, banks, grain and shipping 
companies, among others. Essentially these are companies and 
unions within the fields of transportation, communications and 
banking.
<P>
	According to information contained in the Sims report, more of 
which I hope to get the chance to discuss later, part I of the Canada 
Labour Code applies to approximately 680,000 employees, or 
about 6 per cent of workers in Canada. Almost 50 per cent of all 
workers in the federal jurisdiction are covered by collective 
agreements.
<P>
	Work stoppage activity in the federal jurisdiction is comparable 
to work stoppage activity across Canada, on average. During the 
past six years strikes and lockouts in the federal jurisdiction 
represented 4.5 per cent of the total number of work stoppages and 
accounted for 6 per cent of the total person days not worked due to 
work stoppages. We are not talking about serious circumstances.
<P>
	One of my concerns, which is shared by my New Democratic 
Party colleagues, is that part I does not apply to federal government 
employees who are subject instead to the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act. Members of the RCMP and the military are not 
covered by either part I of the code or the PSSRA. It is my feeling 
that there should be one act, one board and one jurisdiction for all 
federal employees.
<P>
	It has been some time since a comprehensive review with the 
intention of modernizing the Canada Labour Code. This process 
began in early 1995 when a task force was established by the 
Minister of Labour to conduct the review and, where appropriate, 
to make recommendations for legislative change.
<P>
	The task force was headed by Edmonton lawyer Andrew Sims 
and the subsequent report became known as the Sims report. It did 
a fine job. To a large extent the legislation before us represents the 
recommendations the task force brought forward.
<P>
	The task force and the minister's response to its 
recommendations were both subject to extensive consultations. 
Sims had a simple premise on which he worked and it made sense. 
Let me quote from the Sims report: ``Free collective bargaining, 
like free enterprise, works when individuals and groups, unions and 
employers, make decisions about their own best interests and work 
out their own relationships within the framework of the law''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8928"> 8928 </A></B>
<P>
	It continues: ``Legislation cannot fix every problem. Neither the 
Canada Labour Code nor the Canada Labour Relations Board can 
solve every labour-management situation. The parties themselves 
must do that''.
<P>
	Sims carries on in his report to say: ``The great advantage of a 
negotiated settlement is that the parties, by their signatures at least, 
accept that they have achieved the best that they can at that time 
and, consequently, are more likely to live contentedly with and take 
responsibility for the result. Collectively bargained solutions often 
involve change. Change works best when both sides agree to the 
future direction. That is the reason why collective bargaining is so 
appropriate to organizations undergoing change. Our legislative 
framework, therefore, favours free collective bargaining and makes 
little attempt, except in exceptional cases, to impose solutions upon 
the parties''.
<P>
	Obviously, to achieve our goals in Bill C-66, the test of free 
collective bargaining must be applied to all the clauses and if the 
clauses fail, then the legislation will fail as well. In some cases Bill 
C-66 fails the test of free collective bargaining and the idea that the 
system works best when collective bargaining is allowed to work. 
In other cases the changes proposed work very well.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Let me talk first about the Canada Labour Relations Board 
testimony before the standing committee studying the bill. The 
Canada Labour Congress termed it the most fruitful area of 
labour-management consensus building facilitated by the Sims task 
force.
<P>
	The CLC said it had been frustrated repeatedly in the past by the 
government's lack of consultation with labour over appointments 
and reappointments to the board. Since the board's activities and 
rulings have a direct impact on workers, unions and management, 
the CLC argued that the board's composition should be 
``representative of the parties involved''. Management 
representatives in the consultation process agreed, as did the task 
force.
<P>
	Bill C-66 embraces the notion of a representational Canada 
Industrial Relations Board, and we all support that idea. However 
there are a few problems discussed before the committee that have 
not been resolved yet.
<P>
	First, participants in the consensus process recommended that a 
labour-management selection panel should be given the 
opportunity to review and advise on the names of persons to be 
appointed or reappointed to the positions of chair and vice-chair of 
the new board. The task force supported the spirit of the 
recommendation but the bill is silent on it.
<P>
	Second, the consensus group recommended with respect to the 
appointment or reappointment of representative members that they 
should be made from among those included on lists of names 
provided by the parties. Again the task force supported the  
recommendation but the bill refers only to consultation with the 
organization representative of employees or employers that the 
minister considers appropriate.
<P>
	Third, the consensus participants recommended that 
appointments should be on a staggered basis to prevent all 
appointments coming due at the same time. The task force 
supported the recommendation but again the bill is silent on it.
<P>
	There were other recommendations on which the bill is silent. 
There is no real explanation of why the government refuses to 
accept these recommendations which would do so much to improve 
the legislation and improve the confidence level that all parties 
would have in the independence of the board.
<P>
	Elsewhere in the debate, as well as during committee hearings, I 
expressed deep concern about the lack of anti-scab provisions in 
the bill. I am well aware that a consensus on replacement workers 
could not be found during the consultation period, or even within 
the task force. However that is no reason for the minister not to take 
a firm stand in support of collective bargaining by supporting a 
prohibition on all replacement workers. If there were to be any 
disappointment in Bill C-66 as it now stands, it would be the fact 
that the legislation does not come right out and ban replacement 
workers within federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	The province with the longest experience with anti-scab 
provisions is the province of Quebec. The task force member with 
the most direct experience in that province, Rodrigue Blouin, 
supports unconditionally the outright ban on replacement workers. 
In Quebec, replacement workers are banned and in the 19 years the 
ban has been place all the evidence points to a very successful 
legislative program.
<P>
	Let me take a second to quote Mr. Blouin as I did during the 
debate of the amendments I proposed the other day:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I submit that the general principles underlying our system of collective labour 
relations dictate that the presence of replacement workers during a legal strike or 
lockout is illegitimate. Their use must hence be declared illegal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let me continue the quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The use of replacement workers undermines the structural elements that ensure 
the internal cohesion of the collective bargaining system by introducing a foreign 
body into a dispute between two clearly identified parties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It upsets the economic balance of power, compromises the freedom of expression 
of workers engaging in a strike or lockout, shifts the original neutral ground of the 
dispute, and leads eventually to a perception of exploitation of the individual-The 
conclusion to be drawn from my analysis is that there is, on the whole, a situation of 
illegitimacy that Parliament must condemn in no uncertain terms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8929"> 8929 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I carefully read the minority report of Mr. Blouin. I am quite 
taken by his analysis and his conclusion which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parliament has the duty to restore the delicate balance necessary to ensure that the 
collective bargaining system achieves its purpose. The presence of replacement 
workers is an intrusion into an economic dispute that takes place in the workplace, in 
accordance with a public policy designed to promote industrial democracy. This 
policy is negated by replacement workers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am reminded of the minister's testimony before the standing 
committee in this regard. In responding to committee members the 
minister said that an important priority of the government was to 
let the collective bargaining process function.
<P>
	I argue, as did Mr. Blouin, that the one element of the legislation 
which prevents collective bargaining from functioning well is the 
provision about replacement workers. That is why I support an 
outright prohibition on the use of replacement workers. That is why 
I proposed an amendment which the Liberals chose to defeat but 
which, if passed, would for all intents and purposes prohibit the use 
of the services of a person who was not an employee in the 
bargaining unit on the date on which notice to bargain collectively 
was given.
<P>
	The Sims report highlights several high profile disputes in the 
federal sector, including the dispute at Giant Mines in Yellowknife 
with its tragic circumstances and Canada Post's use of replacement 
workers in 1991 which resulted in several confrontations, as 
examples of how dangerous the situation is when replacement 
workers are used.
<P>
	The government had the opportunity to end confrontations in 
strikes and lockouts with the passage of such an amendment but it 
failed to grasp that opportunity when given it in the House.
<P>
	Obviously 20 years of history of such legislation in the province 
of Quebec provides the necessary information we need to assess the 
worthiness of such a clause. It is time the federal government took 
the necessary steps to ban replacement workers from disputes 
within its own jurisdiction and my amendment provided the 
government with the opportunity to do just that.
<P>
	Bill C-66 falls short of the kind of comprehensive successor 
rights protection required in the present economic and political 
environment as well. As was discussed in committee, the 
phenomena of economic restructuring, privatization and 
devolution are combining to render the code inadequate for the task 
of ensuring the continuity of bargaining rights and collective 
agreement protection for workers who have chosen to join a union.
<P>
	In the view of the Canadian Labour Congress, a view that my 
NDP colleagues and I share, the code should be updated to account 
for several situations regardless of whether the operation by 
another is moving into or out of its jurisdiction.
<P>
	The CLC recognizes that to be fully effective this would require 
interjurisdictional reciprocity. There are other situations that 
should be included, for example contracted work that is 
subsequently put up for tender and awarded to a different 
contractor, operations that are franchised, operations that fall into 
the hands of bankruptcy trustees or receivers, and operations that 
move from the coverage of the PSSRA to the code.
<P>
	Essentially what is needed here is reform that will shield workers 
from having without their participation or consent their bargaining 
rights extinguished by decisions made by others. These rights 
should be respected and regarded as part and parcel of an operation 
by another. This would be entirely consistent within the preamble 
and section 8 of part I of the code.
<P>
	I also make a special note of the section in Bill C-66 dealing with 
grain handling because I am a rural member of Parliament with a 
lot of constituents who make their living from farming or whose 
livelihoods are dependent on the success of their farming 
neighbours. This is an area of interest to me.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	I have always felt that farmers and workers have a lot in common 
which they seldom recognize. Both groups have been or are being 
exploited by an economy organized above them. Both groups have 
had to fight multinational interests to increase or preserve their 
incomes. When one group goes to battle against their common 
enemy they should all work together to achieve their common goal. 
Sadly when it comes to the movement of grain this has seldom been 
the case. However changes in the legislation makes the prospect 
more likely in the future.
<P>
	When we look at the recent disputes involving the stoppage of 
grain movement, we notice that a good percentage of the cases of 
stoppage have been the results of a lockout rather than a strike. We 
notice that the federal government has been called upon to bring in 
back to work legislation to get things moving again. When we see 
this we cannot help but wonder if the parties, particularly the 
employers at the ports, are not just looking for the government to 
intervene and settle their differences for them. I acknowledge that 
this is wrong.
<P>
	In previous instances when the longshoremen's union has been 
involved in a work stoppage that prevented grain from being loaded 
on the ships it has agreed to load the grain but it has been prevented 
from doing so by the employers.
<P>
	The legislation before us today is a tribute to the longshoremen 
who recognized the value of grain movement over the years. The 
legislation before us today makes it possible, indeed mandatory, for 
grain to be loaded in the case of a dispute between port employers  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8930"> 8930 </A></B>
<P>
and the longshoremen's union. My colleagues and I support this 
clause out of respect for the ILWU, the International 
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, and for the farmers 
of western Canada.
<P>
	As is evident from my question in the House today, I am most 
concerned about the movement of grain and the way in which the 
government has been handling the latest case of the railroad's poor 
performance in this regard. In recent weeks the minister of 
agriculture talked about his concern about the performance of 
railways which may have cost western farmers $65 million in 
demurrage costs and in lost revenues due to cramped sales.
<P>
	Just this week the agency that regulates freight rates supported 
by the government allowed a further increase in freight rates of 
what could be $15 million. The railways have been given higher 
freight rates. The farmers have had their costs increased. The 
railways have been rewarded for poor performance. The farmers 
once again have to pay. We must ensure that matters like this one 
are dealt with.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-66 is a major piece of legislation. There is 
simply not enough time to discuss all of its aspects today. I wish the 
government had gone further in amending key aspects of the 
Canada Labour Code, especially the section on replacement 
workers.
<P>
	Given the progress that has been made today, at some time in the 
future we will get an opportunity to deal with this important matter. 
On a scale of one to ten the legislation probably ranks as an eight. 
On that basis I suspect that New Democrats in the House will be 
supporting the legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the comments of my colleague. Does he think 
the legislation has achieved a balance? I heard him talk about a 
balance and the Sims report was entitled ``Seeking a Balance''. He 
quoted extensively from Rodrigue Blouin who also talked about 
seeking a balance.
<P>
	We heard the member give the bill 8.0 rating. In the figure 
skating world that is a pretty high rating. Does he feel that the 
entrenchment of anti-replacement worker legislation in the bill 
would have strengthened labour's hand or would have gone along 
the road of seeking a balance?
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize there is not enough time to 
answer the question fully but I do believe that anti-scab provisions 
in the bill would strengthen the balance. The legislation has done a 
lot to achieve balance, although it could have gone further.
<P>
	The balance is the ability to pursue the collective bargaining 
process. As long as employers have the ability to upset that balance 
by bringing replacement workers  into the workplace, the collective 
bargaining process remains unbalanced. As a result I think the 
legislation should have dealt with that.

	The House resumed from February 21 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-250, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada 
Act and the Canada Elections Act (confidence votes), be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on private member's Bill C-250 
which has been presented by my colleague from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster. It is an important bill as it reflects on 
this institution.
<P>
	The bill ensures that Canadians have a fixed election date every 
four years. That is unlike the present situation in which the 
government can decide when an election is to take place. That is a 
bit like an employee deciding what are his terms of employment. 
Unfortunately that is a reflection of the fact that we do not live in a 
democratic country. We live in a system that more closely 
resembles a medieval fiefdom.
<P>
	I do not say that lightly. The public would be interested to know 
that what goes on in the House of Commons bears little 
resemblance to democracy. This bill, which is a very good bill, 
ensures that the Canadian public knows when a federal election 
will take place. It is also an effort to take away the unfair advantage 
that exists for the Government of Canada. It is an effort to level the 
playing field and ensure that all members of the House and most 
important, the public, know when an election will be. The time 
proposed by my colleague is the third week of October every four 
years beginning in 1997.
<P>
	This bill is merely an indication, a small but important effort, to 
make this House more democratic and more responsive to the 
needs and the demands of the Canadian public. This House is 
anything but a democracy.
<P>
	Every four to five years members are elected from the public 
with the hope that they will change this country to make it a new 
and more powerful one. Canadians elect people who are going to 
represent their wishes and bring forward all the good and exciting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8933"> 8933 </A></B>
<P>
ideas that exist within our nation. Canadians expect those people to 
present  those ideas to the House of Commons in the form of 
legislation that will address the many problems that affect our 
country.
<P>
	Unfortunately every four years the dreams and hopes of the 
public for a new and stronger nation are dashed. They become 
nothing but a wistful dream as promises fail to materialize and 
expectations are dashed. This is an unfortunate situation. It reflects 
the fact that the problem is not with the members who are elected to 
the House. Regardless of their political affiliation, members come 
to the House to do the best they can for their constituents and for 
the nation. Unfortunately they come into a system, a House of 
Commons, that is not democratic and that prevents them from 
doing the best that they can for the country and for their 
constituents.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	What they see is not a House of Commons but a house of 
illusions. They come to a House where power is centred in a very 
small number of hands: a few cabinet ministers, a few bureaucrats 
and a few people in the Prime Minister's office and the Prime 
Minister. It is a highly pyramidal structure where these people 
control the legislation, they dictate what happens in the country and 
they do it through a bastardized version of the Westminster system 
in England. The system we are supposed to have was modelled on 
the English system. Instead the system has been changed so that 
power is centred in those very few hands.
<P>
	Unfortunately these people, through the whip structure, force the 
members to vote and act like a group of lemmings. That is an 
entirely unfortunate situation and exists not only within the voting 
habits of members but exists through committees, through private 
members' bills and through private members' motions.
<P>
	We have a great opportunity to capitalize on the great expertise 
that exists among the members of the House and also in the 
expertise that exists in the Canadian public, to bring those great 
ideas forward, to have a vigorous, constructive and aggressive 
debate and come out with better solutions, better ideas that can be 
applied to this country's problems. That is the way a democracy 
should work but we do not have that at all. We have something that 
is highly undemocratic and operates along the lines of a medieval 
fiefdom.
<P>
	In 1993 the Minister of Health, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and the newly appointed Deputy 
Chairman of Committees of the Whole published a superb 
document on how to democratize the House. The document was 
tabled when the government members were in opposition. It 
mentioned relaxing leadership control. It mentioned making 
private member's bills votable. It mentioned ensuring that 
members had as their primary responsibility the role to represent 
their constituents and that every vote in the House of Commons 
would not be a vote of non-confidence, that members were able to 
bring good ideas to the House  without fear of being oppressed, 
without fear of being disciplined by the leadership of a party 
through the whip structure. They were good ideas.
<P>
	What happened to them? They were tossed and shelved. When 
these members came to the House of Commons as members of the 
government, their ideas went by the wayside and have never been 
brought forward. It does a disservice not only to members but it 
does a huge disservice to the Canadian people. It erodes the very 
morale and fabric of the system of governance and prevents us 
from truly becoming the great nation that we can become.
<P>
	Solutions can be put forward. They have been put forward 
repeatedly. Bill C-250 is one example on how to level the playing 
field, democratize this institution and make it more responsive to 
the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	I would submit that if the government was truly interested in 
dealing with the problems of the country, if it were truly interested 
in capitalizing on the expertise in the House and in the Canadian 
public, then it would do a number of things.
<P>
	First, the government would pass Bill C-250. Second, it would 
release members to ensure that they could vote according to what 
their constituents wanted and not follow along like a group of 
lemmings according to what the leader and a small elite group 
wants. Third, it could make all committees completely separate 
from the ministry so that committees could write legislation. Input 
into committees from the public would truly be heard and 
documents that would come out of committee would not have but a 
day of media attention and then be shelved along with dozens of 
other committee reports that say much the same thing.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Committees would have the opportunity to truly incorporate the 
good ideas from the public into legislation that could be brought 
forth into this House, modified and built into stronger bills.
<P>
	Right now in committees, unfortunately and tragically, when I 
sit and hear earnest members of the public coming forward and 
giving good constructive suggestions, it breaks my heart to see 
them do this because I know their good suggestions are going to be 
incorporated into a document that is going to be shelved and 
forgotten.
<P>
	One need not look any further than the royal commission on 
aboriginal affairs that cost $60 million, three years to complete and 
what do we hear about it? Nothing. It is tossed on a shelf.
<P>
	When I was a member of the health committee, the health 
committee was trying to decide what to study. It ignored all the top 
20 suggestions members put forward and was contemplating 
studying aboriginal health.
<P>
	Rosemarie Kuptana, head of the Inuit Tapirisat, came in front of 
the committee, put forth a load of documents  on the desk and said: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8934"> 8934 </A></B>
<P>
``If all you want to do is study us, forget it. We want action. I have a 
whole garage full of documents just like this of studies on us''.
<P>
	What did the committee on health do? It decided to study 
aboriginal mental health while the royal commission was taking 
place. This is not an isolated incident but occurs repeatedly in this 
House.
<P>
	Unfortunately members feel coward to do anything about it 
because they fear the leadership. The leadership rules over them 
with an iron fist and tells them what to say and what to do. If they 
do not do that, they will be disciplined.
<P>
	It makes the institution highly unresponsive to the needs, wishes 
and desires of our country and our people. Also, it is a huge affront 
to the members who sit in this House.
<P>
	I will close by saying one last thing. We have a great opportunity 
in this nation to truly make our country strong. Before we do that, 
we have to make Parliament strong. If we are going to do that, we 
must truly make it a democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this private member's bill. Bill C-250 would set 
fixed dates for a federal election and byelections in Canada.
<P>
	This would indeed be a major and significant departure from the 
current regime under which elections are called, a regime which, I 
might add, has evolved over several hundreds of years of 
parliamentary practice.
<P>
	The practice is for the Prime Minister to select what he regards 
as a precipitous time for an election and to advise the governor 
general to dissolve the House in time for that election.
<P>
	In the normal situation, the Prime Minister still has the 
confidence of the House. He is simply seeking an earlier renewal of 
his or her government's mandate than would be provided by the 
operation of our Constitution, in particular by section 4 of the 1982 
amendments.
<P>
	This provision works consistently with the conventions of our 
Constitution and provides for a maximum duration of Parliament 
of five years barring exceptional circumstances such as war or 
other national crises.
<P>
	At the core of this regime is this important relationship between 
the House of Commons and the executive branch of government. I 
would like to draw the attention of hon. members to the roles that 
are played by the cabinet, the House of Commons and the Prime 
Minister in our parliamentary democracy.
<P>
	Our system cannot be understood solely by examining the 
written words of our Constitution. It is important to underlie the 
constitutional conventions that are just as important as the written 
conventions and our written Constitution in understanding how our 
system works.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	A key constitutional concept is ministerial responsibility. 
Ministers are individually and collectively responsible to the 
House of Commons. When we talk about collective responsibility 
we are in a practical sense referring to the role of cabinet. In 
discussing this particular private member's bill my colleague, the 
hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier, has said that the cabinet is 
ultimately responsible to the House of Commons. The leadership 
provided by the cabinet is crucial to the work of a parliamentary 
session. I reiterate that this is within the overall context that 
Parliament is summoned and dissolved on the advice of the Prime 
Minister to the governor general, usually after consulting with his 
or her members of cabinet.
<P>
	There are ample opportunities for the House of Commons to 
hold the government accountable, applying the principles of 
individual or collective ministerial responsibility. This includes the 
debates of this House, the daily question period, the budget 
debates, the important work of parliamentary committees and bills 
and resolutions introduced by private members. Most important, a 
government cannot hold on to power after it has lost the support of 
the members of our House of Commons.
<P>
	My colleague from Ottawa-Vanier has put his finger on another 
important dimension to the workings of our parliamentary 
democracy. He has referred to the role of the Prime Minister which 
he describes as primus inter pares, first among equals. This does 
not mean that we have a presidential system such as other 
countries. However, the Prime Minister is able to give direction to 
the government's policies and to a legislative agenda and to bring 
about cabinet solidarity, fostering cohesion among caucus 
members. I believe that this places our Prime Minister in his 
authority to call a general election in its proper context. It is 
consistent with the Prime Minister's pivotal leadership role and it 
reflects the conventions of our constitution on collective 
responsibility. This has served Canadians well for 130 years.
<P>
	Under Bill C-250 general elections for the House of Commons 
would be held ever four years on the third Monday of October. The 
Prime Minister would not seek dissolution of Parliament by the 
governor general except on a motion of non-confidence. A similar 
regime would apply to byelections which would be held if 
necessary.
<P>
	My colleagues on the opposite side of the House have put 
forward a number of arguments in support of fixed date elections. 
Among the benefits they see flowing from Bill C-50 are fairness, 
accountability, greater certainty and cost savings. We have also 
heard criticisms about the current regime for calling byelections, 
that the period between a vacancy being created and the calling of a 
byelection is either too long, detrimentally affecting  constituents 
or too short and favouring the re-election of a member.
<P>
	It is important to draw the House's attention to the Lortie 
commission report. None of these arguments that my hon. 
colleague has presented is new. In fact, as my hon. colleague will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8935"> 8935 </A></B>
<P>
know, the Lortie royal commission on party financing and electoral 
reform heard and considered these arguments in 1990 and in 1991.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	The Lortie commission pointed to several drawbacks which it 
felt were persuasive. The Lortie commission did not recommend 
adoption of a fixed date system as has been represented in Bill 
C-250. It did not do that for a number of reasons.
<P>
	First, the commission was not convinced that a system of fixed 
date elections would remove the advantage of the governing party 
in being able to call an election at a time most favourable to its 
political interests. Any governing party could still take steps to 
engineer its own defeat in the House at any time and force a general 
election.
<P>
	The other concern that the commission expressed was that fixed 
date elections might lead to a lengthy and in fact more costly 
election campaign. Certainly the experience in the United States 
with fixed date elections and longer campaign periods is a very 
good case in point for us in this Chamber.
<P>
	The commission referred to the rising costs of the United States 
presidential elections, which are often launched 18 months or more 
before an election date.
<P>
	The Lortie commission also found some precedents for fixed 
term approaches to elections. However, it is most important to 
underline the clear pattern that was uncovered. For the most part, 
fixed terms are a feature of congressional or presidential systems. 
We are all familiar with the United States precedent. While not 
uncommon in democracies, fixed terms appear to be quite rare in 
parliamentary democracies.
<P>
	As noted, we do not have a system of strict separation of 
legislative and executive functions as we find in systems such as 
that of the United States.
<P>
	The commission also referred to many of the points outlined on 
the role of the House of Commons in holding the executive 
accountable and in ensuring the confidence of the executive is 
continued. It referred to the role of the Prime Minister and the 
importance of the constitutional conventions pertaining to the 
dissolution of the House.
<P>
	It also referred to the maintenance of the authority of the Prime 
Minister and the maintenance of caucus loyalty. As the commission 
noted, elimination of that convention could adversely affect the 
role and responsibilities of the Prime Minister and disrupt the 
balance between the executive and the elected legislature.
<P>
	In my view, it is prudent that we maintain a system that has 
served Canadians well for hundreds of years.
<P>
	With respect to the argument that fixed date elections would lead 
to a more representative government, let me say that I do not view 
this as-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary's time 
has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure this evening to rise in the House to speak to Bill C-250. 
The bill was introduced by the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	It is a very interesting bill, in that it provides that general 
elections would from now on be held on a set date. The date 
suggested by the hon. member in the bill is the third Monday in 
October.
<P>
	Consider the current situation. Right now, we know our Prime 
Minister is considering whether it would be opportune to call an 
election in the months or even weeks to come. In fact, people were 
wondering last fall whether a snap election would be called.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	I suppose the Prime Minister checks his thermometer of public 
opinion and looks at the temperature. Right now, he is probably 
saying that the temperature in Quebec is not very favourable for the 
Liberal Party. When he looks at British Columbia, the temperature 
is milder.
<P>
	The question he must ask himself is this: should I wait a few 
months more, for instance until the fall, because the temperature 
might go up in Quebec? Or if I wait a few months, will the 
temperature go down in British Columbia? I am of course referring 
to the temperature of public opinion.
<P>
	According to his own line of reasoning, he will probably say that 
even if he were to wait a few months, the temperature will probably 
not go up in Quebec, so it is not worth postponing the election. On 
the other hand, if he waits a few months, maybe the Reform Party 
will get better organized in British Columbia and maybe the 
Conservative Party will get some hair on their chest and, finally, 
the temperature will go down.
<P>
	So after weighing the pros and cons, the Prime Minister then 
decides what the best time would be to call an election. I cannot 
blame the Prime Minister of Canada for using the system to his 
own advantage and the advantage of his party, the Liberal Party.
<P>
	But at the same time we should also consider the consequences 
of this approach. In fact, as we all wait for the Prime Minister to 
make his decision, we cannot make any definite plans for events 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8936"> 8936 </A></B>
<P>
that might take place during the election campaign. For instance, 
committees that must start on certain studies should remember that  
they can be interrupted or even cancelled if a general election is 
called in May or in June for instance.
<P>
	As for me and my fellow members in this House, we all have to 
make special arrangements in our ridings because we may not be 
able to do certain things in May or in June because the Prime 
Minister might call a general election. In fact, proceeding in this 
way creates a level of uncertainty that is entirely 
counterproductive.
<P>
	For instance, how could a business plan its short, medium and 
long term operations if, on a whim of its director, it had to interrupt 
everything to elect a board of directors? In fact, this uncertainty 
undermines the efficiency of this House and the ability of 
individual members, committees and the House as such to 
discharge their responsibilities.
<P>
	The advantage of the bill before the House today is that it 
eliminates this uncertainty so that we know in advance when an 
election will be called and can plan accordingly when scheduling 
the business of the House, the business of committees and the work 
done by each member of this House.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	At the same time, let us not think that will deprive the Prime 
Minister and his party of the opportunity to take advantage of the 
new rules. The government party will also know when the election 
is going to be called, and can therefore organize its legislative 
agenda, its various speeches, its press releases, its new policies, so 
as to best serve its interests, put it in the best light with the public, 
according to the planned, and known, date of the election.
<P>
	In fact, what is involved here is not depriving the government of 
a bunch of advantages this power confers upon them, but rather 
changing the ground rules so that the harmful effects of the present 
rules are avoided.
<P>
	I must admit, I feel a bit uncomfortable speaking in this way on a 
measure that concerns the Canadian election, when I hope, 
anticipate, wish with all my heart, that there will be no more 
Canadian elections in Quebec, for it will have attained sovereignty.
<P>
	I must admit that, ever since the commissions on the future of 
Quebec, we in Quebec have been questioning our parliamentary 
system because, as you all know, it is copied from the one in 
Ottawa, which is itself a copy of the one in merry old England.
<P>
	In a sovereign Quebec, why should we preserve a parliamentary 
system that no doubt had its merits in centuries past but, as we 
approach a new century, seems particularly ill equipped to cope 
with new challenges, to represent this living democracy which is 
constantly evolving, to ensure that it is closer to the people, who 
will be increasingly aware of current events, to govern a population 
that is very much attuned to all of the social,  cultural and economic 
dimensions involved on the floor of this House?
<P>
	A new parliamentarism is therefore required, a reinvented 
system, a system that will be transparent to the public, which will 
foster their confidence through understanding. This is what the 
sovereign Quebec of tomorrow must be contemplating today. The 
restricted, yet brilliant, version of this same debate I find here in 
this House this evening cannot help but elicit my consent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to speak to the bill put forward by the 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminister. Bill C-250 deals with 
fixed election terms, a fixed date of four years for Canadian 
elections.
<P>
	I would like to address our current system because it is 
extremely skewed. The Prime Minister and only the Prime Minister 
is the person who calls the date. Sometimes I am sure even he does 
not know. It appears to be the case these days. However it skews the 
system.
<P>
	The Liberals who happen to be in power this time, or the 
Conservatives who were in power before them, know when they 
want to call the election. They look at the polls. If they are high in 
the polls and things are looking fine, they call an election. 
However, if it is the reverse as the Liberals are seeing these days 
and they are on a bit of a slide, the chances are they might not call it 
right away. They will look at the polls and suggest perhaps putting 
forward a few bills or a feel good budget such as the one from the 
Minister of Finance last month.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	This is the kind of politics Canadians do not need. We need to 
have a level playing field. We need to know when the next election 
will be. The Prime Minister could call a snap election if the polls 
are right for the Liberal Party. He could delay it if the polls are not 
right for the Liberal Party.
<P>
	The bill is about accountability and democracy. It is not 
democratic. The system is skewed. It is not accountable. When the 
Prime Minister calls an election he is not accountable to Canadians 
but to the Liberal Party, which is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	The Liberal member who spoke before me said that the Canadian 
system was the way it should be and that other countries did not 
have fixed dates. I remind him that the fixed term was established 
in England in 1694. Successive parliaments in England differed in 
the length of term but the fixed term stayed. The New Zealand 
Constitution Act, 1852, followed that tradition fixing the maximum 
life of Parliament at five years. In 1875 it was reduced to three 
years but still the date was fixed.
<P>
	Our American neighbours have as their election date the first 
Tuesday of November. Members of the House of  Representatives 
are elected every two years, members of the Senate every six years 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8937"> 8937 </A></B>
<P>
and presidents every four years. The Americans have been able to 
live up to these election facts for 210 years. I suggest to my 
colleague across the way that perhaps he has not been looking in 
the history books or across the waters. The idea of a fixed election 
is a trend that goes back hundreds of years. The Canadian system is 
a system that is out of whack.
<P>
	What about the time and expense? It is costly when snap 
elections are called. If we had fixed election dates we could plan 
for them. We would know exactly when the election would be. All 
parties including the opposition parties would know what would 
happen.
<P>
	Some will say that this is just the Reform Party whining because 
it wants to go forward. We are not suggesting that we will be the 
opposition party all the time. We will be in power. Any opposition 
party in any parliament needs a level playing field. This is not just 
for Reform but for the sake of Canada stepping forward.
<P>
	I also point to some of the red book promises: more 
accountability in government and a level playing field as we would 
say. What is happening across the way? The Liberals promised 
parliamentary reform. What about free votes? Less than an hour 
ago we saw what free votes were in the House. We were voting on 
section 745 of the Criminal Code and what did the Liberals do, to a 
man and a woman? They stood and opposed the motion. If there 
were free votes in the House I am sure a number of Liberals would 
like to support the motion. They did not support it because they 
were told not to support it. That is what we get with free votes.
<P>
	The House of Commons needs to be democratized. The Senate 
needs to be democratized. I have to take my chance for a shot at the 
Senate. Senator Len Marchand from British Columbia is due to 
retire. British Columbia has an act in place that allows for the 
election of a senator from British Columbia. The precedent has 
been set. Senator Stan Waters was elected in Alberta in the 
mid-eighties. What is stopping it? It is the Prime Minister. British 
Columbians want to vote for a senator. The act is in place. The 
premier says he wants it. What happens? The Prime Minister says 
no. Again it is democracy Liberal style and it simply does not 
work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Dark Ages democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> You have it. It really is. My colleague is on the 
right track. The Liberals are onside on many of the issues. However 
I suspect they will be told once again to vote in block against the 
bill. They will be told it is not a good move because it is not a good 
move for Canada. It is not a good move for them because it is not a 
good move for the Liberals.
<P>
	I support my colleague. A four-year fixed election date is the 
way to go.
<P>
<B>(1845 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too would like to say how much I value being able to speak to the 
private member's bill introduced by my colleague from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster on an important point of public policy.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, and as Canadians who are watching 
this debate will know, private members are able under our rules to 
introduce bills and motions to put forward items of public policy 
which are not being dealt with by the government of the day.
<P>
	This whole area of further democratization of our democratic 
institutions is one in which the Liberals, as typical of them, made a 
big fuss before the election. They put forward all kinds of nice 
sounding proposals for democratizing the system, but when they 
were actually in charge, they suddenly got cold feet and have done 
little or nothing to move in the direction for which they so ardently 
argued before the election.
<P>
	I would like to assure Canadians that the Reform policies have 
been to democratize the institutions of government and voting 
procedures. Since its inception we have been committed to those 
and have drafted legislation already to bring that about. We will be 
introducing that as soon as we become the government. This is one 
of the bills which we will be introducing.
<P>
	A number of arguments have been put forward for and against 
the whole idea of fixed election dates. I would like to discuss in the 
few minutes I have the arguments against or the disadvantages 
which are cited by opponents of fixed election dates. I will just go 
through with Canadians some of the reasons why we do not find 
those arguments at all persuasive.
<P>
	The Liberal member opposite who spoke earlier in this debate 
this evening suggested that the Lortie commission, a very 
comprehensive commission on electoral reform which reported 
recently, did not support fixed elections. In fact that is not the case.
<P>
	In the summary of the commission it was stated: ``The argument 
for holding federal elections on a fixed date was mainly that it 
would make it easier to administer and organize elections as well as 
provide for better enumeration. One or two interveners suggested 
that the fixed date was also more democratic because it removed 
the ability of the party in power to call an election at the most 
favourable time''.
<P>
	The report did not deal with the issue of fixed election dates 
except to observe that it had come up and there were arguments for 
and against. By citing some of the arguments that were brought 
forward to the commission against fixed election dates and 
suggesting that it was the conclusion of the commission is 
misleading. I wanted to put on the record that the Lortie 
commission did not come out either for or against fixed election 
dates.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	About eight main arguments have been advanced against fixed 
term elections. These were mostly put forward in a document 
which was put together by Eugene Forsey and another individual. 
It is a well written and interesting document with a lot of humour 
in it, but the conclusions are flawed. I would like to tell the House 
why.
<P>
	Four arguments of those eight dealt with a situation where the 
argument was that fixed election dates would preclude a 
non-confidence motion which might dissolve the government 
earlier. Of course for those who have been following this debate 
they will know that my colleague's bill continues to allow for the 
contingency of the House adopting a non-confidence motion and 
also allows the House, by the way, to continue sitting past the fixed 
election date in case of war, invasion or insurrection as is allowed 
for in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	The arguments which would suggest that the members of the 
House would not be able to cause the dissolution of the government 
for a lack of confidence in the government are not valid. They are 
clearly dealt with in my colleague's bill.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	There are four other arguments, however, that I would like to 
deal with quickly. One is that fixed election dates would make it 
harder than at present to get rid of an unpopular government 
between elections, partly I suppose, because of the presumption 
that there could not be a motion of non-confidence. I have just 
pointed out that is not true under this bill. Also, governments would 
not have quite the same pressure put on them because of the fixed 
election dates.
<P>
	I would suggest that unpopular governments in our democracy 
can hang on even past the five-year period under the Constitution. 
The more unpopular a government is, the more tenaciously it clings 
to power and avoids calling a vote. I would think that fixed election 
dates would at least give us some certainty that we could boot the 
rascals out, rather than having to wait for them to finally do the 
noble thing and call an election at the last possible second.
<P>
	The second argument is that there are circumstances where a 
government needs to or wants to be able to go to the people with an 
election on a major issue like free trade and if it somehow could not 
get the will of the people on a major issue, there would be an 
impasse.
<P>
	I am very happy to say that I, personally, have solved that 
problem for the people who brought up this objection. I have tabled 
a private members' bill to amend the Referendum Act to permit 
questions to be put before the Canadian public at the initiative of 
any government or at the initiative of the people on major public 
issues. An election would not need to be called. Legislation has 
been tabled both by myself and also by my colleague from 
Vancouver North to allow referendums to be used. That argument 
falls by the wayside as well.
<P>
	The third argument is that the calling of an election is an 
important and a legitimate tool for a government. The threat of 
dissolution allows governments to keep their members in line and 
the opposition off balance. If that is the best argument against fixed 
election dates that we can come up with, shame on us. In fact, in a 
democracy there should be no possible reason that the executive 
part of government can threaten their backbenchers with 
dissolution and keep them in line with those kind of threats and 
keep the opposition off balance.
<P>
	It is very clear that governments have almost every advantage on 
their side. There is absolutely no reason to suppose that they would 
be penalized by not having this advantage.
<P>
	The last reason is that there is a mistaken notion that 
governments are elected. Governments, in fact, are appointed. 
They are responsible to the House of Commons and elections are 
only about individuals who serve in the House of Commons. Out of 
those individuals, a government is appointed, presumably by the 
crown. That is total nonsense.
<P>
	When people vote, they vote for the party that they wish to have 
govern. There is absolutely no presumption or expectation on the 
part of Canadians that they are going to elect <I>x</I> number of members. 
Somehow there is a big question about who is going to be the 
government. Every reason that I have seen against fixed election 
dates simply do not hold water. It is not even difficult to refute 
them. It is incredibly easy.
<P>
	To end my remarks, I would like to quote from an article written 
last month by columnist Andrew Coyne in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>. 
He said: ``Canada is one of the few democracies that still leaves it 
up to the government of the day to decide when elections should be 
called, a decision in which the government has an evident conflict 
of interest. Incumbency has advantage enough without forcing 
opposition parties to start the race off on one foot.
<P>
	``The innocent might imagine an election to be the occasion for 
the people to choose a government. In Canada, the government 
chooses the people at the moment calculated to find them in the 
most forgiving mood. The only real change with fixed election 
dates would be to remove from the government the power it now 
possesses to trigger elections at whatever time is most 
advantageous to its own electoral prospects.
<P>
	``This is hardly incompatible with parliamentary government. It 
is incompatible only with parliamentary dictatorship as we have 
known it in Canada''.

<P>
<B>(1855 )</B>
<P>
	I strongly urge members of the House to support this very 
sensible bill by my colleague from Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to enter into the debate. I came here as a Reformer with 
a very high interest in reforming Parliament. The people of Elk 
Island, particularly the people in the west where I grew up and 
where I have lived all my life, gave a very strong message that 
Parliament had to be made to work in favour of the people who 
elected us.
<P>
	I take a great deal of pleasure standing in support of the private 
member's bill put forward by my colleague. It is another way of 
holding the government accountable. It is another way of returning 
power to the people instead of vesting in their government between 
elections.
<P>
	This is part of a larger problem as I see it. I am distressed by the 
fact that over and over we see the exercise of power by a very few 
people in Parliament. It has already been alluded to but I was 
particularly distressed this evening during the vote.
<P>
	Parliamentary rules prevent me from talking about a vote that 
has been held so I will not break that rule, but I will simply 
comment on the fact that over and over we see members of the 
government voting on command. I can scarcely believe that on 
each and every issue there is always 100 per cent agreement with 
what the government whip says. If that is the case I am very 
surprised.
<P>
	I would like to see true freedom in Parliament and an end to the 
manipulation that takes place by the Prime Minister and by 
ministers of the crown as they operate and as they run through a 
vote.
<P>
	I would like to come to the issue we are dealing with this 
evening, the proposition that people should actually be able to plan 
ahead the time of a federal election being held.
<P>
	I am new to the political world. I worked as an instructor at the 
Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. From the time of my 
nomination in 1992 until the election was finally called for the fall 
of 1993 I lived in uncertainty for some 16 or 17 months. I did not 
know whether I should tell my employer and my students that they 
would have the continuity of the instruction I was offering until the 
end of the semester or until the end of the year. I was unable to plan 
financially and unable to plan in terms of scheduling my career and 
my life.
<P>
	I was very supportive at that time of the plank in Reform Party 
policy that elections should be held periodically at predetermined 
dates. I do not like the words fixed elections because there is an 
implication that the outcome of the election is predetermined rather 
than  the date of the election. We need to distinguish between those 
words.
<P>
	Why can we not say to the people that the government will 
govern in a democratic way by going to the people for that 
accountability session? I have heard parliamentarians refer to it as 
the ultimate accountability session. We go to the electors and ask 
whether on the basis of our record they will elect us again That is 
the strength of democracy. There is no reason in the world we 
cannot do that at predetermined dates with some regularity. The 
only exception would be if there were a time of real national 
emergency.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	I have a great deal of support for democratizing Parliament, the 
House of Commons, this place where Canadians expect their 
aspirations to be reflected. Canadians expect to have their desires 
fulfilled in terms of the rules that are developed which control our 
lives and the way our money is spent.
<P>
	These parliamentary reforms are absolutely necessary. The 
faster we can get on with them, the better. It is a shame that we go 
on and on, I was going to say from century to century, but we are 
not quite that old as a country yet. We keep moving along and there 
is hardly ever a mind for change, a change for betterment, a change 
for a more true democracy.
<P>
	It is a matter of considerable urgency, particularly because of the 
issues that face us. We need to ensure that the electors of this 
country are given the opportunity to elect a fair and an honest 
government, a government that will represent their aspirations and 
will neither run behind them nor ahead of them.
<P>
	We have large issues in this country, the debt, the national unity 
question, the whole matter of our justice system and its inability to 
respond to the needs of Canadians, yet we find in this Parliament, 
over and over again, a mechanism which does not permit true 
change to take place. The mechanism is lacking to actually balance 
the budget. All of these things tie together when we think of the 
way Parliament works.
<P>
	It is my delight to stand to urge parliamentarians to exercise their 
right, as provided under the Canada Elections Act and the 
Parliament of Canada Act, that no one should be able to control 
their vote. When it comes time to vote on this bill, I hope they will 
vote right, not just as they are told. They should think about it 
individually and represent their constituents. The constituents 
elected us. They should do what is best for them, not what is best 
for one party. They should not simply be trying to prolong their 
time in power. It is not acceptable any longer for governments to be 
in power, lording it over the people, ignoring their wishes, going on 
an on and then trying to manipulate the vote by so carefully 
choosing the time when the election is to be held.
<P>

<P>
	When the time comes to vote I am going to be watching to 
ensure that members other than Reformers will be voting 
according to what is right, according to the actual item of debate.
<P>
	Let us support this bill not because it was introduced by a 
member of the Reform Party but because it is long overdue. It is a 
bill which is needed in order to improve our democratic systems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to this bill tonight and to endorse it 
wholeheartedly. I have done so in the past in committee and it is a 
pleasure to talk about it here in public in order to get the words into 
<I>Hansard</I> and to get my official endorsement on the record. It is not 
that it varies from my co-workers in the Reform Party-

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BOVINESOMATOTROPIN">BOVINE SOMATOTROPIN</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Thursday I asked the Minister of Agriculture a question in this 
House about rBST.
<P>
	This, as you know, is the famous hormone that can be injected 
into a cow and increase its milk production by 10, 15 and 
sometimes 25 per cent. It becomes a bionic cow, or close to it.
<P>
	Obviously, the pharmaceutical industry has put several hundreds 
of millions of dollars into developing this miracle hormone. 
However, there is uncertainty about the effect of this hormone on 
cows, as well as on consumers of the milk they produce.
<P>
	I reminded the hon. Minister of Agriculture that on at least three 
occasions customs officers had stopped farmers or dishonest 
individuals importing this well known hormone, the production, 
importation and use of which in Canada is prohibited.
<P>
	One customs officer, quite by chance, asked that the back trunk 
of a vehicle full of syringes containing bovine somatotropin be 
opened. If it is like drugs, a seizure does  not even represent 1 per 
cent of what is imported into and consumed in Canada. If the same 
ratio is applied to somatotropin, it can be assumed that we now run 
the risk in Canada of drinking, without knowing it, milk produced 
by bionic cows.
<P>
	I asked the minister what he intended to do to correct the 
situation. He merely answered that it is up to customs officers to do 
their job, and that he hopes they are doing it well. That is a reply 
that I unfortunately could not accept, coming from the mouth of the 
Minister of Agriculture himself.
<P>
	In addition, since we are now into another year of analysis, there 
is a moratorium on the use of this famous hormone. The 
department, the government, is undoubtedly being worked on by 
lobbyists representing Monsanto, for instance, the pharmaceutical 
company that developed this hormone, because there is a fortune 
associated with the sale of somatotropin in Canada.
<P>
	I therefore call on the government, and I will conclude with this, 
to hold a public debate on the use of this hormone. It would be a 
debate in which consumers, as well as producers, processors, and 
producers of somatotropin, in other words the pharmaceutical 
industry, would be invited to present their views.
<P>
	The government has no right to impose this product on Canada, 
especially to protect public health. It has just passed an 
anti-smoking bill supposedly to protect public health. I therefore 
hope that this government, which is so concerned about the 
well-being and health of our children, will hold a public debate into 
whether somatotropin should be used, produced and sold.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the member opposite for the question.
<P>
	Health Canada has indicated that in its estimation milk and dairy 
products from cows treated with rBST, recombinant bovine 
somatotropin, pose no human health hazards. However, it 
continues to review the product for animal safety and efficacy 
reasons and has not yet made a decision regarding licensing in 
Canada. Hence, commercial and personal importations of rBST 
into Canada are prohibited.
<P>
	Revenue Canada's customs officials have been most diligent in 
controlling the illegal importation of unlicensed product into 
Canada and as a result did intercept three shipments in 1996. 
Individuals who have imported any product, not just rBST, illegally 
can be subject to charges by Revenue Canada. As evidence of this 
continuing diligence, an updated customs alert was issued in 
January of this year.
<P>
	With respect to the question of a debate on the issue of rBST, let 
me remind everyone that in 1995 the  government set a task force in 
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8941"> 8941 </A></B>
<P>
place to address issues other than health and safety relating to 
rBST, issues such as the costs and benefits to the Canadian dairy 
industry as well as the potential impact of animal health and 
genetics. A study was also commissioned on the relations of the 
American consumer before and after rBST was licensed for use in 
the United States. This information was presented to the minister 
on May 1, 1995 and immediately thereafter to the standing 
committees of agriculture and health.
<P>
	As for the future of rBST in Canada, until my hon. colleague, the 
Minister of Health, makes a decision on whether to licence the 
product, I shall continue to support the efforts of Health Canada in 
reviewing the product and we certainly support Revenue Canada 
for enforcing the regulations that are in place now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. The House therefore stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
