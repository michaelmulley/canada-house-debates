	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, you may have noticed this early 
in the morning that we have a new mace on the table. This 
wooden mace was used when the House of Commons, the Centre 
Block, burned down in the fire in 1916. Every year on this date 
we commemorate the date of the fire by using this mace.
<P>
	As we were walking down I heard someone say: ``No, we did 
not melt down the old one, we do have it and we are going to 
bring it in tomorrow''.
<P>
	This is to remind us that things get a little bit hot in here 
sometimes and we have to know we can survive and take the 
heat.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are all here together as Canadian citizens and it is very 
important that we work together for the well-being of all our 
people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is what the mace represents and I just wanted to bring it 
to your attention.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a petition pointing out that single income 
families with special needs children have not only a unique 
challenge but incur extra expenditures in raising their child or 
children.
<P>
	Often one or other of the parents have no choice but to stay at 
home. Frequently the children must be sent to specialized day 
care centres incurring extra costs, sometimes significant extra 
costs.
<P>
	These petitioners believe that the current system of taxation is 
unfair to them. They would like a review by the government of 
this particular situation as it looks at all of the difficulties and 
the unfairness that exists in our tax system.

	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my duty to present a petition on behalf of more than two dozen 
citizens, most of whom live in my riding of Winnipeg-St. 
James. Pursuant to Standing Order 36 the document has been 
certified correct as to form and content.
<P>
	The petition reflects the concern these people have regarding 
the language policy of the federal government. It proposes a 
referendum on the issue. This would be a national referendum 
involving all electors in the provinces and territories.
<P>
	I humbly present this petition to Parliament for its due

	The House resumed from February 2 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motion before the House asks the House of 
Commons and a committee of the House to study, analyse and 
report on Canada's social security system. As a matter of fact, it 
asks that we study the modernization and restructuring of the 
social security system with special reference to the needs of 
families with children, youth and working age adults. It is 
commendable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="848"> 848 </A></B>
<P>
that we study, analyse and revisit our social programs, our  
income support and income replacement programs. However I 
want to remind the House and the minister that there are some 
things we should keep in mind. We will encounter serious 
difficulties in doing this examination of our social security 
system.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	I want to remind the House that this was done with some 
intensity in the 1970s when the Hon. Marc Lalonde was the 
Minister of National Health and Welfare. A very serious attempt 
was made to rationalize and bring up to date our social security 
system. While some good improvements were made at that time, 
some of the simplistic approaches that were first suggested were 
found not to be workable.
<P>
	We have different types of social security systems. We have 
those where the payment is universal and comes out of our 
general tax revenue, for example the old age security system. 
We all pay into it in varying degrees through our progressive tax 
system but at age 65 we all receive the same payment no matter 
what our income is. On top of that we have the guaranteed 
income supplement which pays additional amounts to people 
who do not have other sources of income, who do not have 
private pensions or RRSPs or whatever. That is one kind of 
social security support system where the payment is the same to 
all individuals. I am talking about old age security which is paid 
for through the general tax system.
<P>
	We have other types of programs such as unemployment 
insurance and the Canada assistance plan. Depending on our 
income we pay in varying amounts. If we have lower incomes 
we pay in less. If we have higher incomes we pay in more. When 
we collect we receive more if we have paid in more and we 
collect less if we have paid in less.
<P>
	The principle behind it makes sense. The highly skilled 
worker who pays the top premium because he has a higher 
income will have made commitments and entered into debt for 
homes, cars, household appliances. When unemployed he still 
has to meet those higher commitments so he gets a higher 
payment. But he has been paying in at a higher rate.
<P>
	It is the same with the Canada pension plan. If we have paid in 
at a higher rate we get a higher payment at the end but it is 
usually because we have been living at a higher standard of 
living. Usually the rent, mortgage and other payments are higher 
and when we retire or are unemployed we need that.
<P>
	When they tried to rationalize all these systems back in the 
1970s they found that to put together a flat payment system with 
the systems that were based on varying contributions and 
varying payments was not an easy task. As a matter of fact they 
were not able to do it. I bring that to the attention of the House.
<P>
	Some programs are geared to meet the types of debt and 
commitment we have made while we are working. When we 
become unemployed or when we retire or when we are forced to 
leave work because of injury or disability we need payments that 
will meet that type of commitment.
<P>
	For example we do not want skilled workers to have to sell 
their homes simply because they are unemployed or because 
they are retired. To suggest we should have one payment for 
everybody no matter what they have been doing when they were 
working does not make sense. It could drive a lot of people into 
poverty and that is not what we want to do.
<P>
	I want to refer also to the unemployment insurance system. 
There has been some suggestion that, and I do not know whether 
it goes that far, in order to collect unemployment insurance one 
should be obliged to participate in training programs or in some 
type of community work or whatever.
<P>
	First let us deal with the training programs. It is a fact that a 
good number of our unemployed are highly trained already. 
They are skilled. They are machinists, electricians, architects, 
professional people and trades people with highly skilled trades. 
Their problem is not training, it is the lack of jobs. To suggest 
the solution to all our problems is to simply retrain or upgrade 
everybody is not correct.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	It is true a large number of people cannot find work because 
their trades are out of date or they have no trade whatsoever or 
they are illiterate. Those are the people we have to train and 
make competitive with the people in the United States, Europe, 
Japan. I fully support that. However, let us not overdo it and 
suggest that the total solution is to retrain everybody. Many 
people come to my office and probably to my colleague's office 
every day who are trained but their problem is jobs, not training.
<P>
	We hear another suggestion on the street. It is terrible these 
people are on unemployment insurance and they should be made 
to do some kind of work until they get a job. One of the major 
tasks of the unemployed person is to look for work. It is a time 
consuming undertaking. If unemployed people are serious, and 
most of them are, they spend a lot of time going for interviews, 
searching the newspapers and writing letters. They want to get 
back to work in the field in which they are competent.
<P>
	Let us be careful so that this sort of work fair is not overdone. 
To put to work or in training programs as a condition for 
receiving benefits certain young people who are in good health 
but have no training is fine, but let us be very careful that we do 
not overdo it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="849"> 849 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to remind the House and my own party that in the two 
previous parliaments we savagely attacked the Conservative 
government for the amendments it made to the unemployment 
insurance system, amendments that made it more difficult to 
qualify and amendments that reduced the benefits. In a previous 
set of amendments, it increased the penalty for those who quit or 
were fired without cause, as defined in the act, up to about 11 or 
12 weeks. This was quite a considerable increase in the penalty.
<P>
	In the last round of amendments in 1993 the Conservative 
government took away all benefits from people who had quit 
their jobs for serious reasons but could not meet the definition of 
just cause in the act. It was the same with those who were fired, 
according to the bosses for just cause, but which was very often 
in the mind of the employee not a just cause. It was simply a case 
of harassment or trying to get rid of those people with trumped 
up charges against them.
<P>
	We questioned the minister at that time. We said: ``Well you 
just amended the act a couple of years ago to increase the 
penalties from six weeks to twelve weeks''-or whatever it 
was-``and now you are completely eliminating any benefits at 
all. You are going to a very extreme penalty without ever really 
testing the penalties that you put into place a few years ago''.
<P>
	We attacked those sorts of things. We attacked the 
government for totally removing the $2.8 billion that the 
government used to contribute to the unemployment insurance 
fund. Prior to those amendments in the last Parliament, the 
Government of Canada always contributed to the fund after the 
unemployment rate went over a certain level. The other 
contributions to the fund came from workers and from 
employers. It was a three way contribution: the employers, the 
employees and the Government of Canada. The Government of 
Canada then withdrew its contribution of $2.8 billion and put the 
entire burden on workers and employers. The rates went up. 
They were another form of taxation. We were very critical of 
that. We said that was not the way to do it.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	What happened is by doing these things to the unemployment 
insurance system, by cutting back the benefits, by making it 
more difficult to qualify, by throwing people out of work 
without any benefits whatsoever in some cases, it simply shifted 
the burden to take care of those people to the provinces and to 
the municipalities. When people do not have work and they 
cannot find work someone has to support them. We are not living 
in a cruel, inhumane society. We do not let people starve to 
death. What happened was the provincial social security 
systems had to pick up those people and take care of them. In 
Ontario and Nova Scotia the cities had to and they could not 
afford it. It was simply a shifting of the burden.
<P>
	I am trying to remind the House and my party that I fully 
support this re-examination of social security. However, I am 
also reminding them that we have to be very careful in not 
overdoing it to the extent that we are cruel, inhumane, 
insensitive, unfair and unjust.
<P>
	Let us study, let us recommend, let us save money if we can 
through a better delivery system, let us eliminate duplication. 
Let us not take benefits away from those who worked for years 
and years, built this country and contributed to funds, such as 
the old age security fund. Let us not take benefits away from 
those who worked and contributed to unemployment insurance. 
Let us not make our workers slaves of their bosses.
<P>
	Let us be consistent, I say to my own party, with what we said 
in opposition. Let us be consistent with what we said in the 
campaign. Let us be credible. Let us be fair, just and 
compassionate in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the 
speech by the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, an 
excellent speech by a 28-year veteran of this House who is very 
experienced in parliamentary matters and also very 
knowledgeable about Quebec, since he comes from Quebec.
<P>
	However, there is something that surprises me. I have been a 
member of Parliament for nine and a half years, and from time to 
time people have come to my office with serious problems 
caused by inconsistencies-we have mentioned this before-in 
the area of manpower and training programs. In fact the 
situation is far worse than we think.
<P>
	I would like to mention one example I think is absolutely 
inhumane. Some people who were on unemployment insurance 
after losing their jobs were taking courses funded by the federal 
government. These people, who were between the ages of 30 and 
45, had decided to finish their fourth and fifth year of high 
school in order to graduate. They were in fact encouraged to do 
their third, fourth or fifth year. Unfortunately the unemployment 
insurance regulations are inconsistent with the rules of the 
Quebec school commission. For instance, these people had to 
take classes during the summer to finish their course. The 
Unemployment Insurance Commission told them they could not 
stop working or stop taking courses for more than two weeks.
<P>
	As everybody knows, in Quebec, because of the unions and 
the government, teachers have to stop for a month during the 
summer, which meant the courses were automatically cancelled. 
Most of these people had almost finished their courses but they 
could not continue because Quebec's regulations were not 
consistent with Ottawa's. As a result, these people who had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="850"> 850 </A></B>
<P>
worked very hard for one, two or even three years were 
penalized, because if they wanted to continue later on, they 
would have to pay for the courses themselves.
<P>
	Now this is an incredible example. It is inhumane, when you 
consider the time and effort involved. I would like to ask the 
hon. member who is an experienced politician whether as a 
member from Quebec, he intends to work on this issue and 
ensure that manpower training is transferred to Quebec as soon 
as possible, so that Quebecers can take their courses and keep 
their dignity as human beings and also save some money. The 
duplication and inconsistencies make this system truly 
inhumane. Does the hon. member, as a member from Quebec, 
intend to ensure this problem is dealt with once and for all?
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I fully agree with the hon. 
member that there are provisions now in the Unemployment 
Insurance Act that are ridiculous and have to be changed.
<P>
	One of them is the provision that we had historically that one 
had to be ready and available for work at all times in order to 
collect benefits. That meant that somebody who took a course 
was not ready and available for work because they were studying 
during the day. Those studies were essential in my view and in 
the view of many people to prepare that person for a job.
<P>
	There were amendments a few years ago that allowed people 
to do study programs while they were on unemployment 
insurance but unfortunately one needs the permission of the 
unemployment insurance officials to do that. That permission is 
not always given. In my view it should be almost automatic.
<P>
	I also said in my remarks that I am fully in agreement with 
taking steps to eliminate duplication between the provincial 
programs and the federal programs to get rid of waste in the 
delivery systems and so on. I would hope as a Quebecer that we 
could reach an agreement between Quebec and Ottawa to 
eliminate the inconsistencies between the federal 
unemployment insurance program and the provincial welfare 
system.
<P>
	The elimination of the duplication is essential. The provinces 
should have prior jurisdiction in matters of education and 
training. That was the position put forward in the Charlottetown 
accord. Consequently we have to work out agreements that will 
satisfy the provinces in this matter and stop the fighting between 
the federal and provincial levels. We have to make sure that we 
have programs that are efficient and meet the situation that was 
put forward by my good friend from Longueuil.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of our caucus co-ordinator I would like to 
advise the House that our party will be dividing the speaking 
time in accordance with Standing Order 43.
<P>
	It is with a great deal of pride that I stand to give my first 
address here today as I join with my fellow MPs in this place of 
history and decision. This country, of which we are proud 
citizens, has given to us the responsibility to guide the direction 
of the ship of state in the next several years. The responsibility is 
awesome indeed. There are many potential dangers ahead in the 
presence of existing cracks in our vessel. Each of us in this 
Chamber will play a role in the challenging task to bring Canada 
to its port of safety.
<P>
	It is my honour to have been elected to serve the people of Port 
Moody-Coquitlam. On the north side of the Fraser River on the 
outskirts of Vancouver we enjoy the beauty of the mountains and 
the temperate climate of the west coast.
<P>
	As one of the fastest growing districts in Canada we are 
blessed with five thriving communities. Families from all 
nationalities and backgrounds have chosen to call this area their 
home. With its central location in the beautiful Fraser Valley so 
much of the employment and customer pool of this lower 
mainland is within easy reach. Originally containing the western 
terminus of the rail line in Port Moody, we now host a myriad of 
small businesses complimented by a busy port and rail 
connections.
<P>
	I must pause and thank my family for its part in allowing me 
to take this responsibility. I have always made by husband and 
my two girls a very real priority and it was concern for them that 
crystallized my political choices. As I am sure every MP can 
already testify, this task that we are taking on demands 
sacrifices of both time and energy. Doug, Carolyn and Kathy, I 
want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your love, 
support and understanding.
<P>
	A sincere thanks to all those who voted for me. A special 
thank you to those who worked so hard in my campaign leading 
up to the election.
<P>
	It is especially important to me to recognize that it is the 
people of Port Moody and Coquitlam who sent me here to 
represent them regardless of political stripe. I will honour the 
trust they have given to me, an ordinary citizen, to be their eyes 
and ears here in Ottawa and I will speak out for them on issues 
that affect their homes and our community.
<P>
	The people of Port Moody-Coquitlam have told me that our 
country needs healing. Canada is critically ill with a half trillion 
dollar federal debt.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	This one fact alone dictates the treatment for so many of its 
other complications. Where are the sore spots? Government 
policies are affecting the people I represent in real ways. It is not 
ink on a line, it is people and their families in their daily lives, 
their ability to find work, their sense of security, their openness 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="851"> 851 </A></B>
<P>
of heart to new ideas from around the world. That is what I want 
to talk about.
<P>
	In Port Moody-Coquitlam one sore spot becomes apparent 
as we talk about roads and transportation systems, 
infrastructure, if you please. Our unique area is understandably 
one of the fastest growing municipalities in all of Canada. 
Coquitlam alone is projected to double in size by the year 2021. 
Even today traffic is in gridlock. The history of non action is too 
complicated to address here but even the federal government has 
a part in it.
<P>
	Campaign promises of a previous losing government have 
made an equal provincial-federal cost sharing program a 
political football. Hope still exists for $16 billion or, better yet, 
equal funding for what is now a $120 million rail proposal.
<P>
	What is our government's response? I ask not for more 
spending but about some of the areas in which expenditures are 
deemed more worthy than others. What makes these areas? Let 
decision making bodies such as the infrastructure panel include 
representations from those most affected by its decisions, 
elected representatives from all three levels of government. 
Who better than the municipalities themselves to best represent 
their own needs?
<P>
	Sore points two, three and four would be taxes, taxes and 
taxes. When will the government realize that Canadians are fed 
up with its spending and borrowing and the taxes that go with it? 
I have talked with many small business owners from the tire 
dealer forced to reduce staff from 25 to three, to the community 
minded hotel owner who sees perspective investors come and 
leave, scared off by increased tax burdens. I have talked with 
family wage earners frustrated and plain mad that they cannot 
make progress.
<P>
	This government talks about jobs. Careers and family income 
come from secure jobs within small business. It is folly for 
government in the name of fairness to tax away the job creators. 
The removal of capital gains or RRSP deductions and higher or 
broader tax bases will force more of our job creators across the 
border or out of business if they come here to start with.
<P>
	Higher taxes on the individual put more pressure on families. 
Government spending must be reduced, not taxes increased, to 
help job creation. Jobs will be there by letting business do 
business.
<P>
	What of those who need special help? Those who need the 
social programs of which Canadians are so proud? There is an 
infinite distance between the theory we see in some bureaucratic 
descriptions and the reality in our homes and on our streets. The 
social safety net does not need cutting, it needs to be saved from 
self-destruction, to be there for those who really need it. We 
must bring social programs back to their original purpose.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance was originally designed to give 
temporary support for unexpected job loss. Welfare was there to 
support those who could not support themselves.
<P>
	Take the sore point of unemployment insurance. In case 
number one, a young mother I talked to because of her honesty 
could not fill all the spaces in her day care but she could not 
afford to give up her partial UI supplement, so in turn she had to 
give up her day care or close her business.
<P>
	In case number two, a well meaning pipefitter enrolled in a 
course but did not give proper notice and lost all his UI benefits.
<P>
	Case number three is a government induced non productivity 
where west coast fishermen use UI as a supplement to yearly 
earnings already that are well in excess of national average 
because the government owes them as much.
<P>
	Real job training and apprenticeship programs not by 
government but by business will put people back to work. There 
is no shortage of research on what must be done. We need 
government action not further studies.
<P>
	My constituents have identified more sore points. I am proud 
of the tenacity of the Belcarra Council that spearheaded a 
national petition of municipal councils in protest over the 
present Young Offenders act. It put work and time behind the 
message I hear from citizens from parents to policemen. The 
present government must listen to Canadians as they tell it to 
reduce age limits and raise repeat serious young offenders to 
adult court. It is a poor system as we have lately seen that allows 
convicted criminals loose on our streets. Members of the public 
demand that their protection once again be the primary focus of 
government programs.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	This message ends with one final concern. We welcome the 
increased participation and friendship of people from all parts of 
the globe. Our neighbourhoods proudly represent a microcosm 
of a broad, cultural and language mosiac. There is a common 
belief by all residents, new and older Canadians, that each one of 
us must be equal as individuals before and under the law and the 
privileges of this land.
<P>
	Labels must be removed and not applied in ever new ways so 
that we come together as a people, proud to be Canadian first of 
all and proud to support our own heritage within that context. 
We must address the issue of our national identity for a nation 
with no identity is no nation at all.
<P>
	I urge the present government to hear Canadians from all 
backgrounds tell it that they want most of all to be Canadian. 
New Canadians need to have the opportunity and access to jobs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="852"> 852 </A></B>
<P>
and must be given that opportunity by wise immigration 
policies. It is the economic health of all Canadians that will 
dictate the social and economic climate that all must share.
<P>
	I intend to scrutinize all government initiatives in 
multiculturalism and immigration and actively participate to 
make those initiatives more closely reflect the views of ordinary 
Canadians.
<P>
	I salute my fellow Canadians as they watch the proceedings of 
this 35th Parliament. As Canadians we must never forget the 
richness of the land and the potential of its future. May we see 
past the quick fixes and easy solutions to work toward solutions 
that will provide a solid future of prosperity. That future is very 
possible as we have been blessed with so much.
<P>
	As stewards of the abundant resources of this land and its 
people we must seek to be wise in our decisions and 
compassionate in our hearts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
</B><B>Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to congratulate my colleague on her 
address. I listened attentively and I appreciate a number of the 
comments. I agree wholeheartedly that most Canadian 
taxpayers really believe they pay too much-and I also believe 
that they do-and there is anger out there. They are angry.
<P>
	My question is not a trick question. It is a very important one 
to me. I am trying to find out whether or not it is true that rich 
and influential families can in fact shield some or a great part of 
their wealth through trust funds. If it is true that a certain 
number of wealthy Canadians pay no taxes at all, that a number 
of profitable corporations supposedly pay no taxes, that clever 
people with the human resources as well as other resources are 
able to shield or protect some of their money by taking it to 
foreign countries, is it still appropriate then to ignore these 
people or perhaps ask them to pay their fair share?
<P>
	Thereby we probably would improve the economic health of 
the country and help to protect those programs we have. It does 
not mean they need not be changed in order to be more efficient.
<P>
	Would my colleague care to comment on that?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> I thank the hon. member for his kind comments 
and question.
<P>
	As I have stated Canadians do feel they are being overtaxed. 
What the hon. member has expressed is a very real concern of an 
ordinary Canadian: Why is it that I have a burden whereas it 
seems other people do not, perhaps even the most wealthy.
<P>
	Unfortunately the rules of the game in our present world are 
that capital is becoming more and more international. The rules 
of the game are that money cannot be forced to be maintained in 
one country. That very fact dictates that Canada has to become 
very wise in its economic decisions.
<P>
	The rich as the hon. member said can take their money and 
invest it in other countries. Corporations can move.
<P>
	As I said in my speech the producers of our wealth and the 
producers of our jobs can move elsewhere. Thus it becomes that 
much more important for us to make sure that this, our country, 
is a place where they want to invest, where they want to bring 
their talents and their jobs. Then the rest of us can have jobs by 
that. Sure, they need to do their part, but we have to do our part 
to bring them here. I do not think we have done that in the last 
short while.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I totally agree 
with the hon. member when she says that we definitely should 
not raise taxes.
<P>
	We have reached the limit and people are just about to break 
out in revolt. Her leader said that people would rebel and I think 
he is right. People are going to look for all sorts of ways to stop 
paying taxes.
<P>
	It is obvious that the middle class is overburdened with taxes. 
Those who have a bit more money or a better education are 
leaving Canada. Last year, more than 400 physicians left Canada 
for United States. It costs the nation about $2 million to train one 
physician and we have a situtation here where 400 moved to 
United States.
<P>
	What we should do, and I think my hon. colleague is right 
about this, is find better ways of managing our social affairs. 
There is a lot of waste at the management level. I do not want to 
see less services, but I want to see a lot less management. We 
have to decentralize, to make individuals, municipalities and 
provinces more responsible. The federal government could set 
the guidelines, but social affairs should be managed at the 
grassroots level if were are going to provide services to people 
who need them rather than to bureaucrats.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments.
<P>
	I agree that the middle class is maintaining a burden of what is 
happening in the tax load of our country. We are losing our best 
brains, our best job producers because of poor economic 
policies here.
<P>
	I would take it a step further. I would take it to the very root. 
This was mentioned by my colleague yesterday. The society that 
we live in has had the tendency to be dependent on government 
doing things for its members, whether that be federal, provincial 
or municipal. I would like to see our country becoming one 
where Canadians care about Canadians. Perhaps even at that 
lower level, as families and as communities we are able to 
address the needs especially in the social sector where they need 
to be addressed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="853"> 853 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has embarked on the first step in democratizing 
Parliament by allowing free debates such as this one on the 
future of Canada's social programs. For that it really should be 
commended. I hope it will soon finish the job by allowing free 
votes on these issues we are debating.
<P>
	So as to keep our heads on straight during this emotionally 
charged debate I think there are a few questions we should be 
asking ourselves as we begin the much needed overhaul of 
Canada's social programs. In fact I believe these are questions 
we should always ask ourselves in our role as parliamentarians.
<P>
	The first question we need to ask is: Does the federal 
government need to be involved at all in resolving this problem? 
Can it be more effectively dealt with by other levels of 
government, by business or through private sector organizations 
or even charities?
<P>
	In response to that question there is no doubt in my mind that a 
completely overhauled unemployment insurance program could 
be run by employers and employees themselves. This of course 
is what many have been asking for. In essence this was the 
recommendation of the highly respected findings of the Forget 
commission in 1986.
<P>
	With respect to health care and welfare it is important that we 
recognize that the provinces are in charge of the administration 
of these crucial programs. We should let them continue to lead 
the way in progressive and meaningful reform. Newfoundland, 
New Brunswick and Alberta are all bringing forward exciting 
new approaches to income support and supplementation. 
Alberta is also proposing bold new initiatives in health care. Out 
of these varied approaches will come a synthesis, an idea, a 
program that combines the best of all.
<P>
	In both areas however the provinces are limited in the scope of 
the reform by the strictures of federal legislation. I encourage 
the federal government to put everything on the table in its 
initiative to bring change to health care and social programs.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The second question we should be asking is: Will this decision 
lead to a long-term solution, or is it a short-term band-aid fix 
that helps in the short run but creates problems of its own in the 
long run.
<P>
	I would argue that the changes made to unemployment 
insurance over the last 23 years have not only led to ever rising 
premiums and a bankrupt program, more important it has led to 
dependency on government, a problem whose economic and 
human costs are incalculable. For the sake of Canadians let us 
ensure we have the courage to design social programs and health 
care reform that promote personal responsibility and initiative.
<P>
	The third question we have to ask is: Are all the stakeholders 
involved in making these decisions or is it the top down, my way 
or the highway approach?
<P>
	How many task force reports and royal commission reports 
now serve as chair props and doorstops because governments 
were not committed to following through on the 
recommendations that flowed from the people of the country? 
How many times have governments committed to a process of 
consultation only to ignore the comments they do not like?
<P>
	The government should listen extra hard to the people who 
fund the health care system to find out what services they are 
willing to pay for. The government should listen especially hard 
to the people who fund unemployment insurance to find out 
where it needs changing. The government should strain to hear 
from the people who fund social assistance to see how that 
program can be improved.
<P>
	The fourth question we need to ask is: Will this decision make 
government more user friendly and more accessible, or will it 
increase paperwork and layers of bureaucracy?
<P>
	Canada's social programs today are a nightmare. They are 
designed by bureaucrats for bureaucrats and woe is the user who 
dares to verse his social program without his trusty bureaucrat at 
his side. The design needs to come from the people who use the 
programs. To do otherwise is to dehumanize further and make 
even more wasteful an institution, and I speak here of 
government, that is already characterized by gross inefficiency.
<P>
	The fifth question we have to ask is: Does this proposal have 
clear measurable objectives, or are its goals vaguely stated and 
therefore unmeasurable?
<P>
	I desperately hope that the government will bring forward a 
clear set of objectives when it tables its new legislation this fall. 
Putting people back to work or restoring their dignity sounds 
very nice, but unless we can clearly define our goals in 
measurable terms and then monitor our progress in striving to 
achieve them we may as well not even begin the process of 
reform.
<P>
	Clear goals will force us to determine beforehand whether or 
not they are reasonable goals, whether or not they can even be 
attained. Clear goals will give guidance to the means by which 
we will achieve those goals. Clear goals will force us to set 
budgets that will be sufficient to sustain these new programs in 
boom and in bust periods. Without these goals we will be blindly 
spending wheelbarrows full of money in the vain hope that 
somehow this will improve things.
<P>
	The sixth question we have to ask is: Has it been explained to 
the public that if this decision leads to more government 
spending then spending will have to be cut in other possibly 
more essential areas or that taxes will have to be raised?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="854"> 854 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has a responsibility to communicate what is 
going on in government. As servants of the people we are duty 
bound to ask them where their priorities lie, which social 
programs are the most important to them, second most 
important, and so on. As the debt passes a half trillion dollars it 
must be apparent by now that our resources must be carefully 
rationed. I hope the government will fulfil its responsibility and 
address this issue.
<P>
	The seventh question I ask is: Is this decision being made with 
complete awareness of the current economic, political, cultural, 
historical and social situation and environment both within the 
country and outside the country, or does it ignore current trends 
and important facts?
<P>
	While I touched on the economic situation, we must also be 
aware of other factors that determine our environment. For 
instance in the fast-paced world of free trade we have to decide 
if it is even possible for government to predict successfully 
where the jobs of the future will be. Can we determine if 
technology will allow us to do more with less in the field of 
health care? These are questions that can only be answered by 
carefully investigating the delicate interplay of the many forces 
that shape our country.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	The government is embarking on an ambitious plan. 
Canadians from coast to coast recognize that our social 
programs and health care are in desperate need of deep, 
profound change. Not so obvious, however, is the subtle link 
between strong social programs, a strong economy and the right 
of Canadians, not politicians, not special interest groups, to 
guide this modern day reformation movement.
<P>
	Well intentioned politicians find it easy to spend other 
people's money. Their good intentions are infinite but sadly the 
money is not. Well intentioned special interest groups want to 
help but have a powerful economic incentive to maintain the 
status quo. Only real taxpayers, people who grind it out every 
day to make a dollar, can make those tough decisions about how 
their money should be spent. We should trust them to tell us 
what is wrong with the social programs, what is wrong with 
health care, which programs are most important to them, and 
how they should be distributed and paid for.
<P>
	I will conclude with these two lines that I believe sum up what 
I have been attempting to say this morning. If we fake it, if we 
only hear some people, if we only push our agenda, we cannot 
succeed; but if we listen hard, if we communicate, if we take our 
guidance from real taxpaying Canadians, we absolutely cannot 
fail.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments made by the previous speaker.
<P>
	I would like the member to elaborate a bit more, if he can, on 
what he calls real taxpayers. If I am hearing him correctly he is 
suggesting that if we just listened to real taxpayers we would be 
more apt to make the right decisions. I would like to hear a more 
explicit definition of a real taxpayer.
<P>
	How do we take conflicting advice? I would suggest his 
constituents are not unlike mine. I can assure the previous 
speaker that I have, as he calls them, many ordinary taxpayers, 
ordinary citizens and ordinary Canadians in my riding. They 
disagree on how to move the country forward.
<P>
	Constituents are not monolithic. They are not of one mind. 
They are the macro of this institution. We are the micro. We 
reflect the opinions and views of Canadians. We come here with 
all the conflicting views and philosophies. We fight it out, most 
of the time verbally, to get the job done.
<P>
	Constituents are not much different. I can assure this new 
member that he will be receiving conflicting advice from his 
constituents every day that he sits in Parliament. He will be 
receiving advice on taking a collective approach on certain 
issues, sometimes the laissez-faire approach, sometimes the 
government approach and sometimes the individual approach.
<P>
	What I am leading to is that the member should try not to be so 
simplistic in his approach or advice to this institution and other 
Canadians. He should just listen to Canadians. Canadians are 
divided. At the end of the day after we hear the conflicting views 
and advice we have to make a judgment. That is what Burke was 
saying 200 years ago. We are obliged to offer our constituents 
our judgment.
<P>
	We cannot be robots because the constituents are pressing 
different buttons. They are pressing different buttons every day. 
They are telling us to go this way and they are telling us to go 
that way. Yet I hear the Reform Party say: ``No, our constituents 
are of one mind. They are of one opinion. They are monolithic''. 
That is baloney and I think they have to come to grips with that. I 
want you to respond to that.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind all members to 
direct their questions and comments through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member raises some important 
points. I would point out to him that it was not the people 
involved in making the decisions who led us to the point where 
we have a half trillion dollar debt today. They did not have direct 
input into designing the programs that led us to that half trillion 
dollar debt. Edmund Burke had some wise things to say, but he 
did not have the opportunity to go through 300 or 400 years of 
democracy to see where it would lead.
<P>
	The member is making his comments, not in the context of the 
current situation, not in the context of the  fact that we have a 
huge debt and deficit, not in the context of the fact that people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="855"> 855 </A></B>
<P>
are cynical about politics and politicians, not in the context of 
the fact that we have huge divisions in the country because 
people do not feel they are being consulted.
<P>
	If someone is simplistic in the House, it is not the people in 
the Reform Party who believe people have to be given a voice. It 
is people who believe they have all the answers. I encourage the 
hon. member to take a look around the country today and 
acknowledge we have to listen much more carefully to people 
than we have over the last 20 years.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too want to say a few words on this important motion put forth 
by my friend and colleague, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	I want to say to my friend from Medicine Hat that he should 
take a good look; he is looking at somebody who does not have 
all the answers and does not pretend to have them. I do have 
some concerns about this resolution and I shall express them.
<P>
	If we look at the resolution, the guts of it say that the 
committee would make recommendations regarding the 
modernization and restructuring of Canada's social security 
system. Since I have only 10 minutes I will not take any time to 
talk about how proud I am to be in a country with such a good 
social security system that has served the country very well for 
many years. I wish I had time to do that but I do not. I do have the 
time to say that I acknowledge any system however good needs 
regular scrutiny, regular reviewing, to see what is good about it, 
and we will hold to that. Whatever is not so good or has become 
obsolete we will jettison; we will do away with. That is why our 
system in Canada is a dynamic, unfolding, growing system.
<P>
	There are a couple of buzzwords. I hate buzzwords; I just hate 
them. I know I use them but I hate them because often 
buzzwords wind up inadvertently skating over issues. The word 
modernization and the word restructuring, maybe they were just 
a bit of shorthand. Maybe they are buzzwords to mass a whole 
set of intentions. That I want to know the answer to. Let me ask 
people who hear the word rationalization: ``Have you ever heard 
of a company that was going to rationalize the workforce that 
wound up doubling the work force?'' Not quite. Rationalizing 
has always come to connote wipe out, destroy, reduce to 
nothing.
<P>
	My good friend from North Vancouver injects the term 
improve. Yes, I suppose there is a context in which by 
rationalizing we can improve. I am not arguing that point. I am 
saying to him that the term rationalization has so often come to 
mean everything but improve. That is my point.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	I come to the two buzzwords in this resolution: modernization 
and restructuring. We have to be careful what exercise it is we 
enable the committee to do. We must see to it that it has a full 
mandate to scrutinize the present system and see ways in which, 
in the words of my good friend from North Vancouver, the 
system can be improved. I say to him improved, not gutted. To 
gut the system is not to improve it. That is my whole point and he 
helps me make it.
<P>
	In the haste to modernize I have never had any excitement 
about if it is modern it is therefore good. I happen to know some 
good old fashioned things that are very good too. Modernization 
does not get me too excited if in the process we jettison 
something that was worth while. Restructuring for its own sake 
does not get me very excited if, in the process, we restructure 
some of the goodness, some of the inherent value of the 
particular program.
<P>
	I come from a province with a very proud and very long 
history. By 1997 it will be 500 years since the Brits discovered 
us, except those who were here before us were discovered a long 
time before that. The Vikings discovered us around the year 900. 
When they came here they found people in Newfoundland 
already. The Dorset people were there about 2,500 years ago.
<P>
	There has been settlement on the island of Newfoundland and 
Labrador for thousands of years. The Caucasian settlement is 
much more recent but it has been there for 500 years plus. When 
the Brits arrived in 1497 they found the Portuguese already there 
fishing quite regularly.
<P>
	You know, Mr. Speaker, because you have heard me say many 
times in the House that the reason people came to Newfoundland 
was the same reason in effect that people went to the prairies of 
western Canada. They came because there was a resource there 
that they could earn a living from. In the one case, fish, and the 
other case, land. That is why they came.
<P>
	I introduce that in the context of this debate because there is 
still a bit of stereotyping around. I had a professor in Boston 
University many years ago, a very wise man. I will use his 
words. They might not be politically correct these days but I 
have to use his wording. He said: ``All Indians walk in single 
file, at least the one I saw did''. There is always the danger of 
generalizing from too few examples.
<P>
	I have heard it. I am a proud Newfoundlander. I was born and 
bred there. I spent all my life there and I hear about the lazy 
Newfoundlander. I hear it all the time. We got used to the Newfie 
jokes. They are intended for stunned mainlanders anyway so we 
do not mind that. However we are stereotyped that we are all 
down there trying to find a way to skin by, so we can get 10 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="856"> 856 </A></B>
<P>
stamps, so we can sit home and drink beer for the other 42 
weeks. That is somehow contradicted by the reality.
<P>
	Here is some of the reality. Today there are 580,000 
Newfoundlanders living in Newfoundland. The reality is that 
there are three-quarters of a million native born 
Newfoundlanders living outside Newfoundland. Maybe some of 
them went to Fort McMurray, to Cambridge, to Toronto-there 
is a quarter of a million of them in southern Ontario alone-to 
Los Angeles where there are 85,000, to what we call the Boston 
states, the New England states where there are 75,000 native 
born Newfoundlanders. Did they go because they found a way to 
beat the system there and get 10 stamps?
<P>
	No, they went to get a work opportunity. They have done it for 
500 years. If the work is in the boat they stay there. If it is on the 
rail tracks of Saskatchewan with CP that is where they go. If it is 
cutting logs in Nova Scotia that is where they are today. If it is 
working on the Great Lakes that is where they are today. Several 
hundred of my constituents, even as I speak, are working the 
Great Lakes.
<P>
	I want to demolish one more time the myth that somehow 
there are a bunch of lazy kooks down there who are waiting for a 
government to come up with some more programs that they can 
milk and stay home and drink beer. That is not what this exercise 
is all about.
<P>
	I am proud that I live in a country that says some people out 
there, through no fault of their own, cannot look after 
themselves and so we have a welfare system. I live in a country 
where there is the reality that some people cannot get 
employment for 12 months of the year and so we have an 
unemployment insurance system. Does that mean we ought to 
foster abuse of the unemployment insurance system? No, it does 
not. It means something else. It means that in our haste to 
modernize and to restructure we not throw out the baby with the 
bath water.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	The basic system is good and has served us well. If there are 
some abuses, let us find them. Let us not get so caught up in the 
idea that now we have to reinvent the wheel. We have to find 
some new things because it is 1994. Let us find some new ones if 
they are better than the old ones but let us have a good look at the 
old ones too. They have served us very well.
<P>
	All this is a matter of perspective. I heard the exchange 
between my good friend from Winnipeg-St. James and my 
friend from Medicine Hat. It is not that one has all the answers. 
Some of us state our views more vociferously than others. Some 
of us do not believe them more deeply but maybe articulate them 
more strongly at times.
<P>
	We come from different perspectives. We come from different 
solitudes. It is one thing if one is the leader of the Reform Party 
and one's riding of Calgary Southwest has an average family 
income of $49,000 or the newly independent gentleman from 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville who comes from a  riding 
that has the highest family income in Canada, $58,800.
<P>
	One would have a different perspective if one represents those 
ridings or if one represents my riding in which the average 
family income is $24,800. The gentleman from Annapolis 
Valley-Hants represents a riding in which the average family 
income is $30,000.
<P>
	It is a matter of what the reality and background are and who 
sent us here. I have to say to my colleagues in this Chamber that 
the people who sent me here are every bit as Canadian as the 
people who live in my good friend's riding of Gaspé or my other 
friend's riding of Rimouski-Témiscouata. They are every bit 
as Canadian but with very different perspectives than somebody 
who lives on the prairies of Canada or elsewhere in this country.
<P>
	That is what this debate is all about. We do not run a 
government here. We do not sit here and look at the gorgeous 
stained windows, as nice as they are. We debate here. This is a 
forum in which we bring the ideas of Canadians in two 
territories and ten provinces together. There is going to be a 
debate of different ideas. We are going to have differences of 
opinion. However, at the end of the day we are worth our salt, 
our salary.
<P>
	We justify our being here only if we take what we had in the 
past in terms of social security systems and not destroy them or 
with euphemisms of restructuring throw them out. We should 
rebuild them. We should craft a better vehicle for the 1990s. 
That is the challenge that my people in Burin-St. George's 
want me to address. I believe it is the one that all people across 
this country want us to address here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
intently to the speech given by the hon. member. I enjoyed it 
very much, although for a while I wondered if he was talking 
about buzzwords and Newfie jokes more than the problem at 
hand.
<P>
	However, he did mention at one stage rationalization being a 
bad word that meant terrible things. He gave me credit for 
bringing in the term improvement.
<P>
	Companies that have had to go through a rationalization 
program have ended up with a better structure, more efficiency 
and a profitable situation from perhaps one that would have 
meant disaster before.
<P>
	He also mentioned the term reality. I wanted to bring some 
reality to the discussion here and ask him a specific question. A 
person who retired on CPP in the early 1980s will collect almost 
five times what they contributed to CPP in their lifetime.
<P>
	However, a 20-year-old today contributing to CPP will end 
up collecting less than three-quarters of what that person 
contributed. A similar problem exists with UI when a person 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="857"> 857 </A></B>
<P>
using the system can collect up to 17 times as much as they pay 
into the system.
<P>
	Does the hon. member agree that the CPP and UI systems 
should be modernized or rationalized so that they are much more 
like true insurance rather than a system of transferring benefits 
from one person to another?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, my friend from North Vancouver 
makes two excellent points.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	The best way I can respond to the first point is to tell the hon. 
member about the three people who were facing execution by 
the guillotine. The rule was that if there were something wrong 
with the guillotine you went scot free. The first person put his 
head down, the blade jammed half way down and he was let go. 
The second person, the same thing. The third person was 
watching this and always wanting to be helpful he said to the 
executioner, ``I think I know how to fix that''.
<P>
	If efficiency is the only objective, I can make the system very 
efficient for the hon. member for North Vancouver. Efficiency is 
not an end in itself. It must never become an end in itself in 
government. It must become one of the vehicles by which we get 
there.
<P>
	If the only objective is efficiency I can tell him how to make 
unemployment efficient. Do not send out any cheques. All right? 
Just give people food stamps maybe. I can tell him how to make 
CPP efficient. Let us call it off. That would be the ultimate in 
efficiency, would it not?
<P>
	Let us go to his second point of whether the examples he cites 
need fixing? I say to him gently we are having a debate. It was 
moved by the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
seconded by the Minister of Finance and the debate is calling on 
us to look at the social programs and see if they can be improved. 
That is to say, that debate itself, the fact that the gentleman rose 
in his place and moved a motion, is an acknowledgement that 
there is a lot wrong with the system. The hon. member for North 
Vancouver has given us two examples. If I had a week I could 
give him 10,000 others.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I welcome this opportunity to take part in today's debate on the 
modernization and restructuring of Canada's social security 
system.
<P>
	In particular, I am pleased that the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has proposed to consult as broadly as 
possible with the Canadian people by directing the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development to listen to 
Canadian concerns and priorities regarding all aspects of the 
social safety net.
<P>
	This grassroots approach is precisely what Canadians have 
been demanding for many years. During the last election 
Canadians told us that social assistance programs and 
unemployment insurance are not leading them back to the work 
force.
<P>
	Canadians are right to be concerned. We risk becoming 
polarized into two camps, those who have jobs and those who do 
not. Too many people are not working. Too many people want 
jobs and cannot find them.
<P>
	Part of our social safety net is comprised of social assistance 
or welfare administered by the provinces. Social assistance has 
been designed to help those whose lives have a taken an 
unexpected turn for the worst. It helps the disadvantaged and the 
disabled. It ensures that people have the basics of life, food, 
shelter and health care. In some cases social assistance also 
provides training programs to prepare clients for jobs and 
independence. Through this process a new idea has emerged.
<P>
	Social assistance that provides the basics of life is no longer 
enough. Social assistance also needs to be geared to making 
people more confident, self-reliant and ready to re-enter the 
work force.
<P>
	It is true that welfare is a provincial jurisdiction but the 
federal government must not and cannot shirk its responsibility. 
The federal government is an important part of the social safety 
net. We have the responsibility of the unemployment insurance 
fund which distributes up to $20 billion annually and the same 
problem that besets social assistance also affects 
unemployment. It does not lead people back to the work force. 
For too many people unemployment insurance is just a stop 
along the way to welfare.
<P>
	Besides unemployment the federal government has programs 
that assist the elderly, veterans, disabled and aboriginals. We 
also provide transfer payments to the provinces to help support 
health, education and social assistance programs. These direct 
and indirect expenditures represent the single largest 
component of federal spending. It is in the amount of $70 
billion, slightly over half of all our federal program spending.
<P>
	High taxes and huge debt are crushing Canada's economy. On 
the other hand social assistance programs that generate a 
continuous cycle of dependency are crushing the lives of 
millions of Canadians. We simply cannot afford either 
financially or morally to continue this cycle.
<P>
	The Canadian people know that our social programs, both 
federal and provincial, are strained to the limit. Many feel they 
no longer do what they have been designed to do.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	Instead we need a brand new model so that we would better 
meet the needs of the Canadian people. This new model for our 
social safety net will require changes along the way at a number 
of levels, from the fiscal arrangements which help to pay for 
these programs to the ways these programs themselves are 
delivered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="858"> 858 </A></B>
<P>
	For 127 years Canadians have enjoyed a system of 
government that has served us well, two tiers of jurisdiction, 
federal and provincial, divide powers and responsibilities. 
What makes Canada great is that we have always been able to 
work together and compromise for the greater good.
<P>
	At this juncture of our history we once again find ourselves in 
need of that co-operation and goodwill. Now is not the time for 
another protracted turf war between the federal and provincial 
governments. Canadians will not accept it, nor should we as 
federal representatives be drawn into jurisdictional squabbles. 
What the times appear to demand now is a new rationale for the 
social security system and a willingness to co-operate in 
implementing this rationale.
<P>
	I am pleased to note that a number of provinces have taken the 
lead in exploring new ideas and trying new programs. They are 
to be commended for their initiative and for their creativity. For 
example, British Columbia and New Brunswick are 
experimenting with pilot projects that use financial incentives 
to get those on welfare back to school or back into the work 
force.
<P>
	Ontario is proposing a three tiered approach: a child benefit 
for all parents on low income, a basic benefit for jobless adults, 
and a special allowance up to $450 a month for jobless adults in 
retraining programs.
<P>
	Newfoundland has proposed replacing unemployment 
insurance and welfare with a form of guaranteed annual income 
of at least $9,000 for everyone in the province. The needy and 
the destitute would receive other monetary housing and health 
benefits. As for those who receive welfare or unemployment 
insurance they would no longer be penalized if they take part 
time, short term or minimum wage jobs. They would no longer 
lose their housing, health and child care benefits until they could 
afford to pay for them.
<P>
	All these examples illustrate a workable common sense 
approach to the change of Canada's social safety net. By 
combining the principles of need and merit with incentive, these 
examples of welfare reform illustrate that social programs can 
be based on a kind of hard nosed compassion.
<P>
	The question is familiar to anyone living in Canada. How with 
limited funds can we support in some dignity those who cannot 
work, reward those who can for trying and either educate or train 
the rest? We already have some interesting examples before us. 
Enterprising welfare reforms have been heard before and then 
forgotten.
<P>
	I do not believe Canadians can afford to let that happen again. 
That is why I am so pleased that the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has already agreed to study several of 
these proposals made by some of the provinces.
<P>
	The changes when they come might happen in the following 
way. Assuming that the Canadian economy must undergo 
pronounced structural change to remain competitive the labour 
force is naturally faced with job retraining, job dislocation and 
economic uncertainty. A significant job category in the near 
future may well be that of trainee or student.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance seems to be the likely candidate to 
be transformed into a training and upgrading allowance scheme. 
Such allowances could even begin with students completing 
high school and beginning occupational training or higher 
education. These allowances would continue to be available to 
people in the process of retraining when that becomes necessary.
<P>
	The possibility even exists of entirely banishing the concept 
of unemployment. Temporary lay-offs could be used as holiday 
time while more lengthy lay-offs could be used for sabbatical or 
for periods of job retraining.
<P>
	As illustrated by the Newfoundland scheme such allowances 
might also be used to supplement the incomes of those in part 
time employment. The beauty of this vibrant as opposed to 
passive form of guaranteed annual income is that when someone 
on social assistance finally finds a job they will not be punished 
with a smaller cheque. They would be given a bigger one. The 
assistance would taper off until earned income reaches a certain 
level, and then slowly subside to zero until another level is 
reached.
<P>
	The advantages are easy to see. Unemployment insurance and 
make work spending are redeployed to support the 
unemployable and also reward the effort of getting work. 
Conventional, passive welfare spending declines as people find 
jobs or create their own through self-employment and enough is 
left over to finance better training programs and education.
<P>
	The provinces have come up with many new approaches. It is 
this government's desire to work with the provinces with one 
simple goal in mind, getting Canada back to work. We want to sit 
down with our provincial partners and come up with a unified 
and effective program that works for the Canadian people. By 
co-operating I believe we can find new solutions. I believe our 
shared deficit and debt crisis has opened a window of 
opportunity to try new common sense ideas. They have forced us 
to recognize that our first task is to get Canadians working 
again. They have forced us to recognize that what we do now is 
not working.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The federal government and the provinces of this federation 
have been given a unique opportunity. Together we can perform 
a fundamental overhaul of all the social assistance and 
unemployment insurance programs. Let us not waste this rare 
opportunity. Let us tap into that reservoir of Canadian ingenuity 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="859"> 859 </A></B>
<P>
good old-fashioned common sense and work together for the 
good of all Canadians.
<P>
	At this time I would like to apologize to my hon. colleague for 
using the buzzwords.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must 
congratulate the member who just finished her speech. I 
certainly share some of her concerns and I also understand why 
many Canadians want democratic debates like the one we are 
having right now. But Canadians also expect us to take 
immediate and concrete measures.
<P>
	Up to now, this government has made no major decision. 
Nothing has been done to tackle great priorities like the deficit 
or the social security system reform. We must remember that 
during the campaign, the Liberals promised they would 
maintain the status quo in that area, particularly in the case of 
welfare.
<P>
	I would like to know if the member thinks job creation might 
be a good way to begin the reform. The government announced 
an infrastructure program to put people back to work, but we 
will need more than that. What is the government waiting for to 
launch job creation projects which would at the same time lead 
to this reform?
<P>
	It is clear the announced reform was only an excuse to cut 
social programs because the government is unable to create 
jobs. We cannot train welfare recipients if that training does not 
lead to enriching, creative and well paid jobs. Otherwise, as 
someone said before, we get into a vicious circle and go back to 
square one.
<P>
	The number of people living below the poverty line keeps on 
increasing. We must therefore, first and foremost, focus our 
efforts on job creation. As her government said: jobs, jobs, jobs, 
I say jobs, jobs, jobs, yes, but with concrete projects, and reform 
will follow. I would like to have her comments on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member 
for his kind remarks.
<P>
	As to the social programs and the funding, I believe 
throughout our campaign we illustrated the fact that jobs and the 
social security programs together are unified. If we get people 
back to work the social programs will be less in use. The moneys 
will be there and in close ties with that, the financial end of the 
social programs will help alleviate the debt and the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to be patient. We have been here for a few months, 
but I can assure the hon. member that the human resources 
minister is certainly working hard to come up with a strong 
effective program to meet the challenges of today. I am sure it 
will be something that will meet well with all Canadians.
<P>
	The Liberals have been known to be caring and compassionate 
people. I am sure the hon. member's concerns will be addressed 
by the ministers involved. I again thank the member for the kind 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
congratulate the hon. member for her address. She brought a lot 
of passion and eloquence to her delivery today.
<P>
	I am just a little bit confused in my own mind and would like 
some clarification with respect to the statements from the 
member for Burin-St. George's. He said that we have had a 
basic system that has served us well. If that is the case, why then 
did the hon. member who just spoke say that the economy has to 
undergo major restructuring?
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to somehow bring together 
those two statements so that when it comes to a question of 
integration and getting a system working again that this does 
indeed happen. The two members have created some confusion 
for me. Could the hon. member please clarify those statements?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her kind 
remarks.
<P>
	I believe the programs were established and well studied at 
the time they were implemented. As time goes on, functions for 
a program change. When times are hard and jobs are lost, some 
of the programs tend to be referred to in a manner that did not 
need to be addressed when times were a little more affluent. This 
is what we are trying to address. The programs have been 
studied but we have to make sure that the abuse of the programs 
is addressed. When the economy is down it appears the abuses 
seem to go up. If we can balance both of them, our programs will 
satisfy both at the same time. I hope I have answered the hon. 
member's question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before giving the floor to 
the hon. member for Québec, I would like her to indicate 
whether she is going to make a 10 or a 20 minute speech.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Twenty minutes, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	The riding of Quebec, which I have the honour to represent in 
the House of Commons, is a very special one.
<P>
	Many MPs say the same thing about their riding, but this one, 
which is home to the Quebec government and the National 
Assembly, as well as the Old City of Quebec, declared a world 
heritage site by UNESCO, is, for all Quebecers, a sacred place 
steeped in history, from an administrative, political and 
emotional perspective.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="860"> 860 </A></B>
<P>
	I want above all to pay tribute to the people of my riding, 
and state again that I am convinced that the direction taken by 
the Bloc Quebecois is the only one which will lead Quebec to 
full economic development and nationhood. To convince 
everyone in my constituency of that fact will be the greatest 
challenge of my mandate.
<P>
	The riding includes several federal sites such as the famous 
Plains of Abraham, Artillery Park and the Citadel, well known 
to tourists and visitors alike. It also includes a harbour vital to 
our region's economy, but which has been experiencing a 
significant drop in activity in the wake of the general slowdown 
of the economy.
<P>
	I promise to raise again, in this House, the problems plaguing 
the Quebec harbour to show how a harbour, centrally managed 
by Ottawa which keeps all the revenues, and whose development 
is controlled from afar, cannot compete against harbours 
elsewhere in the world which are virtually all managed locally, 
such as those of Rotterdam and Antwerp.
<P>
	Next to the commercial harbour, we find the Old Port, an 
important tourist attraction and recreational facility in which 
the federal government has been investing considerable sums 
for more than a decade. The development and vocation of this 
facility create serious planning problems in our area.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	The fact the local and regional elected officials do not have 
formal jurisdiction over these facilities calls into question once 
again the whole issue of the inefficient and bureaucratic 
centralization of Canadian federalism, as we have experienced it 
in Quebec City.
<P>
	I am sure we will have ample opportunity to re-examine this 
issue in the coming months and to call upon the Liberal 
government to allocate the sums promised during the election 
campaign, but bearing in mind the real needs identified by local 
stakeholders.
<P>
	Aside from these major infrastructures, the constituency of 
Québec has a number of features that are not so well known to 
tourists and visitors. The riding takes in the most densely 
populated area in the region and as such, it is grappling with 
extensive social problems and with poverty.
<P>
	Large portions of Lower Town and one neighbourhood in 
Upper Town present all of the symptoms of social and economic 
decline, namely widespread unemployment, tenuous jobs, 
dependence on social assistance and a host of other human 
problems.
<P>
	Successive census figures show that the population of these 
neighbourhoods is decreasing. The average income of Lower 
Town residents in 1986 was $6,000 less than that of residents in 
the entire Quebec City area and in the entire province. The 
census also showed that in Quebec City in 1986, there was a 
difference of $7,000 in the average incomes of women and men.
<P>
	The poorer neighbourhoods in Quebec City and elsewhere are 
feeling the full effects of erratic and shortsighted government 
policies, against a backdrop of spiralling taxes, complete 
tolerance of smuggling activities and the ongoing shameless 
waste of public funds, as evidenced by the annual denunciations 
of the Auditor General.
<P>
	For members of the public forced to put up with service cuts 
and higher taxes, the price-quality ratio, as they say in 
economic circles, is slipping more and more.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, the women who live in some of the 
neighbourhoods in my riding, like women in other 
constituencies, experience a unique situation, one that puts them 
at a disadvantage. Now is the time to take a closer look at the 
broader issue of the status of women and to ask whether this is a 
priority for the government.
<P>
	This is the question that must be asked by women in Quebec 
and in Canada, given the threat of cuts to social programs. For a 
great many women, these social programs are the only safety net 
they have and the only way for them to make ends meet.
<P>
	A number of studies have brought to light the abject poverty 
in which women live every day. According to a study conducted 
by Health and Welfare Canada, in 1987, 63.6 per cent of 
single-parent families with preschoolers lived below the 
poverty line set by Statistics Canada. These figures alone 
illustrate the problems faced by many single mothers who 
account for 10.7 per cent of Canadian families and for 11.7 per 
cent of Quebec families.
<P>
	These are not just figures and statistics. We are talking about 
our sisters, our friends and our mothers.
<P>
	Even though poverty is not the sole cause of violence, a 
number of studies have shown a correlation between poverty and 
violence against women and children. My hon. colleagues in the 
Official Opposition will agree, as will the other hon. members of 
this House, that job creation-by this I mean real, sustainable, 
well paid jobs that contribute to the personal growth of 
workers-must be at the top of the government's list of 
priorities. A partnership must be forged with Quebec and the 
other provinces as well as with the private sector.
<P>
	Poverty and health problems go hand in hand. The more a 
family has to spend on housing, the less money it has for food, 
clothing and medicine. Statistics Canada reports that 57 per cent 
of single-parent families headed by women live in rental 
housing, whereas the same is true of only 37 per cent of men in 
the same situation. These figures cast poverty and housing 
problems in a decidedly feminine light.
<P>
	Poverty also means a lack of money for child care. One has 
often heard women earning the minimum wage lament the fact 
that it costs them more to work and pay child care than if they 
were to stay at home and collect social assistance or 
unemployment insurance. This is not laziness but a recognition 
of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="861"> 861 </A></B>
<P>
system's inability to provide child care services allowing 
women to join the  workforce, to ensure their personal growth, 
to upgrade their professional qualifications, in order to achieve 
financial independence and break the chains of dependency.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	Mothers who want to work or go back to school or, as the 
studies show, the large number of them who have no choice but 
to work outside the home, urgently need government support. 
They will then be able to go to work secure in the knowledge that 
their children are in good hands.
<P>
	It is difficult if not impossible in this debate to deal with all 
issues concerning women. We will limit ourselves to two 
aspects for now: child care and violence against women.
<P>
	Let us look first at the issue of child care. The former 
Conservative government had promised Quebecers and 
Canadians a national child care program that was supposed to 
create 400,000 new child care spaces. This project was 
abandoned in February 1992. According to a report by the 
Conseil de la famille du Québec, tabled in May 1993, the 
Quebec government reduced by $94 million the money it was 
supposed to invest in child care in the last three years.
<P>
	We also know that in 1988, according to the Canadian national 
child care study, more than 1,634,000 Canadian families needed 
child care services. In Quebec, 385,900 families would need 
such services for their pre-school and school age children.
<P>
	During the last election campaign, the Liberal Party promised 
to create 50,000 child care spaces in each year following a year 
of 3 per cent economic growth, up to a total of 150,000 spaces. 
Forty per cent of the costs would be paid by the federal 
government, another 40 per cent by the provinces, and the 
remaining 20 per cent by parents according to a sliding scale 
based on income. We find this economic growth-related 
restriction puzzling.
<P>
	There is a crying need for child care spaces. According to 
assessments by the Office de garde du Québec, these needs 
amounted to 201,310 spaces in 1988 compared with 130,713 
available spaces, leaving a gap of over 70,000 spaces.
<P>
	The federal government has always trodden very carefully on 
this issue. It makes promises and then backs off. Some women's 
organizations and child care associations want a national child 
care program. The Bloc Quebecois will not oppose the creation 
of a national child care program.
<P>
	We recognize that some provinces, because of their organic 
bond with federal institutions, may want a federally 
administered and regulated program.
<P>
	However, as far as Quebec is concerned, we are firmly against 
the federal government imposing on Quebec families a 
Canada-wide program with its own list of standards without 
concern for our needs or our economic, cultural and social 
situation.
<P>
	Our intention in this regard is clear. We are asking the federal 
government to transfer to the Quebec government its fair share 
of subsidies so that it can develop adequate child care services 
taking into account the welfare of children and the needs of 
parents. To us, the transfer to Quebec of all federal social and 
health program budgets is paramount.
<P>
	Many hon. members and ministers have stated that the 
government cannot put its fiscal house in order without cutting 
social programs since transfers to individuals and provinces 
account for over half of program spending.
<P>
	In our opinion, if the government intends to reassess, review, 
streamline, redesign or, in other words, cut social programs by 
dumping the deficit problem on Quebec and the other provinces, 
it is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	Before thinking of cutting social programs, the government 
would be well advised to cut defence spending, to save $1 billion 
in administrative costs, by giving the provinces sole jurisdiction 
in employment matters.
<P>
	We think that setting up a parliamentary committee to review 
spending in order to eliminate waste and duplication and reduce 
operating costs would be the best way to identify areas where 
there is still fat to be trimmed. We believe that the federal 
government must rationalize its own spending before reducing 
payments to those hit hardest by the serious economic problems.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	The Canada assistance plan is the program through which the 
federal government contributes 50 per cent of the social 
assistance provided by the provinces. This means that 50 per 
cent of what it costs Quebec to provide day care spaces, as well 
as tax exemptions and financial assistance for non-profit child 
care comes from this program.
<P>
	This program emphasizes the inefficiency of the cost-sharing 
formula which lacks incentives to improve financial 
management practices. Also, the rule of spending favours the 
have provinces. Because they have more tax resources to spend, 
they receive more federal funding.
<P>
	In the end, albeit in the short term, we believe that there is an 
urgent need to relax the eligibility requirements for tax 
exemptions and financial assistance to help low and 
middle-income families pay for child care services without 
having to cut back week after week on basic necessities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="862"> 862 </A></B>
<P>
	Now, we move on to the subject of violence against women in 
Quebec and in Canada. It has become such a widespread 
phenomenon that, even if it may sound redundant to quote more 
statistics, we feel the need to do so because the numbers speak 
for themselves.
<P>
	Half of all women in Canada have been victims of at least one 
act of violence since the age of 16. Some 25 per cent of all 
women in Canada have been abused by their present or previous 
partner. Six Canadian women out of ten who walk alone at night 
in their neighbourhoods have reported that they were either very 
or slightly afraid to do so.
<P>
	These few figures from Statistics Canada surveys on violence 
against women published in November 1993 draw an 
increasingly alarming picture of the situation faced by women in 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Clearly, violence has become a serious problem. Over the last 
decade, 600 children were killed in Canada. One third of these 
children were under one and 70 per cent were under five.
<P>
	From now on, family violence against women must be viewed 
in a broader context so as to include spouse abuse. Thanks to the 
tireless efforts of women's organizations such as rape crisis 
centres and other shelters, incest is no longer a subject discussed 
only behind closed doors. We think that the lack of financial 
support for these organizations is most unfortunate because it 
jeopardizes not only their very existence but also the delivery of 
first-line services to women whose lives, in many cases, are in 
constant danger.
<P>
	We also want to emphasize the needs of women from cultural 
communities, particularly newcomers, women with disabilities 
and seniors who are abused. Some women, often because of their 
greater vulnerability, urgently need support to break the code of 
silence that makes their situation so tragic.
<P>
	While we notice a certain shift in the attitudes and behaviour 
of our legal system towards victims of violence, recent events 
indicate that other challenges need to be met.
<P>
	In closing, I think that the need to alleviate the hardship of 
families and individuals in Quebec and Canada must be seen as 
an underlying principle in any review of social programs.
<P>
	To this end, it is imperative that the government curb the 
deficit and cut extravagant expenditures without social 
programs being affected. In fact, social programs are the only 
social security net we have as we face a sluggish economy that 
has shrunk as a result of the irresponsible management of 
federal funds and costly duplication.
<P>
	It is obvious that the government has not met the changing 
needs of our society, in particular with regard to child care. On 
behalf of all women, we ask that the condition put on investing 
in a child care program, which is dependent upon a yearly three 
per cent economic growth, be lifted. The government must 
release funds immediately and there should not be any 
constraints put on provinces that would rather set up their own 
program.
<P>
	To meet the needs of women, we must develop a joint strategy 
of adequate child care, decent and affordable housing, abuse 
control, job training and permanent employment. Women have 
been waiting for a very long time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have heard comments from the hon. member with respect to 
increasing spending on day care. One certainly cannot argue 
with that. As well we have heard discussions about not cutting 
social programs.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	At the end of her presentation the hon. member indicated that 
the deficit should be cut, after talking about increasing 
spending, not decreasing spending.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member is this. How does she 
believe that can be fulfilled, the cutting of the deficit without 
cutting spending, not expanding spending in other areas?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I talked about cutting the fat, but 
I also talked about increasing child care services to solve the 
problems that women go through every day when they want to 
go to work so that they can have some personal independence. I 
believe that the society which we represent here in this House 
urgently needs to think about child care services so that some 
women could be self-supporting. I am talking about cuts in 
government overspending. I think that women have waited long 
enough. Such cuts would really show the government's resolve 
to act quickly.
<P>
	They talk about 3 per cent economic growth before they can 
invest in child care services; this may mean putting it off 
indefinitely or at least until much later. Women have waited 
long enough and I think that this year we should do something 
for them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the hon. member for Quebec for the fine speech she made. 
However I found some inconsistencies in it.
<P>
	She stated it is completely unacceptable for the Canadian 
government to offload programs on to the provinces. At the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="863"> 863 </A></B>
<P>
same time she said the day care situation in Quebec will not be 
resolved unless the province of Quebec is left to do it on its own.
<P>
	I always wonder when I hear these types of statements where 
the money is magically going to come from. There seems to be 
some magical formula that is going to generate some money to 
pay for these programs if one level of government gets out of the 
act.
<P>
	We heard it the other day when the member for Lévis was 
talking about job creation: if the federal government got out of it 
there would be money to create all kinds of jobs.
<P>
	We heard it from the member for Gaspé. He said if the federal 
government got out of regulating the fish stocks there would be 
all kinds of fish in the Gulf of St. Lawrence to provide a 
livelihood for the fishermen there.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member for Quebec is this. How 
does she see the money being available to provide for the 
problems she has identified? Quebec is one of the provinces that 
receives money from the federal government under the 
equalization grants. By the federal government removing itself, 
how on earth is that going to create the money to resolve the 
problems she has identified?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of Quebec is 
asking for the transfers to be returned to Quebec so that it can 
manage its own child care programs. We give $28 billion to the 
federal government; this is our taxpayers' money. I think that it 
is better to have only one level of government managing. We 
must decentralize decision making. Child care services must be 
specific to the needs of each province.
<P>
	For the Government of Quebec, as with occupational training, 
it is the same situation dragging on. Quebec wants to run its own 
child care programs so that it can set its own standards. That is 
what we demand. So Quebec wants its fair share of the $28 
billion it gives to the federal government. That is only one of the 
issues.
<P>
	With regard to social housing, we know very well that Quebec 
is disadvantaged compared to Ontario, in terms of the fair share 
it should receive. I was looking at figures on social housing; we 
know that women are greatly affected by this program. In my 
riding, we have more than 4,900 single mothers and 4,300 of 
them are waiting for social housing.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	I have a letter from the president of CMHC, saying that 
construction of social housing has resumed but that Quebec is 
behind in this new start-up of social housing. If we go through it 
issue by issue I think it is a good reflection of the Quebec reality. 
We have come here to talk about this reality; it is part of my 
mandate to explain in this House the realities that people in my 
riding live with. Child care services and social housing are two 
issues that I care very much about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize that there 
will be some rather interesting debates in this House. The 
comments made by the members representing Quebec are 
sometimes understood, and sometimes not so well understood. 
However, I must say that this morning I was touched by the 
speech of my colleague representing the riding of Québec, 
because I think it is the first time that we hear a member who 
knows what she is talking about. My colleague represents 
Quebecers as well as the women of Canada and Quebec, and she 
reminded this House of the numerous electoral promises which 
were made.
<P>
	Earlier, we pointed out that when members from Quebec rise 
in this House, some think that every issue affecting Quebec can 
be solved. We invite those people to come to see us and listen to 
us. When the hon. member for Québec said that we must invest 
instead of talking about spending-because sometimes we talk 
about spending even though it is not the case- when she 
mentions investing in daycare facilities, she means that the 
government must invest in Quebec and Canadian families. In 
that regard, I urge the members in this House to reread <I>Hansard</I> 
in order to better understand the messages sent, since the 
language barrier seems to prevent us from being well 
understood.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wanted to create a sense of 
awareness. Very little is said about the situation of women. It is 
always a somewhat sensitive issue and I wanted to make 
members from both sides of the House aware of the claims made 
by women, and also convince them to be very receptive to those 
claims. I know that we are going through a period of austerity 
which affects all of Canada, including Quebec, but let us not 
forget that women have been waiting for a long time. There are 
many working women, but they need concrete support from the 
governments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have heard many fine suggestions from all sides of the House 
during this debate and I would like, if I may, to approach the 
matter from a slightly different angle.
<P>
	We have been told many times and it has been expressed in 
many different ways that now is the hour of revision. We must 
examine the old ways and find new ones if we are to live within 
our means and still provide for the needy in society. We can 
never abandon those who need help. We must reduce our 
spending while preserving those social programs that have made 
Canada the envy of the world.
<P>
	I do not believe we have to slash and burn. I believe we can 
retain the essentials right across the board if we define a new 
understanding between government and many of the special 
interest organizations that receive public funds. If those who can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="864"> 864 </A></B>
<P>
take less were to do so there would be more for government to 
give where the need is greatest.
<P>
	I have the opportunity to examine the published public 
accounts between 1991 and 1993. I have been singularly 
impressed by the way in which previous governments have 
financially supported all manner of worthy organizations, 
especially those specifically constituted to promoting specific 
causes such as organizations to preserve French outside Quebec, 
organizations to preserve English in Quebec, to further labour 
education, to raise the profile of women, to argue the dangers of 
smoking, to advance the cause of day care, to preserve minority 
cultures. The list is long for the worthy causes are many.
<P>
	The difficulty is that most of these organizations rely on the 
federal government for funding, $50,000 here, $20,000 there, 
$30,000 here, $40,000 there. The money spent viewed across 
many ministries runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Let me give some examples. Understand that in doing so, I do 
not mean to disparage the organizations mentioned. All have 
valid messages. All have enormous commitment. All have 
hundreds, thousands, even millions of supporters.
<P>
	Last year the Canadian Labour Congress received $4 million 
to further labour education. Other labour union groups received 
an additional $3 million for the same purpose. Meanwhile, to be 
entirely fair, the national headquarters of the Chamber of 
Commerce received $1.6 million. In every instance it is a lot of 
money. The point is the CLC, the other unions and the Chamber 
of Commerce have large paying memberships which believe in 
what these organizations stand for. It cannot but strike one as 
odd that the taxpayer is also supporting them.
<P>
	The National Action Committee for the Status of Women also 
has incredible support, millions of supporters. It receives 
$300,000 in federal money with another $700,000 going to 
regional and provincial affiliates. This too is a lot of money. By 
way of contrast, the Girl Guides of Canada received $15,000, 
one of the lowest awards of hundreds.
<P>
	Another example is the Smoking and Health Action 
Foundation, one of the most prominent anti-smoking lobbies in 
Canada, received $415,000 in federal and provincial grants. It 
received nothing from members. It did, however, pay $400,821 
in salary and benefits to its eight full-time staff members. It is a 
generous employer.
<P>
	My question is if an organization has broad grass roots 
support why does it not rely on that support financially? Why 
does it not appeal to the people who share its ideals to give a 
dime or a dollar?
<P>
	The girl guides sell cookies, churches pass plates, political 
parties have fund raising barbecues and dinners. It would be a 
scandal for sure if the hon. members of the Bloc required federal 
money to finance their agenda of separatism. Are they any less 
idealistic, less motivated than the many other advocacy and 
special interest organizations that now receive public money?
<P>
	There are hundreds of organizations, large and small, taking 
from the taxpayer when they could be, possibly they should be, 
raising all the money they need by themselves. My challenge to 
these organizations is turn your back on government funding. 
Prove to Canadians that your issues are so strong, so vital that 
like-minded people will get behind all your programs and they 
will spare that dime, they will spare that dollar.
<P>
	The reality of today is government's cannot afford to finance 
organizations that should be able to finance themselves. We 
must spend on those individuals who are most in need, those 
who do not fall into some convenient catch word, those who are 
without strong voices and yet who are crying for help, the poor 
or the young, the tens of thousands under the age of 25 who are 
without jobs and with no prospects. We need to save money to 
save them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was surprised by some aspects of the hon. member's 
speech. For instance, he used the word separatist instead of 
using the term sovereigntist. I suppose he is unaware of the fact 
that in international law and political science, the term 
sovereigntist should be used. There is no such thing as a 
separatist doctrine in international law, but that is not my main 
objection, and I imagine he can always read up on the subject.
<P>
	What surprised me most was that he challenged the Bloc's 
eligibility for funding on the same basis as other political 
parties.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member should realize that Quebecers pay taxes like 
anyone else. This is what more experienced colleagues in the 
hon. member's own party realized when they decided the Bloc 
was entitled to have Parliament pay their legal fees in the 
lawsuit brought against them by a Mr. Aaron. The hon. 
member's colleagues are apparently more democratic in outlook 
than he seems to be.
<P>
	Finally, the hon. member may or may not know that the 
Quebec Elections Act says that only individuals may finance 
political parties. Now that is democratic legislation and it is a 
legacy of a sovereigntist party in Quebec. And I would ask the 
hon. member whether, for the sake of the image of politicians 
and so people will realize that integrity does exist in politics, it 
would not be better for Parliament to pass legislation providing 
for grassroots financing of political parties instead of 
fund-raising dinners at $1,000 a plate at the Laurier Club, a 
Liberal club, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="865"> 865 </A></B>
<P>
or taking donations from the  wealthy who often have access to 
family trusts which his government is reluctant to tax. I would 
appreciate the hon. member's thoughts on the matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess my speech was not as good 
as I thought. Obviously a point has been missed here.
<P>
	I did not mean to suggest there is something wrong with the 
method of Bloc fund raising. I meant to suggest that all political 
parties should receive support from the people, from their 
constituents, not from government. We would have a very 
incestuous relationship if the Liberal government were to be 
financing the Bloc at this time or the Parti Quebecois.
<P>
	I must add further that the choice of the word separatism as 
opposed to sovereignty was a deliberate choice on my part. I 
actually did consider that very carefully because I am aware of 
the distinction and the distinction in the eyes of the Bloc, but I 
have to say that most Canadians they see the separatism rather 
than sovereignty. I am sorry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to compliment the hon. member on his speech. There 
are many things in his speech that I certainly subscribe to and 
many Reformers do as well.
<P>
	There are a lot of organizations in this country receiving 
grants well in excess of what they should be. Perhaps by 
listening to such a speech there is a lot of room for reconciliation 
among parties in today's Parliament in trying to curb this kind of 
thing and spend money in the right places. Perhaps in the next 
four years we shall see, maybe the House of Commons will be 
very much together on that issue.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member how he would define 
slash and burn of social programs since it was mentioned once if 
not twice in his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think I can answer that very 
simply. Slash and burn is when the cutting of social programs 
leads only with the mind, only with head, and forgets the heart. 
We must remember the heart.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member said in his speech that people should live within their 
means. Does that mean people who have little or no resources do 
not have the right to live? To hear some members of this House, 
you would think there were no poor people in Canada. I think we 
should not introduce reforms at the expense of the neediest in 
this country, and I would ask the hon. member to give us his 
views on the subject.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think we are beginning the 
reform on the backs of the disadvantaged. The direction of my 
speech was to ask that those who are able to take care of 
themselves should look after themselves and raise their own 
money. I think that applies right across the board. Those who are 
not in need need not be helped but we have to help those who are 
in need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased that we are able to have this type of a debate on such a 
major item as social policy reform in Canada. It is time we sat 
down and recognized where we have come from and the 
evolution of social policy in this country.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Most of the social programs and policies we have today which 
make us distinctly different from almost every country in the 
world have come about because of Liberal policies. In the past, 
Liberals, as a government and a country that is liberal, we 
believed in the collective ownership of the resource that is 
Canada. We believed fundamentally that it did not matter where 
we lived, in Alberta, northern Ontario, Newfoundland or in 
Ottawa, somehow we had a right to expect to share in the 
greatness and the wealth that is Canada.
<P>
	We have developed a lot differently than our counterparts to 
the south. We believe in a free market system but we also believe 
that the state has a responsibility to redistribute wealth. We 
believe in a free market society but there are larger overriding 
priorities of our society than the accumulation of personal 
wealth. It is why we are different. It is why we have developed 
differently. We manifest our beliefs in social programs that 
make us the envy of the world.
<P>
	We believe that nobody should have to live in poverty in a 
country as rich, as prosperous, with the future that Canada has. 
We believe as a nation that those individuals who are elected to 
govern should be able to find a policy mechanism to ensure that 
nobody should have to worry about whether they have food on 
their tables when they retire, when they are old and in their 
twilight years.
<P>
	We believe we can come up with programs to deliver these 
policies to ensure that no matter where we live we have a right to 
expect quality health care that was accessible to everybody free 
of charge.
<P>
	The federal government put in policies which by and large 
worked very well. Those policies ensured that in time of 
economic collapse or dislocation nobody starved to death. It 
made sure that we somehow allowed the free market system to 
work but at the same time discharged its collective social 
responsibility.
<P>
	Times have changed. We find ourselves in a situation where 
government is no longer able to deliver these principles in the 
same way. Some people, such as my colleagues in the Reform 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="866"> 866 </A></B>
<P>
Party, might say the principles  are no longer valid. I would 
disagree with them strongly. What may no longer be valid are 
the delivery mechanisms that have been put in place. They may 
not be delivering the programs as efficiently as we might like. In 
fact, to argue that the vehicles must be maintained may 
jeopardize the principles and the programs.
<P>
	This is not just a Liberal philosophy. It is, I believe, a 
fundamental characteristic of Canadian society. It is part of the 
fabric of this country. Who better to redesign the social safety 
network than the party that put it together in the first place, the 
Liberal Party. Who better at this point in our history to reach out 
and start it here than this new Liberal government.
<P>
	We have sought input and debate from all sides of the House. 
However there are certain things we have to remember in the 
debate. It is very easy if we are just looking at the fiscal concerns 
of the state. It is very easy to get rid of the deficit. I listened to 
my Reform colleagues opposite during the campaign and they 
presented through their leader and their candidates a way to get 
rid of the deficit in three years. I could get rid of the deficit in 12 
months, but it would be a vastly different Canada.
<P>
	It would mean that the poor and the disenfranchised would be 
living in parks like they do in the United States. I am sorry but 
that is not the type of Canada I was born in and that is not the 
type of Canada I am going to work toward. It means that 
transfers to the poorest provinces would be cut, such as to Nova 
Scotia, Newfoundland and Saskatchewan. We can say: ``Well, 
we have done our bit as federal legislators. We have done our bit 
to reduce the deficit''. However, the human carnage that would 
remain after those actions would be unconscionable and 
unacceptable. So we are not going to follow the Reform pattern 
of slash and burn on social programs.
<P>
	As a government we want to have a full debate about what 
principles of social justice we believe are still applicable and 
whether we can develop the vehicles to deliver that social justice 
through programming.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to remember a number of things. One is that even in 
the wealthiest country in the world, and the country that the UN 
says is the best country in the world to live in, in spite of the 
multi-layered social programs that we have across Canada, we 
have over 1.5 million children who live in poverty. Obviously 
the programs and the goals we set out through our program 
structure has not hit the mark. The country has changed. Things 
have changed forever. We can no longer protect certain 
industries. We are into the globalization of trade.
<P>
	We have to get back to the basics. If we still believe in the 
principles that I talked about at the beginning of my address, 
that of collective ownership of the resource and of social 
responsibility, then we will start from that basis and rebuild a 
social services delivery system, one that will have excised from 
it the abuses, or as much as one can  excise from it, and one that 
ensures at all times we look at the dignity of the individual.
<P>
	I cannot think of anything more undignified than somebody 
who has to live on welfare. I cannot think of anything as 
undignified as a man or a woman who has to go to bed knowing 
there is no food for their children to eat the next morning before 
they send them off to school. I do not think that is what we want 
as Canadians no matter what our political beliefs may be.
<P>
	It is time to sit down and re-establish those fundamental 
principles. Maybe we will find they are not going to be vastly 
different from the principles that were laid down by this party 
after the Kingston conference in the Pearson era. We will 
probably find the fundamental principles of liberalism are still a 
basis on which to build. We will invite people from across this 
country, of various political beliefs, to help ensure that the 
systems brought forward deliver the type of assistance to those 
who need it the most in a way that is not a hand out but is a hand 
up.
<P>
	Single parents in our ridings are coming in and saying: 
``Look, I am receiving $828 a month on welfare and I don't feel 
good about it. I feel kind of soiled. I want to contribute. I don't 
want to be a burden on society. But the circumstance I find 
myself in right now is one that I have had to go to a social service 
department''. They then tell us that they want to work but the 
only job they can find pays $6 an hour. If they work for $6 an 
hour and have to pay child care costs out of it then effectively 
they have lost $200 to $300 of an $850 income. Those are the 
realities of the circumstances that are out there today and they 
have to be addressed. I believe we can do this together 
collectively.
<P>
	It is important, however, to remember a couple of things. We 
have created a multi-layered bureaucracy to deliver the dollar. 
By the time I go to one member and take a dollar out of his or her 
pocket, run it through the system and then drop it back down to 
the individual, the individual who needs the hand-up not the 
hand-out, there is not enough money to do anything but keep 
them on welfare and stuck in the cycle of poverty.
<P>
	Somebody somewhere has to be paid to take the money, to 
process the money, to drop it down to a program directorate, 
down to the province and down to the municipality. We have 
three levels of government taking that $1 and leaving as much as 
possible intact to deliver some assistance to somebody who 
needs at that moment. We have to look at that. We have to take a 
very strong lead, in my view, in trying to ensure that the dollars 
are not spent administering the program but the dollars are spent 
on a well thought out program that will allow people to maintain 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="867"> 867 </A></B>
<P>
their dignity, to retrain if necessary, to give the type of support 
so they become a taxpayer instead of a tax taker.
<P>
	I am intrigued, and have been for years, with a proposal that 
has been put forward by my colleague from 
Broadview-Greenwood. He has put a lot of thought into it. I 
have polled my constituents on it over the last number of years. 
It is called a single tax system. It seeks to address the real 
problems in this country. The problem is not just expenditure, it 
is also revenue generation. Unless we address both problems in 
tandem we still have a big problem.
<P>
	To say we have economic problems because too many people 
are ripping the system off through social programs is wrong. I 
have addressed that. However, to turn a blind eye to the fact that 
we now have a growing underground economy and a tax system 
that simply does not work because it does not generate enough 
revenue, in a way that it is not a disincentive to industrial 
development and wealth creation, is wrong as well.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	In the proposal put forward by my colleague from 
Broadview-Greenwood we looked at a number of ways to have 
a single layer of delivery so that those who need assistance the 
most get the most assistance with a properly thought out 
program to raise them up and reintegrate them into the 
workforce and allow them become productive.
<P>
	I have never met an individual who wanted to be on welfare. I 
have never met an individual who wanted to be poor. I have 
never met an individual who wanted to feel they could not give 
their children the basics of life. I simply have not met them and I 
have met a lot of people in my life.
<P>
	This is an ideal opportunity for us to be bold, to go back to the 
principles that have made this country great, but also to allow in 
this debate a broader application of how we deliver our 
programs. I firmly believe that the proposal put forward by my 
colleague from Broadview-Greenwood on the single tax has 
some merits about how we can deliver on a single tier, how we 
can cut out layers and layers of government and bureaucracy so 
that the limited dollars that come from the same source called 
the taxpayer are focused and targeted to achieve the social and 
economic benefits on which I think all members of this House 
would agree.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I would like to ask for unanimous consent to sit through 
the lunch hour in order to listen to as many speakers as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
suggestion that we sit through the lunch period. Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the member on his election. I also would like to 
congratulate the people of his riding for electing him. He made a 
speech this morning which is very pertinent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This speech is quite consistent with the expectations of my 
party, the Bloc Quebecois. He gave us his point of view very 
eloquently, and I would like to ask him a question. Does he agree 
that the reform we are about to undertake should not affect 
disadvantaged people in our society?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for 
his complimentary comments.
<P>
	I fundamentally believe that. We have to be very careful in 
this country.
<P>
	The poor and the disenfranchised, and that includes regions 
not just individuals, are all too often easiest hit when it comes 
time for government to redirect finances or to cut program 
expenditures.
<P>
	I always believed in opposition and I will continue to believe 
it in government that the role of individual members of 
Parliament is to speak up for those that lack a voice.
<P>
	When necessary cuts come forward the debate will continue I 
hope about who bears which part of the burden of those cuts. We 
can speak here for decades about who caused what to happen. 
The reality is that our present circumstances must be addressed.
<P>
	I believe that any cuts in budgets, any reworking of the social 
safety net must first and foremost look after the needs of the 
most disadvantaged in society but also the disadvantaged 
provinces like Nova Scotia and Quebec that have to rely on 
equalization payments from the federal government 
unfortunately.
<P>
	We all want to contribute. We do not want policies from any 
level of government that stop our individual citizens and our 
provinces from developing to the fullness of their potential. 
That really is the challenge of government after all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested in the comments of the hon. member for Dartmouth. I 
think we have a socialist in Liberal clothing over there. He talks 
about his belief in the state's responsibility to redistribute 
wealth. Those are the policies of my friends and colleagues who 
sit behind me as independents because their party was 
annihilated during the last election.
<P>
	He talks about the redistribution of wealth and the social 
programs of which the Liberal Party is so proud. Let us 
remember that these programs were introduced back in the 
Liberal era of Pierre Trudeau and the just society, at which time 
he borrowed money and put this country in the position we are in 
today 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="868"> 868 </A></B>
<P>
to pay for these  social programs. He redistributed wealth to 
everyone whether they needed it or not.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	We can take, for example, senior citizens. The ex-leader of 
the Liberal party, the right hon. Pierre Trudeau, is receiving the 
old age security even though he is reputed to be a millionaire. Is 
that the idea of redistributing wealth of the hon. member for 
Dartmouth?
<P>
	He mentions the fact that government can no longer deliver 
these programs. My suggestion to the hon. member is that we 
should be looking at social programs which direct the money to 
those in need, the poor in this country. We should not be making 
general sweeping blanket statements of redistributing wealth to 
all those who fall into any particular category as defined by the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> I am happy that the hon. 
member has asked the question.
<P>
	If I listen to the policies of the Reform Party it does not 
believe that government should try as part of a national 
objective to ensure that no matter where one lives in this country 
that one has access to quality post-secondary education. 
Perhaps many members on the Reform side, if those policies and 
programs were not in place, would not have been able to attain 
the seats that they have. They would not have been able to find 
themselves in a position to get the education that has allowed 
them to work in their communities and to find a seat in this 
House.
<P>
	Just maybe, without those darned Liberal policies that the 
member seems to be so intent on criticizing during this debate, 
some individuals would not have been able to access a health 
care system that ensures that people do not go bankrupt if they 
have a ruptured gall bladder in this country.
<P>
	Just maybe, if the members of the Reform Party are so intent 
on supporting a system where there is no sense of collective 
ownership of wealth in this country, then some of their 
colleagues from Saskatchewan and some of their colleagues 
from the other provinces in western Canada would not have been 
able to get the basic services delivered to them in their home 
province that Canadians and members of the Reform Party have 
come to expect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
extend to you belated congratulations on your appointment to 
the Speaker's chair. I wish you well as you and your colleagues 
guide the debate in this, the highest tribunal in the land.
<P>
	I thank the people of Yellowhead for their support on October 
25. I will endeavour to serve my constituents well.
<P>
	In my comments I will be touching on two matters: first, a few 
observations about the riding I am privileged to represent; and, 
second, I will attempt to show what happened to countries that 
have attempted to spend themselves into prosperity. If we do not 
bring spending under control in this country, be it social or other 
spending, we may well find ourselves going down the same 
road.
<P>
	First, I have a few comments on my riding. Yellowhead is a 
huge riding, the third largest federal riding in Alberta. It is 
interesting to note that geographically the configuration of 
Yellowhead is similar to that of the state of Texas. In addition, 
both are rich in oil and beef cattle.
<P>
	Yellowhead also has huge deposits of gas and coal and an 
active forest industry.
<P>
	Nestled in the Rocky Mountains is the jewel of the Rockies, 
Jasper. Our nation's most spectacular park, Jasper National 
Park, attracts tourists from around the world every day of the 
year.
<P>
	The 90,000 plus people who live within the borders of 
Yellowhead are generally an independent lot. Business deals are 
still clinched with a handshake as entrepreneurs engage in the 
time proven activity of human endeavour, the free enterprise 
system. In general, unemployment is not the concern that it is in 
other parts of the country.
<P>
	I am at once proud and humbled in the opportunity to 
represent and serve these people in this place. These folks are 
saying to me, as other Canadians are saying to their elected 
people, that enough is enough; enough spending on programs 
they do not want, they did not ask for and certainly do not want 
to pay for. Increasingly, people are realizing that government 
spending is taking us all down a dead end road to the precipice, 
to the brink. The brakes must be applied so that this nation can 
edge back from the brink of economic disaster.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	I commend the government for this social affairs debate. I am 
confident that it will seriously consider suggestions made in this 
House and elsewhere when the restructuring of these programs 
begin.
<P>
	Overspending is not just a phenomenon of the 20th century. 
For centuries countries have overspent. History is littered with 
examples of great empires that have been reduced to shadows of 
their former greatness.
<P>
	For centuries, economists, historians and observers have 
documented what causes dominant countries to experience 
economic decline. We need not go back to ancient civilizations, 
to antiquity for examples. We only need to go back to the early 
modern period, to the time of the gun powder revolution which 
set in motion some of the more profound changes in modern 
history.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="869"> 869 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no better example of a nation that underwent an 
economic crisis by spending itself into oblivion than Spain 
itself, the great power of the early modern period.
<P>
	Leadership of the Spanish government was dominated by out 
of control spending on the military, the bureaucracy, the church 
and the nobility. Today in Canada, the tax consuming interests 
find their equivalent in big government as well as transfer 
payments and subsidies to businesses whether they are private 
or crown corporations. Long after it became obvious that the 
Spanish economy was in trouble, Spain's leaders resisted every 
effort to cut costs.
<P>
	Like many American and Canadian politicians today they 
could not believe that the money would ever run out. Each new 
setback to the economy was treated as an occasion to launch a 
brand new program. Taxes were tripled between the years 1556 
and 1577. The great country of Spain descended into bankruptcy 
and has not really recovered.
<P>
	Holland which escaped Spanish rule followed a similar 
pattern of decline. The historian Jan de Vries wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Increased costs, particularly in the last third of the 17th century, robbed 
Dutch trade of its dynamism.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That observation should ring familiar as should another. I 
continue quoting:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And as so often happens in societies when new conditions threaten their 
leadership, an inflexibility permeated Dutch institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As Holland went into decline, Great Britain ascended to 
global dominance. After two centuries at the pinnacle of the 
world economy this empire too went into decline. British 
leaders like the Spanish and Dutch before them responded to the 
crisis not by cutting costs but by proposing new expensive 
spending ideas. As a result taxes and spending increased 
dramatically.
<P>
	As he watched his beloved country facing ruin, Winston 
Churchill observed:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have watched this famous island descending incontinently, fecklessly, the 
stairway which leads to a dark gulf. It is a fine broad stairway at the beginning, 
but after a bit the carpet ends. A little further on there are our only flagstones, 
and a little further on still even these break beneath your feet.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	After World War II the country that exceeded any other 
country in the world by any measurement rose to unprecedented 
heights in terms of economic and military might.
<P>
	The superpower age was thrust upon the world with the United 
States leading the way. After almost half a century of 
unparalleled economic growth and world leadership, America 
now is showing symptoms of decline. These are high taxes, high 
prices, high budget deficits, a rapidly increasing crime rate, 
strong special interest groups, failures in motivation, a decline 
in education and everyday competence, a high tendency to 
import, moral breakdown, loss of civic spirit and an increasing 
diversion of energies to non-productive pursuits.
<P>
	Is Canada showing similar symptoms? The question begs the 
answer.
<P>
	Thousands of people, business people and professionals, are 
putting forth their ideas to bring our financial house in order. 
Perhaps more important, there are millions of Canadians, 
ordinary people who get up each morning and go to their 
respective places of work. They are the people who carefully 
and prudently manage the affairs of their households and 
communities, who pay the bills, who pay to all levels of 
government. After all, there really is only one taxpayer. These 
Canadians in a growing tide are asking governments to take bold 
action.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	My home province of Alberta is once again leading the way as 
it has done in the past. Alberta's provincial government, to its 
credit, has recognized the folly of uncontrolled spending and 
program proliferation. Alberta is taking action now. Yes, there is 
and there will continue to be some pain as adjustments are made. 
As expected the special interest groups are protesting. As 
Margaret Thatcher observed a few years ago, they have the usual 
socialist disease. They are running out of other people's money. 
However the majority of Albertans, the people who pay the bills, 
agree that excessive spending had to stop.
<P>
	A new Parliament represents a golden opportunity to change 
the way things are done. Now is the time to act. We must priorize 
spending to save our social programs.
<P>
	I will close with this. For all the problems we face I believe 
this is the greatest country in the world, but let us keep it that 
way. By getting our spending under control, not only for our 
generation, but for our children and our children's children.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
find the history lesson from the member opposite quite 
interesting. I must say that as a history lesson it is intriguing, but 
I do not see how the dying days of imperialistic England have 
had anything to do with the current modern economies, quite 
frankly. I think that imperialism was dying nonetheless because 
what people were saying was a whole other issue. The hon. 
member is comparing apples and oranges, with all due respect.
<P>
	I quite often hear the members opposite talk constantly about 
giving money only to those in need. Who are they? Every time I 
read something or I hear the members of the Reform Party refer 
to that quite often I come away with the feeling that means 
giving alms to the poorest of the poor and forgetting the rest.
<P>
	We have just heard a very eloquent presentation in this House 
from the member of the Bloc party just recently on the issues of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="870"> 870 </A></B>
<P>
women which I support whole-heartedly as someone who has 
worked in this area for quite some time.
<P>
	I want to ask the member if he could at the very least help me 
understand what his party really does mean by those in need. 
How would the member define those in need?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member opposite for the question.
<P>
	I think I can safely say that there is no member of the Reform 
Party, let alone the Reform caucus, that would not deny 
assistance to anyone who really deserves assistance. However 
there are billions of dollars going to wealthy people, people who 
are making above average incomes. It is those people from 
whom we feel that payment should be withdrawn.
<P>
	For example, the Fraser Institute and economists from all 
over have shown studies that 30 per cent of wealthy people 
receive 30 to 40 per cent of government assistance. That just is 
not fair. It is not fair to those millions of average Canadians who 
are earning $20,000, $30,000 or $40,000 a year. It is not fair that 
the tax dollars that these people pay, and God knows they are 
paying enough, go to people in this upper strata.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to acknowledge the point that the debater makes. I too share 
his concerns with government spending. I share his concerns 
with making sure that government programs fall on those who 
are most in need.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to ask him if he is familiar with a little bit of 
history called the depression of the 1930s in which the economy 
settled in to a long and profound period of contraction, serious 
unemployment and serious poverty. The great thinker John 
Maynard Keynes pointed out that this equilibrium had huge 
numbers of people suffering through no fault of their own, much 
like the recessions that we have had since and that it required 
government spending to increase aggregate demand and thereby 
increase employment numbers.
<P>
	If we were to cut spending the way the Reform Party has said 
we should, balance the budget within three years, would that not 
make a bad situation worse by cutting aggregate demand and 
increasing unemployment and increasing poverty and thereby 
making the situation much more difficult than it is already?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for the question. We have to remember that the 
depression occurred during a time when there was not the 
government involvement in the economies that there is today. 
Things went relatively quickly once the crash occurred.
<P>
	All we are doing today by this overspending is 
procrastinating. We are charging it to the future. I suspect, and 
there are economists that say this as well, that when that day 
comes when we cannot spend anymore and when foreign lenders 
will not lend us money anymore, what happened in New Zealand 
will also happen in this country. We certainly do not want to  see 
that. That is why we say we have to stop spending now and 
prioritize spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, I might say in 
the beginning that embarking on this major comprehensive 
change to the social safety net is a bold and much needed move 
by the new government. I pleased with the process that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has established 
which will involve people in terms of those discussions.
<P>
	As well I might point out that in this initiative, along with the 
first budget of the new Liberal government, we must 
demonstrate to all Canadians this is a new government with a 
new agenda which places jobs and opportunities for all 
Canadians first and foremost.
<P>
	While taking control over the deficit and debt is critical, we 
must not fall victim to the neo-conservative obsession of the 
past nine years which has directly contributed to the current 
crisis in Canada in terms of job losses, social unrest, increased 
poverty and disillusionment throughout the country.
<P>
	It will be important for this government to outline to 
Canadians the limits within which we as government can work 
with respect to developing new made in and for Canada 
economic and social policies, especially so given the various 
trade agreements in which we now find ourselves.
<P>
	For example, we have to address the issue in the very near 
future of the kind of federal provincial transfer system which 
will provide the critical social infrastructures for most 
provinces. As a nation and as a government we must ensure that 
all Canadians have equal access to programs under those 
economic and social policies that we implement.
<P>
	Professor Tom Courchesne, a proponent of free trade, pointed 
out that an east-west transfer system does not square well with 
north-south economic integration. If Courchesne is correct, the 
future of our ability to provide for the means of our critical 
social programs throughout Canada could be at risk.
<P>
	Our economy is still having to adjust to the Canada-United 
States Free Trade Agreement and is now faced with both NAFTA 
and GATT. Canadians do not want this government to merely 
administer trade policies negotiated by the previous 
government, they want a proactive government which will 
ensure that policies emerging from these trade deals reflect 
Canadian needs, not just the economic and foreign interests of 
our neighbour to the south.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has stated clearly that he will operate on 
these deals in the interests of Canadians.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="871"> 871 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	As members in this House, we must be forever vigilant that 
economic trade agreements do not force us to the lowest 
common denominators in social programs under the guise of 
economic competition. We must work toward bringing up the 
social, labour and environmental standards of the United States 
and Mexico, our trading partners, and not buckle under to the 
pressure of reducing our own programs.
<P>
	Let me turn for a moment to what is perhaps one of the 
greatest social tragedies in this country over the last nine to 
twelve years, the farm financial crisis.
<P>
	I want to try and put that in some kind of context in terms of 
where we are coming from and where we are going and what we 
have to do to offer some hope for the future.
<P>
	I maintain it is a real serious social tragedy in our rural areas. 
The farm crisis, to a great extent for political and global trade 
reasons, has become accepted to a great extent around the world. 
It has become almost normal in our society to hear of farmers 
going broke and governments really not doing much about it. 
This acceptance ignores the reality in personal terms in which 
farmers and farm families and farm communities find 
themselves.
<P>
	Let me put that into perspective. In 1988, after eight years of 
farm crisis in this country, the House of Commons in its 
agricultural committee report talked about a debt of $22 billion. 
After implementing the Farm Debt Review Board, farm 
adjustment program and other subsidies, in 1992 we found 
ourselves after the loss of thousands of farmers still in debt to 
the tune of $23.9 billion.
<P>
	How serious is this? It is very serious. It means that if we were 
farmers in this room, if you looked one person to your left and 
one person to your right, one of you would be in serious 
financial trouble, faced with the possibility of losing your farm. 
That is the kind of situation we find ourselves in today.
<P>
	In my province of Prince Edward Island in 1991, according to 
census figures, we had 2,361 farmers, a decline of 16.7 per cent 
since 1986 and a 48 per cent decline of farmers since 1971. Are 
we any better off today because we have lost these farmers? No, 
we are not. We have deteriorating communities, a deteriorating 
base on which to base community programs, rinks, social 
affairs, educational systems and so on, a very serious matter.
<P>
	How do we put a human face on these figures in terms of 
social problems? It is an issue that you really cannot understand 
unless you have experienced it. I call it economic violence, a 
loss of pride in terms of those farmers affected, a feeling of 
failure, increasing farm suicides, increasing family split-ups as 
a result of this very serious economic problem at the farm gate.
<P>
	Even with these facts and figures we continue to see over the 
last nine years, coming out of Agriculture Canada and the 
Government of Canada, an acceptance that we must follow the 
trend that the market should make all decisions. We are seeing 
that increasingly so in the new era of globalization.
<P>
	There are some who would say on the other side of the House 
that the free market should decide all things. I disagree very 
strongly with that and I hope we do as a government.
<P>
	Some people will say let us be competitive. Let us look a little 
deeper into this competitive approach for a moment. What is the 
nature of competition? Basically, the nature of competition is 
that you get into an economic game and your objective is to 
destroy the competitor. In the current kind of trade and 
economic policy that we are moving toward in terms of these 
globalized trade agreements, the object of the game is to pit 
farmer against farmer in communities, between countries, 
between provinces, across borders, in a game of trying to lower 
your prices in order to access the market and in the process 
destroy that farmer in that other area.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	That is not the answer. We must move forward with economic 
and social programs that bring in regulatory control, put in place 
marketing programs like the Canadian Dairy Commission, the 
Poultry Marketing Board, the Canadian Wheat Board, to 
implement agricultural policy in the interests of rural Canada 
and farmers.
<P>
	The approach that has been going on for the last nine or ten 
years is leading to greater and greater exploitation and I believe 
to competitive poverty.
<P>
	I do not believe it has to be this way. We must restore, as a new 
government, a sense of direction and a sense of purpose. As I 
mentioned a moment ago, we can introduce marketing 
programs. We can, through our power as a federal government, 
expand and strengthen farm debt review boards to deal with 
these cases that are in serious financial trouble.
<P>
	This is one member who is going to work toward those 
objectives.
<P>
	I do not believe we can allow the pressure to adapt and adjust 
to the blind blameless free market on a global basis to deter us 
from doing what is right in terms of the social and economic 
future of rural Canada and Canadians.
<P>
	There are a number of other areas that I had hoped to speak on 
for a moment but I see that I am out of time so I will sit down and 
receive questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the hon. member for bringing up farming in 
relation to social support programs. As the member may know, I 
am originally from New Zealand where farmers were heavily 
subsidized to grow things like  fat lambs and all sorts of products 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="872"> 872 </A></B>
<P>
that the world did not really need. Huge stocks of butter and 
lamb were put away in freezers for years and years.
<P>
	As the member may also know, in New Zealand when there 
was a sudden debt crisis the subsidies ended rather abruptly, 
putting farmers on the same basis as other businesses. After all, 
farms are businesses.
<P>
	I would like to give the member an example so that I can ask 
him a question. In New Zealand when the subsidies ended a lot 
of farmers initially went broke. It created a whole new climate 
for farming in which there had to be creativity and a look at 
where the market really should be.
<P>
	All of the beans for beans and pork had been imported from 
the United States since the beginning of time. No one in New 
Zealand grew beans for baked beans. Today, because of the loss 
of subsidies and new creativity, New Zealand has become an 
exporting nation of beans to Australia and back to the United 
States.
<P>
	There are more farmers in business today in New Zealand 
making more money than they ever did under the subsidy 
programs. I would like to ask the member if he agrees that there 
needs to be some responsibility taken by the farmers to look for 
new markets and new opportunities in new products instead of 
always relying on the government to bail them out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question. I happened to be in New Zealand when the value added 
tax was brought in and I saw first hand the destruction of many 
of the rural communities as a result of doing away with the 
subsidies to the farm community.
<P>
	The subsidy question has become a misnomer in that during 
the GATT talks the whole thrust of the negotiations was how to 
do away with subsidies. Subsidies became the issue when really 
subsidies are the symptom of a greater problem globally, low 
farm income, which is causing the destruction and the 
deterioration of rural communities and a loss of farms world 
wide.
<P>
	Instead of just targeting subsidies we must look at the real 
problem which is a global agricultural policy creating lots of 
profits for the global corporations in terms of trade issues as 
they try and have farmers in one nation compete against another 
in order to access cheap supply to undermine producers in 
another area and profit in the process.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore we have to look at this much differently globally in 
terms of looking at actually returning the cost of production to 
farmers for the products they produce wherever they produce 
them around the world. Certainly there are lots of hungry people 
around the world.
<P>
	The other point the hon. member makes is with regard to 
farmers marketing their products. We have some great examples 
of that in this country. In fact farmers are doing that.
<P>
	One of the best examples is the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Canagrex was a good agency which would use market 
intelligence and go out to sell farm products in the interests of 
the country and producers, but the previous administration 
canned it.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is a tremendous agency in terms 
of pooling the resources of producers, acting as a single seller of 
export wheat and barley, accessing the marketplace in other 
countries, setting the delivery system in place and returning to 
producers the best return for the product available in that 
international marketplace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Mr. Speaker, some hon. 
members may know that my riding of Rosedale is located in the 
heart of downtown Toronto. Its population encompasses people 
who are very fortunate and are members of the business 
community who are surviving in the present economic 
environment to those who are far less successful in the present 
environment, to the elderly and young people who are dependent 
upon the support systems which Canada has developed to create 
a better and humane society.
<P>
	I am particularly conscious of the need to adjust our programs 
to achieve a decent balance for the need of job creation and also 
to protect the less fortunate members of our society.
<P>
	If we were to go to Rosedale riding to areas like Moss Park, 
Regent Park or St. James Town and speak to the elderly people 
there they would find little comfort in the words from the former 
speaker from the Reform Party who drew an analogy to the 
collapse of the Spanish empire.
<P>
	It was a very interesting analogy of several hundred years ago. 
It did collapse from a dependence on slave labour and 
importation of gold from the New World and a lot of other 
problems that were developed in the 16th and 17th centuries. 
However we live in a modern world with different problems. I 
would urge upon this House that we must approach our problems 
from a modern perspective and I am going to get to that in a 
moment.
<P>
	Part of the modern way in which we must approach our 
problems is to understand what those problems are. Parachute 
Community Employment Centre in Rosedale riding has 
produced a very interesting report. I would be glad to make it 
available to all members of this House.
<P>
	The survey was prepared among the people of Regent Park 
who are consumers of many of the services that are going to be 
the subject matter of the minister's task force and study when 
considering the way in which we go about reforming and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="873"> 873 </A></B>
<P>
readjusting our delivery of services that are of need for 
Canadians to fit modern realities. That survey offers some very 
interesting statistics.
<P>
	Seventy per cent of the people who were surveyed told us that 
they could make more money taking welfare than getting jobs. 
That is not an argument for lowering the amount of welfare 
payments. It is an argument for that which the hon. member for 
Malpeque was pointing out with respect to the agricultural 
community.
<P>
	The problem is that the available jobs and the training people 
have for those jobs are not sufficient to enable them to take 
advantage of the modern marketplace. Therefore the people we 
spoke to in the survey were telling us that what they need are 
better training programs. For that they need English as a second 
language and for that they need literacy.
<P>
	Many of them were young women. Evoking the words of the 
member from Quebec who spoke recently, 25 per cent of the 
women who were interviewed lost or left their jobs because of 
inadequate daycare. Once out of the job market it makes it very 
difficult to break back into it.
<P>
	Therefore trying to get a more adequate daycare program 
going in this country is a very important part of the red book and 
an important part of the Liberal program.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	I would like to turn to a different perspective on this issue. To 
some extent it echoes the words of the member for Malpeque. It 
is the perspective of the global economy.
<P>
	We have to recognize that if we are going to craft a solution to 
our problems in Canada today whatever they are, whether we are 
speaking of social policy, taxation policy or other policies, we 
have to look at the reality of the world in which we live.
<P>
	Today we live in a global economy world. It is one in which 
we have recently seen the GATT changes which brought much 
anguish to many members of this House when they tried to come 
to grips with the problems that is imposing on our agricultural 
communities. It is the world of NAFTA and a world of free 
movement of capital, of goods and more and more, of peoples.
<P>
	Unless we take that fundamental fact into account when we 
are addressing this issue of social policy changes we will fail in 
what we adjust. We cannot craft and create solutions to problems 
which are and will always be uniquely and particularly Canadian 
but we must take into account the global realities of the world in 
which we live.
<P>
	In that context I would like to draw the attention of the House 
to a report from the International Labour Organization which 
was reported in today's <I>Globe and Mail</I>. I would like to take the 
opportunity to read some of that report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thirty per cent of the world's labour force is either out of work or 
underemployed-a global jobs crisis gripping both rich and poor nations, a 
United Nations agency says.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``It is a crisis that in some countries could really explode and undermine the 
social fabric very badly,'' said Ali Taqi, chief of staff of the International Labour 
Organization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Geneva-based ILO estimates that more than 820 million people 
worldwide are either unemployed or working at a job that does not pay a 
subsistence wage.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This evokes the words of the hon. member for Malpeque who 
just spoke about the problems of our farm community. Further 
on in the article it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Taqi said the global jobs crisis is not just the result of the recession that has 
plagued the world economy in recent years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is something more endemic and longer lasting than that and reflects the rapid 
pace of technological change and increasingly fierce global competition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I suggest that part of the answer to our problems in our social 
programs and our social agencies lies in our need to see how we 
fit into this global context and the need to address an 
international answer to the problem.
<P>
	We cannot go this alone. We need the International Labour 
Organization. We need to work with the social charter within 
NAFTA and our other trading partners if we are to have long 
lasting solutions to our problems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On that subject, I would like to say a few words to my 
colleagues of the Bloc Quebecois who talk passionately about 
preserving social services in this country.
<P>
	I know from experience that the world we live in today is not a 
place where it is possible to solve problems by acting as an 
isolated country, with an individual perspective; quite the 
contrary. The solution today is global. Take the European 
Community for example; more and more Brussels is the one to 
determine solutions. Why? Because Spain by itself cannot solve 
its problems; France alone cannot solve its own problems. 
Therefore, the European countries have to work together to find 
a solution.
<P>
	I suggest we have the same kind of situation here in Canada. 
In order to solve social problems in this country and to face the 
difficulties created in a way by the United States, we must have a 
national policy. We will not solve problems by creating more 
tariff or non-tariff barriers between various regions of Canada 
but by working together to ensure our security. It is through 
co-operation and hard work leading to a strong economy that we 
will solve these problems.
<P>
	Therefore, I ask my colleagues of the Bloc Quebecois to 
review this issue with the other members of this House and to 
co-operate with them in order to find Canadian solutions, 
efficient solutions which will apply to national and international 
problems alike.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On that point, Mr. Speaker, I see my time is drawing to a close. 
I would like to complete my remarks by going back to what I 
heard the member for Malpeque saying. I would to some extent 
differ from him on this. I am not sure that the solutions to our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="874"> 874 </A></B>
<P>
problems are something we  are able to construct by ourselves 
without facing the facts of the international world in which we 
live.
<P>
	It seems to me that our duty as members of this House is to 
look and serve as a prism to the global world. If it is a world of 
greater competitiveness and greater free trade, then we must 
serve in a way in which that international world may be brought 
to our fellow Canadian citizens and then turn around and craft 
solutions to problems which are both local and global and take 
into account that global context.
<P>
	I am confident that when the minister responsible, the task 
force which he sets up and the members of this House examine 
these questions, they will be looking for solutions which are 
both local and global, but will also take into account the need for 
a strong Canadian solution to our problems. That in turn will 
enable us to exist in a global environment, one that is more and 
more difficult but one which forces us to provide solutions for 
our citizens which will enable them to live with dignity in our 
own country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel I must 
comment on what was said by the hon. member who was 
referring directly to my party when he asked us to forget about 
implementing solutions like a separate country that would be 
too small. I can inform him that there are small, developed 
countries with a vigorous economy and social programs and a 
standard of living that are enviable.
<P>
	The globalization we are experiencing today will actually 
make peoples who may be part of several nations, and this is no 
mean task, want to defend their identity. Identity also extends to 
social security programs and how they are organized.
<P>
	Many members have spoken to defend Canada's social 
security system, and I can understand that. I also heard them 
mention its defects and that it needs to be modernized. In my 
speech in reply to the speech from the throne, I discussed many 
shortcomings we in Quebec have noticed for a long time and 
have been trying to remedy in negotiations with the federal 
government. Although we saw what the problems were and 
wanted to make adjustments and save money, which is indeed a 
priority today, the federal government constantly objected to 
our proposals. I will get back to this problem, but it seems to me 
that although we should listen to what hon. members opposite 
have to say, they should listen as well and realize there are two 
social security plans in Canada at this time, a Canadian system 
and a Quebec system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. SPeaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Mercier for her comments, and although my answer may not be 
entirely adequate because I have not had time to develop this 
aspect, I am sure that during this Parliament there will be 
opportunities for discussion to clarify our thoughts on the 
matter.
<P>
	To get back to your comment on small countries, if we take, 
for example, the European Community, small countries which 
maintain their identity can do so because they have agreed to 
give up a certain amount of their sovereignty within a broader 
context. I can say that to the people of Ontario, there is no 
difference. Fine, we in Ontario could say that we want our own 
solution. Everybody wants his own solution, but we have to look 
at the facts. We have to be practical.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Everybody cannot have his own solution. The problems of 
GATT are a good illustration of this. Canada wanted to keep the 
supply management system we built up over the years, but we 
could not keep it any more. The other countries would not agree. 
We have to face the facts. It is not just a matter of saying what we 
want. The important thing is what we can accomplish.
<P>
	In this situation we have to look at the global economic 
climate and our own resources. I believe that it will be much 
easier to deal with these problems as Canadians than as 
individual provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I want to inform the Chair that, from now on during this 
debate, the speakers for the Official Opposition will use 
10-minute periods, followed by 5-minute periods for questions 
and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have the honour of being the critic on issues affecting seniors. 
This is probably because of a certain wisdom I gained along with 
my white hair. My field of responsibility includes issues related 
to andragogy, gerontology and geriatrics. These are issues 
which must be examined with a very human approach.
<P>
	During the referendums and election campaigns in Quebec, 
the opponents of sovereignty for Quebec took advantage of the 
insecurity of some older people and tried to scare them by 
saying that they would lose their old age security pension if 
Quebec became a sovereign nation, arguing that the government 
of the province would no longer be able to pay for their pension.
<P>
	Thank goodness, many seniors no longer believe those lies. 
The results of the 1992 referendum in Quebec as well as the 
election of 54 members of the Bloc Quebecois are obvious proof 
of that.
<P>
	The issues concerning seniors are partially dealt with by two 
departments: Human Resources Development and Health, as 
well as by the Seniors Secretariat, which is responsible for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="875"> 875 </A></B>
<P>
providing to seniors information on federal programs and 
services, while also ensuring liaison with federal and provincial 
departments implementing programs for seniors.
<P>
	Also, the National Advisory Council on Aging advises and 
helps the Minister of Health regarding the quality of life of 
seniors, either when the minister submits issues to the Council 
or when the Council itself decides to act on its own. Its role is to 
circulate information and, among others tasks, to publish 
reports.
<P>
	So, why is there no secretary of state responsible for issues 
relating to seniors, since this is an area of vital importance?
<P>
	Recent studies reveal that one person in eight is over 65 years 
of age. In the next ten years, the number of people over 65 will 
increase by at least 40 per cent.
<P>
	The baby boomers are now in their forties. In 1981, 19 per 
cent of Canadians over 65 years of age were in their eighties. In 
2001, that is 20 years later, this proportion will be 24 per cent. 
Life expectancy is increasing, along with related problems.
<P>
	More and more people over 65 years of age will have to rely 
on the ability to pay of those workers aged 15 to 64. Around the 
year 2011, for the first time ever, there will be more older people 
than persons aged 15 or less. Moreover, this group of older 
people will be better educated than today's seniors.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	All these factors show us the importance of planning for the 
future, starting today. Of course there are many programs to help 
seniors, but the isolation of seniors means that most of them are 
completely uninformed and unable to take the necessary action 
to obtain this information. We absolutely must encourage 
seniors to be independent, by letting them join society and not 
by keeping them apart.
<P>
	Most seniors prefer to live at home, to take care of themselves 
and to make their own decisions about their life. According to 
journalist Monique Richer of the daily <I>Journal de Montréal</I>, 
there is a big problem among seniors: the suicide rate of people 
aged 65 to 80 has increased significantly in Quebec, since the 
suicide rate of seniors has risen from 10.1 per 100,000 in 1977 to 
21.9 in 1987. Montreal has a service called ``Suicide Action 
Montréal'' but it seems to be little used, unlike other services for 
young people or other groups.
<P>
	Seniors must also be given access to information on health 
services. Our health system is among the best in the world, but 
spending on health is growing faster than the population and 
inflation. Canada spends over $60 billion a year on health. 
Obviously, as people grow older, they have health problems and 
often lose independence as well.
<P>
	Formerly, our ancestors kept old people at home with them, 
but today, with our new lifestyle, for both young and old, living 
together no longer seems possible.
<P>
	We cannot improve seniors' quality of life by isolating them, 
nor will we save money by cutting benefits under the Canada 
Pension Plan, since these income changes would cost taxpayers 
dearly. We must not confuse old age security pensions with 
welfare benefits.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. May I ask for a quorum call.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Why would you do that?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We have a quorum.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Resuming debate. The hon. member for 
Argenteuil-Papineau may continue his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dumas:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would also like to point out that 
half of our seniors receive income security benefits and are 
caught in a cycle where all they do is keep waiting for their 
cheques. Removing programs for the elderly, eliminating 
current services or lowering pension costs would not improve 
the lot of the elderly.
<P>
	The elderly are not rich people. According to Statistics 
Canada, 1991 data show that almost half of retired seniors, 43.8 
per cent of them, are living below the poverty line. This is a 
serious problem, and let us not forget that the seniors want to be 
a part of Canadian society.
<P>
	Therefore, the government must ask one of its members to 
resolve that sensitive issue, because previous government 
measures only succeeded in keeping seniors inactive, isolating 
them and making them feel financially insecure.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	So, to improve the quality of life of our seniors, we must make 
sure their living quarters suit their needs and allow them to stay 
at home, and lower the outrageous costs of seniors' residences, 
hospitals, et cetera, by providing, for example, home support, 
transportation services, recreational programs, and more.
<P>
	We need to set up a 24 hours a day, seven days a week 
information system and to promote it. The federal government 
has released $3 million for the installation of new telephone 
equipment needed to answer inquiries about old age pensions. 
Seniors also need to be informed of the existence of such 
services and to be provided with other similar services related to 
their health, lodging, et cetera.
<P>
	Additional resources are needed to reach incapacitated 
seniors, if necessary. As recommended by a Canadian seniors 
association, a standing national commission must be set up to 
protect the rights of seniors who want to keep on working.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to remind you, Mr. Speaker, that every 
year seniors represent a higher percentage of our population and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="876"> 876 </A></B>
<P>
that the government must take into account their active presence 
when it puts forward its new policies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has put forward a number of points of view about how 
he thinks the interests of his constituents, residents of his 
province and all Canadians would be better served by this type 
of review.
<P>
	Normally when you deal with wholesale restructuring any 
institution, any group of programs, any fundamental policies 
you would normally start out with certain parameters in mind, 
certain givens.
<P>
	I do not want to say sacred cows because there are no such 
things.
<P>
	We heard from the Reform Party earlier that what it wants is to 
cut, cut, cut and it is not so terribly concerned about the impact 
of those cuts. I have listened intently to members of the Bloc 
Quebecois, who are not interested simply in cutting, that is not 
what they are saying. They want to build a better system to 
ensure that those individuals needing help the most get it.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member if he could give me a few ideas 
as to the parameters that this review should take place in and 
what should be the starting point. What should be the givens as 
to what we are trying to attain.
<P>
	Is it to make sure that income security for seniors is 
maintained? Is it to ensure that transfers to the provinces are 
maintained at a level that would allow the provinces to have 
services of equal quality no matter what the fiscal situation of 
the province is? Is it just to maintain transfers to provinces such 
as Quebec to administer provincial social assistance programs?
<P>
	I just throw those ideas out. If he could give me some sense 
about what he would like to see maintained and built upon in this 
review it would be helpful to me.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dumas:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the 
remarks of my colleague opposite. There is something I need to 
point out to him. When the <I>Coalition des aînés</I> met in Montreal, 
in the riding of my hon. colleague from Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, 
I had the pleasure of meeting, at the Golden Age, members of 
this organization which brings together various associations of 
senior citizens and retired workers in the province of Quebec. 
These people are very much afraid of seeing either their 
pensions or the services they receive cut. By the way, I want tell 
my colleague from Notre-Dame-de-Grâce that it is with great 
pleasure that I visited this huge centre where seniors can go to 
take part in recreational activities or to receive health care and 
other types of services.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	I must tell my colleague opposite that we, members of the 
Bloc, do not want any cuts that would affect seniors. It is the 
same with transfers to the provinces. The amount of money 
transferred to Quebec must remain at the present level. We do 
not want any change in these transfers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member for Calgary 
Southeast is seeking the floor but has a very little time. I would 
ask her to please keep that in mind.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question will be very brief.
<P>
	I appreciate the member's comments regarding seniors but he 
and all of his colleagues have been directing their comments 
toward asking for continued federal and provincial support for 
programs. They have been asking the federal government to 
continue to fund the different and varied social programs within 
their provinces. They have also been talking about federal and 
provincial co-operation.
<P>
	Given all that, how is the member going to meet his mandate 
for separation when he has expectations such as he has just 
expressed for co-operation between the federal and provincial 
governments?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dumas:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer the question 
of my hon. colleague of the Reform Party. I have to admit that 
what I dealt with in my comments pertains more specifically to 
Quebec. But since I am the official opposition critic for all 
senior citizens in Canada, I would certainly not advocate 
anything detrimental to other provinces. Those things we 
suggest for Quebec, which is still part of Canada as far as I 
know, apply as well to the other provinces.
<P>
	When Quebec is a sovereign nation, as I hope it will be in the 
coming years, we will stop paying taxes to Canada at some 
point. We will then be able to afford the same services our senior 
citizens get right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to take part in this debate 
on the funding and future of social security programs.
<P>
	For Canadians and Quebecers, these programs include a set of 
services ranging from an income security policy to the Canada 
Pension Plan and a host of other services.
<P>
	As I prepared this speech, I reflected that one could not 
engage in this debate without considering a number of 
circumstances that make this debate a rather painful exercise. 
The government that tabled this motion belongs to the same 
party which was elected nearly 25 years ago on a promise to 
build a just society that, at the time, under the leadership of 
former 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="877"> 877 </A></B>
<P>
Prime Minister Trudeau, would be based on the principles of 
equality, fraternity and liberty, principles that inspired me and 
probably inspired you as well, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I reflected that after 25 years, it was time to consider what has 
been accomplished, because if we examined our social 
programs, we must also consider the people who at some time in 
their lives may need government assistance. And it is sad to have 
to conclude that 25 years later, poverty has not dimished. Not 
only that, it has started to affect groups in our society which 
were normally assumed to be immune.
<P>
	Of course, when I talk about poverty, I use the term as defined 
by Statistics Canada. In other words, being poor means having 
to spend 56.2 per cent of one's income on food, shelter and 
clothing.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	As parliamentarians, we are being asked to discuss 
restructuring social security programs at a time when Canadian 
and Quebec society are in very bad shape. Granted, poverty has 
changed. In the seventies, when the Senate did its wide-ranging 
study on poverty, being poor was associated more with the 
elderly in our society. This was so true that the cover of the 
Senate report showed an ailing, toothless, elderly woman, and 
that was more or less the image we had of poverty.
<P>
	In the 90s and as we approach the turn of the century, poverty 
has changed. It now has a new face. It affects young people 
between the ages of 18 and 30 who do not necessarily lack 
training. Single parents are particularly affected. It is also a fact 
of life for those workers who, after spending part of their lives as 
active members of the labour market, are suddently excluded 
because of technological change. There are people who worked 
for 15, 20 or 25 years as part of the so-called labour aristocracy 
and who made a good living.
<P>
	I think that the government's role is to provide these people 
with generous, accessible and transferable services, and I was 
delighted when I heard the Minister of National Health and 
Welfare announce her position during the reply to the Speech 
from the Throne. That is how she defined social security 
programs and that is also my understanding of what they should 
be.
<P>
	What I find rather disturbing, and this is where I disagree with 
the government, is that for the past ten years, in any discussion 
on public finances and government policy, there has always 
been an attempt to reduce the debate to mere dollars and cents. 
For the past ten years the government has been proposing 
spending cuts as though that were the only game in town. Of 
course there are ways to save money and of course there is too 
much fat in the government administration, but I think we are 
asking the wrong questions.
<P>
	If we are convinced that providing social security programs is 
not a matter of choice but a reflection of our level of civilization, 
the question should be how we can access additional sources of 
revenue.
<P>
	Even in a zero deficit situation, we will need more resources 
to be able to fund social programs at the levels that will be 
required in the years to come.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois realize there are several 
alternatives for obtaining additional revenue, and we think that 
this exercise is not just a matter of making spending cuts 
haphazardly without being overly concerned about the 
repercussions. One alternative that should be considered is that 
of tax reform. As we have said repeatedly, we are talking about a 
review of the corporate tax system. We know for a fact there are 
people in our society who are not doing their fair share.
<P>
	On the government side, there is a consensus that Canada has 
done everything humanly possible to tax corporations. 
However, when we look at what Canada raises in the way of 
revenue, when we look at the tax rate for corporate profits and 
compare it with the rate applied in other countries, including the 
OECD countries which we often use as a benchmark, you would 
be surprised to hear that the tax rate for corporate profits in 
1990, for instance, was 39 per cent in France, 50 per cent in 
Germany, 46 per cent in Italy and 50 per cent in Japan. 
Meanwhile, in Canada it was 29 per cent.
<P>
	To me it is clear that if we want to discuss the viability of 
social security programs, we also have to talk about the tax 
treatment of corporations.
<P>
	Furthermore, and at this point I want to recall some comments 
one of our colleagues made with a great deal of conviction, and 
although I did not agree with the substance, I must say it was 
very well said, I believe that the ultimate test for any changes 
that are made in the years to come will be that they will have to 
help people find jobs.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Putting people back to work has to be more that a few empty 
words with little backing: jobs, jobs, jobs. Some countries 
manage to have 80, 90 even 92 per cent of their population in the 
work force. Can you imagine having 92 per cent of the labour 
force actually working! And strangely enough, these are small 
countries. These are countries which decided to implement a full 
employment policy. Such a policy is not an irrelevant concept. 
To make it work, it has to become an obsession. The government 
must make the decision, get all the partners together-unions, 
employers, corporations, professionals, students-and ask them 
to endorse the choices made for our society and to help achieve 
them. Naturally, you are going to tell me that Canada has a 
special problem, because it has two levels of government and 
ten regional labour markets competing with each other, and I 
agree. This is why I am a sovereigntist. This makes it very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="878"> 878 </A></B>
<P>
difficult to set up the elements, the goals, the main guidelines of 
a full employment policy.
<P>
	I would say that in the years to come, we will not have a 
choice, we will have to aim for full employment, and this will 
mean more involvement of government in people's lives. What 
we have been hearing for ten years, and what the government 
side is still more or less advocating, is that the best government 
is the one that governs the least. I do not agree with that. I think a 
government has responsibilities and must take action. I am 
going to give you the example of an area in which it would be 
useful that the government not only did not cut its spending, but 
rather increase the resources, because it is an area which creates 
jobs and has a high rate of return, and that is social housing. 
When you build a thousand units, you create 2,000 jobs. This is a 
good investment with a high rate of return.
<P>
	Yet, we are in situation-and this will be my conclusion, 
because my time is almost up and I would not want to break the 
rules-which shows that it is not true that the best government is 
the one that governs the least. I believe that the best guarantee 
we can give to people that we will maintain strong, accessible 
and generous social programs is to target government spending 
towards areas that generate large spin-offs because one of these 
areas on which we can bet for the future is social housing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I extend my 
compliments to the member for his excellent address on social 
problems and so on in this country.
<P>
	He seemed to think that the problem with social programs 
today is the problem of lack of revenue, not a problem of too 
much expenditure. Then he went on to elaborate on his thesis 
that we should have more corporate taxes and more income 
taxes.
<P>
	The member for Calgary Southwest said the other day that we 
are close to a tax revolt in this country because taxes are so high. 
Corporate profits have plunged by billions of dollars. Tax 
revenues have gone down this year. The hon. member still thinks 
that we have a problem with not enough revenue rather than too 
much expenditure.
<P>
	There is always talk about social programs as categories of 
having to pay money to seniors and to the unemployed. What 
about the need? There are some people who are elderly and have 
lots of money and are in no need of additional assistance. There 
are a lot of people who are unemployed making $50,000 or 
$100,000 in the same year who perhaps should not be eligible to 
receive unemployment.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	My question to the member is when does he think that we 
should stop this idea that the problem is not enough revenue, 
that the problem is too much expenditure being directed in the 
wrong places?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, if we all thought alike in this 
House, your task would be much easier, but also less interesting.
<P>
	What we have here is a good example of a fundamental 
difference of opinion. Of course, some expenditures could be 
reviewed; it is a premise and I understand that. But it does not 
seem to be the real problem. When I speak about reviewing 
taxation, I am not saying to my hon. colleague we should review 
personal taxes. I think there is a good enough consensus on this, 
except maybe in the case of the very rich, because Canada is the 
only OECD country not to tax wealth. I am sure the hon. member 
is aware of that.
<P>
	What I am saying to him is that we will have to strive to find 
additional revenues because the pressure on social programs 
will not disappear, because our population is getting older and 
because there are social evils inherent to the type of society we 
have in Canada in 1994. And that type of society is one where 50 
per cent of the people have part-time jobs. When you hold a 
part-time job, you have 7 chances out of 10 of becoming poor at 
one point or another in your lifetime. These jobs are precarious 
and poorly paid and they offer no security whatsoever. Since this 
is our reality, since this is what we have to deal with, there is no 
magic formula, there is no way we can close our eyes and just 
hope the situation will change.
<P>
	There are a few possibilities though if we want to find 
additional revenues. Would my hon. colleague agree with me 
that, if we look at tax rates in the industrialized countries with 
which we usually compare ourselves, Canada has not yet tapped 
every source of revenue it would be entitled to? Would he not 
agree that there are sectors where, if the government wanted to 
act, it could put money back into circulation, it could leave more 
money so that people could take care of themselves and would 
not have to turn to social services? This would seem to be an 
interesting approach.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to be given the opportunity to address 
this question because it is one of the more important ones that 
we will be discussing for several months no doubt during this 
35th Parliament.

<P>
	There are a number of basic questions that we need to study 
together in the spirit of co-operation and openness. Obviously 
we bring forth different values and different views. I accept that 
and respect it.
<P>
	Perhaps the first and most fundamental question for me 
concerns what programs we need as a nation in order to respond 
in a very generous and fair way to Canadians in need?
<P>
	That begs another question immediately. Who identified 
these Canadians in need and who defines what a particular need 
is? Clearly the government has a great responsibility in doing 
that. It has also indicated by virtue of the debates that is has held 
on a number of questions such as peacemaking, cruise missiles, 
the pre-budget debate and this debate that it is interested in the 
views of all parliamentarians. The government is to be 
applauded for having taken this initiative.
<P>
	What the Liberals want is a restructuring of our programs to 
meet more needs with greater efficiency. I would hope that we 
can embrace that priority, that goal, that objective. This is the 
Liberal position and this is what we, as members of the 
government, are going to fight to have happen.
<P>
	Without being malicious or unkind, as I understand the 
various comments that have been made, the NDP, for example, 
and I can speak primarily of Manitoba because its members are 
more numerous there proportionately speaking than they have 
been in the House, is really saying do not touch anything. Do not 
touch any of the social programs.
<P>
	I am sure there will be a number of members who will be 
anxious to correct me if I misinterpret the Reform Party. I would 
welcome that. The Reform Party has been described by other 
colleagues as cut, cut, cut or slash and burn. Those are not my 
words but I have repeated them. I would prefer to be a bit more 
dignified and say dismantle and rebuild. Perhaps it comes to the 
same thing.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It seems to me that we have already been told that all the Bloc 
Quebecois does is talk about is Quebec. I do understand how 
important Quebec is for the Bloc, but it should remember that it 
is the Official Opposition and that, as such, it must speak for all 
Canadians, and represent them all, from coast to coast.
<P>
	Quebec, or rather the Bloc Quebecois, is asking for a transfer 
to Quebec, with no strings attached. But this raises the following 
fundamental question: Why only to Quebec? It seems to me that 
overlapping and duplication represent a problem not only in 
Quebec, but also in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Overlapping and duplication happen in two ways: between the 
federal government, the provinces and territories, and within 
each jurisdiction; and within the federal government, the 
provinces, the territories, and  sometimes even within municipal 
governments. Co-ordination does not always exist even within a 
province or a region. The fact is that we have three levels of 
government, where overlapping does occur, and the issue is not 
raised often enough.
<P>
	Members on all sides want to get rid of overlapping which is 
very costly for Canadians. Why? So that we can respond in a 
better, more efficient way to the needs of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There have been some references this morning with respect to 
child care. I want to remind all members that the Liberal Party of 
Canada which has been chosen by Canadians to govern has made 
a commitment to child care. It is a very responsible one, up to 
50,000 places per year to a total of 150,000 providing the 
economy grows at 3 per cent or more.
<P>
	In the current economic situation in which we find ourselves, 
with a debt which has exceed $500 billion and a deficit in the 
rage of $45 billion, surely linking this kind of program for those 
most in need with those particular conditions, 3 per cent growth, 
is a responsible decision.
<P>
	When we talk about funding our social programs it seems to 
me that we cannot avoid talking of taxation, revenues and 
expenditures. One option is to reduce, cut, slash, call it what you 
will. Another is to recognize the fundamental issue, on which we 
are all in agreement, that the middle class in particular feels that 
it cannot bear any more taxes. It is angry. There is anger out 
there.
<P>
	However, there is another issue and I do not say it in an 
arrogant and pompous way. Are there others out there who are 
not paying their fair share? It is true that there are influential and 
rich families able to shield millions or perhaps even billions of 
dollars? Should we be asking questions such as should there be 
an inheritance tax in this country?
<P>
	Is it true as well that there is money being transferred to other 
countries and being shielded, at least in part, from taxes being 
paid to Canada for the benefit of all Canadians? Is it true, and I 
believe it is, that there are Canadians who earn substantial sums 
of money each year but who pay no taxes? Is that fair? Is it 
equally true that there are profitable corporations that pay no 
taxes or virtually no taxes?
<P>
	If there is some truth to all the questions I have raised, and I 
have not even raised the whole question of the black market 
economy which apparently if everyone were paying taxes 
according to the rules would probably eliminate the deficit, is it 
any wonder that Canadians are saying just a minute, why is it 
that the government cannot get money from those sources that 
are not paying their fair share?

<P>
	I invite all of my colleagues, and I say this in a very serious 
way, to share their ideas openly in this debate. I recognize that 
there are divergent views. That is what democracy is all about. I 
believe that is what a strong democracy is all about.
<P>
	We should all try to come at least to some basic agreement on 
what we are trying to do. It seems to me that while we may vary 
in our approaches to how this might be done, what we 
collectively want to do is identify the Canadians in need and 
define conditions under which they can be helped.
<P>
	If we can do that I believe that putting forward the 
mechanisms, the programs to respond to that will be much 
easier.
<P>
	Whether we are from the Bloc Quebecois, with a particular 
orientation, or other parties in which we believe in a Canada as a 
whole with some improvements to what we have, which is 
probably the finest country in the world, I have always 
wondered why one would ever want to change something that is 
the finest. Perhaps some day after having listened a bit more I 
shall come to some sort of understanding.
<P>
	I would like everyone to make a commitment to look at social 
programs, look at taxation, look at the fundamental issues 
facing this whole country in such a way as to build a better 
country for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
closely to my hon. colleague's speech. I think there is some truth 
to what he said.
<P>
	Now, I would like to point out to him some of the differences 
that may exist between Canadians from other parts of Canada 
and Quebecers. French-speaking Canadians have always 
depended a great deal on the federal government in Ottawa to 
safeguard their rights. We in Quebec, on the other hand, have 
always felt that where overlap or duplication occur, it would be 
preferable to assign these rights to the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	When the Fathers of Confederation gathered in 1865, 1866 
and 1867, English-speaking people supported the idea of a 
single government. Quebec is responsible for the fact that we 
have two levels of government in this country, because its 
representatives insisted that this course of action be taken.
<P>
	Therefore, I think it is very important to note that while Bloc 
Quebecois members speak on behalf of Quebecers, they are also 
concerned about problems affecting other regions of Canada as 
well. I hope the hon. member understands this.
<P>
	I also want to congratulate him on his speech. As this session 
progresses, it would appear to us that the Liberals have split into 
two factions, one which I would qualify as Liberal-Reform and 
the other, as Liberal with social-democratic leanings.
<P>
	This debate will likely give members a chance to analyze 
opposite views and ultimately to take a coherent stand.
<P>
	As for us, what matters most, as I have stated repeatedly in 
this House, are the rights of the least fortunate in our society. I 
listened to the speeches of the Reform Party members and I 
think we all agree that the reform process now being initiated 
must not affect the most disadvantaged members of society. 
Would the hon. member care to respond to what I have just said?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel: </B>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague. He 
has raised a number of excellent questions.
<P>
	First, I agree with him completely when he says that we have 
to help the less fortunate any way we can. As for francophones 
outside Quebec who presumably have benefited from their 
association with the federal government, I would simply like to 
remind my hon. friend that all of us have at some time or 
another, for different reasons, benefited from the federal 
government, not just francophones outside Quebec. Perhaps I 
misunderstood, but listening to him, I got the feeling that 
because there are not many of us and because we are scattered 
across the country, we need the federal government. Look, we 
have been fighting for a long time for our language and culture, 
and we are doing a good job of it, even if there are only a handful 
of us. Yes, it is true that we need the government from time to 
time, but I assure you we can stand on our own two feet.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	As for the existence, supposedly, of two factions within the 
party, let me say that we are a united party. We may have our 
differences. I have three daughters and I can assure you that, 
while I raised them all the same way, there are differences 
nevertheless. In spite of this, we are a family and we love one 
another a great deal. I love them a lot and I hope the reverse is 
also true.
<P>
	Therefore, please do not compare the Liberals with the 
Reform Party, because such a comparison could make me 
seriously ill. We want to improve upon existing measures. A 
Liberal looks at an existing measure and thinks about possible 
improvements. That is what we want to do.
<P>
	Lastly, my hon. colleague speaks of Quebec and yes, 
occasionally, even of Canada. Even my young colleague who 
made an excellent speech earlier mentioned all of Canada, as did 
others. But you must do so more often. You are the official 
opposition and must speak for all of Canada. When you see a 
problem outside Quebec, you should speak about it because you 
sit in opposition, I hope, on behalf of all Canadians.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had not expected 
to participate in this debate today, but I welcome this 
opportunity to speak in this debate on human resources 
development.
<P>
	What we have heard today are many excellent presentations 
such as the presentation by the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth which reminded us that there are many 
organizations in Canada that are made up of relatively wealthy 
individuals who receive grants and awards. Perhaps those 
organizations, just as members of Parliament, just as many other 
Canadians who have more, should think about giving up their 
privileges, opportunities and grants to help those who have less. 
It is certainly something worth considering.
<P>
	I want to say in response to a comment made by the member of 
the Bloc Quebecois earlier that there are reform Liberals and 
there are social democratic Liberals, that in fact all Liberals in 
this party today, I am certain, are committed to Canada's social 
welfare program. Moreover all of them like myself regard the 
development of Canada's social welfare program as one of the 
greatest accomplishments of Canadian liberalism and the 
Canadian Liberal Party.
<P>
	There have been several interesting observations and very 
fine speeches by members of the Reform Party. One speaker 
alluded earlier to the example of Great Britain and compared it 
to the kinds of things that are happening in Canada today and to 
what has been called by others the British disease. We have 
heard that kind of term, not simply from Mrs. Thatcher, but from 
others. I think it is one of those terrible simplifications that 
obscures a broader truth.
<P>
	If we look at western Europe since 1945 what we find is that 
many of the countries that have had the highest growth rates 
have been countries where government participation in the 
economy is higher than it was in Great Britain. In fact if we look 
at government participation in the economy since 1945 the 
western economies, many of them built up from the ruins of the 
wartime period, are those which have spent more on social 
welfare and have done better in terms of economic growth.
<P>
	It may be a surprise to learn it, but between 1950 and 1990 the 
country that had the fastest rate of economic growth in Europe of 
the major nations was Italy, a country that had a high degree of 
spending on social welfare. Germany is another example.
<P>
	Second, in looking at British society, those who have looked 
most closely and most recently, including Mrs. Thatcher's 
supporters, have said that the difficulty with Great Britain is not 
so much the fact that Great Britain spent more on social welfare, 
not so much that it tried to develop strong programs to help the 
poorest in society,  but rather because Britain failed so badly in 
training and education.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	Maurice Cowling, one of Mrs. Thatcher's academic 
supporters, has written a book about British society. What he 
points out is that Britain has failed very badly in the area of 
training and education while other countries in continental 
Europe have done so much better. I think that bears a lesson for 
us.
<P>
	In Canada we too have spent a lot of money on education and 
training. The hon. member for Port Moody-Coquitlam, who 
spoke earlier today, talked about this question in her address. 
She talked about the need for improvement in training and 
suggested that training could be done best by the private sector.
<P>
	I am pleased to report that the hon. member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam is a graduate of the University of Waterloo.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. English:</B> The hon. member for Peterborough is a 
professor at Trent University.
<P>
	The University of Waterloo has pioneered co-op education in 
Canada and has done so so successfully that it far out-ranks 
Trent University in the rankings every year in <I>Maclean's</I>. The 
member for Port Moody-Coquitlam went through this co-op 
program, one which I know very well because I taught there for 
20 years myself. In that co-op program she benefited 
enormously from the support of the government. That co-op 
program, which is being copied by many universities throughout 
Canada, is an excellent example of what business, government 
and educators can do together.
<P>
	The initial idea for the program came from the business 
community in the area as did the idea for the university. The 
business people came to educators and said: ``Let us work 
together to make sure that the transition from the educational 
place to the work place is made easier, that students have work 
experience and they can carry that experience further''.
<P>
	The result has been a much higher degree of success in getting 
jobs on the part of graduates. There has been a lot of satisfaction, 
as the hon. member herself said. The program has worked very 
effectively. It is a program that worked not because of private 
initiative, but because a government worked with business and 
educators to create a coherent system of training and education.
<P>
	In the Waterloo area, the example of the University of 
Waterloo has been followed by Sir Wilfrid Laurier University 
and also by our secondary school boards, particularly the 
Waterloo Catholic Board of Education. I have worked with that 
board myself in working out training programs for students to 
enable them to move from the high schools and universities into 
the work place. Students who are within those programs and who  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="882"> 882 </A></B>
<P>
have a more direct experience in the work place find the 
transition to higher education and to work much easier.
<P>
	The difficulty we find is that so many training programs are 
just not working in the way we had hoped. That is why we are 
calling for a restructuring. This is most relevant of course to any 
discussion on human resources development.
<P>
	In a recent study done by the Canadian Guidance and 
Counselling Foundation, 73.9 per cent of the community 
employment agencies, 72.4 per cent of Canada employment 
centres and 45.2 per cent of counselling services in colleges and 
CEGEPs report that they turn clients away because they do not 
meet funding criteria. This is simply not good enough. The costs 
are high.
<P>
	The human costs of not watching what happens with training 
at the lowest level, at the intermediate level and at the 
post-secondary level are very high for our society.
<P>
	As an educator, I personally feel-and the hon. member for 
St. Boniface has written some excellent pieces on this 
subject-that we need to restructure our training programs in 
the broadest possible way. I would echo the thoughts of the 
member for St. Boniface in suggesting that we all share these 
problems together. Training and education in this country is 
very costly. When we compare the international rate of spending 
on education we find that Canada, a very wealthy nation, spends 
a percentage of GNP that is higher than almost any other nation. 
If we are not the highest we are certainly close to it. All of us are 
aware that we could spend this much better.
<P>
	Our responsibility as members of this House, of all parties, is 
to work together to improve this very crucial sector of Canadian 
society. In doing so we will start to recreate that sense of 
initiative among younger people and that sense of purpose that 
is so lacking now.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	I think we can work together and we would achieve so much 
for this great country if we would do so.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock p.m. pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to statements by

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take this 
opportunity to remind members of the House and all Canadians 
that February 1 to 7 marks Eating Disorders Awareness Week. 
The theme is: Breaking free-Celebrating our sizes.
<P>
	The National Eating Disorder Centre and support groups 
across Canada will address a key concern about weight 
obsession and negative body image particularly among women. 
The goal this year is to increase awareness of the psycho-social 
factors which contribute to the development of anorexia, 
bulimia, or weight preoccupation and those that prevent eating 
disorders from occurring.
<P>
	During the week, information through public forums and 
exhibits will be provided to Canadians to dispel myths and 
direct them to appropriate resources.
<P>
	I am delighted that the messages of this week are consistent 
with the actions of Health Canada to promote a sense of 
well-being as well as healthy weights. Healthy bodies come in a 
variety of shapes and sizes and a good weight is a healthy 
weight, not just a low weight.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the National Eating Disorder 
Centre for its work on raising awareness of this important health 
matter.

contribute to a more open and improved process of reviewing 
and determining the future of Canadian forces bases in Canada.
<P>
	My proposal calls for the establishment of an ad hoc caucus of 
MPs representing ridings in which CFBs are located for the 
purpose of determining the future of these bases, whether they 
be downsized, restructured or closed.
<P>
	This caucus could be chaired by the minister and report its 
findings to the government. This caucus could provide the 
minister with the information and views from each base and its 
community that he might not otherwise have the benefit of 
receiving and would be shared and debated openly, resulting in 
the best analysis and decisions possible.
<P>
	It is important for the minister and his government to have 
MPs, regardless of the future of their bases, as allies rather than 
adversaries.
<P>
	In short I believe that involving MPs in this decision-making 
process will result in the best possible outcome for Canadian 
forces bases in Canada.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	According to the daily newspaper <I>Le Devoir</I>, whose source 
was a senior member of the RCMP, cigarette smuggling is only 
the tip of the iceberg. Cigarette smuggling networks have now 
expanded into jewelry, clothing and alcohol. In the Montreal 
area alone, over two thirds of cigarette smugglers are also 
dealing in alcohol.
<P>
	Is the government aware that its carelessness, laxity and 
negligence in the fight against cigarette smuggling are causing a 
growing underground economy to spread dangerously?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
said and I would like to repeat in this House that we are fully 
aware of this situation. I contacted the provinces because the 
federal government is not the only government involved in this 
whole problem of the underground economy. We need an overall 
plan and everyone's co-operation to deal with it.
<P>
	I told the House yesterday that I had to engage in further 
discussions with some of the premiers. I am planning to speak to 
them early next week. And we have given very clear instructions 
to the police to take all necessary measures to ensure that all 
Canadians in all regions of the country obey the law.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every question we ask now is answered with a litany of 
calls, talks and intentions but never with action. We are starting 
to wonder whether there is a government in the House.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> There is none.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he 
can confirm that the government's action plan against cigarette 
smuggling includes a federal tax reduction of $6 a carton, as the 
CBC reported last night?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in due time a statement on the whole problem will be made in 
this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Government of Ontario persists in its refusal to 
reduce its own taxes, does the federal government intend to go 
ahead with its own reduction of federal taxes, given the fact that 
the Prime Minister said that some time ago?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
some days ago the hon. Leader of the Opposition told me that we 
should proceed because he was convinced the Ontario minister 
of finance had said in Montreal that he was to proceed. I was not 
that sure.
<P>
	Today we apparently have a different version. Yes, the hon. 
member said himself in this House that after the meeting of the 
ministers of finance in Montreal the Ontario minister of finance 
had committed Ontario to cut taxes. That evidently was not the 
case, if I believe what the hon. Leader of the Opposition is 
saying today.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, last Tuesday, 
the Solicitor General boasted that, in the last three months, the 
RCMP had seized some 80,000 cartons of contraband cigarettes.
<P>
	Had the minister done a simple calculation with the figures 
quoted by the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
he would have realized that in the last three months, while the 
RCMP seized a truckload and a half of contraband cigarettes, 
some 360 truckloads were smuggled into Canada. What a sieve!
<P>
	Can the Solicitor General tell us, given the lack of results 
achieved by the RCMP, what additional resources he intends to 
give them to make them more effective?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add to the information I gave the House a few days 
ago. In 1993, the RCMP made over 4,600 seizures and laid more 
than 1,250 charges in Quebec alone. This is quite a respectable 
record.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, just 
yesterday the Prime Minister was asking for more information 
before taking action, while the RCMP is now telling us that it is 
very well informed, that cigarette smuggling networks are 
branching out into luxury items such as clothing, jewelry and 
alcohol. How can the Prime Minister explain that the RCMP is 
not acting, except for political reasons?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is well known that the RCMP is very independent and does its 
job as the law requires. Any accusation to the effect that it has 
political orders not to act is totally false. We have clearly 
instructed the RCMP to take all necessary measures to stop this 
smuggling.

my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="887"> 887 </A></B>
<P>
	None of us in the House question the value and importance of 
immigration, but legitimate questions exist concerning the 
appropriate levels of immigration. As the minister knows, 2.3 
million Canadians are either unemployed or underemployed, the 
welfare rolls are bulging and governments cannot finance the 
current level of social services.
<P>
	Under these circumstances is the minister absolutely 
convinced in his own mind that maintaining immigration levels 
at the current level of 250,000 per year is in the national 
interest?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, we consulted Canadians in the last 
election. One of the commitments we made in the red book was a 
commitment to move our immigration policy toward a 1 per cent 
level. That commitment was not undertaken lightly. That 
commitment had the foresight of some study and analysis.
<P>
	The Economic Council of Canada, for instance in its 1993 
report, suggested moving toward 1 per cent and doing so 
gradually. It also said that the net economic impact of every 
immigrant is approximately $2,000. If we multiply that by the 
levels we are looking at, it is half a million dollars only in the 
calculation of net economic benefits to immigrants without 
talking about job creation and entrepreneurship.
<P>
	We feel it is a balanced approach. We talked about reuniting 
families. We talked about bringing in skills that people in the 
country need and the skills that our economies require, as well 
as maintaining our international obligations toward those who 
legitimately seek our refuge as they do across the country.
<P>
	Yes, we believe it is a balanced approach and on balance will 
help the country grow as former immigration movements have 
done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the minister for his answer. In light of his answer can the 
minister prove, by laying before the House a detailed cost 
benefit analysis or other evidence, that maintaining 
immigration at the level of 250,000 immigrants per year is a net 
economic benefit to Canada?
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, we tabled the immigration plan at 
three o'clock yesterday. At one o'clock we briefed my 
respective critics. At 12.28 yesterday on CP wire, without an 
iota of a figure being deposited, his hon. critic for immigration 
said the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Immigrants are choking welfare systems, contributing to high 
unemployment, and many cannot read.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Before the hon. leader gets up and preaches and requests 
analyses from this side of the House, I ask him to check with his 
members so as not to suggest things that are not borne out in fact 
but are more borne out in fiction and mythology.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> More, more.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In the heat of exchange I know my colleagues 
sometimes forget the Speaker. I know it is an oversight because 
here I am. However I wish you would direct your responses and 
your questions through me, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question for the minister.
<P>
	If the minister were to be presented with studies that 
maintaining immigration levels at the 250,000 level under 
current circumstances does not produce a net economic benefit 
to Canada, would the minister consider lowering the level?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, a number of studies have been 
produced in terms of the relationship between net immigration 
and net economic benefit. In fact, if I were to say something, 
there probably would not be enough studies in the current time 
to correlate those two forces a little more precisely.
<P>
	I know the Reform Party has often used and basically 
exclusively used the C. D. Howe report done by Daniel Stoffman 
as a compass for suggesting that it should be reduced to 150,000. 
Even in the C. D. Howe Institute report Mr. Stoffman concludes 
that, at the very worst, net immigration is neutral on the 
economic benefits that immigrants bring.
<P>
	Compared to that we have the Economic Council of Canada 
that shows a $2,000 net benefit. We have the report by Dr. 
Rosalyn Kunin in 1991 who studied the economic impact of 
business. Between 1986 and 1990 she concluded that 80,000 
new direct jobs were created, a contribution during that time of 
$3 billion to GDP.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that during that time 10 per cent of 
all business activity-and I would be more than happy to table 
this-across the country was created by business immigrants. 
There are studies that prove immigrants are not a weight on the 
country. We should be forging ahead with the knowledge that the 
immigration policy adds dynamism to the country.

Speaker, my question is for the minister of immigration.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec has agreed to accept 40,000 
immigrants this year, or about one-sixth of the total the minister 
has announced he will admit to Canada. Quebec has one-quarter 
of Canada's population. If we extrapolate the number of 
immigrants Quebec believes it can absorb, the national figure 
would be 160,000 immigrants.
<P>
	Could the minister explain why the number of immigrants 
Quebec believes it can absorb differs to such a large degree from 
the number the minister thinks our country can absorb?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, there is 
a Quebec-Canada immigration accord. Quebec has a selection 
with respect to independent and business immigration. 
Obviously it also assumes a family class and refugee class under 
the federal guideline.
<P>
	The hon. member's party is suggesting that the figure be 
150,000. I know what you are against but I also want to know 
what you are in favour of. If you want to cut 100,000 
immigrants, as your party is advocating, I would like to know 
where you are going to cut. Are you going to cut from the family 
class since your party preaches-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I am sure the minister will want to direct 
his response to the Chair. It makes it much easier. Would the 
hon. minister like to conclude.
<P>

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. As I understand it this is a question and

although there are many questions unasked we want to hear 
both.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, has the minister consulted the other provinces in 
determining the new immigration level, especially in light of 
Quebec's decision to accept fewer immigrants?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, in 
preparation for the 1994 levels that we tabled yesterday all 
provinces were consulted. Those consultations took place in 
1993.
<P>
	Not only were they consulted, but the member's own province 
as late as last week faxed us a list of designated classes that the 
business and economic communities of British Columbia would 
like us to bring in as independents. We have done that. 
Forty-four per cent of all immigrants in 1994 will be those 
selected based on the skills that our economy needs.
<P>
	British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have 
all requested certain trades and skills. We are trying to 
co-operate with the provinces so that we as one slice of 
immigration can have immigrants come to the country to fill 
economic niches that the federal government has designated in 
full co-operation with each and every single province.

not to authorize any cruise missile tests in 1994 before the

	Members will know that in August 1993 the previous

that we will be having foreign policy and defence reviews in the

question is for the minister of immigration. The minister's 
department is struggling with a backlog of more than 14,000 
refugee claims from persons already in Canada. Social services 
are also struggling with the flow of refugees, something the 
minister acknowledged when he announced that refugee 
claimants would be allowed to find work.
<P>
	Why is the government increasing the number of refugees 
Canada will admit when we are already unable to deal 
compassionately with the current numbers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, as part of our immigration levels 
the government is committed to international obligations. The 
member rises from his seat today, as he did yesterday, and 
simply casts out of hand that we should not have had as many 
refugees in the country or we should not honour obligations with 
respect to allowing those individuals to have fair and speedy 
hearings.
<P>
	What we did yesterday not only maintained our obligations 
under the United Nations High Commission on Refugees. We 
have encouraged private communities to sponsor refugees, not 
only because we believe there are more cost benefits in that they 
absorb settlement costs but also because when communities 
come forward prepared to accept refugees it is a celebration of 
what the program is all about.
<P>
	The hon. member also spoke about welfare rolls. We should 
talk about facts as opposed to creating the perception and the 
myth that every refugee who comes to the country goes on 
welfare.
<P>
	According to the Ontario government some 4 per cent of the 
615,000 applications for social welfare assistance in Ontario 
alone in 1993 were refugee claimants. Within that figure there is 
some abuse this side is interested in, but I would urge the 
member to set the context of his deliberations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question for the minister on a related issue. The 
Ontario government has already asked for an additional $110 
million for immigrant programs. In response, the minister said: 
``You have to be a realist. There are limited dollars available in 
the pool''. Why does the minister not reduce the number of 
immigrants until the government is able to properly support 
these newcomers to Canada?
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had a meeting with my provincial 
counterparts in Ontario. For the first time the Ontario 
government has signalled an interest in entering into a 
federal-provincial agreement on immigration. Only three 
provinces do not have current agreements.
<P>
	The government has signalled its intention to accept the 
request of the Ontario government and the Ontario government 
has made a request for federal assistance for resettlement.
<P>
	Unlike the former government, this government is prepared to 
listen to Ontario's concerns. We will work with our provincial 
partners as well as those at the municipal level on behalf of all 
Canadians which is something the people want.
<P>
	I simply said something that the hon. member and his party 
have been saying every day. We have a fixed amount of dollars 
available in the federal treasury. In fact, the member has made a 
campaign of talking about  deficit reduction. I thought I was

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister admitted that the government would 
put parliamentarians before a fait accompli regarding the 
appointment of the new CBC President, thus refusing to subject 
this appointment to the approval of the House, and that is now a 
done thing.
<P>
	Since the government decided to impose its own choice, will 
the minister undertake to give members of the parliamentary 
committee on Canadian Heritage the list of candidates who 
submitted their resume to Mrs. Collenette, the wife of the 
Minister of National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, obviously, the hon. member and I disagree on how 
appointments should be made. But I want to point out that the 
appointment of a person is a rather confidential process. Many 
candidates are eligible; many have a chance of being selected 
for the job but, in the end, there can only be one appointment. In 
my opinion, it would not be reasonable to publicly reveal the 
names, and there are quite a few, of those who were not selected 
for the position. Therefore, it is not my intention to make public 
the list of those who could have got the position which was filled 
today.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to ensure greater transparency, the minister might 
consider tabling this list to the committee, in camera.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. Since the minister refused to 
consult the committee, will he at least tell this House what were 
the true criteria used for the appointment of the new President?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, there is no such thing as true or false criteria. There are 
only criteria, and the main ones were suggested by the CBC 
itself, because these people know what they are doing and they 
know how important such an appointment is.
<P>
	We are quite willing to listen and, in fact, we did listen not 
only to their advice but also to the advice provided by those who 
take an interest in this issue. I already said that we had come up 
with a long list, following an announcement in the <I>Canada 
Gazette</I>, and I am pleased to repeat again that the president, 
whom I want to congratulate, will gladly meet the parliamentary 
committees interested in hearing him.

and congratulate her on her first question in the House of

	I am pleased to reply to the hon. member that due to the efforts 
of the Minister of Trade, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
officials of my department I can announce today that the 
European Community, after examining Canada's fish inspection 
program, has agreed to exempt all Canadian fish products from 
EC mandatory inspections.

<P>
	Given the horrendous cost to the health of Canadians, to our

and more deaths earlier than the combined total of traffic

government will do everything in its power to discourage 
smoking, particularly among the youth of Canada including the 
maintenance of high prices. There is a proven relationship 
between cigarette price and cigarette consumption.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have had many discussions with my colleagues on this issue.
<P>
	We are very concerned that the smuggling problem we are 
facing now is seriously undermining years of policy building 
that has resulted in a reduction in smoking among Canadians. 
We are seeing an increase in smoking among young people 
especially that is very troubling.
<P>
	We must act to restore the reduction in smoking among the 
Canadian population and any action this government takes will 
take all of these factors into consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
applaud the minister's strong representations within cabinet. I 
would like to ask specifically if the minister has asked the 
minister of revenue to ensure that tax policies will not be 
fashioned to protect the tobacco industry or to cave in to law 
breakers, that is to cave in to people who would break the law, or 
to extract more taxes from people addicted already to cigarettes.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The results of two studies released by the National Cancer 
Institute of the United States show that the incidence of colon 
and rectal cancer is higher among smokers than non-smokers. 
Also recent statistics show that lung cancer has now passed 
breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths among 
women.
<P>
	Does the Department of Finance officially recognize the role 
that cigarette smoking plays in the incidence of many cancers, 
heart and lung disease and that proposed reductions in the tax on 
cigarettes would increase both smoking and the incidence of 
these diseases?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, this side of the House is under no 
illusion as to the health effects of smoking. Whatever action we 
take, as has been so well articulated by the Minister of Health, 
will be taken with a view to mitigating those effects. The 
government must make sure that smokers in this country 
understand full well the dangers they are running in smoking 
and that we will not allow Canadian health to be jeopardized.
<P>
	Having said this, the only thing I would raise is the necessity 
for some consistency of view. It was pointed out to me that the 
member for Calgary North has expressed quite publicly her 
support for a reduction in the taxes.
<P>
	I might say to the leader of the Reform Party that some 
consistency of view from that side of the House would certainly 
help the Canadian people in understanding where his party is 
coming from.

	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. I would 
like to ask the Minister of Finance if he feels he will be able to 
fairly consider the reintroduction of an export tax as the best 
way to discourage both smoking and smuggling.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted to answer the 
member's question, although I think that he himself ought to 
feel a little ashamed in asking it.
<P>
	The fact is that I was on the board of Imasco. I joined the 
board. It is a company which is controlled from abroad. As a 
strong Canadian nationalist I was asked to join because it was 
very important that Canadians be represented on that board of 
directors.
<P>
	It is a company which is involved in a great number of 
ventures within this country and is creating an enormous amount 
of employment in many areas that have nothing to do with 
tobacco. It also happens to be something that is in the private 
sector which I thought his party was supposed to understand.
<P>
	I would not have thought it necessary to stand up in this House 
and say this. Let me try to say this very clearly and very calmly. 
Many members have experience in a wide number of areas. One 
of the tremendous things one would hope is that having all these 
new members and the ability to create a new atmosphere is that 
they bring that experience to this House. Some of them may well 
have experience which conflicts with what the government is 
doing and things the Canadian people want to see happen. But I 
would never want to see any member stand in this House and say 
that someone's experience or background prejudices his or her 
decision.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a new 
member of Parliament it has been very interesting to uncover 
many of the ideas and directions that seem to permeate 
politically correct thinking on Parliament Hill and within the 
news media. Yesterday was a classic example when the minister 
of immigration stood in the House and told Canadians we were 
going to be receiving an additional quarter million immigrants 
in the next 12 months.
<P>
	I suggest the expressions of concern around coffee tables or 
living rooms last evening in the homes of many Canadians were 
not reflected in the minister's quota. It was particularly 
instructive yesterday when the immigration critic for the 
Reform Party stood in the House. There were expressions of 
humour and derision from some of the Liberal Party members 
when he made the statement that the Reform Party was not 
opposed to immigration.
<P>
	We stand for a balanced approach to immigration based on 
economic need and benefits to Canada. Clearly some of the 
Liberal members have prejudged that the Reform Party is 
anti-immigration and therefore found his statement humourous. 
Of course the concept of prejudging is the root of the word 
prejudice.
<P>
	We all judge statements and actions by other individuals in 
the light of our own experience or sometimes unfounded 
assumptions. Perhaps an old line party like the Liberals should 
take instruction from the fate of the other old line party which 
was decimated in the most recent election.
<P>
	I make these statements as a preamble to suggest that the old, 
tired, worn out concepts which have led to a crisis in many 
Canadian families relating to child care clearly have not been 
successful. Perhaps government members would be well 
advised to assume Reform Party MPs and the ordinary 
Canadians who they represent share the same concerns that they 
do.
<P>
	We want what is in the best interest of Canada, for Canadians 
and especially our nation's children. Do not prejudge our ideas 
that may be interpreted in so-called code words, because I 
choose to speak in clear, concise, simple English. There is no 
other meaning that is contained in these clear, concise words.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports child care programs that subsidize 
financial need, not the method of child care chosen and that 
subsidize children and parents, not institutions and 
professionals. The Reform Party supports government 
regulation of day care standards. The Reform Party opposes 
state run day care.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Reform Party policy is generated through a bottom up, 
grassroots approach where hundreds of thousands plus of our 
members have an opportunity, indeed a responsibility, to give 
direction to their representatives in the House.
<P>
	There are many Canadians who feel any government subsidies 
or expenditures by government in support of child care must be 
balanced and do away with a system that is complex, inequitable 
and inadequate.
<P>
	The Prime Minister in a year end interview with <I>Maclean's</I> 
magazine stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Day care is an economic program as much as a social program, because if you 
have a good system of day care you create more jobs. The people who want to 
work will be able to do so and the people who take care of the children will have 
new jobs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Prime Minister acknowledges the element of social 
engineering that drives the economic considerations.
<P>
	What about those parents who choose to stay home and excel 
in the job of homemaker? Should we have a taxation and benefit 
system in Canada that fundamentally forces parents out of their 
homes? We support parents and those responsible for bringing 
up children who choose to work outside the home. However I 
submit we are the only party that equally supports parents who 
choose the worthy vocation of working within the home as the 
homemaker.
<P>
	Following a thorough study I would visualize the Reform 
Party supporting an increase in the per child personal tax 
exemption and amending tax rates so that a single income family 
earning $60,000 annually pays no more tax than a two income 
family where each parent earns $30,000. This would work to use 
the tax code to be fair to families that choose to have one income 
earner rather than two.
<P>
	Let me express some of the concerns to the House that some 
Canadians have with respect to institutionalized child care. 
They cite studies that show children put into day care at an early 
age having difficulty forming affectionate and trusting 
relationships later on. I am not stating that there is any 
conclusive evidence of this, but I am stating it is a concern for 
many Canadians. My own personal sentiment is that in the vast 
majority of cases day care is, after all, a poor substitute for a 
child's own mother or father.
<P>
	To subsidize state run day care and not give equal subsidy to 
families that choose alternatives is prejudicial and has the 
potential of forcing children into a situation that many parents in 
Canada reject.
<P>
	We want to promote policies in which single parents who are 
either forced to work or choose to work outside the home have 
the option of entrusting the well-being of their children to other 
family members or close friends. Should their situation not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="895"> 895 </A></B>
<P>
receive equal subsidy? With government subsidy of only state 
run day care Canada closes the option of parents exercising their 
responsibility  to choose what they judge best for themselves 
and for their family.
<P>
	We are very conscious of the tragic situations such as the 
situation which has led to the Martensville trial in 
Saskatchewan. We are aware that there are many other 
circumstances wherein children are not being properly cared for 
in unlicensed day care facilities. This is why I restate that the 
Reform Party supports government regulation of day care 
standards.
<P>
	We are also concerned with the impact that unlicensed day 
care has on the so-called underground economy where there is a 
reward for not declaring income derived from what is 
essentially an in-home business. We view with concern the 
changes that the Conservative government brought to child 
benefits and other social programs through what has been 
described as a skilful exercise in the politics of stealth.
<P>
	Without an informed and open public debate Canadian social 
policy especially in the area of child care is wandering aimlessly 
without thorough discussion, study or input from concerned 
Canadians. It is important that members of the House go out of 
their way to inform their constituents of details and background 
on this and many other issues so that concerned Canadians will 
be empowered to give meaningful input to the political process 
and indeed to the direction of the government with respect to 
family issues.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	We must listen to our constituents because I believe that the 
answers to these problems lie outside this Chamber and reside in 
the homes of our citizens. Discussions in restaurants, coffee 
shops, living rooms and around kitchen tables should be the 
source of intelligent direction for this House.
<P>
	In the government's order for today's debate it requested 
broad consultation to analyse and make recommendations 
regarding the modernization and structuring of Canada's social 
security system with particular reference to the needs of 
families with children.
<P>
	As a Reform Party member I am speaking for the ordinary 
Canadian whose voice is not normally heard in this Chamber or 
indeed in front of standing committees. I believe there are 
countless millions of Canadians who are not represented by the 
vocal special interest groups. They reject the vision of child care 
that includes state intrusion into the family. Social 
responsibility, yes; social engineering, no.
<P>
	Those voices are calling for a balanced system of taxation, 
regulation and direction from the government which will treat 
all Canadians, all families, all parents equally. They want social 
engineering by the government terminated. It has been said, and 
I agree, that a nation is no stronger than its most basic unit: the 
family.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all let me congratulate the hon. member for his comments. 
While I listened with great interest I was glad to see him in the 
course of his remarks switch from the term day care to child 
care. In fact as we well know the more relevant term that reflects 
the reality of our society right now is child care. Many children 
need that care at various times throughout the day and therefore 
the traditional term is very much out of place. I was pleased to 
hear him shift to the appropriate term.
<P>
	That is simply not a matter of political correctness. It reflects 
the reality in our society today and the fact that so many children 
need care outside the home. I say unfortunately because I agree 
with him that certainly a parent is the best provider of care for 
one's child, if that is possible.
<P>
	This leads me to my question. I wonder if the hon. member 
would support a measure which would, through the Income Tax 
Act, reflect a credit to a parent? Let us be candid. Usually that 
would be the mother, but not necessarily always. Would the hon. 
member support a measure which would give a tax credit to a 
parent who, in fact, chooses to stay home and provide full-time 
care for the child?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member's 
question I offer a qualified yes. I say that there must be a balance 
so that there is the ability for parents to choose what is best for 
their children. If in fact a child tax credit is the best way to go 
about doing it or the measure that he had suggested is the best 
way of going about doing it, I would support it but it is a 
qualified yes.
<P>
	My qualification is that at this point I do not believe nor do 
any of the members of our party believe that the country is in a 
position to actually take an action like that. If it was revenue 
neutral I would suspect it would find support within our party.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
working mom who has had two children in day care or child care 
I really object to the tone of the hon. member when he seems to 
suggest that my children have had an inferior upbringing. I 
would like to attest to the fact that my children have proven 
themselves to be admirable members of their community and 
have contributed a great deal.
<P>
	Could the hon. member please give us a precise definition of 
what social engineering is?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, through our taxation system 
frequently there are situations where it is beneficial for our 
citizens to take particular actions. I cite as an example the 
situation I mentioned in my speech where right now under our 
taxation it works to a net benefit to a family to have two income 
earners at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="896"> 896 </A></B>
<P>
$30,000 rather than one income earner at $60,000 and yet the 
gross income before taxation is equal.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	I suggest that kind of policy forces the situation where people 
make choices. I am not suggesting for a second that the choice a 
family may make when two people determine it is in their best 
interests and the best interests of their family that there should 
be two wage earners, that that is an inferior decision, not for a 
minute. What I am suggesting is that by the taxation act as it 
presently exists it works in a prejudicial manner against those 
who choose to have one income earner.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make a short comment. I do not think we have to oppose a 
daycare system sponsored by the government and daycare 
services at home.
<P>
	Ideally, we should have a system whereby parents can choose 
between two solutions according to their values and the 
circumstances. I spent my whole life in education, and I can 
confirm that for some children day care was very traumatic and a 
source of serious problems. This might have nothing to do with 
the daycare operation itself, but could be linked to the lack of 
resources. Clearly, daycare centres do not always offer the 
quality of service they should. I believe that parents who do not 
want to send their children to daycare centres should have a 
choice, although it remains to be determined whether this choice 
should carry with it social benefits. I think this would be a proof 
of respect for the parents' values.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do not believe this is a question. Does 
the hon. member wish to comment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. It seems to me 
that immediately before Question Period the member for 
Kitchener spoke and if I heard correctly the person in the Chair 
at that time said there would be an opportunity for five minutes 
of commentary and questions on his remarks.
<P>
	I wonder if that is the case.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Thank you for raising that point. In 
fact I am told that the member you just spoke of was not in his 
seat at two o'clock. Therefore his 10 minutes of comments or 
questions expired because he was not here.
<P>
	Other members might wish to know this too. If you do not 
show up, you do not get your questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are proud of the social programs we have built 
together. We are proud of our sense of fairness and justice. We 
care when people are unemployed. We care when people are 
poor. Together we have built social programs which are the envy 
of the world, from medicare to the old age pension.
<P>
	We Canadians are also proud of our common sense. Today 
common sense tells us that we must rebuild and improve our 
social programs to meet the new needs and challenges of the 
1990s.
<P>
	We need to reform and strengthen our social system so that we 
can provide all Canadians with a fair chance to seize the 
opportunities of the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Liberal Party was the architect of major social reforms in 
this country. With the assistance and the proposals of all 
Canadians, the new Liberal government intends to pursue its 
social work.
<P>
	We cannot allow nor do we want to allow past successes to 
prevent us from seeing the need for change. Our goal is to 
change our income support programs without threatening our 
values of fairness and compassion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the past we have created programs which have substantially 
reduced poverty among senior citizens. Now we must forge 
creative programs to reduce the poverty among children. There 
is really something wrong when in a country as wealthy as 
Canada over one million Canadian children use food banks 
every year.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	We know that when children live in poverty they get sick more 
frequently, they do worse in school, they have fewer chances to 
succeed. We owe it to our children to ensure that all of them have 
a chance to succeed in life. That is why I welcomed the 
announcement by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development that Parliament will hold immediate, wide ranging 
and open public hearings on reforming Canada's social system. 
The task before us is mammoth but we owe it to Canada's 
children to succeed. We need the wisdom and the input of as 
many Canadians as possible and that is why these public 
hearings are so vital.
<P>
	Just as we must act to confront the problems of children living 
in poverty, so we must act to confront the problems of teenagers 
who drop out of high school. In the last three years alone the 
number of jobs held by high school dropouts has decreased by 
17.2 per cent. We cannot leave these young people permanently 
stuck on a dead end street. We need to rethink our apprenticeship 
programs. We need to rethink our training programs. We need to 
give young Canadians a chance.
<P>
	The government's plan to introduce the youth service corps is 
an excellent start, but we acknowledge that it is only a start. We 
need to find new ways of guaranteeing that young Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="897"> 897 </A></B>
<P>
have both basic reading and math skills and also the skills they 
will need in the knowledge-based industries of the future.
<P>
	The bottom line is that we have to provide young Canadians 
with the skills to get off and stay off social assistance. That is the 
right thing to do both ethically and economically.
<P>
	As we consider the realities of the 1990s we must remember 
the plight of hundreds of thousands of Canadians who have lost 
their jobs during the recent recession. There are so many decent, 
hard-working people who have lost their jobs as a result of 
massive layoffs. These are Canadians who have been robbed of 
their dignity through no fault of their own.
<P>
	We must consider during our public hearings what new hope, 
what new help, what new training we can provide for older 
workers who have lost their jobs. How can we help these older 
workers regain their dignity?
<P>
	I am not talking about doing favours for people. I am talking 
about making sure that we tap the talents of all Canadians and 
allow all Canadians to play a role in building a vibrant and 
prosperous society.
<P>
	As we think together about how to improve Canada's social 
programs during changing times, we must focus on the reality 
that Canada's population is aging. How do we cope with this new 
reality? More important, how do we enable senior citizens to 
remain active and independent members of society? How do we 
start tapping the invaluable resources that senior citizens 
provide?
<P>
	One answer to all these problems is to say that it is just too 
bad. It is too bad that some kids are poor. It is too bad that a lot of 
teenagers have dropped out. It is too bad that older workers have 
no prospects. It is too bad that senior citizens are kept from 
making a contribution. That is one response, but it is not the 
Liberal answer and I do not think it is the Canadian answer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians will solve these problems. We are really concerned 
with social programs and Canadians will be very happy to have 
the opportunity to express themselves during these public 
consultations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians who are in dire financial straits need help to 
survive. They also need help to get off and stay off social 
assistance. Part of the solution lies in greater job creation and 
the government has already indicated its commitment to this 
end.
<P>
	Another part of the solution lies in redesigning our social 
programs so that Canadians are equipped to fill those new jobs.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	In the months and years ahead all of us must work together to 
reform our social programs so that we can end poverty in this 
country.
<P>
	The lessons of the great depression led a Liberal government 
to introduce unemployment insurance. The need to fuel a 
post-war economy led a Liberal government to introduce family 
allowance. The need to offer more people a chance at higher 
education led a Liberal government to introduce Canada's 
student loans.
<P>
	The Liberal government of today is prepared to meet the 
social needs of the present from child poverty to opportunities 
for our youth, to laid off workers, to an aging population. We 
want to strengthen our social system and we want to include the 
Canadian public in the process.
<P>
	We believe that the healthiest changes, the best changes, are 
made when Canadians agree to the changes together.
<P>
	I look forward to the public hearings on these vital issues in 
my own riding of Hamilton Mountain and I look forward to 
hearing the views of Canadians right across our land.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting in the dialogue between political parties that we 
always seem to end up at the same point.
<P>
	During the course of this election it was very interesting to me 
that the Liberal candidate in my riding went out of his way to 
make sure that people in our constituency felt comfortable with 
the fact that the Liberal government would not do anything, or 
had no plans with respect to social programs. We may recall very 
briefly that during the course of the election the former Prime 
Minister with the summer job also was really taken on in the 
area when she suggested that there might be some look at or 
revision of social programs.
<P>
	I wonder if the member might not agree that it would have 
been helpful to the Canadian public if they had been made aware 
that in fact the Liberals when they became government were 
going to be doing a complete review; if it might not have been 
helpful for them to make a judgment based on what appears to 
have been a predetermined plan.
<P>
	I suggest that there has been a situation in Canada during this 
election process where our party told the Canadian people about 
our plans, though they may be open to question, and that the 
social program had to be looked at if it was going to be 
maintained.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Phinney:</B> I am surprised that perhaps the hon. member 
has not read the red book. I thought everybody had read the red 
book by now. All the way through that red book it explains that 
we were going to keep the social net; that there would be nobody 
falling through it; that we would make sure all the protection 
that has been there in the past will be there in the future, but that 
there will be changes. There would be consultation. We would 
bring Canadians in to allow them to express what they felt about 
the programs and the state that they are in.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="898"> 898 </A></B>
<P>
	I agree with you that the response by the former Prime 
Minister-and we can appreciate why she is not the Prime 
Minister now-felt that there was not enough time during the 
campaign to talk about what she had to say about the social 
programs. Probably that was more because she did not have 
anything to say about the social programs rather than because 
there was not enough time.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased that the member for Hamilton Mountain 
has placed such an emphasis on youth as well as our studying of 
the social programs. I think that is very important.
<P>
	We know our youth has an unemployment rate of about 20 per 
cent right now and we know that in the future career changes for 
youth will be four to five significant career changes. These are 
real career changes. These are not simply moving up the ladder 
or sideways, or into something a little bit different. This will be 
totally different career changes.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	This is a really different world and we are all very much aware 
of that. It is absolutely imperative that we look at all groups but 
youth is our future. That is why I am particularly pleased that the 
member for Hamilton Mountain did place such an emphasis on 
youth.
<P>
	My question has to do with the apprenticeship program that 
the red book, now famous of course, talks about. We know that 
an apprenticeship program is extremely positive and it is a good 
way to go.
<P>
	It is my belief from the background that I have had it is really 
important that when we implement an apprenticeship program 
we bring in all partners: labour, business, industry as well as 
education.
<P>
	Therefore I am wondering if the member for Hamilton 
Mountain could comment on that and the importance of making 
sure that those groups are not forgotten.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Phinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is perfectly 
right.
<P>
	The apprenticeship programs are very important. We have 
seen in other countries how much this can contribute to the 
future of individual youth and also to the country.
<P>
	One of the problems in the past is that all the people involved 
in the apprenticeship programs were not consulted, in particular 
on the needs in a community. Before people were registered in 
an apprenticeship program or by the time they got through a year 
and a half of it they realized that they were never going to get a 
job when they finished the program. They quit and the drop-out 
rate was about half.
<P>
	What we are planning to do now is to make sure that those 
groups, including labour, are consulted and that the courses we 
offer for apprenticeship programs will mean that youth 
afterwards can get a job.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is my first time to rise and speak on 
the floor.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate you on your appointment. I look 
forward to working with you. I would like to congratulate 
everyone here for being elected. Obviously constituents felt that 
members were worthy of that trust and have sent them here.
<P>
	I would like to apologize to the members across the floor from 
the Bloc Quebec for not speaking to them in French. It is a sign 
of respect. I am afraid I do not have the confidence quite yet to 
attempt to do it. Never mind, I will be doing it soon.
<P>
	My riding is Vancouver Centre. I do not want to go into the 
geographical and regional description of Vancouver Centre. 
What I want to tell members about Vancouver Centre is that it is 
a microcosm of Canada.
<P>
	Vancouver Centre represents on the one hand some of the 
wealthiest people in this country. On the other hand, it 
represents people who live in abject poverty in one-room hotels 
in the middle of the riding. I therefore feel that I can speak with 
some authority on the problems that we are facing today in terms 
of our economic and social problems.
<P>
	The reason I lump both of those into one is that they are not 
single problems. We cannot in any way remove or separate the 
problem of economic disorder that we have in our country from 
the problem of looking at our social programs. They are totally 
and completely interdependent.
<P>
	A strong social program-I do not like to use the words safety 
net-a strong sense of social responsibility is very important if 
we are to look at economic growth. Unemployment has a major 
impact on our ability to gain revenue. Unemployment drains our 
coffers of money that we pay for unemployment insurance.
<P>
	When unemployment insurance expires, our coffers are 
further drained by helping people who are on welfare. On the 
other hand, if we have people working and contributing they 
contribute to the wealth of this country not only economically 
but in terms of their self-esteem.
<P>
	I am a family physician and I have yet to meet, in fact the 
number of people I know is very small who want to stay on 
welfare and who want to be unemployed. People want to work. It 
has everything to do not just with money but with self-esteem, a 
sense of self-worth and a sense of contributing to the growth and 
future of our country. This is why we cannot separate these two 
issues.
<P>
	I would like to speak to the motion because I believe that the 
motion made by the hon. Minister of Human Resources 
Development is a very important one. I do not understand how 
we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="899"> 899 </A></B>
<P>
could be debating it at all. We should all be saying that we agree 
with it.
<P>
	Really all the motion is asking is for us to look at ways in 
which we could change, modernize and up-date our social 
system. This needs to happen. We cannot have an inflexible 
system. We are moving into the 21st century. Our needs have 
changed. Our economic way of living has changed. We need to 
look at how we do things to make them not only more efficient 
but more applicable to the needs of the people and more cost 
effective.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	It does not mean that we are talking about cutting programs. 
We are talking about making them more efficient. The minister 
has invited not only all of the members across the floor in both 
opposition parties, but he has invited the people of Canada, the 
provinces, the municipalities and non-governmental 
organizations to work together to find that common ground.
<P>
	It is not a coincidence that the Liberal Party was elected with a 
specific mandate to find that common ground. Nor is it a 
coincidence that when we put our red book forward it contained 
a total package of a plan for the future of this country. It is in fact 
because of a strong Liberal tradition and heritage that the 
Liberal Party has recognized the need for a socially responsible 
society.
<P>
	Socially responsible means allowing people the dignity of 
working, as the Prime Minister has said so often, and allowing 
them to do so by giving them the skills to enable them to get to 
that position.
<P>
	There are always going to be people in our country who will 
not be able to realize their full potential by working. We will 
always have among us people who will be disabled in some way. 
That is the social safety net. However the ability to bring people 
into realizing their full potential is the Liberal way. That is what 
this motion does.
<P>
	This motion speaks to making our system more applicable and 
more able to move us further into the 21st century so that 
Canadians can become strongly independent people, 
recognizing their full potential and able to contribute to this 
country. That is all the motion states.
<P>
	The debates I hear are pre-empting the results of that kind of 
consultation around this country. They have pre-empted it. That 
is one of the problems that people have always had with our 
political system. We have never allowed a process of 
consultation to work. We sit and indulge in rhetoric. We score 
points on each other by trying to say that this is what we are 
going to be doing and what we are not going to be doing.
<P>
	The motion is clear. It asks for our co-operation and our 
commitment to looking at how we change our system. It asks no 
more than that. It is a promise that the Liberal government 
made. It is a promise in the red book. Everyone has heard about 
the red book. It is not a magic book. It has not some wondrous 
tone that one has to have a Ph.D. in literature to understand. It is 
a simple articulation of the core value of the Canadian people,  
which is what we and our Prime Minister seem to have been able 
to articulate very well.
<P>
	It has been two years in the making. We consulted not just 
with Liberals but with people all across the country and around 
the world regardless of their political stripe. We brought them in 
to talk about the need for change, to look at not changing the 
bottom line, which is a strong sense of fiscal discipline together 
with social responsibility, but how we can do that differently.
<P>
	It is obvious that the old ways have not worked. It is obvious 
that the solutions we used in the past were useless. We are 
saying: ``Let us work together to change this, to make it 
different''.
<P>
	I do not even know why we are debating this motion, hon. 
colleagues across the floor and within my own party. It is 
obvious to me that it is the only course of action we must take. 
What I would like to ask of members instead is that they come 
together with us in this endeavour, that they co-operate, that 
they help to consult and that they help to make the difference.
<P>
	People have elected us for change. They have elected all of us, 
the Reform Party and the Liberal Party across Canada, to help 
move this country forward so that we can be globally 
competitive and that our individual Canadians can be 
independent. That is what we would like members to do. Let us 
do it together so that we can create a country that we can all, 
regardless of our political stripe, be proud of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the member for Vancouver Centre. The Liberal 
Party had nine years in opposition to consult and we received 
this little red book. What does the member think the Liberal 
government can do in nine months? It is not time for a decision.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am afraid I do not understand the 
member's question very well. He said that the Liberal 
government has had nine years to consult. Is that the question?
<P>
	The Liberal government has been in opposition for the last 
nine years. It has not been a position to set the course for this 
country. Now that the Liberals are in government it has taken the 
bull by the horns. We have not sat around and gazed at our navel. 
We have decided on a plan of action. Let us get on with it. There 
is a time line to this. We promised to follow a specific time line 
and we are going to do it. A report will be ready by September 
1994 and we are saying, help us to do it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
delighted by the comments of the hon. member.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="900"> 900 </A></B>
<P>
	What I am about to say is not a challenge to the member in the 
least. She made a statement about lumping social policy and 
economics together. Indeed they are an interdependent 
coupling.
<P>
	My concern is the rhetorical piece that is the red book for me 
does not have the economic elements within it that satisfy what 
we must do for Canadians to get them back to work.
<P>
	My daughter is 22 years old and does not have a job, although 
she has a university education. She says: ``Mom, please do not 
come back home and say you can do nothing''. It is the rhetoric 
that is my concern. If we are going to co-operate it is incumbent 
upon us to look at economic policies and marry that with social 
policy. That is how I hope we can co-operate in this House.
<P>
	In my view the debate has helped to push us along that path.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to hear that the hon. 
member and I have much in common. I have a 25 year old who 
has a university education and not able to find work either. We 
have all come here with the same bottom line. We are all looking 
for the same things.
<P>
	I do take exception to the fact that the hon. member said the 
red book is long on rhetoric. The red book is very long on 
specifics. These are the plans of action into which we are now 
moving. The immigration plan is clearly set out the red book; 
our economy plan is clearly set out in the red book and our social 
policy is clearly set out the red book.
<P>
	She has asked that we marry the two and look at a way to bring 
them together. That is precisely what this motion speaks to.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, reading, writing and understanding even a very simple 
text is still a problem for many of our fellow citizens. The 
problem is even worse for the illiterate and has a negative 
impact on the development of our society as a whole. In my 
speech I would like to expand on the various aspects of this 
problem.
<P>
	In this country, one adult out of four can neither read nor write 
sufficiently well to meet the requirements of daily life. It may 
seem hard to understand that in 1994, this kind of problem 
exists, even among young people, since schooling has been 
compulsory for more than 50 years. In fact, today, a whole 
generation is paying the price of the school reforms that took 
place in the 60s.
<P>
	However, schools are not the only culprits. The current trend 
towards family dislocation is also to blame. Well-known 
authors have stressed the major impact of the family 
environment on the child's ability to learn to read and write.
<P>
	Finally, the private sector has not played the role assumed by 
its counterparts in other industrialized countries. Seventy-six 
per cent of Canadian businesses  with more than 50 employees in 
Canada have no policy for training human resources.
<P>
	And last but not least, there is the federal government's 
responsibility regarding the high rate of illiteracy in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to start by commenting on the negative impact of 
federal involvement in this area.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	I condemn the almost inevitable inefficiency of a policy 
where responsibilities and resources must be shared, discussed 
and fought over by two levels of government: one which has 
legal jurisdiction over this area, in other words, the provinces, 
and the other which for years has insisted on invading this area 
of responsibility in a totally illogical way which also has been 
very detrimental to our financial resources. This is typical of the 
federal government.
<P>
	Ottawa's failure to support literacy in this country includes 
the poor allocation of federal resources as a result of 
jurisdictional overlap.
<P>
	The hundreds of millions of dollars wasted annually as a 
result of this overlap could have been used, for instance, to 
create a pre-school network similar to those that exist in many 
western countries. The positive correlation between early 
socialization of children and academic achievement has been 
stressed repeatedly. As the Deputy Prime Minister said last 
Tuesday, the years between zero and five are critical.
<P>
	With the money saved, Quebec, if it had a free hand, would 
have been better able to help organizations engaged in literacy 
training and occupational training.
<P>
	In my own riding, for instance, we have a regional adult 
education and occupational training service provided by the 
Sainte-Thérèse, Deux-Montagnes et Saint-Eustache school 
boards. Their budget has just been cut by 13 per cent, despite the 
magnificent job they are doing.
<P>
	Changes in the family structure, as I said before, are also 
responsible for illiteracy. But does Ottawa do enough to adapt to 
these new structures? To working mothers? To single-parent 
families? What is the federal government doing to create a 
genuine daycare network, as an alternative to pre-school 
establishments? The private sector is not doing enough? That is 
pretty obvious. But is there not a case for giving them better 
incentives to do their share in retraining manpower?
<P>
	In any case, looking for scapegoats is not going to solve the 
problem. It is high time to put in place what is needed to fight 
illiteracy.
<P>
	Need we recall why action is urgently needed; and why 
illiteracy is a scourge? First of all, illiteracy cuts people off from 
their culture. That is clear. Knowing how to read and write is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="901"> 901 </A></B>
<P>
key everyone needs to open that door, and the illiterate person 
who does not have that key cannot enter that world.
<P>
	Second, there are the practical requirements of daily life in 
our society which include a minimum knowledge of reading and 
writing. I am sure the Minister of National Revenue, and it is too 
bad he is not here, would be very upset if we were not capable of 
completing our income tax returns and then writing him a 
cheque. You have to be able to read and write to do that. We also 
have to be able to read our contracts, bills, and so forth. Need I 
go on?
<P>
	Finally, and this is a particularly urgent question today, there 
is the matter of getting a job. Illiteracy has always been a 
handicap in this respect. It has barred individuals from the better 
jobs. Today, the consequences are far worse. In today's society, 
occupational skills, including literacy, are no longer a guarantee 
for getting a good job. They are an absolute requirement for any 
job at all.
<P>
	Two-thirds of the jobs created by the year 2000 will require at 
least grade twelve. This means that illiteracy wastes part of our 
human resources. It undermines our economic development and 
diminishes our competitive position vis-à-vis countries that are 
more concerned than we are about the training of their labour 
force.
<P>
	In accounting terms, providing sufficient funding to fight 
illiteracy today is a good investment for the government because 
it means fewer welfare recipients and a broader tax base 
tomorrow.
<P>
	To get a maximum return on this investment, how it is used 
should be determined locally. Aside from the fact that it is pretty 
useless to have an army of officials in Ottawa make general, 
high-sounding statements, it also does not make sense and it is 
counterproductive in the extreme to claim there should be 
common standards for a literacy policy from coast to coast, for 
Canada and Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Who could claim, unless it is for partisan reasons, that it is not 
in Quebec, with its distinct culture, that such a policy should be 
implemented if we are looking for efficiency and not electoral 
visibility for the federal government.
<P>
	The best way to avoid overlapping is for the federal 
government to withdraw from that field. To come closer to that 
ideal situation, Quebec and Ottawa should at least sign that 
agreement giving Quebec control in that area.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to congratulate the hon. Deputy 
Prime Minister for the pathetic plea for the unemployed she 
made on Monday. She said that our society was sick with 
unemployment and that one of the causes of the disease was the 
lack of training of part of the population. I agree with that, but 
what I do not agree with is the method she proposes to find and 
then apply the treatment capable of curing society of 
unemployment.
<P>
	For Quebec, she says, the disease could be beaten if the two 
doctors, Quebec and Ottawa, would stop quarrelling, would 
agree on a treatment and would apply it together. Ever since 
Molière wrote his play, we know what happens when one or 
more physicians are called to the bedside of a patient: the fees 
are high and the funeral director is never far behind.
<P>
	What we propose is that the Ottawa doctor leave promptly, 
before it is too late, and leave the patient in the hands of his 
Quebec colleague who, being closer to the patient, is in a better 
position to treat him efficiently.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed very much the remarks of the hon. member. I want to 
make one observation.
<P>
	I believe that education is within provincial jurisdiction in 
Canada. I would have thought to some degree the problems in 
education that pertain to illiteracy and difficulties in reading 
have to do with the quality of instruction at the provincial level 
whether it be in Quebec, Ontario or any other province.
<P>
	Therefore I ask the hon. member if he supports national 
standards in education as a way to confront this problem?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously, the question that was 
just asked is extremely interesting. Would it be appropriate to 
have common standards? And I presume that the hon. member is 
wondering whether it would be useful to have the same 
education standards from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
<P>
	My answer is no. Of course, there are some common 
principles but, as I was saying, beyond the virtuous general 
statements to the effect that education must be aimed at 
educating and that the language must be good and so on, I do no 
see the need for Vancouver and Quebec to have the same 
objectives. I am still saying that it is not necessary for Quebec's 
education goals to be established in Ottawa.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as this is my first official speech in this House, I would like, with 
your permission, to congratulate all members on their election 
and congratulate you on your appointment to this responsible 
position.
<P>
	I would also like to thank the voters of Brome-Missisquoi 
from the bottom of my heart for placing their trust in me and 
electing me as their representative. Brome-Missisquoi is a 
lovely riding in Quebec's Eastern Townships. It has both an 
urban and a rural mix and tourism, farming and industry are the 
dominant areas of activity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="902"> 902 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development and Minister 
of Western Economic Diversification has informed us that he 
intends to hold broad public consultations on social program 
reform. The government has given itself two years to review 
social programs and make changes in a manner which, as it 
promised repeatedly during the election campaign, takes into 
account the concerns of the people.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Many Quebecers and Canadians are afraid of what the 
government has in mind for social programs. They are afraid 
that the government, under the pretext of getting public finances 
in order, will slash the only social safety net they have.
<P>
	The upcoming social program review scares many 
disadvantaged people and those who are suffering because of the 
sluggish economic recovery. It scares unemployed persons, 
welfare recipients, low and middle income families, senior 
citizens and, of course, disabled persons.
<P>
	All of these people are currently facing a great deal of 
uncertainty as to the availability of quality occupational training 
to help them integrate the labour force and gain access to the 
health care and social services they desperately need.
<P>
	According to the <I>Office des personnes handicapées du 
Québec</I>, in 1986, there were ten times as many disabled persons 
living in a residential setting as there were disabled persons in 
an institutional setting. More than one third of the population 
over the age of 75 is considered disabled and overall, there are 
more women than men who are disabled.
<P>
	The challenge facing the government is, therefore, complex. 
On one hand, all Quebecers and Canadians want the government 
to tackle the employment problem. Citizens who want to use 
their skills and experience to make a contribution to society find 
nothing noble about unemployment and welfare. Finding work 
is a priority for disabled persons, particularly for those not 
confined to an institution because of their disability.
<P>
	Disabled persons often encounter obstacles such as 
discriminatory hiring and promotion practices. Yet, many 
disabled persons are highly qualified and functional. Why not 
call upon these individuals who want to participate in the 
economic development and modernization of Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
	Disabled persons also face problems in other areas such as 
training, transportation, communications and housing, areas in 
which most Canadians take fairness for granted.
<P>
	Most of these areas come under provincial jurisdiction and we 
believe that the federal government has no business interfering 
any more than it now does in such matters. We think that the 
money allocated by the federal government to these programs 
for the handicapped must  be transferred to the provinces, which 
are a lot closer to the needs of their population.
<P>
	We think there is an increasingly urgent need for Quebec to 
create institutions that unite us, based on our needs and not on 
standards imposed by the rest of Canada that do not always take 
into account our economic, cultural and social situation. The 
duplication and overlap problem is costly and so complex that 
the average person is easily lost. The competition among 
governments on service quantity but not quality has resulted in 
waste, the rule being that the federal government takes up as 
much room as possible without regard for costs.
<P>
	Cuts in transfer payments to the provinces for health care may 
translate into budget cuts in home-care and rehabilitation 
centers.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Quebec and the other provinces will be forced to slash their 
health care services. The government must not be allowed to 
make the provinces bear the burden of its deficit and shoulder 
the blame for these cuts.
<P>
	The lack of funds in the health care system affects non only 
the availability of occupational therapy and physiotherapy 
services but also the home support program for people with 
disabilities.
<P>
	Are we to think that cuts to social programs will lead to a 
reduction in efforts to make public buildings accessible to 
people using wheelchairs since, as the humorist Jean-Marc 
Parent was saying, there are always doors that open on the wrong 
side and 90 degree access ramps?
<P>
	Despite their significant presence in our society, there is still 
too little research on the social integration of people with 
handicaps or functional disabilities. While we are scraping the 
bottom of the barrel to offer concrete and direct services to the 
population, can we afford to have two of everything? In 
1993-94, the overall administration of federal and provincial 
health and welfare programs accounts for over $150 million and 
more than 1,500 full-time jobs.
<P>
	Can we afford to duplicate initiatives aimed at target groups 
with occasionally conflicting priorities? These are areas of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction and the federal government is 
merely trying to raise its political profile.
<P>
	In 1991, only $46 million was spent on programs for the 
handicapped over five years or a little over $9 million a year. 
According to Statistics Canada, between 12 and 13 per cent of 
Canadians have various disabilities; it may be a mobility 
impairment, a vision, hearing or speech problem, an intellectual 
deficiency or a mental illness. As the figures clearly show, the 
time and energy spent on duplicating programs for the 
handicapped are not only costing us a lot of money but also 
lowering 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="903"> 903 </A></B>
<P>
the quality of services offered to these people. This is further 
evidence that Quebec's sovereignty is the only valid solution to 
this administrative nightmare.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Sir, may I offer my 
congratulations on your attaining the position of Deputy 
Speaker.
<P>
	The minister's initiative in the area of social services is 
certainly much overdue and much needed in this country and 
gives us all cause as Canadians for serious reflection about what 
really is the role of government, or what ought to be the role of 
government in our society as we move toward the 21st century.
<P>
	A conservative would have us believe that government should 
do very little, that really everything should be left to the 
marketplace, that just like business and the market take care of 
everything and those who earn, wealth will trickle down to those 
who do not have such wealth and that everything will be 
wonderful in our society; so-called Reaganomics, if you will, or 
the path followed by Margaret Thatcher and by the previous 
government in this House.
<P>
	It is quite obvious that such an approach to government in 
society has been a miserable failure. Never has the gap between 
those at the top, those who have, and those at the bottom 
widened more significantly in such a few short years as it did in 
the 1980s in North America and in Britain and other parts of the 
world.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	It is quite obvious that the conservative philosophy is quite 
bankrupt as we move toward the end of this century and the start 
of a new era.
<P>
	On the other hand, we have the socialist philosophy that 
government should do everything for us. It should take care of 
us from the cradle to the grave. There is very little that the 
citizen should have to do. Let government do it all. That has 
been tried in different parts of the world with very limited 
successes, producing such an incredible tax burden on countries 
that they have had to totally rethink the way their society is 
structured. It has produced a paternalistic society in which all 
too often the initiative of the individual is stifled almost 
completely to the point at which they simply feel that they are a 
ward of the state.
<P>
	Between these two extremes of the far right and the far left 
you have what I feel, and history has proven it to be the sensible 
position, is the position of a liberal; a far more balanced 
position, founded on the ideas of some of the greatest thinkers of 
political science in history.
<P>
	A liberal view espouses the fact that there is a social contract 
or that there ought to be in a society a social contract between 
the citizen and the state, that the state is there and gains power 
through the actions of the citizenry in giving that power 
temporarily to the state. The duty of government is to assist the 
citizen to realize his or her full potentials, then to work in 
partnership with the private sector and to let that citizen and the 
private sector work together for job employment, job  creation 
and so on. To a large extent it is the private sector which will 
help to foster employment in a society.
<P>
	A liberal rejects the notion that there is no role for 
government to play whatsoever. That is simply not a view that I 
can find acceptable. The lessons of history are that there must be 
a role for government.
<P>
	In this debate about the reform of social security let me quote 
perhaps one of the best expressions of the role of government 
that I have come across in my life time. It comes from Hubert H. 
Humphrey, a former vice-president of the United States. There 
are some lessons we can learn from our American friends. 
Perhaps there are many they can learn from us as well.
<P>
	Mr. Humphrey said the moral test of government is how it 
treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who 
are in twilight of life, the aged; and those who are in the shadows 
of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped''.
<P>
	Surely that is the kind of test we want to put before any 
government as Canadians. That is the kind of test that this 
current government is quite prepared to stand up and meet in its 
mandate over the next four or five years. The minister's 
initiative in this reform of social security is a very clear 
testament to that.
<P>
	On this side of the House and in Canada in general there are 
those who say the Liberal Party should refrain from using the 
word reform since it is the label of one of the current parties in 
the House. I categorically reject that. The real reformers in this 
House are those members on this side who are true to their 
liberal principles. That is who the real reformers are.
<P>
	I will never stop using the word reform because it is a word 
which history has shown to be a liberal word. The liberals on this 
side of the House are proud to be members of the Liberal Party 
and we intend to continue to have our voices heard within in our 
own caucus, within this House and within this country to make 
sure that our views are put forward with the views of Canadians 
all across this country who share the fact that there must be a 
role for government to play.
<P>
	What are the areas of reform that need to be examined in our 
current look at these particular problems? The unemployment 
crisis we face, if not the most serious situation, is right near the 
top of the list. Never have so many suffered so much in such a 
few short years in terms of job loss. Not since the days of the 
great depression. We simply must attack that and do everything 
we can as a government and as a nation to get Canadians 
working again.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="904"> 904 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The best kind of social reform we could come up with is a 
program of job creation. It was quite clear in the election 
campaign which party was the only one prepared to speak 
consistently, day in and day out, about jobs for Canadians. On 
October 25 we saw reflected the result that Canadians 
understood who was prepared to address the real concern, the 
unemployment crisis.
<P>
	In terms of attitude in society, unfortunately we have drifted 
into a situation where there are far too many Canadians who 
seem to be accepting unemployment insurance and welfare as a 
way of life. I like to believe and I do believe they are a minority. 
Frankly I know, coming from a municipal councillor 
background, that some people are prepared to accept it as a way 
of life for themselves. We cannot allow that attitude to continue.
<P>
	That is not to condemn the unemployed. Far from it. I would 
be the last to do that. In fact I submit that most unemployed 
Canadians truly want to work, but we need an attitudinal shift 
which has to be led by the government. We must insist that 
people who are willing and able to do work but unable to find 
work are given some gainful employment, some meaningful role 
to play. We will help them over the short-term crises they face 
until they are able to find full-time employment on their own.
<P>
	Whether that will evolve into some kind of guaranteed annual 
income or some system of workfare I am not sure, but I know 
very clearly from my experience that we cannot encourage and 
let continue the attitude that one can just stay at home and be 
supported by the taxpayer. That has to be discouraged in the very 
small minority of people who unfortunately have that attitude.
<P>
	I would like to say a word about the co-ordination of social 
programs. As I mentioned my own previous experience was at 
the municipal level. It is all too clear to those of us who come 
from a background in municipal government that there has been 
a consistent downloading of responsibility from the federal 
government to the provincial government and then down to the 
municipalities that have nowhere to pass it on to except to local 
property ratepayers. It is simply wrong and unconscionable that 
should go on.
<P>
	Quite frankly the redistribution of income should be handled 
by the senior levels of government, by the federal and provincial 
governments. That is a far more just situation for the clients of 
the system, for the people who need assistance. It is far fairer for 
them and it is far more just to local taxpayers in any given 
municipality.
<P>
	I come from London, Ontario, and represent the riding of 
London-Middlesex. We have seen examples of where people 
have come to our city from other parts of Ontario and have 
unfairly created a significant problem in the welfare budget of 
that municipality. That very important program must be funded 
from federal and provincial budgets.
<P>
	Yes, there is only one Canadian taxpayer. We know that, but it 
is not a responsibility that should fall upon the shoulders of 
municipalities. The Canadian Federation of Municipalities has 
been saying that for years. I am confident that Minister of 
Human Resources Development and the Minister of Finance 
will hear that message and take steps to redress the lack of 
co-ordination and of proper funding of the programs.
<P>
	The area of child care was a subject referred to earlier by a 
Reform Party MP. There is nothing more important to fund than 
child care. There are people who need subsidized care. We must 
give that care to the children of the working poor. If we do not 
we see far too clearly the horrendous social problems that result. 
We simply delay paying the piper and create a number of 
problems.
<P>
	With those thoughts, I am very confident as a member of the 
new government that we are on the right track. Real reform will 
take place, led by the real reform party in the House, and that is 
the Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the member's comments.
<P>
	The hon. member expressed his views. He explained for me 
exactly why we are here in this House to debate. The member for 
Vancouver Centre questioned why we were here to debate. She 
said: ``What we are doing really is not having consultations 
together''. She indicated that we were pre-empting the decision. 
I would have to say that the hon. member who just spoke did 
exactly that.
<P>
	I have to go back to the member's text. I do not know if he 
actually had this written down or if he was ad libbing. He did say 
that we want to help them over the short term and then we are not 
quite sure where they are going to go from there. He was 
speaking about the unemployed.
<P>
	``What will this eventually mean'', the hon. member asked. I 
would like the hon. member to clarify exactly what was meant 
by that statement. Having used the example of an annual 
guaranteed income was of some interest to me. I would like 
some clarification on that point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I had some speaking notes and I 
would like to correct the hon. member.
<P>
	I was trying to make the point that social assistance should be 
short-term help, whether it is in the form of welfare or 
unemployment insurance. It ought to be in its best application 
short-term help.
<P>
	I did not indicate in any way where do they go from there. 
Hopefully people on this short-term help will find with the 
assistance of government and the private sector gainful and 
decent employment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="905"> 905 </A></B>
<P>
	If they do not, as they have not been unfortunately, the 
short-term help has had to become long-term help, hence the 
problem we find ourselves in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pride that I rise for the first occasion in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	As is the tradition with maiden speeches I would like to take a 
moment to thank my supporters who elected me on October 25. 
More particularly I would like to thank my campaign workers 
who spent many hours on my campaign. I would especially like 
to thank my wife for her patience, encouragement and the many 
sacrifices she has made in support of my campaign and my new 
career. Last, I would like to thank my parents for their support, 
guidance and encouragement over the last 37 years.
<P>
	The riding of Elgin-Norfolk sits on the north shore of Lake 
Erie and runs approximately 100 miles east to west. It begins in 
a small town called St. Williams in Norfolk township and runs 
through to Rodney in Aldboro township.
<P>
	The riding is the birthplace of many great contributors to both 
Canada and the world including Mitch Hepburn the former 
premier of Ontario. As well, the inventor Thomas Edison was 
born in Elgin-Norfolk. The renowned Liberal economist John 
Kenneth Galbraith comes from just outside St. Thomas in a 
small town called Dutton. Last, the great Canadian, the leader of 
the New Democratic Party and member for Yukon also was born 
in Elgin-Norfolk.
<P>
	Elgin county has a long agricultural tradition. It has many 
farms ranging from dairy farms through cattle farms, cash 
crops, chicken farms as well as many others.
<P>
	It is also the home of an important manufacturing sector, 
particularly in auto related manufacturing and auto parts. The 
main population centre, the city of St. Thomas, is the home for 
the Ford Motor Company and Freightliner Truck 
Manufacturing.
<P>
	The people of the riding of Elgin-Norfolk wait with great 
anticipation for the performance of the 35th Parliament of 
Canada. My riding has suffered a tremendous job loss through 
the last five years. Factory after factory has closed permanently, 
all in the name of global restructuring. These people are anxious 
to see policy changes which will increase their job security and 
provide hope for their future, for their community and for their 
children.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The initiatives of this Parliament must speak to the needs of 
the people of Elgin-Norfolk as it must speak to the real needs 
of all members in Canadian society. Canadians, regardless of 
where they live, expect that job opportunities will be created out 
of economic growth and fairness in the tax system and 
expenditure policies of this new government.
<P>
	I would like to speak for a moment about first principles. The 
principles of a good income support program or labour force 
adjustment system should include a fundamental commitment 
to the principles of social justice and a preferential option for 
those most in need. Furthermore all of our programs, including 
social spending, should facilitate a stable and growing economy.
<P>
	The contribution that social spending makes to economic 
growth has often times been overlooked in economic debates. 
However a full discussion at this point would take me beyond 
my 10 minutes so I leave it for another day.
<P>
	More fundamental than the principles of any government 
program are the principles of government. Mr. Vaclav Havel, in 
his first book as president of the Czech and Slovak republic, 
stated: ``I am convinced that we will never build a democratic 
state based on rule of law if we do not at the same time build a 
state that is-regardless of how unscientific this may sound to 
the ears of the political scientists-humane, moral, intellectual, 
spiritual and cultural. The best laws and the best conceived 
democratic mechanisms will not in themselves guarantee 
legality or freedom or human rights-anything, in short for 
which they are intended-if they are not underpinned by certain 
human and social values''.
<P>
	My challenge for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and all members of this House is that we craft 
programs which are both humane and moral.
<P>
	Many members on both sides of the House, from all three 
parties, have spoken about the pressing social issues in their 
communities, be it the unemployed, the hungry, day care or 
violence in the home. I would like to add my voice to theirs and 
press the government to find solutions to the problems of 
economic hardship throughout our nation. More specifically I 
would like to ask the government to attack vigorously the issue 
of poverty, including the plight of the working poor.
<P>
	Too many Canadians, many of whom are working, are 
experiencing long term and real financial and emotional 
difficulties because they have fallen below the poverty line. Our 
labour force adjustment strategy must ensure meaningful, well 
paid jobs for Canadians not part-time subsistence work that has 
too often been the case in the past.
<P>
	Recently Dr. Shaw, a professor at the University of Toronto 
Medical School, estimated that health costs due to 
unemployment were over $1 billion a year. To all the members 
here, I suggest that if we measure the health costs due to poverty 
it would far exceed $1 billion. Our programs need to deal with 
the issue of poverty head on, both for those who are working and 
those who are not working.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	In the few moments remaining, let me move from the general 
to the more specific. Ultimately our ability to generate wealth is 
a function of our knowledge. We live in a knowledge based 
economy. The degree to which wealth is shared in this country is 
a function of our moral commitment to take care of each other 
and that means, in this day and age, ensuring that every 
Canadian has access to meaningful education and meaningful 
training so as to gain the knowledge to become a contributing 
member of society through a job.
<P>
	More specifically our review of UI needs to review the 
training programs included therein. Too many of our training 
programs are merely effective band-aids that do not offer 
long-term realistic hope. The national training act needs to be 
revamped. Provinces need to participate in an honest dialogue 
so that the bogus distinction between education and training 
disappears.
<P>
	Let me close by asking all members of the House to 
respectfully set aside their ideological differences and work 
together to meet demands for a fairer Canada and a more just 
Canada and end the scourge of poverty on our land.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
you very much for giving me the opportunity to enter into this 
debate.
<P>
	First of all I would like to congratulate the member for 
Elgin-Norfolk. I can sympathize with him in making his first 
speech in the humble assembly that is here. I can recall my first 
week in the Alberta legislature. I was asked to move the speech 
from the throne at the young age of 27. I remember a number of 
people in the government of that time who had been there for 27 
years and had most likely heard 101 different speeches and I had 
to say something different to them. I remember that being a very 
humbling experience. I am sure the member felt that way today 
but respects this institution very much.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	I would caution the hon. member that one of the diseases that 
often sets in after you have had the opportunity of being in this 
assembly is that the 10 minute speech early in your career seems 
to enlarge and enlarge until it becomes the 40-minute speech. So 
be careful of that disease as you go forward in your career. I wish 
you all the best and congratulations on your first speech in this 
assembly. Very well done.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure the hon. member will always want to 
speak through the Chair.
<P>
	I am a little bit puzzled. Is the hon. member responding to the 
speech or is he making his speech now?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Perhaps I could start my own 
speech if it is appropriate or if Mr. Speaker permits I could ask a 
question of the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I was sort of looking forward to that expansion 
of the speech that took 27 years. If he has a short question I 
would like the hon. member to have a chance to answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> I wish to ask the hon. member 
how he sees the study that is going to take place with regard to 
human resource development. Does the hon. member see the 
targeting of programs for those who are need or does he see it in 
terms of the philosophy of the government approaching the 
responsibility of human resource development, social services 
and other related programs on a broader budget basis?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the questioner for those 
kind comments. I have no difficulty with the concept of 
targeting those most in need. It is fundamental to what we need 
to do as a country.
<P>
	Over the last five years our expenditures on unemployment 
insurance have grown from approximately $11 billion to $20 
billion. In large part that is due to the problems in the economy 
and the major downturn or economic depression we have been 
through.
<P>
	Given that we spend so much money in this country we need to 
always for the sake of the poor and for the sake of those most in 
need make sure that money is always well spent.
<P>
	We need to look specifically at training programs that quite 
often do not do the job. When our programs do not do the job as 
they are supposed to, it is the disadvantaged people that are most 
hurt, I have no problems with targeting those most in need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> I appreciate very much the 
courtesy to me and the hon. member as well, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I would like to indicate I appreciate very much that the 
government has allowed us as members to have input into the 
reforms of the social security system and to make comments.
<P>
	The minister has requested that all Canadians throw off the 
old ideas, put aside vested interests and give some new impetus 
and some new objective to our social security programs. That is 
a very honourable objective of the minister.
<P>
	Many other ministers and many other governments in the past 
have also set the very same objectives. It seems to be a pattern. 
When a new government comes to a legislative assembly or the 
House of Commons the first thing it wants to do is review what 
has happened and start anew. I certainly hope when we do this 
review, we maintain some of the good programs and some of the 
assistance, the safety nets that have worked well across this 
nation.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="907"> 907 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	Many Canadians in health departments and in social services, 
social development and welfare departments have worked hard 
to try and hone the current system this nation has. Over the years 
I have had the opportunity of being involved in a number of 
those reviews and studies.
<P>
	The point that I want to make in my few moments here today 
is with regard to what I see as the objectives of the Reform Party 
of Canada and how we want to place ourselves in this review and 
reform that will happen.
<P>
	I say to the hon. member for London-Middlesex who was 
talking a little earlier about having an inside track on reform, I 
hope we approach the reform of the social service system on a 
broader basis so that all Canadians and all sides of this House of 
Commons have input into the new changes which will come 
about during the first or second term of the 35th Parliament. Not 
just the government, not just the Liberal Party, not in a partisan 
way but on a broader basis.
<P>
	As the Reform Party we must do two things. First of all, we 
have a basic philosophic approach to social programs and those 
programs meeting the needs of Canadians. I am sure all of us 
have heard that in this assembly. We believe we should help 
those in need, that no Canadian should suffer from a lack of 
food, clothing, shelter and health care, that those basic four 
requirements should be available to every Canadian. We believe 
it should be there.
<P>
	However we also say that because of the current 
circumstances where we are some $500 billion in accumulated 
debt, that the current track of the Liberal government as is set 
out in its program whereby the object is to bring the deficit down 
to 3 per cent of the GDP, even reaching that target we well 
recognize that in the first year, if we reach that target in 
1994-95, there will still be a $25 billion deficit to accumulate on 
the debt. If we looked just at that figure over the next four years 
we would add another $100 billion to the $500 billion.
<P>
	What does that do in terms of the tax dollar? Right now, 32 
cents out of every tax dollar goes to pay interest costs. If we 
continue to build up the accumulated debt, as some economists 
and some of those who have researched this very well have 
indicated, if we continue on that type of a spending pattern, by 
the end of the century we will end up paying 50 cents of every 
one of our revenue dollars toward interest costs. The question 
then is: How much does that leave to meet those basic needs we 
think are so important, the food, the clothing, the shelter and 
health care for Canadians?
<P>
	We cannot run the country on 50-cent dollars. It is impossible 
to do that kind of thing. We have to come to grips with it.
<P>
	With respect to the upcoming budget, in the informal 
discussions that are going on not just in this assembly but in 
discussions in other committees and in talking informally with 
government members and those who are trying to examine the 
budget deficit that is coming up, the forecast is that we most 
likely will have a deficit in the 1994-95 budget of $38 billion to 
$39 billion. So we can imagine how that is going to erode and eat 
away our capability as legislators to meet our social objectives. 
That has to be part of the discussion when we look at reform.
<P>
	It will not be the ideal that we come up with. We have to work 
within the financial constraints we are facing. Certainly I would 
recommend to the government in this reform that we must then 
look at the definition of those in need.
<P>
	There are a couple of examples. During our campaign period 
we talked about those on old age assistance. At the present time 
some $14.4 billion are allocated across this country in the 
current year. In the former fiscal year it was about the same 
amount of money. Those dollars, $14.4 billion, are allocated to 
those persons receiving old age assistance.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	What we are saying as Reformers is an example of targeting of 
programs. Those seniors getting a family income of $54,000 or 
more-we feel that is adequate for the senior to live on-if we 
were able to on a graduated basis maybe to $70,000 of income, 
reduce their old age assistance using a formula we could take out 
of expenditure in that old age assistance program some $3.4 
billion. That amount could go toward reducing the deficit. 
Rather than a $38 billion or $39 billion deficit that adjustment in 
program may bring it down to $35 billion or $36 billion. That is 
the kind of thing we have to do.
<P>
	We have to look at the whole health care program. I know the 
question of user fees is tossed around by the various provinces. I 
come from the province of Alberta which is seriously looking at 
user fees. I know the government has said it will not do that but it 
is not because it wants to punish someone or take something 
away, but there is a capability during these difficult economic 
times for people to be able to pay for part of the service.
<P>
	It is also believed there may be a deterrent in that those who 
really do not need the health care service will not visit the doctor 
as often as they are presently doing. We have to look at the case 
of user fees as well in this review and this reform.
<P>
	I could use other examples with regard to targeting of 
programs. Under the circumstances I believe those terms of 
reference must be considered in this reform. This is not a period 
where we have a lot of money, where we can say to Canadians 
that everybody is going to have a share of the government pie or 
the revenue. We are not at that period of time in our history as 
legislators and we have to recognize that. We have a major 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="908"> 908 </A></B>
<P>
responsibility in this  assembly to come to grips with targeting 
social programs and to be very fiscally accountable.
<P>
	In my last few moments I would like to refer to a report that 
was done in Alberta in 1967. This report is a white paper on 
human resource development. It was written by the Hon. Ernest 
Manning at a time when I was in his cabinet as the Minister of 
Public Welfare. A major author of this was also his son, now the 
leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	We put this white paper together and I am not referencing it 
just for the sake of bringing this document here. There are some 
basic principles in this paper that looked at human resource 
development. It was the first document put together in Canada 
on human resource development. We in the province of Alberta 
introduced that concept. Following that period of time there 
were other provinces and also the federal government of the day 
that accepted some of the basic philosophy of the human 
resource concept.
<P>
	There were three basic objectives. One was to look at 
programs of maintenance. There is a group of people in Canada 
that needs assistance and maintenance. The second one was 
rehabilitation and the third was preventative programs.
<P>
	We had leading programs in the area of prevention in Canada 
and I would like to recommend that to the committee for study.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for Lethbridge for his remarks. I am pleased to 
note that his book is also red and I could reference another red 
book that may expand on some of the points they raised so long 
ago.
<P>
	I have a curiosity about part of what he presents.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	On the one hand his party has spoken strongly against any 
expansion of taxes, any increase in taxes or anything to do with 
causing people to pay more. Yet on the other hand his party is 
quite willing to support user fees which by definition will cause 
people to pay more for services they receive. I wonder if he can 
reconcile this contradiction for me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> That is an excellent question 
from the hon. member. We look at it this way. If we are able to 
reduce the cost of government, people will have more money in 
their pockets to pay for some of their services.
<P>
	There is a direct relationship between the reduction of the cost 
of government and being able to pay for some of one's own 
needs. In the four areas I mentioned, in terms of food, clothing, 
shelter and health care, we would look at the individual having 
more of a direct relationship between using the service and 
paying for the service.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
my hon. friend made reference to my earlier comments I hoped I 
would have the opportunity to ask him a question. I appreciate 
that.
<P>
	I made my point that to reform is to improve a situation. It is 
to find a better way. Frankly that is the liberal way, and the party 
that has consistently done that most effectively in this country is 
the Liberal Party on this side.
<P>
	Can the hon. member tell us how the destruction of the 
national health care standards, which is the result of those 
policies put forward by his party, would improve the situation 
for Canadians in need? Can he go on and explain to us those 
specific improvements in the social security system that the 
Reform Party stands for?
<P>
	The hon. member uses the phrase ``target social programs'' 
and that is the difference. We want to target social problems. 
Can the hon. member enlighten us on those points?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> In terms of the first question, if 
that reform means improving things and doing better we 
certainly agree with that.
<P>
	In terms of our targeting social programs and the hon. member 
said social problems, I think we are using semantics more than 
anything. I believe what the hon. member is saying is that 
individuals out there are in need and that is who we would target. 
We would have to categorize for example those that we feel need 
incentive and encouragement to go back to work, look after 
themselves as our economy picks up. We should have that kind 
of flavour in our society. Our Prime Minister said the other day 
that he wanted to get rid of dependency. We agree with that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Haldimand-Norfolk-Dairy industry; the hon. 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River-Rouge River valley; 
the hon. member for Beaches-Woodbine-Immigration; the 
hon. member of Rimouski-Témiscouata-Policy on 
appointments; and the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe-Unemployment insurance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take a few moments this afternoon to 
discuss the reform of Canada's social security system.
<P>
	Given your role here in this House you are of course non 
partisan, but you will remember clearly that, during the last 
election campaign, our party made a commitment to the people 
of Canada. Indeed, we promised to give new confidence to the 
majority of Canadians about having a job and a more promising 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="909"> 909 </A></B>
<P>
future in the years to come than they could hope for in recent 
years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the then Leader of the Opposition and now the Prime 
Minister said on the steps of Parliament Hill the day the election 
campaign started: We must give Canadians their smile again. 
We must give them that hope. We must make them feel better.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am very much in favour of this initiative because, after all, 
the goal is to improve social programs. For example, the 
proposals put forward by our colleague the Minister of Human 
Resources Development are aimed at improving the social 
security system, so that it can better meet the expectations and 
needs of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	A good number of these programs have been in place for 
several years and the Canadian economy has changed since they 
were first introduced. I remember the days when an 
unemployment rate of three per cent was considered equivalent 
to full employment. Today's figures are totally different. I also 
remember the days when it was perfectly normal to have one 
salary per household, the bread winner usually being the man in 
the house. It goes without saying that these standards no longer 
apply. The situation has evolved and we must not only adapt 
accordingly, we must also change our social programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am of the view that the best social program is a job. There is 
nothing quite like it, as they say in the commercial. If the best 
social program is a job, as I submit it is, then surely all of the 
other programs that we have must be such that one is always 
better with a job than without one.
<P>
	That is not the case with social programs today. How many 
times have colleagues in this House heard constituents tell them 
that they cannot afford to work, that the social program that they 
are on is designed in such a way that they are taking a cut by 
going back to work?
<P>
	For a single mother with three or four children going back to 
work is not easy. As a matter of fact, in many cases it is, without 
saying impossible, very hard. I am of the view that it is high time 
we started thinking of such concepts as guaranteed minimum 
annual income in such a way that no one is punished for trying to 
make life better for themselves. No one is punished for finding a 
job. That is not the case right now. That is not the case at all.
<P>
	The other part to this is the unemployment insurance 
programs that we have. A few years ago we got into training 
programs in a rather major way under many aspects of what is 
commonly referred to as UI. Some of these programs are for 
training but they are confusing at best.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Those of us who have referred constituents to training 
programs under section 26 of the Unemployment Insurance Act 
know that these people can, if they get benefits the day that the 
training begins, receive those benefits for a period which could 
be extended to 156 weeks. However, if these people make a 
claim under a program not covered by section 26 and go back to 
school while receiving UI benefits, they not only lose the 
possibility of having their benefit period extended, they also 
lose those benefits.
<P>
	You will agree that if the objective is to provide training, 
programs should be structured so that people are not penalized 
precisely because they take a training course, as they should.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On the other hand we have section 14. People qualify under 
section 14 to take a training program sometimes identical to 
those under section 26. If they are taking a program and if they 
are offered a job they must resign forthwith from the training 
that they are taking to go to the job.
<P>
	However, if they were approved under the other section they 
do not have to do it. That does not make a lot of sense to me. It 
seems that whatever little block was ticked off beside one's 
name determines how the training one will be receiving will be 
administered and whether one will receive benefits, extend 
benefits or have the benefits cut off altogether. That does not 
seem like a reasonable proposition to me.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	If you are on unemployment insurance and you apply to work 
on some of these make work projects, under section 25 of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, you go back to work and you 
receive a form of top-up in addition to your benefits, providing 
you have enough benefits to cover the whole period of the 
project you are going to work on.
<P>
	In other words, if you have nine weeks of coverage left and 
you are starting to work on a project that will last ten weeks, you 
cannot work nine weeks and then quit. You have to refuse to take 
it altogether because you must have the requisite number of 
weeks for the duration of the program.
<P>
	Maybe this makes sense to somebody but it does not at all to 
me. I am having some difficult explaining all of this to those 
who asked me to represent them in this Chamber.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="910"> 910 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to see the government take a look at the 
administration of its programs, so that these are better managed 
and, more importantly, better co-ordinated, to meet the needs of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that I do not agree with those who 
claim that we are spending more and more on social programs.
<P>
	I just received today a document entitled ``The National 
Finances'', published by the Canadian Tax Foundation. 
According to this document, social programs subsidized by the 
federal government represented 23.1 per cent of the tax base in 
1984, compared to only 22.8 per cent in 1993-1994. We must 
not forget that. We must not claim that we are proportionally 
spending more and more all the time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Glengarry-Prescott-Russell for his speech. I 
noticed that he too had found in the present system many faults 
that make it absolutely absurd from the recipients' point of 
view. So, how do you expect the public to understand what the 
hon. member was talking about?
<P>
	Here is my question: Is the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell aware that he is no longer in the 
opposition, that he is a government member and that his 
government could act now rather than spend another nine 
months consulting?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I understood correctly, the hon. 
member is suggesting that we should not have consulted him, as 
the duly elected representative of his riding, and the other duly 
elected members of this House, that the government should have 
acted in an arbitrary manner, without consulting Parliament. 
This may be a Bloc Quebecois pattern of thinking but we, 
Liberals, have more respect than that for this place than the Bloc 
has demonstrated. I might add, regarding the member who has 
asked me the question in particular, that I know his own political 
background much better than the previous Conservative 
government?
<P>
	Basically, what we want to do is to hear from the duly elected 
representatives of the people to ensure that our programs will 
meet the needs of Canadians. After all, that is what we were sent 
here for.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I had planned to recognize the hon. 
member for Jonquière next, but since his comment was of a 
rather personal nature, in my opinion, I will give the floor back 
to the hon. member for Rosemont.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to add that, were 
the minister and his government to decide to act immediately to 
remedy those faults, they would have my support and I think that 
all my constituents would agree with me entirely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate my hon. colleague on his presentation. As a high 
school guidance counsellor, I was for many years in a position to 
meet workers who wanted to receive some occupational training 
and who had to wrestle with unemployment insurance rules. And 
I would have liked to say exactly what my hon. colleague said, 
that is denounce the fact that some people today are not 
receiving training because Canadian training policies are 
inadequate.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	In addition to congratulating my colleague, I would like to ask 
him a question. Why must all of these programs be standardized 
across Canada? Why could the Government of Quebec not 
oversee occupational training, as labour unions and 
management are demanding? In fact, Quebec stakeholders are 
unanimous in calling for all of these programs to be 
administered by the Quebec government. Why is this not 
possible at the present time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> First of all, Mr. Speaker, it is not only the case 
with Unemployment Insurance. My colleague opposite should 
know, if he worked in that field, that welfare recipients are 
confronted with the same kind of problems. So, it does not 
happen only with federal programs. In fact, as we speak, the 
problems facing welfare recipients may well be worse.
<P>
	Now, the member opposite is asking me: would it not be 
possible for certain programs to be administered by a single 
level of government instead of two? It is certainly not 
impossible, and no one said it was. As a matter of fact, if I am 
not mistaken, the hon. member for Hull-Aylmer and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs stated clearly that he was planning 
and had in fact started negotiations along that line. So, it is far 
from impossible to negotiate successfully with provincial 
officials and it is not fair to say that the programs are the same-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The time allotted for 
questions and comments period has run out.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to have an opportunity to speak on the subject of reform of our 
social programs.
<P>
	I have had the great privilege over many years in my 
community as a volunteer, as an elected representative 
municipally and as an elected representative federally to work 
with people in my community to try to resolve some of these 
problems and to agonize with them about the frustration of 
programs, rules and regulations that do not allow people to take 
the steps they want to take to become self-sufficient and to 
create a better life for themselves and their children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="911"> 911 </A></B>
<P>
	As I begin speaking today, I want to pay special tribute to 
many of the women I have worked with over the years. I have 
found tremendous strength among women living in poverty 
trying to raise their children and trying to plan to get out of that 
poverty trap to create new opportunities for themselves and their 
children only to butt themselves up against a system that makes 
it hard for them to do that.
<P>
	The fundamental principle of liberalism is the dignity and 
worth of every individual. Canadians heard the Prime Minister 
and Liberal candidates across the country speak on that theme 
time and time again. It is central to the red book and to the 
economic and social programs that we put forward in the red 
book and that we are all now intending to implement through 
this Parliament.
<P>
	However, believing in the dignity and worth of every 
individual also means making sure that as a society we create the 
opportunities for every individual to achieve their full potential 
and to use that to their personal benefit, to the benefit of their 
family, friends, community and country. Far too much inhibits 
that now.
<P>
	I had the privilege of attending the pre-budget consultation in 
Toronto last week and hearing a speech by a former deputy 
minister of this government, Arthur Kroeger, in which he talked 
about the rising benchmark of unemployment that has been set 
in each decade of the last half of this century, rising from 
approximately 4 per cent in the fifties to over 6 per cent in the 
sixties to plus 9 per cent in the seventies and to 10 per cent to 11 
per cent in the eighties. It obviously seems stuck at that point for 
the moment.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	What has also happened is that the middle class has 
disappeared into a economic polarization of our society. Some 
people have moved up into higher paying, more secure, more 
skilled jobs, and more have moved down into less skilled, lower 
paying jobs and that bottom level seems to be declining.
<P>
	I have also had the privilege recently of reading a publication 
called &quot;The Canadian Women's Budget&quot; which talks about how 
the policies of the previous government over the last five years 
have further exacerbated that polarization of Canadians. A 
family of two parents earning $20,000 a year, a pretty low 
income we would all agree with two children, is now paying 
more than three times the taxes it did. A middle income family is 
paying 15 per cent more and the wealthiest Canadians are paying 
less than 4 per cent more.
<P>
	As I look at the need to be frugal, to make the best use of the 
fiscal resources we have, to move toward a balanced budget, I 
also want to move toward balance in the budget and who is 
benefiting from the kinds of programs we have and who is being 
left on the sidelines in an increasingly harsh world.
<P>
	The poverty of children in our society is one of those things 
that perpetuates a poorer and poorer society and fewer and fewer 
opportunities for people to develop their talents, their abilities 
and their skills and make the contribution they want to make and 
are capable of making.
<P>
	We know that children growing up in poverty are more likely 
to drop out of school, more likely to be illiterate, more likely to 
get sick, more likely to commit suicide. Poverty is a 
fundamental issue that we as a society are not addressing.
<P>
	I mentioned that I have dealt with poor women, single parents, 
trying to raise their children, trying to create a better 
opportunity for themselves. There is no scheme for them to 
gradually move from dependency to independence. They are 
punished if they try to. They lose benefits that are essential to 
the security of their children.
<P>
	I am a woman who has raised three children. Most of the 
women I have worked with will sacrifice their own dignity for 
the sake of the security of their children. We have to make sure 
that we are not forcing them to make that choice.
<P>
	We know that more women than men are poor. We have to ask 
ourselves how we have allocated our resources in the past as a 
society so that has happened, so that there is a segment of our 
society consistently poorer and significantly poorer than society 
at large. It has not happened by accident, it has happened by 
specific policy decisions. What is there in our social programs 
and in other programs of government that has allowed that to 
happen, and in fact that has led to it happen?
<P>
	I want to talk about the need to look at special needs in our 
society. In the last government a project sat on the desk of the 
minister of employment that for $26,000 a person would have 
taken people with disabilities and trained them to work in the 
high tech industry in which there is a desperate need for people 
with the skills that this particular group of unemployed would 
have been given. The government sat there and did not move on 
that project.
<P>
	I have been involved with training programs. I see how 
desperately they are needed and wanted in communities. I talk 
about a restaurant that a community group actually started as a 
business so it could use that business and re-invest the income 
from that business in training. I can count in the hundreds for a 
very small investment of federal dollars the young men and 
women who have come through that program, who have 
established careers for themselves, who have turned their lives 
around completely.
<P>
	I want to talk about something we learned through those kinds 
of programs. I hope this review goes to some of the fundamental 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="912"> 912 </A></B>
<P>
causes of why young people end up uneducated or 
undereducated, unemployed or underemployed and unable to 
integrate themselves into society at large and into the work 
force.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	What we found in common with other similar projects across 
Ontario was that when we dealt with young people who met 
these criteria of less than grade 10 education, out of work at least 
six months, very little job experience to speak of, we were 
dealing with a large component, over 80 per cent of children who 
came from a history of sexual abuse.
<P>
	Until we start addressing those fundamental issues of why our 
children leave school, why they never quite make it in society, 
we are not going to solve those problems.
<P>
	I welcome this comprehensive review. I want to see us be 
more frugal with our money. I do not want to leave my three 
children a horrendous debt. Nor do I want to leave them a 
meaner, nastier society than I have enjoyed.
<P>
	I welcome this reform. I hope it will do some positive things 
for a lot of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the hon. member for an interesting speech.
<P>
	The member shows great concern for people caught in the 
poverty trap and that is exactly what all of us have a concern for 
here. I would like to ask the member a question. I wonder if the 
member is familiar with a program that has been running in New 
York state which has saved the taxpayers about $21 million over 
the last few years while at the same time finding positions for 
people who have been on the welfare roles for a number of years.
<P>
	The project involves a private company and it is involved in 
training with a different perspective. Instead of trying to teach 
new skills, and I do not deny there are times when these new 
skills are needed, what it does is search for and develop the 
skills that are already there, however basic they are.
<P>
	Then it teaches how to search for a suitable job and it helps the 
person go to the interview and it does the follow up and 
eventually when the person is placed it does the follow up to 
make sure the person stays in the job.
<P>
	After nine months of continuous employment the private 
company that did the training is paid about $5,000 for having 
placed the person.
<P>
	As I said earlier that has saved about $21 million for the 
taxpayers over the last few years.
<P>
	I would like to know if the member would agree that type of 
program could be useful in Canada, because about 85 per cent of 
the people placed are still in the same job after one year. It has a 
very high success rate.
<P>
	This seems to be a way to save tax dollars while at the same 
time helping people get out of that welfare rut.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not need to go to the United 
States to find examples of good employment programs and good 
training programs with equal success rates. I find them in my 
own community and I find them having been started by people in 
the community who understand our needs, who understand the 
resources of their community that they can bring to bear.
<P>
	There is room for a mix of public and private sector 
involvement as we address these issues as there is in programs in 
Canada and in my own community. However, I think we need to 
be cautious of one thing. It is very easy to have a higher success 
rate in one program if one is very selective about who one 
chooses and if one chooses only those people who are going to 
succeed. There are some people who are a much greater 
challenge whom the private sector, being interested in making 
the greatest possible profit in the least possible time, might not 
choose to work with.
<P>
	For instance, I mentioned young people with a history that has 
lead them to have fewer opportunities. I mentioned women, 
many of whom were married at a very young age, who became 
mothers at a very young age, became single parents at a very 
young age when their partner left them. Those women not only 
need specific training, development of skills they have, 
development of new skills, but they need to develop a whole new 
level of confidence in themselves and belief that they can make 
a difference in their own lives.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	That does not lead to a lot of profits but it leads to a lot of 
opportunities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have been listening to my hon. colleague. She is full of good 
intentions. It is true that there is a substantial wage differential 
between men and women. When you talk about youth issues, it 
also concerns me directly. Except that the hon. member said: 
``We want to do something, but we are not sure what''. There are 
things you can do when you are in office.
<P>
	In my riding, youth unemployment has reached 50 per cent, 
not 30 per cent but 50 per cent. In my riding, there are no 
universities. This means that we are continually experiencing a 
brain drain. And those who leave do not come back. You are very 
sensitive to that problem and you are full of good intentions, but 
the road to hell is paved with good intentions. So-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Your time is almost up. I will 
recognize the hon. parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am aware that some people, in 
some areas, are facing much more serious problems than my 
constituents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="913"> 913 </A></B>
<P>
	Indeed, solutions are urgently needed, but when you make 
profound changes, you must make sure that they are done well, 
that they will not only remedy the problem for a week or a month 
but provide a long-term solution.
<P>
	I am sure that the people concerned have good ideas to suggest 
and that we will make a better decision if we listen to them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first 
like to thank my parents, my family, the constituents of my 
riding of Lotbinière and all those who have worked directly or 
indirectly to help me get elected. Thank you.
<P>
	If I may, I would like to start my maiden speech by briefly 
describing the beautiful riding of Lotbinière that I am proud to 
represent. Flanked by the St. Lawrence River to the north, it 
includes more than 50 communities with a total population of 
94,315.
<P>
	The largest community is the recently merged city of 
Victoriaville-Arthabasca which is home to almost 40,000 
people. Victoriaville-Arthabasca is the third most 
industrialized city, per capita, in Quebec with close to 200 
industries. Sir Wilfrid Laurier's house overlooks the city, where 
the Susor-Côté family, Henri d'Arles and other famous people 
were born.
<P>
	The riding I represent offers many tourist attractions such as 
the Lapierre mill in Norbertville, the Portage mill in Lotbinière, 
the Bergeron plant in Saint-Antoine-de-Tilly, not to mention 
the region's numerous covered bridges, historic homes and 
churches.
<P>
	For a period of about ten years, the riding of Lotbinière was 
represented in the House of Commons by the late André Fortin. 
Mr. Fortin had a reputation for working tirelessly and with 
unsurpassed vigour to defend the interests of his constituents. I 
humbly hope that I can be worthy of that former member of 
Parliament who achieved big things in this riding. If serving the 
population means being a good member of Parliament, this is 
what I intend to do.
<P>
	I rise today to urge the Liberal government to think twice 
before slashing social programs. Despite being optimistic by 
nature, I must admit that rural regions such as mine are faced 
with growing poverty.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada, 4,680 men and women aged 
15 and over collected unemployment insurance in 1991 in the 
riding of Lotbinière, and this number has not improved with the 
recession we have been through. Three years ago, 
unemployment stood at 11 per cent of a labour force of 45,800. 
Add those on welfare and much of the population will be 
affected by the measures which the government intends to take.
<P>
	The reason I refer to my region is that, like other rural regions, 
it is in danger of suffering unduly from an ill-considered reform 
of social programs. We are trying to get our head above water 
and we fear that the Liberal government will put its hand on our 
head and make us sink further. The regions are already in trouble 
compared to the major centres. I certainly do not want to sound 
alarmist, but if we go by the social development report 
published by Quebec's Conseil des affaires sociales, we must 
admit that Quebec is split in two. Indeed, in the first report 
published in January 1989, we see an analysis of 25 regional 
county municipalities along the south shore of the St. Lawrence 
River, showing a decrease or no increase in population for 18 of 
them between 1981 and 1986.
<P>
	Of course, the exodus of our young people to major centres 
has a lot to do with it. Why do young people leave their home 
regions? Employment is their very legitimate reason. It is a 
vicious circle because the higher the jobless rate in a 
community, the more young people tend to leave it, as we can 
read in the report of the Conseil des affaires sociales. For want 
of economic and social opportunities, our young adults move to 
the big cities, leaving behind an aging population which for that 
very reason is more dependent on the state.
<P>
	There are two Quebecs, one young and prosperous, the other 
aging and poor. That is the situation in Quebec now, and it is no 
doubt the same in other provinces of Canada. Even though 
feelings of attachment remain strong in rural regions like 
Lotbinière, Charlevoix, Matapédia and Lac-Saint-Jean, the 
centralization of government services in cities identified as 
regional capitals obliges the people in the regions to travel to 
obtain services.
<P>
	Another example, taken from the report of the Conseil des 
affaires sociales published in 1990, shows that technical options 
are not being offered in regional high schools but rather in larger 
centres. Therefore many fifteen-year-olds go to the city not 
only to study but also in the hope of finding work. For example, 
Statistics Canada reported that nearly 35 per cent of the 
population in my riding was at least 40 years old in 1991.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resource Development said this week 
that he wanted the reform of social programs to create hope and 
to end dependency, especially by creating jobs. I would love to 
believe the minister, but nothing in his speech tells us how those 
jobs will be created. Where is the hope for the people of the rural 
regions I just mentioned? Their hope now lies in the help they 
receive from social programs, imperfect as these may be. The 
government will pay its debt with money taken from social 
services, forcing the provinces to raise taxes again and putting 
the federal government in a good light. There is more and more 
discontent in the regions and I hope that the minister is aware of 
the situation.
<P>

<P>
	Before concluding, I would like to quote Lise Bissonnette of 
<I>Le Devoir</I>, who wrote these lines in the issue of Tuesday, 
February 1, 1994:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the operation also serves as a disguise to a final assault by the federal 
government, which has been trying since the middle of the century to appropriate 
provincial fields of jurisdiction enshrined in the Constitution, namely social 
programs, education, and now labour relations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is possible to modify some programs without adversely 
affecting the have-nots. It is possible to prosper in a regional 
environment, as is demonstrated by Cascades. But for that to 
happen, the government must act responsibly. In the past three 
weeks, I have been receiving phone calls from poor people in my 
riding. Their first question is invariably: Will the government 
make cuts in the social programs? I would appreciate it if, one 
day, the government opposite would tell us precisely and 
honestly what it will do and where it will make those cuts. 
Canadians need to be reassured. We must not wait until the poor 
come and voice their discontentment here, in front of 
Parliament. We must not wait until then. I will tell you one 
thing: if it comes to that, I will side with the poor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened with interest to the member's speech. I congratulate 
him on it, but I have a couple of questions and a couple of 
concerns.
<P>
	I am not absolutely certain but I think I heard him indicate that 
he was relegating his riding to surviving simply on social 
assistance, that was to be the mainstay of his riding's economy. I 
cannot see that as a viable long term solution for his riding.
<P>
	My riding suffers from high unemployment as well. I come 
from a rural area with a number of communities. Although we 
see the importance of social programs to help us through 
difficult times, we see economic development and the pursuit of 
rebuilding the economy and creating new jobs as being the long 
term solution, not simply social programs.
<P>
	My second observation is that there seemed to be a great 
amount of concern among the needy of his riding, as he 
described them, as to from what level of government the 
assistance comes. It has been my experience when dealing with 
individuals who are in need of government assistance that their 
primary concern is that they receive the assistance. They do not 
much care about a battle between different levels of government 
getting in the way of the assistance getting to them.
<P>
	I thought the member might like to comment on those two 
points.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer the hon. 
member opposite. In the case of social programs, I think we 
must bring in a reform when the economy is going strong and not 
when it is down. Let me also add that in the case of the 
unemployment insurance reform, that is Bill C-113, the 
government penalized 99 per cent of the population simply to 
catch the one per cent of abusers. In a family such as Canada, of 
which Quebec is a full member, you must not resort to such 
measures and hurt the vast majority just to get at a very small 
number of individuals. You make reforms when the economy is 
strong, not when it is in difficulty. The recession which we have 
been going through since the early nineties is a good illustration 
of my point.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, western society, that some see as an advanced society, 
maintains certain values on which is based the principle of 
equality among individuals. These values can be summed up as 
the right to health, education, work and personal respect.
<P>
	These values have long been recognized as essential by 
Quebec society and by Canadian society. People here have 
agreed to assume their responsibilities by providing everyone 
with health, social and educational services whose quality we 
can only be proud of.
<P>
	In his motion to the House earlier this week, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development considers broad consultations 
to modernize and restructure Canada's social security system, 
``with particular reference to the needs of families with 
children, youth and working age adults''.
<P>
	In his statement, the minister assures the Canadian population 
that, far from wanting to make our social security system less 
efficient, he wants to improve it. The minister could not be more 
explicit. We must ensure, he said, that the system continues to 
offer basic security to all those in need.
<P>
	What worries me is that there are more and more people in 
need in this country. Where should we draw the line? Can we 
draw a line without endangering the principles of universality 
and accessibility?
<P>
	If I may, I would like to remind the House that one out of five 
Quebecers lives below the poverty line; it is easier to identify 
the groups that are not affected than those who are.
<P>
	In Canada, one child out of six is poor. If the children are poor, 
it means that their families are poor. They are not able to offer 
the living conditions essential to the development of children. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="915"> 915 </A></B>
<P>
must be pointed out, however, that this situation is not the 
parents' fault but results for the most part from economic hard 
times and the current climate of government indifference.
<P>
	Being poor means being hungry, being cold, being unable to 
concentrate in class, being sick more often than others; it often 
means having lost hope, living with violence, addictions and 
despair.
<P>
	Some say that the government is on the brink of bankruptcy. 
Everyone agrees that it is imperative to reduce the deficit. 
However, the government has a moral obligation to ensure that 
the measures advocated will have no negative effects on the 
disadvantaged. These measures should primarily be designed to 
improve socioeconomic conditions for those in need. To launch 
a real effort to put its fiscal house in order, the government must 
concentrate on its operating costs and on defence spending.
<P>
	It is only during an election campaign that we dare to propose 
miracle solutions to balance budgets with such large deficits. No 
one in this House is fooled, let alone the citizens of Quebec. The 
government must resist the temptation to cut social programs 
and service delivery.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The minister of human resources tries to reassure us by saying 
that under the system, basic security will be extended to all 
those in need. However, the services that are available right now 
to help those wishing to escape difficult circumstances and 
improve their lot in life are already inadequate. The government 
must devise a strategy to beef up social programs and services 
while bearing in mind the financial ability of the provinces, and 
of course Quebec, to pay and scrupulously upholding the 
principle of program accessibility and universality.
<P>
	Substantial cuts in recent years in federal transfer payments 
for health care have considerably increased the tax burden of the 
provinces and of Quebec. Public concern over possible cuts in 
federal social housing subsidies has left us fearful that this 
government is no longer seeking the path to reform, but has 
already found it.
<P>
	The official opposition will never agree to allowing this 
government to get a handle on the deficit by strangling society's 
less fortunate members. Curbing the deficit by cutting social 
security is unacceptable in a society that for many decades has 
defined itself as just and fair, a good place to live.
<P>
	Quebec has long been demanding, and with good reason, an 
end to overlap, duplication and federal government 
encroachment on provincial areas of jurisdiction, especially 
health care and education.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians have long been calling for a 
healthier, more streamlined government machine. Eliminating 
the additional expenditures resulting from program overlap 
would be another step forward in the process of putting our 
public finances in order.
<P>
	The consultation process launched this week is important. 
The stakes are high and this government cannot afford to 
misdiagnose the problem and, especially, to prescribe the wrong 
medicine.
<P>
	I am proud to be a member of the nursing profession and 
recently, the Association des infirmiers et des infirmières 
compared the cost of health care in Canada with costs in the 
United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and 
Sweden. It would appear that health care costs are higher here 
than anywhere else. But, is our health care system any better for 
it? Would our services suffer if we were to identify the reason 
for these cost disparities?
<P>
	Nurses are in favour of maintaining the quality of health care 
in this country. By listening to their expertise, perhaps we can 
come up with ways of using all of our health care system's 
resources more intelligently.
<P>
	Like all modern societies, Quebec want to control its growth 
and confront the future in a dynamic, responsible manner. The 
outcome of this debate must not impede the attainment of this 
objective.

the hon. member for London-Middlesex.
<P>
	First, I thank him for taking the time to listen to me. He 
deserves credit for being still here at 6 p.m. on a Thursday 
evening.
<P>
	The hon. member says he asked me two questions. 
Unfortunately, I believe he asked only one question because he 
first said that the Bloc Quebecois wants to destroy this 
magnificent country. His only question was: Why do we want to 
destroy this magnificent country since we, of course, recognize 
that the social security services which exist here, especially 
since the end of the Second World War, are services which we 
can be proud of.
<P>
	Canada is indeed a great country, but it is so great that, 
somehow, Quebecers feel a little removed from it. 
Unfortunately, we are different; we have different values which 
are important to us and, like Canadians, we respect people. 
Indeed, Quebecers, like Canadians, truly respect the importance 
of people's health; the difference is that Quebec was able to 
innovate and break new ground in all kinds of areas. Let me give 
you two examples. I believe Quebec was the first province to 
introduce maternity benefits or childbirth grants. Quebec's way 
of looking at things is slightly different and this is what makes a 
society rich and special.
<P>
	What the Bloc Quebecois wants, along with a great number of 
Quebecers, is to create a new state which will be able to have 
equal and active relations with its neighbours. I should add that 
we will be very happy to have Canada as our neighbour, because 
it is a great country which we respect, and we will also be very 
happy to have the United States as our neighbour.
<P>
	I hope that answers the question of the hon. member for 
London-Middlesex.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> I wanted to 
put a question to the hon. member. I listened to her speech; she 
talked about the deficit and Canada's financial problem. I 
simply wanted to ask her if she had discussed these issues with 
her colleagues since they have a certain experience with those 
problems which certainly existed prior to October 25.
<P>
	I was wondering for example if the hon. member had talked to 
the member for Saint-Hubert, the members for Richelieu, 
Longueuil and Rosemont and most of all, the member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean because these people have a vast experience and 
were part of the government at a time when all those problems 
were very obvious for all Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, as time is running 
short and you were in the country in those days, perhaps you 
could answer the hon. member's question.
<P>
	Of course it is important to reduce the deficit, but we must cut 
where it is logical to do so. It is logical to trim the fat first and 
for the time being, there are still a lot of areas where we can trim 
some fat.
<P>
	You know, in my kitchen, if I throw away some milk because 
it went sour, I am wasting it. Well, in this great and wealthy 
country of ours, I think there is still some waste. It is a collective 
as well as an individual responsibility and members of this 
House, of this government, who should serve as models, must 
set an example. I hope I have answered your question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I join in this debate on the motion of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development because it is one 
which will deeply affect the people of my riding and deeply 
affect all Canadians.
<P>
	Etobicoke-Lakeshore has fallen on hard times recently. 
Many of our industries have packed up and left town leaving 
empty plants and office spaces and many unemployed people in 
their wake.
<P>
	We have people capable of providing highly technical 
knowledge but with little infrastructure for support. The youth 
in my riding are facing an ever bleak future and it seems that no 
matter what their training is there are no jobs for them. There are 
many seniors in Etobicoke-Lakeshore who are living on the 
edge of poverty and they are all concerned about the quality of 
life they will have in their remaining days.
<P>
	My constituents and all Canadians are in a state of despair. 
They are having a hard time not only finding but keeping their 
jobs. Many who have jobs are underemployed or work only part 
time and intermittently.
<P>
	During the campaign I promised and I committed according to 
the red book. I committed together with all the members of the 
Liberal Party who were campaigning at the time that we would 
invest in people; that we would help individuals to make better 
choices for themselves and for their families; and, that we would 
help individuals to establish new ways of participating in a 
social and economic structure that would make a difference for 
them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="917"> 917 </A></B>
<P>
	We talked about rebuilding the security system, offering 
employment, offering hope, creating a more productive 
economy through better use of human resources, their skills, 
their talents and their abilities. We also spoke about education 
reforms, about our young people and the way in which we would 
have to prepare our young for the future ahead of them.
<P>
	This despair is felt; and this minister's commitment to a 
review of the system is exactly what we need to do. We want to 
ensure that our children are well trained and educated and we 
want jobs for ourselves and for our future.
<P>
	We recognize the contribution of senior Canadians. They 
spent their lives working to make a better place to live. They 
contributed to the development and funding of social programs. 
They should be able to live in security and enjoy retirement. The 
Canada pension plan, old age security, and guaranteed income 
supplement are meant to contribute to their security. These 
programs are no longer working as they were meant to.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	By the year 2020 it is predicted that 20 per cent of our 
population will be seniors. Maybe many hon. members will be in 
that category. If we do not work on these programs now there 
will be no support for those Canadians then.
<P>
	There is really one course of action. That is to involve 
Canadians in a full review of the system, a review that includes 
unemployment insurance, social assistance, training, education, 
looking at our young people, looking at our children and 
families or single and lone parent families, and all those who are 
presently experiencing difficulty in the system.
<P>
	We must involve all Canadians in this dialogue. We must 
involve as many Canadians as possible because these programs 
affect each and every one of us from the cradle to the grave. We 
each have an interest, a shared concern in the system, because 
we are all stakeholders. This is why we have embarked on this.
<P>
	The hon. members of the Official Opposition would have us 
believe that what we are about to do is what the Tories did: slash, 
burn, and cut and somehow walk away from the realities of the 
lives of the people we are here to serve.
<P>
	The Liberal Party founded most of today's social programs. 
These programs were designed for a different time but they were 
based on the same values which we hold dear today. They were 
based on the beliefs that each and every Canadian has a right to 
live with dignity, that each and every Canadian should be able to 
earn his or her own living. They were based on the knowledge 
that we do not all have equal opportunities in life and that we 
should work to ensure a certain standard of living for all. That 
includes unemployment insurance for those encountering 
difficulties in the workplace, social assistance for those facing 
poverty, and a pension plan for those in their senior years.
<P>
	We want to protect those values. We want to ensure those 
values continue to exist in our social security system. We can 
only do so with a comprehensive review such as the minister has 
proposed.
<P>
	I commend him for this ambitious plan and encourage all 
members of this House to work and to work steadfastly to ensure 
that we provide the environment and the kind of security that is 
needed in our country.
<P>
	I extend my own support and pledge I will do everything in my 
capacity to ensure that the residents of Etobicoke-Lakeshore 
and all Canadians participate in this endeavour.
<P>
	We have recommitted through the red book that this must be 
done to ensure that our commitment is met.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since there are only three minutes left, 
I would ask the member for Bourassa to share them with the 
parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I would 
like to congratulate my hon. colleague on her election as an MP. 
She is from one of Canada's important minority groups, and 
since I too belong to one of them, I think that we should be able 
to work together for Canada's minorities.
<P>
	The member mentioned unemployment. I believe that in 
Canada, minorities are particularly affected by unemployment 
and the economic crisis. I would like to hear her views on equal 
access programs such as job access and affirmative action for 
minorities. I hope the government will make more room for 
minorities in the federal public service where they are 
under-represented.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question and for the opportunity to share some of his 
experiences that we have in common.
<P>
	I do care about equity issues. I think we are on the road to 
equity. If we look around the Chamber we can see that there are 
opportunities for us to work in a fashion that would reflect the 
nature of Canadian society.
<P>
	Canadian society is not just English and French, or people 
from Quebec and people from the rest of Canada. We are 
multicultural and multiracial. We must be in every place in 
society. We must aspire to be the best Canadians that we can be 
and every opportunity must be given to individuals. It is a waste 
of talent and ability when every individual is not given the 
opportunity to reach their full potential.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="918"> 918 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why I am here. That is why the hon. member is here. 
We are all here to work in the interests of Canadians to make 
sure we have a society that is equitable, that is working, a 
society where each and every individual is a person of dignity, of 
worth and able to participate fully in Canadian society.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DAIRYINDUSTRY">DAIRY INDUSTRY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
this evening under Standing Order 37(3) to discuss a question I 
had in question period the first day of this session.
<P>
	I know when I was on the other side of the House not too many 
members on this side of the House got up under this standing 
order.
<P>
	However, I thought it might give me an opportunity to discuss 
a serious situation in my riding and in ridings across this country 
regarding Canada's position as it came out of the GATT 
negotiations regarding ice cream and yogurt. At that time I 
asked the minister what he was doing and how the negotiations 
were going with the Americans.
<P>
	There is a lot of concern out there that over the past few years 
the government has not stood up for the rights of Canadian 
farmers when negotiating with the Americans on these issues.
<P>
	In fact there are many in my riding of Haldimand-Norfolk 
who feel that the government has failed in any attempt over the 
past few years to put a strong argument forward on behalf of 
Canadian farmers.
<P>
	I ask the minister if he would not stand up to the Americans 
and tell them we are not prepared to cave in to their position on 
ice cream and yogurt which was essentially to lower those tariffs 
to zero immediately.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	The minister may not be aware of a legal decision that has 
come forward to us from the dairy farmers of Canada that in fact 
supports the Canadian position that we can put a tariff on ice 
cream and yogurt. I know the minister will be very pleased to 
hear this. In fact Richard Doyle of the Dairy Farmers of Canada 
says in a letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The drafters of the NAFTA text clearly recognized that GATT rights and 
obligations would not be static, but grow and change with the agreements 
negotiated under the GATT. In light of the extensive references to developments 
and future agreements under GATT, it appears unlikely that a successful 
argument could be made against Canada's decision to reduce tariff levels 
according to its GATT rights and obligations. In reviewing the legal opinion, 
valid arguments have been identified to support the position that your 
government took during the GATT negotiations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have here a legal opinion by the American law firm, 
Cameron and Hornbostel. I am sure the hon. minister does not 
have this legal opinion yet because it was just sent out. It is dated 
February 1.
<P>
	I am sure when he receives it he will look at it and make it very 
clear to the Americans that unless we can negotiate a deal we do 
intend to keep these tariffs on ice cream and yogurt. In fact, we 
will fight as hard as we can to make sure that we have a 
continued supply management system in this country and a 
viable agriculture sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
reply to my colleague's comments. I commend him for the 
interest that he has shown and continues to show on this issue.
<P>
	There are a number of outstanding agri-food trade issues that 
are being discussed and are problems between Canada and the 
United States at the present time. The Minister of Agriculture 
attempted to resolve these while he was in Geneva but the 
Americans did not see fit to take part in those discussions at that 
time and unfortunately we were not able to get a bilateral 
agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="919"> 919 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course, the issues did not go away. The problems did not go 
away. Canada is still seeking a resolution to these issues in a way 
that meets Canadian needs. There have been ongoing bilateral 
negotiations over the past several weeks. The minister met with 
his U.S. counterpart in Toronto on January 8. Those discussions 
are not yet concluded and continue to go on at this time.
<P>
	I would like to state clearly that the government is working to 
defend the interests of Canadian agriculture in these 
negotiations. All sectors of agriculture and the agri-food 
industry in all parts of Canada are being considered and taken 
into account.
<P>
	Everyone who is familiar with the Canadian industry has 
known for some time that the trade regime for ice cream and 
yogurt was going to be a difficult issue in the conclusion of the 
Uruguay round. A GATT panel ruled in 1989 that Canada's 
import quotas on ice cream and yogurt were not consistent with 
article XI. Canada accepted the findings and agreed to bring its 
measures into conformity with GATT. In light of that 
multinational trade union result, the government is continuing 
to seek resolve of that situation.
<P>
	The government remains committed to ensuring that our 
supply management systems can continue.
<P>
	With the support of the provincial ministers of agriculture, the 
federal minister has asked me to lead a small task force to 
consult with all stakeholders to talk about and discuss what 
changes may be necessary and what mechanisms will be 
required so that we can continue to have orderly marketing for 
the supply managed commodities into the future for the benefit 
of all Canadians.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ROUGERIVERVALLEY">ROUGE RIVER VALLEY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to take up an issue that was raised in Question Period just a 
few days ago which related to a large piece of my riding of 
Scarborough-Rouge River. That is the lands that comprise the 
Rouge River Valley.
<P>
	What I collectively refer to as the Rouge Valley lands 
comprise approximately 10,000 acres in what is now an urban 
environment. The 10,000 acres, give or take a few, basically 
include the two river valleys that comprise the two Rouge River 
tributaries. These lands have somehow managed to survive 
intact as an integral ecological unit with their evolved flora and 
fauna.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	In recognition of that fact we have to pay tribute to those who 
over the last 15 or 20 years realized this and made it known 
before it was too late in the face of the development of these 
lands. Now the Rouge Valley lands have received a commitment 
from provincial, federal and municipal governments to preserve 
them in an ecological park of the sort that is still being 
negotiated and managed.
<P>
	To give an example for the record, the Rouge Valley River still 
has 55 species of fish. It is home to 200 species of birds, 28 
species of mammals and 700 species of plants, forest and 
vegetation. That is in an urban area of Toronto. As hard as it is to 
believe, we must be thankful for it and make a commitment to it.
<P>
	My question involved the seeking of a commitment from 
federal, provincial and municipal governments and that whole 
community that comprises eastern metro. We are looking for a 
commitment from this government to complete a promise of 
funding of $10 million given in 1987. Part of this commitment 
has already been used for the acquisition of an aboriginal burial 
site at the edge of park boundary. There was also a commitment 
of federal expertise in managing park lands or ecological 
habitats.
<P>
	Some believe the park could be jointly developed and 
managed by the provincial and federal governments. Others 
believe the park should be managed by an entity developed 
specifically for that purposes and others who think the 
municipal government should also have a role.
<P>
	I am seeking a further commitment from the federal 
government and I am very hopeful along with all the people I 
represent and all the people in the southern Ontario community 
who care very much about this priceless asset. We hope the 
federal government will commit to further involvement in the 
project.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for Scarborough for his question on the Rouge River 
Valley.
<P>
	As the Minister of Canadian Heritage has already indicated to 
the House, this government remains committed to the creation 
of the Rouge River Valley Park. In fact this 11,400 acre preserve 
is North America's largest urban park. Its creation is an 
excellent example of co-operation among the federal and 
Ontario governments as well as private organizations in meeting 
federal government environmental objectives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, from the very beginning, the federal government 
has been in favour of the Rouge River Valley Park. In 1988, the 
Minister of the Environment of the time announced that the 
Canadian government would invest $10 million for the 
conservation of the valley.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, the federal government contributed $1.5 million of the 
$2.6 million purchase price for the culturally significant Bead 
Hill National Historic Site in Scarborough within the Rouge 
River Park. This is the only intact 17th century Seneca village 
and burial ground known in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As my friend from Scarborough-Rouge River knows, Bead 
Hill is an example of an important aspect of native history which 
is under-represented in the Canadian network of national 
historic sites.

<P>
	The federal government's commitment to the Rouge River 
Valley Park remains firm. Upon establishment of a park 
management agency by the Ontario government, we would be 
pleased to consider funding further projects for park 
development within our commitment.
<P>
	I would like to thank my friend from Scarborough-Rouge 
River for displaying his continuing interest in Rouge River 
Valley Park. It is a very important element in the lives of his 
constituents as well as all Canadians. He should be 
congratulated for bringing their concerns to the forefront of 
discussion in the House.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising to discuss further the question I asked in the House the 
other day that dealt with the funding levels for settlement 
programs for immigrants.
<P>
	As I mentioned during question period, 59 per cent of the 
250,000 immigrants who settle in Canada settle in Ontario but 
only 39 per cent of the federal immigration settlement program 
funds go to language training for Ontario. As I mentioned, the 
budgets of the school boards in Ontario are being cut constantly 
by the provinces which is resulting in language training 
programs being cut.
<P>
	I want to expand a little on why this issue is important and 
what it means to the future of all people in Ontario. We talk a 
great deal about the future of this country, stating that higher 
education is extremely important in order for the young people 
to be able to build careers, especially in the new knowledge 
based industries.
<P>
	If the immigrant children who come to this country are not 
able to learn the language where they reside, whether it is 
English in Ontario or French in Quebec, they do not have the 
basis on which to build an education and a career, thereby being 
relegated to dead end jobs and being denied, in essence, a proper 
education.
<P>
	The problem does not remain just with children. It is a wider 
issue and affects adults as well. When I came to this country in 
1957 there was no such thing as a language program. Therefore 
we as children had to struggle.
<P>
	The parents who worked long hours from five in the morning 
to eight at night either in factories or construction-certainly 
my parents-were not able to learn the language properly. We 
are now paying in a social way because if we do not pay up front, 
we pay later as a society.
<P>
	Later we will pay for the seniors. We talk about seniors issues 
in this House. We must remember that there are hundreds of 
thousands of seniors in this country who came here and worked 
for the last 35 or 40 years and are not yet cognizant enough of the 
English language to be able to take advantage of the programs 
we provide through our taxpayers' dollars. They are not able to 
take  advantage of the counselling programs we provide. They 
are not able to take advantage of a lot of programs that are 
available to the average Canadian. This creates an added burden 
on society.
<P>
	My question is very important because I am concerned and 
interested. I want to make sure we look at funding. I am not 
simply asking questions from the point of view that we want 
more money because there is money going elsewhere or what 
have you. It is not a light question. I am looking very seriously at 
the implications of what it means to people and the effect it has 
on these people's lives down the road, both the children and 
adults along with the seniors eventually.
<P>
	It is a social issue and not just one of immigration. I want to 
make sure the minister understands that. I want to ask the 
minister if the discussions I understand the parliamentary 
secretary to have mentioned that day are in any way anticipated 
to bring about results in the near future or if we are looking at 
something that will take still some time.
<P>
	My concern is that something happen as soon as possible 
simply because we cannot afford to have children in the school 
system who do not get a proper education. The school boards get 
their money as we know from ratepayer taxes. It is a finite 
source and it is very difficult to deal with added resources.
<P>
	We as a government and as a nation have a responsibility to 
assist in this area because we are the ones that set the levels. We 
work with the provinces in identifying the immigrants we want 
to come to this country. We have a responsibility to then work 
with the provinces to make sure there is equity in the system.
<P>
	I would appreciate it if the minister would address that aspect 
of my question.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. 
member has a long and distinguished background in settlement 
work in her home province. She can take pride in the fact that the 
government has already introduced regulatory changes that will 
allow refugee claimants to work while awaiting the outcome of 
their claim.
<P>
	The government is committed to enhanced co-operation and 
co-ordination between the two levels of government. We will 
have to work together to use scarce resources more effectively.
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration met on Monday 
with his Ontario counterparts to discuss the very matter raised 
by the hon. member for Beaches-Woodbine. I am pleased to 
say that the province of Ontario and the federal government will 
begin negotiations with a view to establishing an immigrant 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="921"> 921 </A></B>
<P>
agreement. Ontario is one of only three provinces that does not 
have an immigration agreement with the federal government.
<P>
	With this first step we have clearly demonstrated our 
willingness to enhance co-operation and co-ordination between 
the two levels of government. The federal government has a 
series of settlement programs and services designed to help 
immigrants access services available to all Canadians. These 
programs are designed and delivered on the understanding that 
settlement is a process that involves new and established 
Canadian residents.
<P>
	Canadians are involved as sponsors, service deliverers, 
volunteers and hosts. More than 300 external partners have 
entered into contribution agreements with the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration for the delivery of services to 
newcomers.
<P>
	The program allocations for the various settlement programs 
for 1993-94 will be over $251 million. We understand and share 
Ontario's concerns about settlement and integration, and we are 
certainly prepared to listen. This immigration agreement will be 
the first step in addressing Ontario's concerns.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced 
yesterday and again today, he is placing this House in front of a 
fait accompli with respect to the appointment of a new President 
of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He has refused to 
subject this appointment to a parliamentary committee for 
approval in a free, binding vote, as the previous government had 
promised.
<P>
	Yesterday, I asked the minister to explain to the House why 
this policy was changed and why candidates for the position of 
president and chief executive officer of the CBC had to send 
their resumés to the Prime Minister's Office, to the official in 
charge of appointments, who is a long-standing Liberal Party 
activist.
<P>
	The minister told us that the policy had changed because the 
government had changed and went on to refer me to page 454 of 
<I>Hansard</I>. That was an obvious statement if there ever was one. 
And the reason I am rising again on this question this evening is 
that the minister's answer was totally unacceptable as it did not 
address my question.
<P>
	I did refer to <I>Hansard</I> as the hon. minister had so kindly 
suggested and here is what I found, and I quote: ``The 
government will announce shortly the appointment of the new 
president of the CBC''.
<P>
	As you can see, Mr. Speaker, that does not answer my 
question. The previous government had instituted an 
appointment process designed to be non-partisan, in which 
nominations were to be sent to recruitment committees. Since 
coming into office October 25, the new government has been 
telling us that they were following in the tracks of the previous 
government. Let me tell you that they have gone off the track 
and that openness has been thrown into the ditch.
<P>
	Today, I asked the minister again why his government had 
made that change? To no avail.
<P>
	Why did the minister not submit the appointment to the 
parliamentary committee on Canadian Heritage?
<P>
	Why does the minister refuse to table before that committee, 
meeting in camera, the list of candidates who have turned down 
the job as reported in <I>La Presse</I> today.
<P>
	Why does the minister refuse to be more transparent about 
political appointments when his Prime Minister is boasting left 
and right that he wants to restore the confidence of the people of 
Canada and Quebec in their public corporations and federal 
institutions?
<P>
	Is it only because the minister is not an expert on 
parliamentary procedure, as he said himself?
<P>
	At the first opportunity the government has to make good on a 
promise, namely to run the country with transparency, it has 
candidacies sent to the Prime Minister's Office instead of an 
impartial recruitment committee.
<P>
	I think that the people of Quebec and Canada are entitled to 
see for themselves that the people running their public 
corporations are chosen on the basis of objective criteria.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Need I remind you that we are entitled to question the 
government's openness on this? Indeed, we have no grounds to 
believe that the credibility of the process of appointment to 
management positions in federal institutions has been improved 
by the recent change of government.
<P>
	How many candidates refused the position in the CBC? Why 
did the Prime Minister break with tradition and prefer to choose 
a candidate from inside instead of from outside the 
organization? The minister had many meetings with the 
candidate while he was acting president of the Corporation since 
November. Did the minister discuss his candidacy during those 
meetings? Did the minister support the candidacy? Did he 
personally recommend it to the appointments director? Who 
really made the decision? The minister, Mrs. Collenette or the 
Prime Minister on the advice of his special adviser, the former 
president of the CBC?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="922"> 922 </A></B>
<P>
	All these questions are unanswered. Could the minister 
answer them directly tonight, without referring me to <I>Hansard</I> 
this time?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage I am pleased to respond to the 
question raised by the member for Rimouski-Témiscouata on 
the appointment of the new president of the CBC.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the minister said, the selection process for the new 
president of the CBC was very transparent. On November 13, 
1993, a call for candidacies was printed in The Canada Gazette, 
and all interested candidates had the opportunity to apply for the 
position. Also, many people were consulted on this issue.
<P>
	The CBC needed someone with experience who knew the nuts 
and bolts of this institution and was ready to go into action 
immediately. Mr. Manera is such a person. He has been working 
for the corporation since 1985, holding the positions of senior 
vice-president, Resources and Administration, and more 
recently, acting president.
<P>
	The appointment of the new president comes with a series of 
measures the government has undertaken to allow the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation to assume its own destiny, one of the 
commitments the Liberals included in the red book.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The appointment of Mr. Manera and the series of measures 
announced will assist the CBC in reinforcing its role as public 
broadcaster and as a national institution serving the Canadian 
public.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of all our cultural institutions, the CBC is undoubtedly the 
one which plays the most significant role in defining our 
national identity.
<P>
	The broadcasting industry is undergoing massive changes, 
and it was imperative that we appoint a president capable of 
dealing with the financial problems of the Corporation and of 
reasserting loud and clear the role of the CBC as a public 
broadcaster serving the Canadian public. That is exactly what 
we have done, and an announcement on this issue was made this 
morning.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Friday, the minister of Human Resources Development ended 
his answer to my question on a potential Unemployment 
Insurance costs increase by inviting the Official Opposition to 
co-operate with him in a thorough examination of social 
programmes, and thus study the question of government's social 
expenditures as a whole.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to remind the minister of 
Human Resources Development that we should also take a look 
at the evolution of certain of our social policies, and I am 
particularly referring to the lack of a family oriented policy in 
Canada, since 1994 year is the International Year of the Family.
<P>
	With the emergence of a certain form of neoliberalism in the 
eighties, a new view of family responsibility has come to the 
fore; it has now become an individual responsibility, thus 
freeing society from a seemingly embarrassing load.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Federal social policies are often based on a concept of the 
family where the husband is the only wage earner. Thus, we have 
a married exemption in our tax system. In our old age security 
plan, the wife's benefits are cut in half when her husband dies, 
but if the wife dies, her husband keeps all his benefits.
<P>
	As a result of complex changes in the tax system and the 
deindexation of family and child benefits, a Senate committee 
says that, from 1986 to 1991, the federal government grabbed 
$3.5 billion out of the family and child benefits program. A 
Quebec family with two children and an income of $70,000 a 
year pays as much tax as a childless family with the same 
income.
<P>
	Thus, a couple who chooses to invest in a pension plan will 
have generous tax deductions, but if it prefers to invest in the 
future of the Quebec nation by having children, it has to fend for 
itself without any help from Revenue Canada.
<P>
	This lack of family oriented policies at the federal level 
carries tragic consequences. In 1991, the number of children 
depending on food banks in Quebec and Canada was estimated 
at 700,000. One year later, it was 900,000. Many teachers 
throughout our school system complain that they are now social 
workers because of a sharp deterioration in family life and 
because of the number of children they look after.
<P>
	The following case shows the great inconsistency of federal 
family-oriented policies. In Toronto, a young mother, owner of 
a small business with nine employees, had to be on her job in her 
business two days only after having a baby. That person 
contributes to plans insuring a significant percentage of her 
employees' salaries when they are on maternity leave, but 
nothing in the social policies of the federal government provides 
for maternity leave for that small business owner. Such a 
situation is unacceptable.
<P>
	The establishment of a universal day care program, maternity 
leave and special leave granted to mothers to provide care to a 
sick child are but a few of the issues that have to be debated in 
initiating a true reform of social programs, and especially the 
establishment of family oriented policy.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="923"> 923 </A></B>
<P>
	Simple things such as allowing children to have lunch at 
school so that they do not have to travel, offering flexible work 
schedules and offering a flexible transit system to seniors 
would also foster the emergence of a family oriented policy.
<P>
	In the past, the federal government, and this includes the 
Liberal government, showed a lack of vision and a lack of 
courage towards Quebecers and Canadians with respect to 
family oriented policies.
<P>
	We, the members of the Bloc Quebecois, are convinced that a 
review of our social programs starts with the development of a 
real family oriented policy in Canada as well as in Quebec. 
Whatever options the Liberal Party has, it is difficult for us to 
think that this government can ignore the fundamental changes 
that family structures have undergone in Canada and Quebec 
since the introduction of social programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the UI premium rate for 1994 has been set at the minimum rate 
required under the Unemployment Insurance Act. The rate will 
not be increased during 1994. Furthermore, the government will 
introduce legislation to prevent the UI premium rate from rising 
in 1995 as would otherwise occur under the provisions of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
	The UI program is self-financing from premiums paid by 
employees and employers. The federal government temporarily 
finances UI deficits but premium revenues must eventually 
match UI costs. We therefore might have paid for the freeze by 
allowing the deficit in the UI account to rise, thus postponing the 
day it would return to balance, but we decided that would be 
imprudent.
<P>
	There is widespread recognition of the need for a 
comprehensive reform of Canada's social security programs. No 
department or government on its own could design all the 
appropriate changes. Therefore we hope members of the House 
from all parties will participate in the reform of social programs 
including unemployment insurance.
<P>
	As the Minister of Human Resources Development said in 
response to the hon. member's original question, the review of 
the social security system that was launched in the House on 
January 31 will consider the issues of unemployment insurance 
rates and premiums in a broader context.
<P>
	The hon. member will agree that the problems facing 
Canadians in the 1990s go far beyond the financing of the UI 
system. Unemployment, poverty, global competitiveness, 
changes in the work place and skill shortages are only some of 
the factors we must consider in the process of rebuilding the 
social security, labour market and learning framework of our 
country.
<P>
	The scope of the review will include UI but will extend 
beyond it to include training and employment programs, social 
assistance and income security, education and learning, labour 
practices and rules affecting the workplace, and taxes and 
premiums that affect job creation.
<P>
	Our goal is to reduce reliance on programs like 
unemployment insurance by helping people to get back to work. 
This is the mandate we received from the Canadian people in the 
October 25 election. This is our commitment and this is what the 
social security reform process is all about.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, the minister outlined a process 
for reform that will consult widely with Canadians from all 
walks of life on these important issues. The process respects the 
jurisdiction-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to say that the member's 
time has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at ten o'clock, pursuant to Standing Orders 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
