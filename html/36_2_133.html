<P><A NAME="LINK2"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there has been consultation 
among all parties in the House and I believe you would find 
unanimous consent for the following motion.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, notwithstanding any standing order or usual practice, the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts shall meet this day at 
12.30 p.m. for the purpose of hearing evidence from the Auditor 
General of Canada and that, if the chair or vice-chairs of the 
committee are not present— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I understand one of the vice-chairs is available now. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the committee may choose any other member to be acting chair of 
the meeting and that the committee be authorized to broadcast its 
proceedings. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the information of hon. members, the room that has been made 
available is Room 237-C if members wish to note it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have another motion that 
I want to bring to the attention of the House.  I ask hon. 
members to pay close attention to this one.  It relates to the 
fact that I received a communication from the other place late 
yesterday evening indicating that if by 10.30 this morning we 
refer Bill C-44 to it, the bill will be passed this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I would move that Bill C-44 shall be deemed to have 
been read a second time, referred to a committee of the whole, 
reported without amendment, concurred in at report stage and read 
a third time and passed now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we could pass a motion at 
any time to do anything in this place, it seems, but I believe 
the motion really is not in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have rules in this place that say there are ways to handle 
bills and motions.  It includes a second reading debate, a 
referral to committee where witnesses could be brought in to 
answer any questions we may have, report stage amendments and 
debate, and a third reading debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that we are going to proceed with this bill, a bill that 
involves billions of taxpayer dollars, without debate and at all 
stages in order to get it to the Senate and into law just because 
there will be an election call on Sunday, is not wise use of 
House time.  It circumvents the rules in a way that was never 
intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are more than prepared to debate it.  We are more than 
prepared to put forward our amendments and our ideas on it. 
However, we are not prepared to proceed, nor do I think this 
motion should even be accepted that we circumvent the rules of 
the House because an election is imminent on Sunday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as was indicated by the 
House leader for the official opposition, there are certainly 
some problems with the method by which the government is 
attempting to move this legislation forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the lesser of the evils here is that many seasonal 
workers, many Atlantic Canadians and Canadians right across the 
country who would be the beneficiaries of this legislation, will 
not be able to avail themselves of the support that would be put 
in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians know and all members of the House realize that 
this legislation, were it really a government priority, could 
have been brought forward in a much more timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was alluded to by my friend is quite true.  The government 
is in the death throes before an election.  It is attempting to 
get this legislation through in a very cynical fashion.  It is 
attempting to hold this in front of the faces of Canadians and 
tell them that this is fixed, that this is a done deal, just as 
it has with medicare.  That of course is not the case, as we all 
realize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do not want to do is hold up this legislation.  If there 
is any way procedurally that we can proceed with this legislation 
to the benefit and greater good of Canadians who would therefore 
be eligible and able to avail themselves of this support system 
through the EI changes, we in the Progressive Conservative Party 
would be prepared to co-operate with the government to see that 
it happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The indication that the other place would also be open to 
receipt of this legislation to see that it would pass through 
before the end of the day is welcome news.  I do not think any 
member of the House should throw up roadblocks to try to prevent 
that from happening.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a very jaded view that the government is doing this. 
It is obviously doing so as more pre-election goodies, but we do 
not want to see this legislation held up any further if at all 
possible.  It does circumvent rules.  It does not allow us to 
have sufficient time to look at the content and the true inner 
mechanisms that would be brought about by this legislation, but 
it is done with the best of intentions, we hope, and therefore 
the Progressive Conservative Party would support passage of that 
legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the Bloc 
Quebecois will not give its support to this motion and the 
leader of the government knows why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes a clause that legalizes the diversion of the 
employment insurance fund, and the Bloc Quebecois can never 
allow the government to set the rate by itself. This 
responsibility must be assumed by the commission. We conveyed 
the message to this government that we would not support the 
motion, even though it really saddens us to do so, considering 
all the positive measures, however temporary, that the bill may 
provide for, among others, seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have loved to support this legislation, but once again 
the government has shown its arrogance, cynicism and disregard 
for democracy. No matter how we put it, this sad week is still 
unfolding, even today. Unfortunately, we will not give our 
support. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the NDP echoes some of the 
concerns expressed by my hon. colleague from the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  We also are not completely satisfied with 
some aspects of this legislation.  However, we are prepared to 
co-operate because we realize that employment insurance is very 
important for people in the Atlantic provinces.  Even though this 
is being done, as has been indicated, as an election fulfilment 
or an election promise, we feel that in the end if the people 
benefit that is the important thing.  We would be prepared to 
co-operate to allow it to be passed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are faced with a very big decision but a 
fairly straightforward one.  Is the House prepared to proceed in 
such a fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there was a motion just 
put before the House that was denied unanimous consent but 
perhaps the House would consent to debate the bill if it were 
renamed the Liberal vote buying bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1998, a company proposed a project to export water by 
tanker from Lake Superior. This sparked a debate among Canadians 
on the future security and preservation of Canada's freshwater 
resources. However, this is not a new issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has followed the deliberations of the House over the 
past 40 years will remember the grandiose continental schemes 
dreamed up to transfer water out of Canada.  The views of 
Canadians and the Government of Canada on this have not changed. 
Canada's water is not for sale.  Our freshwater resources are too 
precious to allow bulk removal or diversion.  They must be 
protected for future generations of Canadians who will follow us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successive Canadian governments have opposed the diversion or 
bulk removal of Canadian water.  However, to date this has been 
little more than declarations.  The time has now come to deal 
through legislation with the issue, and that is why we are taking 
action. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 will protect boundary waters, including the critical 
resource of the Great Lakes, from bulk water removal under 
federal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act implements the 1909 Canada-U.S. Boundary Waters Treaty. 
This is one of our oldest treaties and a landmark in Canada-U.S. 
relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With over 300 lakes and rivers along the Canada-U.S. border, the 
drafters recognized the critical role played by water and the 
importance of providing a structure and mechanism to prevent and 
resolve disputes between the two countries. Ninety-one years 
later we are using the same mechanism to ensure that these 
waters will be protected for future generations of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act 
in Bill C-15 are based principally on Canada's treaty obligations 
to the United States not to take action in Canada which affects 
levels and flows of boundary waters on the United States side of 
the border.  I would note that the United States has the same 
obligation to Canada, that is, not to take action in the U.S. 
which affects levels and flows of boundary waters on the Canadian 
side of the border. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments also have a second objective; to protect the 
integrity of boundary water ecosystems. The amendments have 
three key elements: a prohibition provision; a licensing regime; 
and sanctions and penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prohibition provision will give the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs the authority to impose a prohibition on removals of 
boundary waters out of their water basins. Exceptions will be 
considered, such as ballast water, short-term humanitarian 
purposes and water used in the production of food or beverages, 
for example, bottled water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are many boundary waters along the Canada-U.S. border 
affected by the prohibition, its most significant effect will be 
on the Great Lakes. This will provide to Canada the ability to 
stop any future plans for water removal out of the Great Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Separate from the amendments dealing with the prohibition, there 
will be a licensing regime. These licences will cover projects 
such as dams and obstructions in boundary and transboundary 
waters. Under the provisions of the treaty, these types of 
projects must have the approval of the International Joint 
Commission and the Government of Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020
<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stress that the process of approving such 
projects has taken place over the past 91 years without any 
problems under the general authority of the treaty. In essence, 
the process is not changing, except that it will be formalized 
now in a licensing system. Also, the licensing regime will not 
cover bulk water removal projects. These, if they are proposed, 
are covered by the Act's prohibition. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 will also allow for clear and strong sanctions and 
penalties.  This will give teeth to the prohibitions and ensure 
that Canada is in the position to enforce it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to set Bill C-15 in the general context of 
Canada's strategy announced on February 10, 1999 to prohibit 
bulk removal of water out of all major Canadian water basins. 
Why did the Government of Canada take this initiative?  The 
removal and transfer of water in bulk may result in irreversible 
ecological, social and economic impacts. We want to ensure, for 
future generations of Canadians, the security of our freshwater 
resources and the integrity of our ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to be effective, any approach must take account of two 
factors. First, no single government has the ability to resolve 
this question. Flowing water does not respect political 
boundaries. 
In the case of the Great Lakes system, two federal governments, 
eight state governments, two provincial governments, and a 
number of regional and binational organizations are involved in 
managing and protecting freshwater resources. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it would be a gross oversimplification to view the 
issue only from one angle.  It is a multidimensional issue 
involving removals, diversions, consumption, population and 
economic growth, the effects of climate change, and last but not 
least, the cumulative effect of all those factors. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All levels of government must act effectively and in concert 
within their respective jurisdictions. Hence, Canada announced 
in  February 1999 that the Government of Canada would be acting 
within its jurisdiction.  Bill C-15 fulfils this commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada also announced a reference from the governments of Canada 
and the United States to the International Joint Commission to 
investigate and make recommendations on consumptive uses, 
diversions and removals in the greatest of our shared waters, 
the Great Lakes.  It said that it recognized the primary 
responsibility of provinces and territories for water 
management.  My colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, 
and I proposed a Canada-wide accord to prohibit bulk water 
removal out of major Canadian water basins.

legislation and policies to prohibit bulk water removal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Joint Commission delivered a landmark report 
on March 15 of this year, that is, the protection of the waters 
of the Great Lakes.  I would like to reflect briefly on the IJC's 
conclusions and its recommendations.  They are consistent with 
and supportive of the broad environmental approach adopted by 
Canada on the issue of bulk water removal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Joint Commission concluded that “water is a 
non-renewable resource” and the vast volumes of the Great Lakes 
are deceiving.  Less than 1% of the water in the Great Lakes 
system is renewed annually.  The other 99% is a gift of the 
glacial age.  Taking water out of the water basin is in fact like 
mining.  Once taken it will not return.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also stated that if all the interests in the Great 
Lakes Basin are considered, there is never a surplus of water. 
Every drop of water has several potential uses. Forty million 
Canadians and Americans depend on the waters of the Great Lakes 
for every aspect of life: day-to-day living, industry, recreation, 
transportation and trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of this, the ecosystem of the Great Lakes has its own, 
equally important, demands on the water.  As we are dependent on 
the future health of the Great Lakes, the future health of the 
ecosystem is dependent on our action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IJC concluded that the Great Lakes require protection, given 
all of the present and future stresses and uncertainties. 
Recommendations for action were made to all levels of government 
in Canada and the U.S.  These recommendations provide the basis 
for developing a consistent approach to protecting the Great 
Lakes on both sides of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada agrees with the IJC's conclusions. The 
prohibition provisions of Bill C-15 will provide the protection 
to the Great Lakes called for by the IJC. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Great Lakes are the largest reservoir of fresh water in the 
world.  If the IJC, the International Joint Commission, considers 
caution is the watchword for the management of waters in the 
Great Lakes basin, is it not equally so for other smaller bodies 
of water and ecosystems across Canada wherever they are located? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to address the trade 
implications of Canada's policy approach.  A number of persons 
and groups have called on the federal government to use an 
export ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a consensus among Canadians that our water resources 
need protection. The issue before us, then, is not whether to 
protect the water, but how best to accomplish the goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's approach, embodied in Bill C-15 and our overall 
strategy, is to protect water in its natural state in water 
basins. It is better than an export ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is protected and regulated in its natural state, before 
the issue of exporting arises and before it has become a 
commercial good or a saleable commodity. It is the most 
comprehensive, environmentally sound and effective means of 
preserving the integrity of ecosystems and is consistent with 
international trade obligations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The critical point is that the Canadian government and Canadian 
governments of the past have full sovereignty over the management 
of water in its natural state and, in exercising this 
sovereignty, they would not be constrained by trade agreements. 
Canada's view of this matter has been supported by a wide range 
of expert opinion.  The International Joint Commission, which is 
an independent binational Canadian-U.S. commission, came to 
similar conclusions in its final report after exhaustive public 
hearings and submissions that included government and independent 
experts representing every point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deputy United States trade representative, in a written 
submission reproduced in the IJC report, indicated that under 
customary international law, non-navigable rivers to a 
watercourse, including the right to control or limit extraction, 
belong solely to the country or countries where that watercourse 
lies.  He further indicated that the World Trade Organization 
“simply has nothing to say regarding the basic decision by 
governments whether to permit the extraction of water from lakes 
and rivers in their territories”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this light, I am puzzled by the insistence of those who 
continue to recommend that we institute an export ban. It comes 
from people who apparently share our desire to protect Canada's 
water resources; however, it is clear their approach would make 
our water more vulnerable to trade challenge, not less, and make 
it harder to protect, not easier.

dimension, has possible constitutional limitations, and may be 
vulnerable to trade challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An export ban would focus on water once it has become a good and 
therefore subject to international trade agreements, and would 
likely be contrary to Canada's international trade obligations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are looking to all levels of the government to act. 
Bill C-15 will provide protection against the bulk removal of 
water from the Great Lakes and other boundary waters.  Joined 
with the efforts being made in other parts of the federal 
government's strategy, including the Canada-wide accord on water 
and the Canada-U.S. reference to the International Joint 
Commission, it will provide the best protection possible for 
Canada's freshwater resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the best way to protect Canada's freshwater.  It brings

Speaker, I take this opportunity to thank you for giving me a lot 
of advice when I came into the House as a rookie.  You pointed 
out a lot of things to me, and I highly appreciated your help.  I 
learned a lot from you.  I guess when I do come back I will have 
graduated from being a rookie to second term MP.  I take this 
opportunity to wish you all the best in your future endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today on behalf of the constituents of Calgary East to 
speak to Bill C-15, an act to amend the 80 year old International 
Boundary Waters Treaty Act.  I will begin by explaining why we 
are compelled to debate this issue.  Water is an issue that 
touches the lives of all Canadians.  It is part of Canadian 
heritage.  Canadians are very concerned at the thought of losing 
control of the country's freshwater resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a legitimate concern.  Canada will face an increasing 
demand for this precious resource in the new millennium.  I 
remind members and all Canadians of the failure of the Liberal 
government to protect Canada's freshwater resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also deserve to be informed of the past mistakes made 
by the government on this issue.  The export of water was never 
supposed to be an issue in Canada.  Various federal politicians 
in the early 1990s claimed that Canada had a right to manage its 
own water and that water would never be challenged under any 
international agreement.  Unfortunately this is not the case. The 
water issue is back on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 28, 1993, a few days before the election, the member for 
Winnipeg South Centre, who happens to be the minister who 
introduced Bill C-15, expressed his concerns about NAFTA and its 
implication for Canada's freshwater resource.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is on record as saying that NAFTA should be 
amended to prohibit bulk water exports.  Had Liberals kept their 
promise, Canadians would not have to worry about the issue of 
bulk water exports and we certainly would not be discussing this 
matter today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1993 Liberal red book said that NAFTA would be an 
opportunity to correct any flaws that existed with the free trade 
agreement with the U.S.A. and Mexico.  Liberals promised 
Canadians we would retain control of our water.  They promised to 
review the side agreements of NAFTA to ensure that they were in 
Canada's best interest.  Regardless of these promises, the 
government signed the NAFTA deal without a side agreement on 
water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Raw logs and unprocessed fish were exempted from NAFTA, but the 
best arrangement Canada could get on water was the following side 
deal signed by Canada, the U.S. and Mexico on December 2, 1993: 
“The NAFTA creates no rights to the natural water resources of 
any party of the agreement”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately this side deal is of little legal value.  Unless 
water in any form has entered into commerce and has become a good or 
product, it is not covered by the provisions of any trade 
agreement including NAFTA.  Nothing in NAFTA obliges any NAFTA 
party to either exploit its water for commercial use or begin to 
export water in any form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water in its natural state in lakes, reservoirs, water basins 
and the like is not a good or a product.  It therefore is not 
traded and never has been subject to the terms of any trade 
agreement.  The side agreement worked as long as Canada never 
allowed water to enter into commerce and become a good or a 
product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the exception of international boundary waters, the vast 
majority of water in its natural state is owned and managed by 
the provinces.  It is a provincial responsibility to manage the 
resources carefully, just as the provinces manage their forests 
and oil and gas.  If one province enters the business of 
tendering contracts to export bulk water, then according to 
chapter 11 of NAFTA it must treat Canadian, American and Mexican 
companies in a similar fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National treatment provisions give all corporations of our NAFTA 
partners the right to help themselves to our water the moment any 
Canadian company is given an export permit.  In fact, water would 
not be exempt from NAFTA once we started shipping water.  The 
government would be powerless to stop it.  If it did, the 
government would have to compensate for lost income under the 
investor state provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not have the foresight to think that some 
provinces may one day look into the possibility of licensing the 
export of water, but recent examples show us the opposite. 
First, the province of Newfoundland granted an export permit to 
McCurdy Enterprises Limited to export water from Gisborne Lake. 
Second, in Ontario the Nova Group received a licence to extract 
water from Lake Superior. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in British Columbia, the California company Sun Belt 
wanted to export water from B.C.  It is now demanding up to $10.5 
billion in damages from the federal and B.C. governments alleging 
that its rights under NAFTA have been violated.  Sun Belt is 
demanding restoration of the water export licence the B.C. 
government cancelled in 1991 and compensation for lost business 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the provinces eventually pulled out of these proposals, 
the agreements renewed fears about water export and the impact of 
our trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now look at the government's strategy that it believes 
will ensure Canada's control over its freshwater.  This 
government, having failed to protect Canadian sovereignty over 
water during NAFTA negotiations, is now proposing a backup 
solution.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals had six years to propose legislation since the 
ratification of the NAFTA but preferred to wait and be pushed to 
the wall before they reacted.  This does not surprise me, since 
Liberal strategy can be defined as a wait and see approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 proposes to prohibit bulk water removal from boundary 
waters between Canada and the U.S.A.  That covers only 15% of 
Canada's water resources.  The provinces manage the remaining 
85%.  The government's water strategy includes a Canada-wide 
accord to prohibit bulk water removal.  However, five provinces 
have refused to endorse the accord, leaving the country's water 
vulnerable to exportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal strategy was designed in the belief that all 
provinces would agree on a national ban.  It is quite obvious 
after the two day debate in Kananaskis in late November 1999 that 
the government has failed to achieve this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 legislates authority to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs to impose a prohibition on the removal of boundary waters 
out of the natural water basin.  It provides clear sanctions and 
penalties for violations.  This means a licence will be required 
from the Minister of Foreign Affairs for any activity that would 
have the effect of altering the natural level or flow of water on 
the U.S. side of the border.  Clearly another level of 
bureaucracy will be added.  The government has shown in the past 
that it is exceptionally good at adding levels of bureaucracy 
when it is not needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere in the bill is the word export used.  The government 
feels, and with good reason, the term will imply that water is a 
commercial good.  What the absence of the word export really 
means is that water was part of the negotiations during the NAFTA 
talks.  That is one thing the government should admit.  The fact 
that the government is taking the route to ban bulk water export 
shows how little faith it has in the December 1993 side deal it 
signed after promising Canadians it would protect our sovereignty 
over water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands now we can say yes or no, but we have lost the 
right to say yes to Canadians only.  Perhaps the government 
thinks the bill will somehow magically remove Canada from our 
international agreements on water.  Unfortunately the bill is far 
from closing the door on the water export issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several Liberal MPs, including the member for Davenport, have 
stated in the House that the proposed accord will lead to a 
patchwork of provincial initiatives making Canada vulnerable to 
trade challenges.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems quite clear that a meaningful protection of our water 
resources requires the federal government to face the reality of 
international trade agreements. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean the member thinks NAFTA should be renegotiated to 
exclude water?  The former foreign affairs minister thought that 
way when he was in the opposition.  I quote the member for 
Winnipeg South Centre: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be making a direct proposal to the United States 
administration that in looking at the new environmental accords 
as part of NAFTA we include the exclusion of water as part 
of that accord. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had the power to implement in government what he had said in 
opposition.  Why did he refuse to do so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The core issue up for debate today is the protection of our 
sovereignty and rights over water.  Bill C-15 does not resolve 
that issue.  The failure of the government to protect our 
resources leaves the impression that the government is using the 
issue of water export as a political tool, one that should give 
it enormous leverage as a future trade cash cow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should be done? 
In 1993 while the government was busy signing away our 
sovereignty over water, the Canadian Alliance made a specific 
statement on the protection of our fresh water.  The Canadian 
Alliance stated that exclusive and unrestricted control of water 
in all its forms should be maintained by and for Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada possesses about 9% of the world's renewable water 
resources and 20% of the world's total freshwater resources. 
This includes water captured in glaciers and in the polar ice 
caps. Protection of our sovereignty over this valuable resource 
is critical to Canadians and to our national identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes that Canadians should retain 
control over our water resources and supports exempting water 
from our international agreements, including NAFTA.  An outright 
ban on water export would run contrary to our NAFTA commitment 
because water was not exempt from that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A side agreement would have to be negotiated that would exempt 
water from NAFTA before a ban on water exports could even be 
considered.  Until an exemption is achieved, we encourage the 
provinces to place a moratorium on commercial water licensing so 
that water in bulk form never becomes a good governed by NAFTA 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once an exemption from NAFTA is in place, the decision to export 
water in bulk should rest with the provinces that own the 
resource.  Natural resources fall under provincial jurisdiction 
and international trade is under federal jurisdiction.  As a 
result of this constitutional division of powers, any water 
export scheme can only succeed with the support and co-operation 
of both levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of exempting water from NAFTA, the Canadian 
Alliance will support the proposed bill as it represents the only 
viable approach that the federal government can take and the only 
constitutionally valid NAFTA compatible ban on bulk water export. 
However, I would like to see the government propose real answers 
to this issue and show some leadership in exempting water from 
our trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been preferable to exempt water from NAFTA but 
failing that, Bill C-15 will have to do as second best.  The 
Canadian Alliance is not asking the government to back out of 
NAFTA as has been proposed by my colleague from the NDP, but we 
wish the government had kept its promise for a side agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is likely to become one of the hottest commodities in the 
21st century.  Because the government did a poor job of managing 
this resource, we will have to pay the price one day.  Canadians 
should realize that we are no longer sovereign over our water. 
Neither will our future generations be if something is not done 
to change this reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 or not, the bottom line is that Canada's water 
resources are vulnerable to export.  While I am a strong 
supporter of free trade, I believe it should not come at the 
expense of our sovereignty over water.  Decisions about bulk 
water export should rest in the hands of Canadians only, not with 
Americans, NAFTA or WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one day Canada will decide to export water if it is 
proven environmentally sound.  If that ever happens, and I 
strongly stress if, the tap should belong to Canadians only.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first of all I would like to extend my thanks to my colleagues in

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 9, 1999 I was the mover of an NDP supply day motion 
which called for a national ban on the bulk export of water from 
Canada.  At that time that motion received the unanimous support 
of the House.  It is in that context I would like to speak to 
Bill C-15 today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 is not, as the Liberals are trying to suggest, a 
national ban on bulk water exports.  It is not a piece of 
legislation one would have expected if they were actually trying 
to live up not just to their promises, but to the commitment they 
made to parliament that day when they supported the NDP motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill which aims to prohibit bulk water removals from 
boundary water basins only.  This is a retreat from banning bulk 
water exports and this retreat is clearly, although the 
government will not say so, because of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement.  The very language of removal tells the story. 
The Liberals refuse to use the word export because if they talked 
about water exports as opposed to water removal, then they would 
have a test case with respect to NAFTA because NAFTA deals with 
exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals were as confident as they say they are that 
water is exempt in NAFTA, then why would they be afraid to use 
the language of exports?  They themselves say they want to deal 
with the water question in the context of an environmental issue 
because otherwise, if they dealt with it in any other context, if 
they dealt with it as an export, this would, and I will use the 
government's language here, trigger its international trade 
obligations. International trade obligations is code for NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the Liberals are unwilling to admit that NAFTA 
is as inadequate as it truly is when it comes to water.  If the 
Liberals did admit that, they would have to explain to Canadians 
why they are not actively seeking to either get out of that 
agreement or to change it, if in fact it leaves our ability to 
determine whether or not we want to export water completely 
subordinate to the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is doubtful that even Bill C-15 is NAFTA proof. International 
trade tribunals have been more than willing to overturn 
environmental laws as disguised trade barriers. We have 
seen that happen.  This is what has happened before to some of 
Canada's key fisheries conservation measures. The bill is 
therefore vulnerable to trade challenges even if the government 
claims it is taking an environmental rather than a trade 
approach.  What is really being protected here is not so much our 
water but a certain part of the government's anatomy when it 
comes to its position on NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even on the more modest goal of prohibiting bulk water removals, 
Bill C-15 fails. It does not really ban bulk water removals or 
exports from watersheds, it only says it cannot be done without 
a licence.  Bill C-15 is actually more of a licensing scheme for 
bulk water removal than a prohibition and it applies only to 
waters covered by the International Joint Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill allows for huge exceptions to be provided for in the 
regulations.  The government says these regulations will not 
deviate much from current practice.  Indeed, but current practice 
allows for industrial withdrawals within a basin and many of 
these basins straddle the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power to give out licences for bulk water removal is given 
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, not to the Minister of the 
Environment.  Again we see that water is ultimately a matter of 
relationships, fundamentally between Canada and the United States. 
If we think that is not covered by NAFTA, we have another think 
coming.  The very fact that this power is given to the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs and not to the Minister of the Environment 
gives that away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when the activities of the Department of Foreign 
Affairs are being increasingly dominated by commercial concerns, 
one is not left feeling confident that environmental concerns 
will govern the licensing scheme.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately therefore, there is nothing really new in Bill C-15. 
It just formalizes in legislation what the International Boundary 
Waters Treaty already says and what the federal practice in these 
matters has been for more than 90 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the bill will die on the order paper means that 
yet another key part of the federal government's strategy on 
water is in tatters.  Not only do we now lack protection for our 
water, we do not even have a serious plan to get one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government devised a hasty three-pronged strategy the day 
after the NDP motion was passed in the House.  One of the prongs 
called for a national ban on bulk water exports.  That never 
happened. One prong dissolved when the federal government's 
proposed voluntary federal-provincial water accord collapsed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now another prong, Bill C-15, will dissolve when it dies on the 
order paper. Perhaps that is as it should be because this never 
was a response to the motion that was passed in the House on 
February 9, 1999.  This is a case of the Liberals continuing to 
deceive Canadians with respect to the reality of NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to wonder though, in all these years with respect to water 
and NAFTA, were the Liberals deceiving themselves or deceiving 
Canadians?  I think the cat is now out of the bag; they were 
deceiving Canadians and Bill C-15 is part of that deception.  It 
is another broken Liberal promise.  It is another example of 
federal inaction in terms of dealing with this issue.  I regret 
very much that we are on the eve of an election and we do not 
have a chance to pursue this matter further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had been serious about keeping some of its 
promises not just with respect to banning water exports, but also

continuing as president of the P.E.I. Junior Farmers Federation, 
and chartering NFU Local 102 in 1969, Mr. Laughlan fought 
strenuously for farm rights, rights based on sound principles. 
His dedication and activism grew and were fostered in others 
during his 21 years as district director of District 1 NFU.

the Prime Minister's last minute attempts to buy votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canadian Alliance called for tax cuts, the finance

tax break, the government said “We can't afford it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now on the eve of an election, the Liberals have taken their 
hands out of the taxpayers' pockets long enough to open the 
goodie bag. Do they really think Canadians will forget the 
deficit was eliminated through excessively high taxes? Do they 
really think Canadians will believe that the Liberals will 
actually deliver on any of these promises? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, it was the Liberals who promised to eliminate the 
GST.  It was the very same Liberals who promised open and

Parliament Hill of the Persons case and the Famous Five, the 
whole inspired by notions of equality and justice for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lessons globally and domestically are clear that women's 
rights must be a priority on our public agenda as a matter of 
principle and policy, that women's rights are human rights and 
that there are no rights if they do not include the rights of 
women.  As Nellie McClung and the Famous Five put it, “no nation 
can rise above its women. The degradation of any woman is a 
degradation of us all”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The struggle for human rights, for 
women's rights, for equality, is the struggle for ourselves. 
In what we say and, more importantly, in what we do in this case 
and the cause for equality in general and women's rights in 
particular, we will be making a statement about ourselves as a

about his mini-budget election platform.  As always, he is trying 
to be all things to all people.  However, for the seventh 
straight year he has knowingly discriminated against the people 
of Mackenzie, British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the northern residents' deduction was changed in 1993, the 
district of Mackenzie was unfairly excluded.  Mackenzie is a 
small, remote community more than 100 kilometres from a major 
urban centre.  Much larger communities in the region, such as the 
cities of Grande Prairie, Fort St. John and Dawson Creek, 
qualified for the deduction and deservedly so, but why the 
continued discrimination? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past seven years I have repeatedly asked the finance 
minister to correct this.  Each time he has studied the issue and 
then refused.  I guess if the Prime Minister's office believed 
the change would increase his election chances, then it would 
have been announced last week.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the RCMP continues investigations 
into government dealings in the Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the auditor general, with the most scathing report in a 
decade at least, being shut down by the Liberals from giving that 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the information commissioner saying that the government 
routinely appears to be threatening public servants, and the 
Prime Minister says “We will see you in court”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the former clerk of the privy council saying that 
there is a huge concentration of power in the Prime Minister's 
Office, away from cabinet and away from the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy itself is being threatened by all these moves.  I 
would like to hear from the Prime Minister.  Are all these 
responsible individuals wrong in what they are saying and if they 
are not wrong, will the Prime Minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Deputy Prime Minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when we get good advice, as we have from the auditor 
general or the information commissioner, we look at it seriously 
and we act on recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general made very clear that we are acting 
effectively to deal with the kinds of problems that we first 
uncovered and that he has confirmed.  We are taking these 
recommendations seriously.  We are acting in the best interest of 
Canadians and in due course I am sure Canadians will agree with 
us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question was not answered, but 
that is fairly characteristic.  I will pose it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These individuals are saying that democracy itself is being 
threatened.  The former clerk of the privy council is a very 
responsible individual.  The information commissioner is a very 
responsible individual.  They are alluding to the fact that 
democracy itself is being threatened by the Prime Minister and 
his office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would just like to know if these responsible public servants 
are wrong.  I am not talking about the auditor general right now. 
We will talk about him in a minute.  Are they wrong?  If they are 
not wrong, will the Prime Minister apologize for being a threat 
to democracy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, proof of the fact that we have a democracy is that 
people can express their opinions, which do not have to be shared 
by everyone in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not passing judgment on the opinions of the people he has 
quoted, but proof that democracy works in Canada is that we are 
here today in the House of Commons exchanging ideas, debating 
ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proof of the strength of our democracy will come before too long 
when Canadians will make their decision on who should govern the 
country.  That is democracy, not the empty words of the Leader of 
the Opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we cannot get an apology for those 
other officers.  How about for the auditor general? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday there was supposed to have been a report given, the 
most important one in a decade, by the auditor general.  We have 
just heard that there is some kind of respect for democracy here. 
Yet Liberal members did not go to that committee meeting so there 
was no quorum.  The committee had to shut down.  The auditor 
general could not give his report.  The Liberals said they could 
not find the room.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister sticking to the excuse that they could not 
find the room when all the opposition members could make it?  Or, 
is it that he just cannot find the time for democracy?  Is he 
sticking with— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Before the Deputy Prime Minister answers, 
the government is not responsible for the work of committees.  If 
the Deputy Prime Minister wishes to answer he may. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member forgets that we undertook and carried 
out the undertaking to make sure the House was sitting to receive 
the auditor general's report and to make it public.  We made sure 
the House continued sitting so that the Leader of the Opposition 
and the other opposition party leaders could question relevant 
ministers, starting with the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows our commitment to taking the auditor general's report 
seriously.  This shows our commitment to openness.  We are not 
trying to suppress any report.  The record shows that the Leader 
of the Opposition is totally wrong in making that allegation.  He 
should not refuse to put on the record that there will be a 
meeting of the public accounts committee to hear the auditor 
general. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a very important question and 
it was not answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members said they could not find the room.  That is the 
issue.  As with so much of what the Liberal government does, only 
in the face of public outrage did it inch toward doing something 
responsibly, only in the face of public outrage time after time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Liberal excuse standing?  They could not find the room. 
That is what we heard last night.  Yes or no.  Is that the excuse 
you are sticking with, or was there another reason for which you 
should apologize for disrespecting the auditor general? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would ask hon. members to direct their 
questions to the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if there is anyone who should 
apologize right now, it is the hon. member for making these 
allegations when he knows that the facts are otherwise, when he 
knows that his own deputy House leader was told by myself 
yesterday when his staff was phoned by myself to schedule a 
meeting today, which we have now done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An apology is in order and it is from the feeble attempt of the 
Leader of the Opposition to try to make Canadians believe 
something which he knows is incorrect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe Liberal members should have 
showed up yesterday instead of calling for another meeting today. 
The 1993 Liberal red book of promises said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If government is to play a positive role in society, as it must, 
honesty and integrity in our political institutions must be 
restored. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this week, seven years later, the auditor general said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our audit examined four of the grant and contribution programs by 
HRDC. We found breaches of authority, payments made improperly, 
very limited monitoring of finances and activities, and approvals 
not based on established processes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the government's dismal failure to restore public 
confidence, why should Canadians trust it with their votes? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member should be, shall I say, complete in his 
language, because the auditor general said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC has initiated quite extraordinary corrective action to 
address these serious problems.  We concluded that the department 
is on the right track. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the hon. member not put that in his question and give 
us credit in the same way that the auditor general has done?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Neigette-et-la-Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this week was the darkest and most shameful one for 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government demonstrated its arrogance and its contempt. Not 
only did it muzzle the information commissioner, it also tried 
the same trick on the auditor general by not showing up at the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was so arrogant as to present a virtual 
mini-budget, with many measures that will not be implemented 
because of the dissolution of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government really believe that all its schemes will 
allow it to escape the true judgment of voters? 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

the facts are different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the measures included in the budget, yesterday we 
adopted a ways and means motion with the support of two parties 
in this House. The hon. member is well aware of that. In fact, 
yesterday, all the parties except hers understood what this ways 
and means motion meant. All the other members of parliament 
understood that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the auditor general's report, there will be a televised 
meeting today, at 12.30 p.m., to show that the government acted 
in good faith and was accountable in this issue.

Speaker, the actions taken this week by the government have 
nothing to do with the values that it claims to be upholding, 
but they have everything to do with the political agenda of the 
Prime Minister, who did not hesitate to use the House to launch 
his election platform and who, according to TVA, even paid 
$2 million to cancel the rooms reserved for the trip to China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government realize that by giving priority to its own 
agenda, it is showing its contempt for public institutions, 
which must first serve the public, not a political party? 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is rather strange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On opposition days, the hon. member opposite promotes the ideas 
of her party. When the government presents its agenda, it 
obviously promotes its ideas, as it did in the excellent 
economic statement presented by my colleague a few days ago and 
adopted in this House yesterday, which has been very well 
received by the overwhelming majority of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
no one is going to be taken in, neither the general public nor 
the members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the second time, on the eve of a general election, that 
the Liberal government is trying to muzzle the auditor general. 
The government has gone so far as to dare to try to convince us 
that its MPs could not find the meeting room.  This just shows 
the arrogance and disdain of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister think that his attempts to muzzle the 
auditor general are really going to prevent the truth about the 
Liberal government's administrative scandals from breaking out 
into the light of day? 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no muzzling going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, this government is the one that made the change to 
having the auditor general report to this House, not once a year 
as in the past, but four times a year.  That was an initiative 
of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the committee in question is meeting today.  This is its 
second meeting this week to discuss the auditor general's 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is totally transparent, totally accountable to 
the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are glad the committee is meeting today, but it took the 
intervention of the Bloc Quebecois and all the opposition 
parties to get the government to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister seriously believe that his crisis 
management techniques, which are nothing more than damage 
control, will prevent him from having to answer for all the 
scandals and criminal investigations he has hanging over him? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the matter of the auditor 
general's report is being discussed in a committee room a little 
later today, the hon. member knows very well that this is not 
because of intervention by the Bloc Quebecois.  I myself 
proposed this initiative— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
government was elected because it promised to get tough on 
pollution.  It promised to clean up our environment.  It did not 
promise to sit on the sidelines while 20 million tonnes of 
Toronto garbage pollute the water in Ontario and Quebec, 
threaten the water that first nations and a great many other 
communities depend upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government so stubbornly and persistently refusing to 
launch a full federal environmental assessment into the Adams 
mine madness? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the situation with respect to the Adams mine is 
this.  The province of Ontario has carried out an assessment. It 
has come to a certain conclusion, which is that it is 
environmentally safe to carry out the use of the mine site for 
Toronto garbage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand there are two aspects of federal jurisdiction. 
One is the transboundary aspect with Quebec, between Ontario and 
Quebec.  The other is the transboundary aspect between the 
Ontario jurisdiction and the federal Indian reserve in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said in the House time after time, and the hon. member 
knows it, that question has been put to the environmental 
assessment authority.  When it comes up with scientific 
conclusions I will make a decision on whether to proceed with a 
fully inquiry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 80 
billion litres of water are at stake.  The health of people in 
thousands of communities is at stake. 
The government did not campaign on dumping 20 million tonnes of 
Toronto garbage into a lake and it did not campaign to let Mike 
Harris do whatever he darned well pleases with our environment.

refusing to put an end to the Adams mine mess? 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in the tirade of the hon. leader of the New 
Democratic Party there is one element that is totally absent, and 
that is the fact of the Canadian constitution.  The federal 
government does not have the power to walk into every problem in 
the country simply because the problem exists, whether it is at 
the municipal level or the provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that she thinks that simply because there is a problem 
the federal government should take over?  There is a problem with 
illiteracy.  That does not mean that this government should set 
up educational programs for every child in the country.

question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Toronto airport authority was granted a $185 million rent 
reduction just after it signed its lease agreement.  The auditor 
general said “The department could not provide us with the 
rationale”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for the Deputy Prime Minister.  First, why 
was the rent reduced by a whopping $185 million?  Second, was any 
minister directly or indirectly advised of or involved in 
discussions that led to that decision? 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of Transport, I am obviously 
not in a position to express personal knowledge of the subject 
matter.  However, because of the interest of the leader of the 
Conservative Party, I will undertake to find a detailed response 
for him and provide that to him, if possible, later this day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that raises a very interesting issue about how this parliament is 
able to function and get at facts that need to be known and 
conduct public business that needs to be carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was obviously a range of questions raised by the auditor 
general.  The government has agreed to a special meeting at 12.30 
p.m. today.  That obviously will not allow the House to pursue 
the questions that arise from the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the Deputy Prime Minister, will the government agree

hon. member in answering the question about the Toronto airport 
authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The airport was treated in a comparable manner to other 
airports.  However, in the case of Pearson airport, the financial 
projections could not be updated immediately prior to the 
transfer because of ongoing legal actions involving terminal 2, 
and three major projects had to be completed by Transport Canada 
prior to the transfer.  That required a one time financial 
adjustment to the lease to take into account the three unfinished 
projects to which I have just referred.

are asked to make their judgment at the ballot box they will 
agree that this government has earned the trust of Canadians, not 
only on its good record but its forward looking plan to bring 
Canadians successfully into the 21st century and not move them 
backward in a mean-spirited way as the Alliance would do in the 
unlikely event it was given the chance.

stonewalling investigators from the Office of the Information

firearm registry project finance files there were no financial 
spreadsheets or budget projections for this fiscal year. This is 
highly unusual, if not illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister really want parliament and the voters to 
believe they are running a $300 million program without any

<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what we know on behalf of the Minister of Justice about 
the point of view of members of that party is not that they are

registration scheme: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police and politicians knew Bill C-68 was just a ploy to strip 
guns from law-abiding citizens with a grossly overbudgeted 
financial sinkhole of a bureaucracy...This is why the law was

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the justice minister wasted more than half a billion 
dollars on her useless gun registry, instead of helping the

the right thing and repeal Bill C-68?

attempt to recognize cruelty to animals as a form of violence and 
to encourage the justice system to treat it seriously.

can the Deputy Prime Minister tell the House what kind of signal 
the Prime Minister is sending to Canadian businesses and workers

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I have been looking into this further.  It is my 
understanding that more than 70% of the cases which involve 
churches involve them because the claimants, former students in 
residential schools, sued not only the federal government but 
also the church organizations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-15, an 
act to amend the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act, be 
read a second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise today to speak on Bill C-15, an act to amend the 
International Boundary Waters Treaty Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is a most precious resource for humankind. It has become a 
cliché to say that. Water is the very basis of life on earth. 
However, despite what we have believed for a long time, we could 
run out of water as a resource. Recent studies show that in some 
areas water is practically non-renewable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the report of the International Joint Commission, 
released last August, says that precipitation and underground 
water barely contribute 1% to Great Lakes water renewal every 
year.  This is cause for concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances, we must recognize that even if the 
Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River account for one fifth of 
all freshwater reserves on the surface of the planet, it is not 
a limitless resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in recent years discoveries and research on greenhouse 
gases and the potential risks of rising temperatures have shown 
the acute fragility of resources and the threats facing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The membership and duties of this commission are defined further 
on. Because of climatic risks, desertification on a planetary 
scale, limited resources of freshwater throughout the world and 
energy development on the basis of that resource, the idea of 
exporting large quantities of water by tanker or of diverting 
rivers has been seriously considered in the last decade in 
Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, a serious threat has now been added to the 
environmental threats already facing our water resources, and 
that is the bulk export of water and diverting lakes and rivers 
on a large scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the bulk export of water opens up tremendous economic 
opportunities. Acknowledging that fact, some provinces examined 
the feasibility of issuing licences allowing companies to study 
bulk water export projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following a drought in California at the beginning of the 1980s, 
British Columbia issued export licences to five Canadian 
companies and one American company. Over time, the province 
became concerned about the possible impact of such exports on 
its natural resources and passed legislation to forbid the bulk 
export of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that other provinces have considered issuing export 
licences. We recently saw some headlines about Newfoundland in 
this regard. 
The province quickly changed its mind but the possibility of 
issuing licences still exists. This, coupled with recent legal 
action by Sun Belt Water Inc., a California company, against the 
Government of British Columbia creates fears and raises once 
again the issue of commercial risks associated with the export 
of that resource. 
This is the context in which the federal government has been 
promising to legislate for a year now.  This is the background.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I want to talk about the federal government strategy to 
date.  Early this year, the federal government announced that it 
intended to take more direct action with respect to water 
exports, and to present a three-point strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strategy is a follow-up to a motion passed in the House of 
Commons on February 2, 1999, with respect to the protection of 
water.  It was a New Democratic Party motion, which received the 
support of the House, and read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in 
co-operation with the provinces, place an immediate moratorium on 
the export of bulk freshwater shipments and inter-basin transfers 
and should introduce legislation to prohibit bulk freshwater 
exports and inter-basin transfers and should not be a party to 
any international agreement that compels us to export freshwater 
against our will in order to assert Canada's sovereign right to 
protect, preserve and conserve our freshwater resources for 
future generations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the New Democratic Party motion introduced in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal strategy consists of three elements. 
The first is an amendment to the International Boundary Waters 
Treaty, which would give the federal government authority to 
regulate bulk water removal from boundary waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is a reference with the United States to the 
International Joint Commission to investigate the effects of 
consumption, diversions and removals, including those for export 
purposes, in boundary waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is a proposal to develop, in co-operation with the 
provinces and territories, a Canada-wide accord on bulk water 
removal so as to protect Canadian water basins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 10, 1995, Canada and the United States created the 
International Joint Commission, following implementation of the 
1909 boundary waters treaty. 
Its primary mandate is to ensure co-operation between the United 
States and Canada in the management of storm drainage systems 
along the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six commissioners sit on the commission, three from Canada and 
three from the U.S.  It is their responsibility to study the 
various problems arising in the management of basins.  The 
shores of Great Lakes and St. Lawrence system are borders to 
eight states—Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, 
Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York—and two provinces—Ontario and 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After noting a growing number of proposals to export water from 
the Great Lakes and other areas of the U.S. and Canada, the two 
countries agreed to ask the commission to study the question and 
make recommendations within the next year.  The final report is 
expected in February 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 18, the International Joint Commission submitted a 
preliminary report.  Briefly, it recommended that, during the 
next six months it will need to complete its report, the federal 
and provincial governments and the American states not authorize 
any removal or large scale sale of water.  It pointed out a 
number of things that warrant mentioning. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It indicated that there was no surplus in the Great Lakes 
system, that large scale removal of water could limit the 
resilience of the system and that information on the removal of 
underground water is inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This point causes problems, because underground waters can have 
a considerable effect on the integrity and quality of 
ecosystems.  The report pointed out as well that we do not 
know—and this is a very important point—what the demand will be 
for water in the future.  We must never forget that other 
generations will follow us and we have the job of ensuring these 
future generations are not penalized by our decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, because of the possible climate change and other natural 
considerations, it is impossible to assess with any degree of 
certainty what the level and the flow of the Great Lakes will be 
in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, the federal environment minister submitted to his 
provincial counterparts a Canada-wide agreement banning bulk 
water removal from watersheds. The response was rather timid, 
since Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan 
indicated that they would make their position known at a later 
date. Quebec withdrew from the discussion, stating that it found 
that the agreement was premature and that its Bill 73, the Water 
Resources Preservation Act, provided temporary measures 
prohibiting the transfer outside Quebec of surface water or 
groundwater taken in Quebec until December 31, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, however, kept the right to divert large quantities of 
water to produce electric power, keeping in mind the Churchill 
Falls project where it is looking at diverting the river to be 
able to produce electric power in the Labrador region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government considers that its legislation is 
adequate. It also stated that it will wait for the results of 
the public hearings of the BAPE and of the Quebec environmental 
assessment panel, before developing a comprehensive water 
strategy. New Brunswick, Newfoundland, the Northwest Territories, 
Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, Ontario and the 
Yukon have all endorsed the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only missing element of the three-pronged process is the 
changes to federal boundary waters legislation. Bill C-15 
completes the federal strategy announced last February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a brief summary of Bill C-15. Bill C-15 derives 
directly from the federal government strategy announced in 
February 1999 and it fulfils its desire to regulate the removal 
of water from transboundary waters. According to the federal 
government, the purpose of this bill is to pave the way for the 
implementation of the treaty relating to boundary waters and 
questions arising along the boundary between Canada and the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, the proposed amendments prohibit bulk water removal 
from boundary waters out of their natural water basin. The 
proposed amendments will also require persons to obtain licences 
from the Minister of Foreign Affairs for water related projects 
in boundary or transboundary waters that would affect the 
natural level or flow of water on the United States side of the 
border.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the federal government wishes to add clauses 10 to 26 to 
the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act. Clauses 11 and 12 
deal with the licences that have to be obtained for any project 
which uses, obstructs or diverts boundary waters in a manner 
that affects the natural level or flow of the water. Both 
clauses indicate that the licences do not apply in respect of 
the ordinary use of water for domestic or sanitary purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 13 of Bill C-15 seeks to prevent the removal of water from 
the boundary waters to take it outside the water basin, 
notwithstanding clause 11. 
General clauses 14 and 15 of the bill provide that sections 11 
to 13 do not apply in respect of projects in existence 
immediately before the respective coming into force of those 
sections, unless their impact lasts after their coming into 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 16 to 20 list the powers of the minister and summarize 
his capacity to issue and revoke licences and to impose 
penalties. Clause 21 deals with the regulations that can be made 
under the legislation and that will be a guide for ministerial 
decision making. The bill indicates, for example, that the governor 
in council, on a recommendation by the minister, will be able to 
define the concept of water basin, under paragraph (<I>b</I>) and 
identify exemptions to sections 11 and 12 under paragraph (<I>c</I>). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this paragraph, the department has already raised possible 
exemptions like humanitarian uses over a short period of time or 
the use of water to produce food and drink. An example that 
comes to mind is bottled water. Paragraph (<I>d</I>) deals with the 
prescription of classes of licences and paragraph (<I>j</I>) with the 
prescription of cases where no licence can be issued, and so on 
and so forth. Clauses 22 to 25 determine the punishment for 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general public recognizes that our water resources should be 
protected, but it is far from obvious that Bill C-15 will result 
in better protection. In fact, a legitimate question concerning 
Bill C-15 is whether the Liberal government is taking advantage 
of the panic over water resources created by events in Ontario 
to grab powers outside its jurisdiction. 
Again this government is showing that it wants to interfere in 
areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am forced to say today that the government never changed its 
tune during the three and a half years of this mandate, which 
will soon come to an end. It always declared that it respected 
provincial jurisdiction. But when the time came to put those 
words into action in the bills it introduced, we saw the true 
nature of this Liberal government. Liberal values were not 
reflected in the bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals said that they respected 
Canadians from all provinces, from Ontario, from Manitoba, from 
Saskatchewan, from British Columbia and from the maritimes. 
But that kind of language can be very deceiving because, when 
they introduced bills, we saw the opposite. They are two-faced: 
they say one thing, but their actions day in and day out go 
against the interests of the people and the provinces. They 
should provide services to allow individuals to have real 
courses of action and they should give some money back to the 
provinces for the environment, because it is a very important 
issue.

<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, during 
the hiatus, the people watching our debate may have forgotten 
what I was saying about Bill C-15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to recap and remind the House what the purpose 
of this bill is. I also want to describe the government strategy 
I was referring to when we had to leave for the other House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take this opportunity to thank the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois for appointing me critic for the environment. I think 
that we held some very important debates during the last three 
years and a half and that we considered some major issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One need only look at the legislation on the environment and on 
endangered species. The government wants to pass a bill to 
protect endangered species, but apart from the environment 
minister's fine words, what is it doing? I do not disagree with 
the minister's words, but we are still waiting for him to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad, because I reached out to him on a number of 
occasions, including the endangered species bill, the 
Environmental Protection Act, and even the debates on 
pesticides. There was no unanimous report, since Reform 
dissented because they are pro-business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, there are two different visions in this parliament: 
the ordinary people's vision, represented by the Bloc Quebecois, 
and the vision of the Liberal Party and Reform. I still call 
them Reform because they have not changed; it is still the same 
old Reform Party. They have not changed a whit. Their vision is 
still short-sighted. According to their vision, big business is 
to be in charge of everything that has to do with the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have denounced with all my strength this vision of the 
Alliance and the Liberal Party, which is to highjack provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we caught them red-handed, this time with Bill C-15. 
This government cannot help trying to control everything, be in 
charge, be the king of the castle, as it were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to report that, today in Jonquière, a minister of 
this government, accompanied by the member from Chicoutimi who 
crossed the floor—we call them turncoats—was to announce an 
investment. Earlier the government House leader talked about 
Bill C-44, an act to improve the Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twice in two weeks, workers in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean told the 
revenue minister, the minister who represents our area, that we 
were quite capable of looking after our own administration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members do not represent their constituents properly. 
It is going to blow up in their face, as we say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the revenue minister was unable to give his press 
conference. He was told by people in our area to go back where 
he came from, through the Parc des Laurentides. We have been 
having quite a debate in our area. We would like to invest in 
the infrastructure, but the federal government has made cuts in 
road upgrading programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken part in every debate, saying that 26% of the money 
they hold is Quebec's. A substantial portion of this money 
should go to my area. 
The minister was told to go back where he came from, because the 
kind of change he made to the employment insurance program is 
not worth the paper it is written on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud those people.  They have shown all of Quebec and all 
of Canada that they were capable of standing up for themselves, 
of stating that the fund is theirs.  The government has no 
business using it as it pleases; it is for us to administer, 
with the workers and the employers.  We are the ones to have the 
say, as the gap keeps widening for seasonal workers thanks to 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government makes the directives, but makes no financial 
contribution.  It has been raiding the fund.  Bravo to the 
people of the Saguenay and Lac Saint-Jean.  I hope that all 
Canadians will stand up for themselves like the people in my 
area did this morning, and will continue to do so throughout 
this election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my speech by saying that, although the Bloc 
Quebecois is well aware of how vitally important it is to 
protect our water resources, the bill as it stands strikes us as 
useless and is not in keeping with the division of 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has a huge potential for encroachment onto provincial 
jurisdictions, without providing any additional protection 
against massive water exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought therefore to be opposed to the principle of the bill. 
I wish the Minister of the Environment, and whoever his 
successor is after the election, to know that we, the 
representatives of the Bloc Quebecois, will never accept 
interference in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to salute 
you and to thank you for all your well-chosen words and for the 
professionalism you have brought to the House as deputy speaker. 
I will always have very pleasant memories of you.  I wish you 
the best of luck in the future.

her kindness.

<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to discuss Bill C-15 with reference to 
one of Canada's most precious natural resources, water.  Canada 
owns most of the freshwater resources in the world.  Almost 9% of 
the world's soft water is on Canadian territory and 60% of 
Canadian water flows into the Arctic Ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exportation of bulk water is not a new issue.  It is 
actually a major issue that the Conservative government in 1984 
was very much concerned with.  We believe it is imperative to 
protect the interests of Canadians with reference to the export 
of bulk water.  It is why we made sure that water was protected 
under NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 introduces amendments to the International Boundary 
Waters Treaty Act in order to prohibit bulk removal of water from 
Canadian boundary waters, including the Great Lakes.  The 
prohibition on removals will apply principally to the Great Lakes 
and other boundary waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from prohibition, the amendments will also set in place a 
licensing regime for boundary waters projects such as dams, 
obstructions or other works that can affect water levels and 
flows.  The International Boundary Waters Treaty Act was passed 
in 1911, implementing the Canada-U.S. Boundary Waters Treaty of 
1909.  Its main objective was to establish the International 
Joint Commission, a binational organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's border is the longest in the world, with over 300 lakes 
or rivers that either form, cross or straddle it. 
It is the Canadian government's responsibility and duty to 
protect that border.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFTA and the WTO generally prohibit restrictions on the 
exportation of goods subject to certain exceptions, none of which 
are likely to be applicable to the present purpose.  The 
difficulty lies with the absence of a legal definition of goods. 
Obviously water in its natural state is not considered a good. 
Subject to trade agreements, bottled water is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-15 is to protect water which in its 
natural state would not then be subject to international 
obligations concerning trade in goods.  From this perspective any 
possible precedent from a water export project would be limited 
to the province involved and would arise from the particular 
legislation that permitted removal for export and not from trade 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one province's legislation permitted removal of water and a 
project were to be approved, other provinces could still have 
legislation that prohibited removal of water.  The point is to 
illustrate that water, in its natural state, is not a good and 
therefore not subject to international trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is an integral part of Canada's boundaries.  This most 
precious resource has to be protected and managed in the best 
interest of Canadians.  I can assure the House that the bill will 
be supported by us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak about the importance of communities having good, 
safe drinking water.  That is why I asked the minister today 
about the safety of water and talked about the federal 
government's role of ensuring that in this great country, where 
we have so much water, we are doing everything to make sure 
Canadians in all parts of the country can drink water safely.  We 
do not want another Walkerton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in my riding every month or two a small community has a 
boiling order.  Do we have an infrastructure problem?  Is enough 
money going to the communities and municipalities to make sure we 
have the facilities so that our children, seniors and all of us 
do not get sick from drinking water? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot take it for granted any more.  We did that in 
Sainte-Marie-de-Kent before getting that pig factory installed. 
We asked for an environmental impact assessment.  The federal 
government had both the responsibility and the obligation to do 
an environmental impact assessment.  It had the obligation.  The 
Liberals lured Metz Farms to Sainte-Marie-de-Kent.  It is clear 
the Liberals in Ottawa were told an environmental impact 
assessment was not wanted, and that is what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening today?  We have communities and families not 
speaking with each other.  On top of that we have a federal 
government that has realized that maybe we have water problems. 
Maybe we have communities with health risks.  Maybe the drinking 
water is not safe any more and tests should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 30,000 pigs being processed over there.  That could have 
been prevented.  Metz Farms invested a lot of money to install 
this.  It was told it could.  The federal government said it did 
not need to do an assessment, that Metz could go ahead and set up.  It would 
not intervene.  It would not use what was available to make sure 
the people of Sainte-Marie would not be at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Definitely the department is on autopilot.  It is not even in 
neutral but going in reverse.  We did not have the technology in 
the past to identify why there were contaminations.  We have it 
now, but we have a federal government that continues to close its 
eyes to it.  This is not acceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government said last week it would do some water 
testing in Sainte-Marie.  The government is now recognizing that 
it should have done an environmental impact assessment.  I say 
the government should do what the manager of Metz Farms said to 
do:  buy it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem here.  Communities are not happy with this. 
We have our farms.  Nobody is against farms.  Our leader spoke on 
farms this week.  Our critic spoke on farms and on how the 
federal government is abandoning our farmers.  We do not mind 
farms, be it cow, pig or sheep.  We are not talking about farms 
here; we are talking about factories.  There is a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference is that before we had Metz Farms in 
Sainte-Marie-de-Kent both the farmers and the non-farmers would 
actually eat together in the morning.  They would have coffee 
together.  They liked each other.  They would help each other. 
What do we have because of this factory?  We now have family 
divisions.  There is no more harmony.  That is what 
bothers me. No one is against farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was agriculture in the mini-budget to make sure our 
farmers would survive?  They do not survive.  They are eaten up 
by the big factories.  That is what the Liberal government is 
pushing for now, the megafactories.  They did it with fishing as 
well.  We have to protect our farmers.  We have to help our 
farmers.  Our farmers are saying they need what Metz is giving 
them because that way they get free fertilizer for their lands. 
That means our farmers are in difficulty.  They might need 
financial help.  What does the government do for our farms be 
they small, medium or big but still not factories? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A farm is not 30,000 pigs.  I lived next to a farm that had pigs 
and one that had a milk dairy.  They were great people.  It was 
nice to hear the cowbells in the morning.  My fence was electric, 
so I had no problem buying a home among farms.  I like farms.  A 
factory, it has been proven, is an environmental disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can hon. members imagine that we have actually put a pig factory 
in the middle of a region where we have invested millions and 
millions in tourism, aquaculture and fisheries?  Let us try to 
mix the two together.  There was a smell over the summer from the 
piggery.  It was not supposed to smell during tourist season, but 
the pigs could not figure out how to hold it back during the 
summer months.  What happened?  We had a bad smell during tourist 
season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the health risks?  Today I was on a call-in show. 
There were calls from Carmelle, Maria, Lisa, Rhéal, Richard, 
Raymond, Edmond and more.  They called because they were very 
concerned, and with good reason:  they were not consulted. Nobody 
knew about it.  It was a secret deal.  Nobody knew this factory 
would be set up.  That is not right.  Let us allow communities to 
talk to about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is legislation in place.  I know farmers are worried that 
if we put forth too much legislation it would hurt the farmers. I 
believe we have the legislation in place now.  We had a minister 
of DFO who could have requested an environmental impact 
assessment to make sure that what we are seeing now would not 
have happened.  The mechanism is in place.  We do not have to add 
any extra burden to our regular farmers.  This is not what we are 
talking about.  We are talking about a pig megafactory that has 
tremendous potential impact in terms of health, economics and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even this week the Liberal government announced $19.5 million in 
tourism for Atlantic Canada.  That is nice, and we will take it, 
but how do we balance it off with developments like the pig 
factory?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could have been put somewhere else.  It was a terrible 
location.  There are other areas.  The two just cannot be mixed 
together.  At some point there will have to be a decision made on 
whether the government will keep investing millions in tourism 
and aquaculture or keep investing in pig factories.  I do not 
think they blend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now people are saying we cannot risk thousands of jobs in 
the fishing and tourism industries for a few jobs in 
Sainte-Marie-de-Kent.  We cannot gamble that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we needed both an environmental impact assessment and 
a socioeconomic assessment.  We needed to have this studied 
before it happened, but no, it looked as though it just went 
through.  All of us in government have to sit together right now 
and fix this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Sainte-Marie-de-Kent, Saint-Paul, Saint-Lazare, 
Sainte-Anne, Fond-de-la-Baie, Bouctouche, Saint-Antoine and 
Saint-Joseph deserve better.  All levels of government need to 
sit down and look at the situation.  People deserve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the solution is to compensate Metz.  Metz has told me 
that if it gets the money it will close its doors.  Let us 
compensate.  For the few millions it will cost to close Metz we 
will save millions in the fishing and tourism industries.  That 
is not counting the health bill.  The health of the people of 
that region is at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to look at that option.  People from the 
communities are telling me they want it closed.  People working 
in Metz are telling me as an MP to find the money and it will 
close its doors.  At the end of the day that will be the only 
option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was wrong from day one.  The government does not know where 
it started or when it started.  We know all of this started 
several years back.  As was said on the radio talk show today, it 
really does not matter who brought it.  We are stuck with the 
problem.  We are stuck with a health problem, an environmental 
problem and an economic problem.  This has to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree that communities have to take it upon their 
shoulders the way they are doing.  They have no choice.  One 
politician alone cannot solve this problem because one politician 
alone did not bring it there.  To be honest, it was two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They need help and support.  They need to know that the 
government will recognize that it failed big time when it could 
have intervened, when it could have requested an environmental 
impact assessment because of the possible impact on our fish 
habitat.  It could have, but it closed its eyes to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not right.  The government recognized it this week by 
requesting testing.  What will it do if it finds the water is 
contaminated?  What will the minister do?  Will he close it then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The assessment would have proven that the water would eventually 
be contaminated and would affect the fish habitat and all the 
money we have invested in aquaculture, in our fishing 
communities.  We have communities that are practically totally 
dependent on the fishing industry and tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one end we have a government that says it will cut EI and 
people have to be working all the time.  At the same time it is 
bringing in facilities going against what we are trying to do, 
which is work as much as we can.  As usual there is no plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a regional development plan.  We need environment 
ministers to agree to it and abide by it.  Communities need to be 
consulted.  No longer can we have facilities like this one. There 
are 30,000 pigs being processed per year in a community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing we do not talk about, and maybe one of the least 
important things for a lot of people, is the value of the homes. 
What about the value of the family?  Many families have told me 
about being outside for barbecues and all of a sudden smelling 
it.  They have to get into the house, close their windows and 
shut everything tight.  That is not right.  What about the value 
of their homes?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sainte-Marie-de-Kent is a place where everybody would like to 
live. I remember going for drives there all the time and saying 
to my husband, “My God, it's nice in Sainte-Marie”. 
Unfortunately, a lot of people are not saying that any more.  It 
is not because we do not have nice people.  We have great people 
in Sainte-Marie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sainte-Marie is not the only place that has the smell.  I live 
in Buctouche and the smell is there too.  How about the golf 
course?  How many millions does it take to build a golf course? 
We did not even look at the impact on the golf course but we are 
putting money in there too into pays de la Sagouine.  It just goes 
on and on.  It is a decision I will never understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never understand provincial politicians apparently 
lobbying to have this factory set up there, the same politicians 
who invested money in both tourism and the fishery.  I will never 
understand why they believed that bringing in this factory would 
benefit our region.  I hope someday that they will participate in 
the call-in, such as the one we did this morning where they 
refused to comment.  I believe it was because they could not 
explain it or did not want to.  However, I would like to see the 
day when they will explain that decision.  It was a terrible 
decision.  I have to say I do support the community and I do 
understand their frustration. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk of communities working very hard to develop their 
region, but not of the private sector.  How many people have 
invested their own money, in a campground or in cottages, in 
starting up a fish plant or in many other things?  Did anyone 
consult these entrepreneurs and ask them “Is this going to hurt 
your business?”  No.  No one consulted them.  Everyone has to be 
consulted.  The government cannot go on making decisions for 
communities at the expense of the people living there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a call from a man who had to leave his work to go and care 
for his children because the spreader had gone by his house.  It 
makes no sense for this man to leave his work for such a reason. 
This week, a truck was taken off the road.  But were the people 
who did the inspection not within their rights?  The truck was 
taken off the road.  It was not allowed on the road because it 
failed to meet the requirements of the Department of Transport. 
How many other things are not right?  I congratulate the 
committee.  I congratulate the pool patrol for all their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that all the communities, with our help, and all 
levels of government must sit down together and reach a 
solution.  I hope that other people will insist that the 
government compensate Metz Farms, and close it down to save jobs 
in the tourism sector and to protect the health of our families, 
children, seniors and young children, who often have asthma, as 
Maria said when she called me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I thank you.  It has been a pleasure for me to sit 
here these past three years, five months and few weeks.  I know 
you will not be coming back to the House, and I want to wish you 
not only good luck, but success in your future endeavours. 
Thank you again for your patience, knowing that those of us who 
had arrived recently needed a little advice.  I look forward to 
our next meeting.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
speech of the hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac was so full 
of inherent contradictions that I felt I had to stand up and ask 
for some clarification.  The most noticeable contradiction was a 
glaring omission.  She failed to mention the fact that, even 
though she was a member of the NDP caucus and should know better, 
it was the NDP that moved the opposition day motion back in 
February of 1999 which called for the government to do something 
to ban the bulk sale of water and the interbasin transfer of 
water and to protect that precious natural resource. 
I am wondering if that was a deliberate omission, because, 
frankly, it could be taken as being rude to fail to at least 
acknowledge that in a lengthy speech. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another contradiction that exists. Now that the member 
is in fact a member of the Progressive Conservative Party and a 
sitting member of the Tory caucus, she did not mention 
anything about the real nature of the Tories' attitude toward the 
bulk sale of water and the interbasin transfer of water.  I use 
two examples because I only have a few minutes.  I could mention 
many more, but these are two glaring examples.  One is the right 
wing Tory premier, Wacky Bennett.  They did not call him wacky 
for nothing because his big plan was to flood the Skagit Valley, 
divert the great northern rivers of British Columbia and sell the 
water to Washington State. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As if that was not crazy enough, other Tory premiers came along 
with similar ideas, like Gary Filmon, the former premier of 
Manitoba, who wrote his engineering thesis in school with a plan 
to use nuclear blasts to blast a trench from Lake Winnipeg into 
North Dakota, then divert the water further into the Columbia 
River system and into the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All throughout history right wing Tories have had this plan to 
commercialize Canada's water and turn it into a marketable 
commodity.  When they went into the NAFTA deal we 
begged and pleaded—the opinion of the NDP is that we should not 
have entered that deal at all—“Make 
sure that water is off the table.  Do not commercialize our 
water. Do not make it subject to these liberalized trade 
agreements”. It was the Tories who put the future of our 
freshwater supply at risk by doing that very thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is Tory prime ministers and premiers who have said “Water is 
the oil of the next decade”.  Can we believe anyone who would 
view a substance that is so essential for life itself as 
something that should be subject to the profit motive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I am asking the hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac 
when she was lying.   Were you lying when you were a member of 
our caucus or are you lying now that you are a member of the Tory 
caucus? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Winnipeg Centre knows full well that to put such a question in 
such a way is unparliamentary and will not be permitted.  The 
hon. member for Winnipeg Centre will have one opportunity to 
retract with no other words, one opportunity and one opportunity 
only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  I apologize for the comment and I retract 
any statement to do with lying.  I was taken up in the heat of 
the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will go on to the 
next question or comment.  We are not going to have a response. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to speak for a few minutes to this very important 
topic.  We all know the importance of water.  I suppose some of 
the occurrences in the province of Ontario in the last couple of 
months have really underlined that for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that when my son was in Africa he reported to us that one 
of the greatest problems and challenges in the continent of 
Africa is to provide a plentiful and a safe water supply to the 
people on that continent.  There is nothing that is more 
important than an adequate supply of water that is safe, free 
from contamination and free from anything that would harm us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also aware of the fact that water is a renewable 
resource.  I often marvel at the different engineering cycles 
that have been designed into our planet.  One of the most amazing 
ones when we stop to think about it is the design of the water 
cycle, which goes up into the clouds.  We fly through it with some 
bumps when we are on an airplane.  The water precipitates, comes 
down and is so necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when I was a farm kid in Saskatchewan that if we did not 
get rain we did not get food because the very plants required 
that water.  That was all part of the big cycle. 
That water of course would then eventually evaporate.  Some of it 
found its way into creeks and rivers, some of it into the South 
Saskatchewan River near where I live, and some of it found its 
way over to the Hudson Bay and into the ocean.  Once again, the 
sun evaporated it and it came back in clouds.  It is a large 
cycle.  We need to recognize the fact that a lot of this is 
really quite beyond the control of people and, specifically, it 
is beyond the control of governments.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is very important for us to make sure that the 
water supply and the basins that we have in Canada are protected 
from exploitation and from harm.  We need to make sure that our 
water supplies are kept intact and not subject to being drained 
so that our own people suddenly no longer have an adequate 
water supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle, I agree with this particular bill before us today. 
It is regrettable that when NAFTA was being negotiated there was 
not a specific reference made to the total exclusion of water 
from any trade considerations.  The wording in the NAFTA 
agreement unfortunately is ambiguous.  It says that NAFTA creates 
no rights to the natural water resources of any party to the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians, we sit here with our water supply and wonder if 
this means that neither the United States nor Mexico, nor any 
other country, has any rights to our natural water resources. Or 
does it mean that we as Canadians, since we are also a party to 
this agreement, do not have the rights to our own natural water 
resources?  It is regrettable that the people who signed NAFTA 
did not pick up on that and correct it before it got into its 
final form.  Hence, we now have this dilemma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really believe that when it comes to the sale of water we 
could make pretty good use of that resource.  As I said before, 
if it is taken elsewhere in the world, through the design of our 
universe, it will come back to us.  We could sell the same water 
over and over again and it could be a very good thing for us 
economically.  However, as soon as we begin to do this it becomes 
a tradable commodity and subject to NAFTA which means we would, 
at that stage, lose control of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an interim measure, I think we should pass the bill so that 
commercialization, sale of bulk water, is not even contemplated. 
To do so under NAFTA would get us into a real bind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will concede now and give the floor to the member for Mercier. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know I 
really do not have much time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do want to take the last few minutes of this 
parliament to point out that Bill C-15, despite its good 
underlying principles, is in sync with all the other legislation 
the current federal government, which as we all know does not 
have much time left, has come up with. It is using every 
opportunity to infringe upon the jurisdiction of the provinces, 
and especially that of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, water is of the utmost importance for life, health and 
economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the International Joint Commission proposed that, 
on both sides of the border, the United States and Canada and 
the American states and the Canadian provinces agree to suspend 
bulk water exports for a period of six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important to realize here is that this bill goes much 
further than the recommendation and authorizes the foreign 
affairs minister to determine by himself Canada's jurisdiction 
over Quebec's water resources.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally unacceptable. It explains why we insisted on 
saying that this is not the way to go. We should trust the 
provinces to exercise their jurisdiction and let the federal 
government exercise its own jurisdiction, which is not at all 
the one the government is trying to set out in Bill C-15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final words in this parliament are much the same as my first 
words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I thank you for all the work you have accomplished. 
I would like to pay tribute to you. 
For the members who rise in such a busy House as this one, the 
mere fact that the Speaker is listening to them, as you have 
very often listened to us, allows us to be better speakers for 
the Canadians who watch us, to better explain the various bills 
and why we oppose them, which is our responsibility as members 
of the opposition.

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment I would like to have considered by unanimous 
consent would be the following:  that the motion be amended by 
deleting all the words after the Canadian Forces and 
substituting the following: both at home and abroad, in such 
areas as humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, search and 
rescue and UN peacekeeping, should proclaim the first Sunday in 
June as Canadian Forces Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a relatively minor amendment, but I think you would find 
unanimous consent to have the House agree to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Members have heard 
the suggested change to the motion standing in the name of the 
member for Nepean—Carleton.  Is there unanimous consent for the 
hon. member to move the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Therefore debate is 
on the original motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  I am very pleased to have the 
opportunity to speak to this motion today.  The motion as it 
appears is to declare June 15 as Canadian forces day. 
I understand that my colleague, the hon. member for Hillsborough, 
may be moving an amendment that would reflect my earlier comments 
in this regard.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give members a bit of the history of this motion.  It was 
introduced on March 18, 1998.  It is perhaps a testament to the 
speed with which the wheels of parliament turn that it has taken 
over two years to have it considered by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members would no doubt say that I should count myself lucky 
that I got an item on for debate at all.  I can assure them that 
I feel fortunate to be able to have this item considered. 
Nevertheless, I cannot help but think that there absolutely has 
to be a better way to deal with private members' business.  I 
very much hope that the next parliament will address this issue 
in a comprehensive and effective manner.  That discussion very 
clearly is for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the item before us, I must say that I have been gratified by 
the amount of support expressed for the particular measure.  The 
motion received a great deal of support from the members of the 
House.  I should remind members that this was one of the items 
for which there were 100 signatures of members, from both sides 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In circulating the petition on this motion, I received some very 
supportive comments.  Indeed there were some expressions of 
surprise that the country had not already done something of this 
nature to honour the men and women who serve in the Canadian 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say as well that in consultations I had with members of 
the House and with the Minister and the Department of National 
Defence, I have revised the motion, as I indicated earlier. Those 
revisions reflect the changes in terms of the consultations I had 
with regard to the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for the change is quite simple.  If we fix a date on 
a weekend, it is more likely that Canadians across this great 
country of ours would be able to more readily participate in 
community events and ceremonies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the motion all about?  Quite simply, the purpose of the 
motion is to thank all the men and women who serve us while in 
the uniform of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might ask why such a measure is necessary today.  After 
all, we have so many people in the country who perform important 
and dangerous roles to protect people and property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue, however, that the nature of military service is 
quite different.  As we have heard so often at the defence 
committee, we have the concept of unlimited liability in military 
service.  What does that mean?  It means that the person who 
signs up with the Canadian forces agrees to obey orders that 
could put his or her life, as well as those of colleagues, in 
danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In two world wars and the Korean war, the concept of unlimited 
liability was not an issue that attracted a lot of esoteric 
debate.  It was an issue that was all too real to the people who 
served and died for this country.  It was all too real to the 
families, to the mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers who read 
telegrams saying that a loved one was wounded, missing or killed 
in action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues seem so far from us today, 55 years after the end 
of the second world war, but are they really?  For the family of 
a peacekeeper who was killed in Bosnia or Croatia or, indeed, if 
we go back a few years, in places like Cyprus or the Golan 
Heights, the concept of unlimited liability is very real.  It is 
very real for the families of the soldiers who are currently 
serving in Bosnia and who will be very shortly serving in 
Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that I feel a little close to this issue as someone 
who has served from the beginning of this parliament on the 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs.  It 
has been as a result of my service on that committee that I have 
come to know and appreciate the varied and complex work that is 
done by our men and women in uniform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to the committee hearings on quality of life that 
we held in bases across the country, where the members of our 
committee got a real taste of what the Canadian forces 
accomplish.  Our committee started its work on a trip to Canadian 
forces base Yellowknife on a C-130 Hercules in January 1998.  I 
have had a lot of trips on airplanes but I cannot remember one as 
uncomfortable as that trip.  My colleague, the hon. member for 
Hillsborough, could probably attest to that on some of the rides 
he has had in the C-130 Hercules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the beginning of an eye opening experience that later 
took us to Canadian forces base Esquimalt, then off to our search 
and rescue operations at Pat Bay. 
From there we went to Canadian forces bases Edmonton, Cold Lake 
and Moose Jaw.  Our travels also took us to Canadian forces bases 
Borden, Petawawa, Valcartier, Halifax, Gagetown and Goose Bay. We 
saw soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen who told us about the 
joys and challenges of their work, along with the frustrations 
and disappointments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of serving on the 
defence committee was being able to visit our troops in 
peacekeeping and other operations.  Our committee travelled to 
Geilenkirchen, Germany, where we saw Canada's contribution to the 
NATO AWACS system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also travelled to Canada's areas of operations in Bosnia, 
where we visited places with unusual names like Velika Kladusa, 
Coralici, Bihac, Zgon and Drvar.  In many places we saw the 
physical damage of war:  destroyed homes, burned out farms, 
burned out businesses and factories, and beautiful green fields 
that no one would dare to walk on for fear of land mines. Perhaps 
most disturbing of all were the faces of the men, women and 
children who have been deeply affected by war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditions of service that our men and women in the Canadian 
forces face are certainly less than ideal.  There is, as we all 
know, the danger of unexploded land mines and unexploded 
ordnance.  As well, there are weapons everywhere in some of these 
places.  There are dangerous roads and hazardous conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that also struck me when our committee visited 
Bosnia was that when I asked some of our peacekeepers what would 
happen to the society being protected if the peacekeepers were to 
leave that place, we were told very clearly that it would not 
take very long, maybe only hours, perhaps days, before people 
would again be killing one another and damaging and destroying 
property.  They said that it would be a very serious and 
unfortunate situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of our committee also had the opportunity to travel to 
Kosovo earlier this year to the KFOR operation, Camp Maple Leaf 
in Skopje, Macedonia, to tour the operations there.  What we saw 
was equally disturbing and probably made just as much impact on 
us as the trip that we took to Bosnia a couple of years earlier. 
We saw the results of the precision bombing, the mass graves and 
the property destruction, which was everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, members of the Canadian forces do not just serve in the 
Balkans and in the former Yugoslavia.  They are in many other 
parts of the world, more recently in places like East Timor and 
in an area that I am certainly more familiar with, Sierra Leone. 
We have had, for instance, military observers there to monitor 
the Lomé peace agreement as part of the UNAMSIL force there.  We 
also had a cargo handling unit in Sierra Leone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned some of the dangers of our operations for people in 
places like Bosnia and Kosovo, but in Africa the dangers are in 
many respects multiplied.  Here I am thinking of military 
observers and the dangers that exist in terms of kidnapping.  We 
saw earlier this year the kidnapping by the rebel forces in 
Sierra Leone of about 500 members of the Indian peacekeeping 
force that was part of the UNAMSIL operation.  That sort of 
violence is something that peacekeepers or military observers can 
be exposed to on a fairly regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, in places like Africa there is the threat of disease.  I 
am thinking again of Sierra Leone, where the danger is constant 
with regard to diseases like malaria, dysentery, yellow fever, 
cholera, sleeping sickness and river blindness.  These are all 
diseases that members of our forces can be exposed to in areas 
like Sierra Leone, Congo and Ethiopia-Eritrea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inasmuch as we can be inoculated against certain diseases, the 
one thing we cannot be inoculated against is post-traumatic 
stress disorder.  That is something we have certainly seen over 
the last number of years.  Many of the members of our forces are 
facing it.  Perhaps the most high profile victim of PTSD, as it 
is called, has been Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire, who served 
with great distinction in Rwanda. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1345

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to meet General Dallaire on a number of 
occasions.  He certainly has my greatest respect and admiration. 
I think he embodies the values of the Canadian forces.  When I 
say the values of the Canadian forces, I mean the desire to help 
people in need, the desire to protect the innocent, to preserve 
the rule of law, to safeguard human rights and to protect people 
and property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>General Dallaire is one of many who have experienced probably 
the worst the world has to offer.  Rwanda was certainly a place 
where the world as a whole failed very miserably.  However I 
think we can be very proud of the fact that a member of the 
Canadian forces, General Dallaire, tried his very best to prevent 
this slaughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to the people like General Dallaire and many of the unsung 
heroes of the Canadian forces to whom this Canadian forces day 
would be dedicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the comments I have heard from members of the forces, 
which is a source of great frustration to them, is that many 
people do not really understand what they do.  People know we 
have an army.  They know we have an air force.  They know we have 
a navy, but they are not really clear on the sorts of things and 
the individual tasks that our forces perform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, it is important to emphasize that the Canadian 
forces as whole is a very vital tool of our foreign policy.  When 
all else fails, when the diplomats stop talking and when the guns 
come out, it is members of the Canadian forces and other allied 
forces who are sent in to try and straighten out the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked about the challenges and the work of the Canadian 
forces abroad, but I think it is just as important to stress what 
they have done domestically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but be drawn to the memories I have of the ice 
storm that occurred in 1998.  It is probably a distant memory for 
a lot of members in the House and for a lot of Canadians, but 
half the people in my riding were without power and in some cases 
for several weeks.  This was an experience they do not want to 
repeat soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were roughly 30,000 to 35,000 people without power during 
a very difficult winter.  Whole towns in my riding, places like 
Osgoode, Manotick and North Gower, were without power.  It was in 
aid of these small communities that our forces came to the 
rescue.  My constituents were very pleased to see the members of 
the Canadian forces present and providing a kind of security 
blanket for the members of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my comments here and allow other members to 
speak on this motion.  I would appreciate the opportunity at the 
conclusion of the debate to make a few more comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think it is appropriate on what is undoubtedly the very last 
day of the 36th parliament that we should conclude our debates 
with such an important topic.  I would like to congratulate my 
hon. colleague from across the way for having introduced this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before private members' business began we were talking 
about water and how in this country we have an abundant, safe 
supply of it.  We take it so for granted.  We often take for 
granted the relative peace and safety of our land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are greatly blessed by the fact that we do not have to have 
active, armed troops in full combat gear going up and down our 
roads and highways, protecting our borders and generally using 
force to keep the peace.  We have become accustomed in Canada to 
our freedoms, our freedom to move about and our safety, without 
fear and without worrying about being attacked by either internal 
or external agents.  We are probably remiss. 
We do not think about this enough, nor do we express our 
gratitude enough to not only God, under whose charter this 
country was founded, but also for the people who serve us in the 
various peacekeeping capacities.  Certainly I am thinking of not 
only our armed forces, but also our very notable police forces, 
the RCMP and the many other provincial and local forces that we 
have throughout our land.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes wonder what would happen if we did not have the 
restraint of our peace officers and our armed forces in order to 
protect the peace, because we realize when we look at other parts 
of the world that it could indeed be very fragile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is proposing that we have one day a year in which we, 
in a specific way, acknowledge and give honour to our armed 
forces personnel.  This is of course something which we already 
do to some degree annually on November 11 when we have 
Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been my privilege over the last seven years as a member 
of parliament to participate in that very special day which we 
have on November 11 every year. I have had the occasion on that 
day to visit one of the local legion branches in my riding each 
year.  There are five of them altogether. I have rotated around 
from one to the other.  Last year I went to the community of 
Chipman where they do not even have a legion branch per se, but 
where they have a very fitting and a very respectful ceremony on 
November 11 to honour the armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On every occasion when I have picked up that wreath and 
approached the place where we place it, I have been touched by 
the emotion of realizing that the wreath represents a sacrifice 
which other people were willing to make in order to protect our 
safety, our society and our country, to protect and defend those 
things that we so strongly believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had only a very small and indirect involvement with 
violence in the form of war, that is, in the sense that our son 
has served overseas.  In fact, both of our sons did, but one for 
a greater length of time.  He served, not with the armed forces 
but with the peace forces:  World Vision, with which I am sure 
many of the members here are familiar; Samaritan's Purse; and 
Compassion Canada, agencies that are there to help people. He did 
go into areas where the land was wartorn.  He came back from 
Bosnia and told us that the countryside was a lot like ours but 
that when he went closer to the houses, which also looked like 
ours, those houses were full of bullet holes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that we owe a tremendously huge debt of 
gratitude for those in the armed forces who sacrifice their own 
safety and put their own safety at risk in order to defend the 
rights of others and keep the peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to be a member of parliament who has the privilege of 
having a large armed forces base in my riding.  The Edmonton base 
is actually in my riding since my riding sort of boundaries right 
up to the city of Edmonton.  I have a number of people there who 
are working in the armed forces.  It has been my privilege on a 
number of occasions to visit that base and talk to the different 
personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, among other things, we ought to be showing these people 
the respect which they should have by making sure that their 
needs, financial and otherwise, are adequately met.  It is one 
of the areas that I think we should address.  Many of them are 
not paid enough in straight money to provide for themselves and 
their families.  Besides having a day in which we honour them in 
addition to November 11, we should also be looking at providing 
them with adequate means of livelihood.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concur with the member's desire to amend the motion that 
instead of having it fixed at the 15th day of June, we would have 
it the first Sunday in June.  It is a good amendment and I would 
support it if it were put forward again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to have a day where everyone can participate. In 
our Canadian culture Sunday is a day when, despite the fact that 
we are becoming more and more commercialized on that day, many 
people do work less.  Government employees, for example, enjoy 
Saturdays and Sundays off.  Sunday is one of those days when we 
have a little more personal freedom to be together with families 
and do things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since many thousands of Canadians attend worship service or a 
synagogue on Saturday or Sunday, these ceremonies could also be 
included there.  As people of faith, we also believe in being 
thankful, and to weave gratitude to our armed forces personnel 
into a religious service would be something very appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle I agree with this motion.  November 11 is a fairly 
adequate acknowledgement of the work that our armed forces do, 
but that particular day is rooted more in history.  We use the 
phrase “lest we forget” and think specifically of those who 
gave their lives and of those who suffered bodily injury in the 
great wars of the past. This would be a day to honour and give 
credit and tributes to those who presently serve in our armed 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In as much as we are indebted to them, we should seriously 
consider having such a day and making it part of our national 
culture and part of what we do once a year to emphasize the 
wonderful blessings that we have as a result of the things our 
armed forces personnel do for us and on behalf of us. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have before us a 
non-votable motion, which allows us to state our intentions if 
that motion were some day to be voted on in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion, the text the mover submitted to us in amendment 
today would have been more acceptable than the one we have to 
debate on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the change itself was unacceptable today. Since 
100 members had signed to indicate their support for the bill, 
we could not today, out of respect for those 100 members, accept 
to debate a different text from the one already accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the motion is non-votable and since the member who moved it 
will eventually come back in the next parliament with a proposal 
that hopefully will be made votable, we will nevertheless say 
what we think about the text now before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that we would be in favour of a means of 
recognizing the dedication of the members of the Canadian armed 
forces. We must not recognize the dedication of only the 
current members of the Canadian armed forces, as there are also 
former members who are now retired and for whom there is no 
recognition day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a recognition day for veterans, Remembrance Day, for 
those who were killed in action, who gave their lives to defend 
the freedom of our people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also those who, fortunately, did not have to pay the 
ultimate price, but who nevertheless put their lives at risk. 
These people were members of the Canadian forces for years. 
Their contribution should also be recognized on certain days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people took part in peacekeeping missions abroad. They may 
have helped during catastrophes in Canada. They may have done 
exactly the same job, without losing their lives. They are as 
deserving of our recognition as those who died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is whether, in order to recognize all these people, 
we should have three special days during the year: one for the 
veterans who died at war, one for those who did not die but 
spent years with the Canadian forces in the service of the 
nation, and another for those who are currently in the Canadian 
forces. It would never end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue should be examined by a committee. We could look at 
how the contribution of these people could be acknowledged on 
one or two specific days. I believe that in some countries one 
day is set aside to remember those who died at war, and another 
one is reserved for the country's armed forces. Perhaps we will 
come to the conclusion that two days are needed but, in my 
opinion, that second day should not only include current members 
of the Canadian forces, but also former ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us talks about the “contribution of the 
Canadian Forces to the protection of Canadian sovereignty”.  I 
think it inaccurate to seek a day of commemoration for this 
reason, Canadian sovereignty having never been threatened.  No 
foreign power wants to attack Canada.  No foreign power has 
threatened Canada's sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we set aside a day to pay tribute to those who have 
never had to fight to protect Canadian sovereignty, which has 
never been threatened?  The sovereignty of a country is 
threatened when the citizens of that country no longer want it. 
That is the only situation in which that sovereignty can be 
threatened, and only a country's citizens may decide to retain 
or modify their sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that could happen, because the people of 
Quebec, who are in favour of Canadian sovereignty without 
wanting to be a part of it, would like to be a sovereign nation 
themselves.  One day would have to be found to defend and 
celebrate Quebec's sovereignty, and another to celebrate 
Canada's sovereignty.  There would be two different days and I 
am sure that all Quebecers would be happy, under those 
circumstances, to observe these two days to celebrate the 
sovereignty of two peoples who deserved to exist, the Canadian 
people and the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, these are my last words in this august assembly. 
I will not be a member in the next parliament, because I am not 
seeking a new mandate.  It was a great honour, during these 
seven years, to defend the interests of my country, Quebec. 
I was very struck by the democracy which reigns in this place, a 
democracy which we would like to see continue in the nation we 
are seeking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also extremely proud to serve the inhabitants of the very 
lovely and large riding of Joliette.  I hope that my successors 
will enjoy themselves here as much as I have, that their stay 
will be as short as possible, and that they too will continue to 
defend the sovereignty of our wonderful nation, Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise on this motion that aims to proclaim June 15 
Canadian forces day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the many men and women employed with the Canadian 
forces deserve recognition from all Canadians.  Not only do these 
Canadians face often very difficult conditions due to the nature 
of their work but they must also deal with a Liberal government 
that has not provided the kind of support they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard many stories about poor equipment, inadequate 
health care and lack of support for our troops overseas.  Earlier 
this week I addressed the House of Commons on the topic of 
Canadian peacekeepers heading toward Ethiopia.  I said then and I 
will say again that first and foremost all Canadians involved in 
that effort must be properly equipped, clothed, supported, 
trained, led and organized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope the government has learned from the extreme hardships 
encountered by peacekeepers in Croatia and will ensure that our 
peacekeepers on this most recent mission will be provided with 
every opportunity to fulfil their mission safely and securely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report we saw on Canada's peacekeeping efforts in Croatia 
produced a troubling and very disturbing picture.  On that 
occasion our peacekeepers had a lack of lumber and sandbags to 
adequately protect themselves from regular shelling and gunfire. 
They also lacked proper medical support and sufficient advance 
surgical team support.  The UN in that case refused for weeks to 
examine complaints from our peacekeepers that the drinking water 
was contaminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our peacekeepers, their families and communities deserve to know 
that the government has addressed all these issues and is doing 
everything possible to ensure that our peacekeepers are provided 
with all the support possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I support the notion of proclaiming Canadian forces day, I 
would expect more from the Liberal government than merely setting 
aside a day for recognition.  As NDP spokesperson, I am appalled 
by the way in which our troops and civilian defence employees 
have been treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not really have an overall vision for our 
military.  It seems that things happen on a case by case basis. 
Often decisions are made on the spur of the moment.  We really 
need for our military an overall vision of what we as Canadians 
want our military to be and what role we want it to perform. That 
vision should be properly resourced and staffed. In that way 
people can go about their business without worrying about cuts in 
budgets or about not having enough people to send off on various 
peacekeeping missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the Liberal mishandling of Canadian forces issues, I 
take my hat off to all men and women who have served and continue 
to serve with such commitment and dedication.  These men and 
women have shown their devotion and love of our country. They 
have performed their roles very well.  We must take our hats off 
to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think particularly of the sacrifices endured by the families 
of military personnel.  Many times the spouses and children are 
left at home while their loved ones are off on missions in very 
dangerous settings.  This is indeed quite a disruption to family 
stability, but they all pull together and give their best because 
of their love of and devotion to this country and the job they 
are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's announcement to finally replace the Sea King 
helicopters underscores its complete mishandling of the whole 
issue of support for our military.  Every step of the way in the 
Liberal government's supreme bungling of the Sea King 
replacements has reflected the worst example of placing short 
term political interests ahead of the safety of Canadian forces 
personnel and Canadian citizens.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House of Commons the NDP has been at the forefront 
pushing for replacements for the Sea Kings.  I wrote the Prime 
Minister in June of this year, stating: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it would be a shame, and in fact inexcusable, to allow the 
political background and decisions of the past concerning new 
military helicopters to cause any further delay in making a 
speedy and proper decision at this time. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently there was an announcement that the government was 
moving ahead with the contract on the Sea Kings.  This appearance 
of taking the matter off the back burner and putting it on the 
front burner is somewhat suspect timing as we head toward an 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note that the helicopters will not be available until 2005. 
The first part of the contract, for the airframe, will not be 
awarded until sometime in 2001.  The second part, for the 
missions system contract, will not be awarded until 2002.  Even 
today we hear concerns being expressed on the part of some of the 
contenders for the contract.  They feel there is a question about 
the contracting process, that it eliminates some and enables 
others to be at the forefront for the particular contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that political considerations of the Liberal 
government are still more important than the safety of our 
Canadian forces personnel, who will be depending on the aging Sea 
Kings for a long time yet to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have pointed out on previous occasions that Sea Kings went 
into service in 1963, when Diefenbaker was prime minister, 19 
current members of parliament had yet to be born and Martin 
Luther King had yet to give his famous speech.  Sea King crashes 
have killed and injured Canadians, yet almost 14 years have 
passed since the Liberals first began the process of replacing 
the Sea Kings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad we are finally moving forward on that issue, but there 
is nothing the government can do at this point to wipe away this 
huge stain on its record.  Over seven years ago Sea Kings started 
dropping out of the sky due to systems failures.  The Liberals 
are accountable to Canadians for each and every day of those 
seven years that they did nothing.  The recent fiasco with the 
Liberal government's handling of the <I>GTS Katie</I> is just one 
more example of the disaster of privatization.  Canadian troops 
and forces equipment should be transported by Canadian forces 
vessels, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House on May 12 of this year I raised the issue of 
contracting out.  A recent defence audit condemned contracting 
out in the military.  The forces contracting out fiasco began 
with ill-fated alternative service delivery that has cut DND 
civilian workforces in Halifax, Goose Bay, Shiloh, Gagetown and 
throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The October 1988 report of the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs, entitled “Moving Forward:  A 
Strategic Plan for Quality of Life Improvements in the Canadian 
Forces”, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Canadian Forces must be fairly and equitably 
compensated for the work they do and the risks they take. Members 
and their families should never have to suffer the indignity of 
substandard housing, nor should they be reduced to charity in 
order to feed their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lifestyle faced by military personnel often makes it well 
nigh impossible to support a dual income lifestyle. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all this I must again applaud the men and women who 
serve in the Canadian forces, both military and civilian. 
Civilian personnel are sometimes forgotten in this regard.  They 
perform an integral and important role that is often overlooked 
in providing support throughout the service.  When we look at 
what is happening with our civilian personnel we see the 
government wanting to privatize such things as the supply chain 
project rather than allowing in-house bids to deal with those 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think about having a day to honour the Canadian forces I 
also think of the reserves.  Reservists play a very important 
role in our military.  Just this past week, on October 18, many 
reservists wore the uniform with pride as part of reserve uniform 
day.  Reservists have served Canada for over a century and have 
served on peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.  On behalf of 
the New Democratic Party, it is my honour to commend all 
reservists for their commitment to their communities and their 
country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Halifax West reservists played an essential role 
in the recovery of Swissair flight 111 and have provided 
invaluable service throughout Canada, including service during 
the Manitoba flood, the 1998 ice storm, avalanches and forest 
fires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge all Canadians, as we think about a day to celebrate 
the Canadian forces, to take time to say thank you to the 
reservists who are so committed to our country.  They deserve to 
be well trained, properly equipped and adequately funded in order 
to be a vital component of the forces of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that we would support a day recognizing the 
Canadian forces because they are indeed an integral part of our 
society.  They do a lot to make Canada the kind of country of 
which we can all be proud. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
members of the House, before I go to my speech, I also want to 
say that this will be my last speech.  I said the other night 
when I spoke in the take note debate that it was my last speech, 
but this definitely will be my last speech in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank all members for their co-operation over the 
years.  I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, and all the Speakers 
for the great role they play in the running of this glorious 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government readily supports private member's Motion No. 134 
to designate Canadian forces day.  This day would officially 
recognize on an annual basis the significant contribution that 
our military forces make in promoting Canadian interests, peace 
and security, both at home and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the instituting of Canadian forces day, citizens across 
the country would be encouraged to learn more about our armed 
forces.  It would provide them with an opportunity to personally 
thank the many men and women who work tirelessly in Canada's 
interests day after day, year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian forces day would mean a lot to Canadians, and it 
would mean a lot to those in uniform.  The Canadian forces are a 
vital national institution.  They reflect Canada's cultural, 
linguistic and regional diversity, with a presence in every 
province and territory, in more than 3,000 communities across 
the country.  The Canadian forces are made up of many faces, all 
of them serving as one under a single flag.  They come from 
across the nation, from farms and from cities, from different 
ethnic and religious backgrounds, men and women alike, all of 
them united by the common cause of serving Canada and Canadians. 
The Canadian forces are an essential part of the national fabric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just outside this building on the lawns of Parliament Hill every 
summer, members of the primary reserve force conduct the 
colourful changing of the guard ceremony.  Many of them, as 
trained infanteers, have also served overseas on peacekeeping 
missions or assisted during domestic crises, such as the ice storm 
of 1998, as has been mentioned.  These Canadians live, work and 
study in this very community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces are everywhere we look.  Forces personnel 
are raising families in our communities, contributing to our 
local economies and working alongside many of us, sometimes 
without our knowledge or recognition.  Defence research and 
development is stimulating Canadian innovation.  The national 
cadet program is teaching responsibility and citizenship to our 
children.  The Canadian forces, in short, are a very integral 
part of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces are also an integral part of Canada's 
history.  Since Confederation, their members have made great 
sacrifices in the building of our nation.  Thousands of Canadians 
have died in active service with the Canadian forces, from 
Paardeburg to Vimy Ridge, from the beaches of Normandy to 
Kapyong.  Many of the veterans who survived some of these battles 
are among us today, former members of the Canadian forces who 
fought with great courage for their nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces today continue to perform core functions of 
the government.  Our men and women in uniform work every day to 
protect Canadian sovereignty, promote national interests and 
secure international peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian forces members bring relief during natural disasters. 
They provide search and rescue services.  They patrol our 
coastline and enforce Canadian law.  They help fulfil our 
international obligations.  They bring peace and stability to 
troubled regions of the world through peace support operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last year or so the Canadian forces have been involved 
in the interception of over 600 illegal migrants, year 2000 
preparations, disaster relief in Turkey, peacekeeping in East 
Timor, NATO operations in Kosovo, and North American security 
through NORAD.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces provided support to and helped co-ordinate 
over 8,000 search and rescue operations, a record number.  These 
efforts resulted in the saving of over 4,000 lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this very moment approximately 2,500 Canadian forces 
personnel are deployed on 16 operations around the world.  We 
currently have more than 1,500 men and women in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina alone.  The list of operations is long: 
Ethiopia and Eritrea, Iraq and Kuwait, the Golan Heights, 
Guatemala, and Sierra Leone.  Just recently a Canadian officer, 
Major-General Hillier, assumed command of Multi-National Division 
Southwest in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As these examples illustrate, all members of the Canadian 
forces, from privates to general officers, are making a concrete 
difference in improving the world in which we live.  Much of 
their work is, by its very nature, thankless and hard.  Members 
of the Canadian forces have chosen a profession that puts their 
lives at risk, all in the name of Canada and Canadian interests. 
They face down aggression and tyranny in distant lands every day 
so that we may live in peace and prosperity here at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to providing the Canadian forces 
with the right tools for the job.  With two consecutive defence 
budget increases, a comprehensive quality of life program, and a 
list of newly procured equipment, the Canadian forces are 
building a strong future on an even stronger foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also committed to ensuring that our soldiers, 
sailors, airmen and airwomen are properly recognized and publicly 
thanked for their national service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 6 the Governor General and Commander-in-Chief 
presented the first Canadian peacekeeping service medals to 
recipients in Ottawa, including many members of the Canadian 
forces.  As Canadians we recognize elements and individuals of 
the Canadian forces through various honours and events such as 
this one.  However, we have yet to reserve a day when all 
Canadians from coast to coast can take a moment to thank all 
members of the Canadian forces for their dedication and hard 
work.  By declaring a Canadian forces day today in the House, we 
will provide that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People across the country will be given the occasion to 
recognize the accomplishments of our men and women in uniform. It 
will, in short, give Canadians an opportunity to thank Canadian 
forces personnel for their dedicated work.  It is time for us to 
officially set aside a day when Canadians of all walks of life 
can thank members of the Canadian forces for their service and 
increase their knowledge of military issues in the process.  It 
is time to officially establish Canadian forces day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my fellow members to support this motion.  I would like 
to put forward the following amendment.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK194">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
words “Canadian Forces” and substituting the following:  “both 
at home and abroad, in such areas as humanitarian assistance, 
disaster relief, search and rescue and UN peacekeeping, should 
proclaim the first Sunday in June as Canadian Forces Day”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair had a 
previous notice of the amendment.  The amendment is in order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am proud to stand today to speak in support of Motion 
No. 134. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we support the bill, we have to recognize the 
government cuts that the Department of National Defence has 
suffered.  In 1993-94 the defence budget was $12.4 billion.  In 
1997-98 it was down to $9.8 billion.  That does not really show 
support from the Liberal government.  There has been a reduction 
of 23%.  The reduction in the number of civilian employees at the 
Department of National Defence has been a staggering 40%. General 
Maurice Baril says that there is likely to be an additional 
reduction of 2,000 to 3,000 people in that department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has gutted the heart and soul of the armed 
forces.  Let us not forget that the Sea King helicopter 
replacement program is currently being investigated by the 
Canadian International Trade Tribunal and that there have 
actually been some pilots who have lost their lives because of a 
very bad decision by the Liberals. 
Let us not forget the soldiers who are forced to visit food 
banks.  I do not think that should be happening.  I could go on 
and on.

I commit to the House that members of my party will stand for our

will certainly have our support on that day as well as the other 
364 days of the year. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before I go back to the motion I would like to echo some of the 
comments that have been made in this place in connection with 
your own participation and membership in this Chamber.  I wish 
you the very best in terms of your future endeavours.  You 
certainly have been a credit to the House.  I have watched you 
over the last number of years since I was elected in 1997 and I 
can say that I have a great deal of respect for the way you have 
handled your role in the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not get an opportunity, because I could probably speak for 
quite some time on these subjects, to talk about the Canadian 
forces in NATO, search and rescue operations or the many other 
activities in which they involve themselves.  However, I think 
those activities have been amply discussed by other members who 
have spoken to the issue before the House today, including the 
member for Hillsborough, the member for Elk Island, the member 
for Halifax West and the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some comments made during the course of the debate to 
which I want to make reference, that is, the whole business of 
recognizing past and present members of the forces through the 
motion.  That is what the motion does.  It just does not 
recognize members of the Canadian forces who are serving right 
now but recognizes the many others who served in years past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another hon. member made mention of the fact that Canadian 
sovereignty has never been threatened.  He would have a hard time 
putting that argument to members of the Canadian forces who 
served in the battle of the St. Lawrence during the second world 
war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read another endorsation of this idea from the 
Conference of Defence Associations.  As I mentioned earlier, a 
tremendous number of groups and individuals have supported the 
motion.  The Conference of Defence Associations has said that the 
28 member associations of the CDA, comprising over half a million 
individuals coast to coast, stand behind any action to bring 
attention and appreciation to members of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is likely to be the last day of debate in parliament.  I 
can think of no better way to honour the men and women of the 
Canadian forces than by proclaiming the first Sunday in June as 
Canadian forces day.  I would request unanimous consent of the 
House for the passage of the motion with the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Does the member for 
Nepean—Carleton have unanimous consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we close 
today I should like to add a couple of words to indicate how 
humble and how proud I am to have been able to occupy this 
wonderful chair for the past three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all members very much for the generosity shown to me for 
three years and particularly for today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland): </B>The hour provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired.
