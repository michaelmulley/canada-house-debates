	The House resumed from June 9 consideration of Bill C-85, 
an act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances 
Act and to provide for the continuation of a certain provision; 
and of Motions Nos. 1 to 7.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. members, the last time the House 
considered Bill C-85, the hon. member for Longueuil had four 
minutes left. Since he is not in the House today, the hon. member 
for Yellowhead has the floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I comment directly on Bill C-85 I remind the House it has 
been almost two years since the government took over office and 
Canada's deficit. The problem still remains unresolved.
<P>
	During the last 24 hours the deficit has increased by $100 
million and in the last hour the deficit has increased by $4 
million. Since I began speaking the deficit has increased by 
about $40,000. When I an through with my remarks on the MP 
pension bill the deficit will have incredibly increased by about 
$700,000. Our country's debt stands at over $550 billion and the 
government has added about $100 billion to the debt over the 
last couple of years.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	Into this kind of deficit disaster, this spending brinkmanship, 
the government introduced the outrageous, incredibly rich gold 
plated MP pension bill which government members are 
reluctant to debate in the House and which they certainly will 
not debate outside the House or across the country.
<P>
	Government members should hang their heads in shame. 
Every member who votes for this bill, this elitist double 
standard bill, should be embarrassed. When MPs who support 
the bill go back to their ridings, how can they look their 
constituents straight in the eye and tell them they deserve a 
pension at least twice as rich as those of their constituents? For 
the 74 Liberal members of Parliament presently here, the trough 
heavies, how can they look their constituents in the eye and tell 
them they deserve a pension at least four times are rich as those 
of their constituents?
<P>
	Politicians in Ottawa have created two sets of rules, one for 
the ruling elite and one for regular folks. A case in point recently 
of a double standard is the mileage allowance increase for MPs, 
about 12 per cent higher than is allowed in the private sector. 
Politicians set themselves apart, above regular folks.
<P>
	I am talking about a double standard, which is really an 
euphemism for hypocrisy. The ultimate hypocrisy takes shape in 
the MP pension plan. It was an issue during the 1993 election 
campaign and it will grow to a major issue in the next election.
<P>
	My constituents in the Yellowhead know what the federal 
government is doing about the gold plated pension plan and they 
do not like it one bit.
<P>
	Sadly, the Liberal government lacks the intestinal fortitude to 
do the right thing and bring MP pension into line with pension 
plans available in the private sector. It is a double standard. 
Whether the Liberals want to accept it or not, we are all regular 
folks, just like the people who voted for us. Dignity and respect 
are in order for Canadians, not double standards or double talk.
<P>
	There are many things hypocritical about Bill C-85, the 
pension bill. It allows benefits to accrue at double the rate 
legally allowed in the private sector under the Income Tax Act. 
Senior Liberal MPs, 74 of them with more than six years of 
service, will retain their gold plated pension and start collecting 
immediately on retirement regardless of age.
<P>
	Seventy-four Liberal MPs even under the provisions of the 
bill will still receive a pension four times richer than most other 
Canadians'. Freshman MPs who opt into this new plan will still 
be part of a pension plan twice as generous as that available for 
most Canadians, and they can start collecting pensions at age 55. 
This group of MPs will also be able to collect 75 per cent of their 
salary after serving 19 years in office. Most Canadians have to  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14002"> 14002 </A></B>
<P>
work 35 years to collect a pension worth 70 per cent of their final 
income.
<P>
	It is this kind of better than thou attitude Canadians are tired 
of. Average folks are being asked to tighten their belts, to pay 
more in the form of all kinds of taxes. MPs have created an 
insulated world for themselves which shields them from the 
financial burden regular Canadians are asked to carry.
<P>
	Perhaps one of the most hypocritical elements of the MP 
pension plan is it allows former parliamentarians who are 
wealthy to continue to collect an MP pension. Seniors citizens 
can only dream of such a system for them. These folks have to 
abide by the rules set by law. Any senior 65 years of age or over 
who has an income exceeding $53,215 must pay 15 per cent of 
the excess net income up to the full amount of old age security 
collected. In other words, seniors who cross a certain income 
threshold have their old age security benefits clawed back and 
most people would say it is fair and reasonable.
<P>
	Those members who have six or more years experience can 
begin to collect their MP pension immediately on leaving office 
regardless of age. Freshmen MPs can begin collecting their MP 
pensions at age 55. To top it all off, former parliamentarians who 
are well off are not subject to any pension clawback. For some 
unknown reason they are put on a pedestal and are somehow 
deserving of every cent because they served their country.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	What about the seniors who have their OAS pensions clawed 
back? Many of them are veterans. Most seniors helped build this 
country. Surely they can claim they have contributed to their 
country and are deserving of every cent as well. Again it is a 
double standard, one the public should not and will not tolerate.
<P>
	To deal with this unfairness I will be introducing a private 
member's bill this fall which is the basis for an Amendment No. 
39 to Bill C-85. Both require all former parliamentarians 
whether senators or MPs to have their pensions clawed back 
exactly the same way many seniors have their OAS benefits 
clawed back. This clawback would take effect immediately once 
the parliamentarian begins to collect his pension regardless of 
age. It would apply when a former member attains employment 
which pays him in excess of $53,215, the exact same threshold 
level which applies to seniors eligible to collect OAS.
<P>
	I will be the first to admit such a clawback will not save the 
country billions of dollars. It will save the taxpayers money in 
the long run. That is something every member in the House 
should be interested in. It will help to alleviate the widespread 
cynicism federal politicians encounter. It will help to restore 
perhaps a little confidence. This is most important. It will send a 
signal to the long suffering taxpayers that cuts must start with 
those who legislate.
<P>
	Why should former Tory Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, 
who is independently wealthy, pocket $33,500 of taxpayers' 
dollars every year? That is his MP pension benefit and not one 
dime of it is clawed back. To add insult to Canadian taxpayers, 
Mulroney stands to collect an additional $50,000 per year in 
priministerial pension when he turns 65 in the year 2003. This is 
the man who brought the country to its knees. As the MP pension 
plan is laid out now none of that can be clawed back and after a 
member turns 60 it is all indexed.
<P>
	Then there is millionaire Liberal Pierre Trudeau. With 
inflation protection he collects well over $100,000 per year 
from Canadian taxpayers. Here as well not one thin dime is 
clawed back.
<P>
	We cannot forget some of our colleagues presently in the 
House. They will be the heavy troughers when they leave this 
place. The Deputy Prime Minister staunchly defends the 
obscene MP pension plan. It is no wonder, she would stand to 
collect about $34,000 per year if she retired today. That is 
almost $3 million by the time she reaches age 75. If on her 
retirement she gains meaningful employment or contracts from 
the ex-heritage minister certainly she should be susceptible to 
an MP pension clawback.
<P>
	Then there is the leader of the Tory party. It appears we cannot 
get the rich blue blood out of the Tories. He has been extremely 
quiet about the ludicrous MP pension plan. I suspect it is 
because he stands to collect about $45,000 per year on 
retirement, with a total of $4.5 million, mostly taxpayers' 
money, until he reaches age 75. It is no wonder the Tory leader is 
silent about the MP pension plan.
<P>
	Surely everyone would agree that on retirement the leader of 
the Tory party, the independents really, should be subject to an 
MP pension clawback if he earns over $53,000 per year in the 
private sector.
<P>
	It is unfair to ask seniors in a certain wage category to give a 
portion of their pensions if former parliamentarians who fall 
under the same wage category do not have to give back a portion 
of their incredibly rich pensions.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	I sincerely hope all members of this House will give careful 
consideration to amendment No. 39 under Bill C-85, which 
calls for an MP pension clawback to well off former 
parliamentarians. There cannot be two sets of government 
imposed rules, one for seniors collecting pensions and one for 
MPs collecting pensions. It is undemocratic, unfair, and just not 
right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to have the opportunity to speak today on Bill C-85, 
commonly known as the MP pension plan.
<P>
	I first have to express my extreme disappointment with this 
government for using time allocation on a bill such as this. The 
obvious question we have to ask is why the government did it. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14003"> 14003 </A></B>
<P>
Why did it impose limits on debate on  a bill such as this? What 
is the hurry? We have two years, under normal conditions, 
before an election is called. Why does the government have to 
ram this through before the end of this Parliament?
<P>
	I submit that the Liberals want to get to the bank before the 
end of the day to cash in and make their big deposit to take 
advantage of what they just awarded themselves.
<P>
	What did they award themselves? They awarded themselves 
an obscene pension plan. In the red book the Liberals outlined 
that they were going to be reforming this MP pension plan to 
bring it into line with what the average is in Canada. That simply 
has not happened here.
<P>
	I also want to examine the role of the official opposition of 
Canada in this particular bill. Why would a party whose main 
goal is to leave this country by separating from Canada want an 
MP pension plan? They must have some idea that maybe this is 
going to fail and they are going to be here for a lot longer than 
they originally expected. As a matter of principle, should this 
party not say that they are going to use this opportunity to opt 
out? They want to opt out of Canada but they want to stay within 
the MP pension plan. Talk about double standards.
<P>
	We have double standards from the Liberals on the MP 
pension plan, but I would say there is a complicity here with the 
Bloc. They also co-operated in the vote on time allocation on 
this bill. I am really disappointed with Her Majesty's official 
opposition, or loyal opposition I should say, which is what the 
word actually is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Using the term loosely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Yes. My colleague just reminded me that I am 
using that term loosely.
<P>
	I want to outline my concerns of what I think the public has to 
say on this issue, especially the public in my riding. The main 
issue in the last election campaign in my riding was MP 
pensions. It was not MPs' salaries. There were a number of other 
issues, but one of the main issues and one that was brought 
forward at every public meeting I attended was the MP pension 
plan. People asked: ``Why would the MPs award themselves a 
pension plan four or five times more generous than the average 
pension plan in Canada? Is this not a double standard?'' I had to 
agree that it was a double standard in my view.
<P>
	The question came up several times: ``Why do they have the 
power to award themselves their own pension? Should it not be 
put out to an independent commission and the power be left with 
the Canadian public?'' I had to agree with that as well.
<P>
	The public understands very clearly that there is a double 
standard here, a public standard they are not prepared to accept. 
I do not think this can be sold to the Canadian public. Even this 
revised plan is twice as generous as any public sector plan. How 
can that be sold to the Canadian public at a time when we are 
facing  cutbacks? We are trying to inspire people in Canada to do 
with less to make our country competitive again to get it back on 
the rails and here we are in this very House of Commons, where 
we need to show leadership, going in the opposite direction. It is 
a very bad tactical move on behalf of this government. It cannot 
be sold to the Canadian public.
<P>
	I want to take a moment to examine some of the clauses in Bill 
C-85. We still have a plan that is put forward here. They have 
changed the eligibility. MPs do not have to serve two terms or 
six years. Now it is going to be that MPs will be eligible to start 
collecting at age 55.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	Pension plans through Canada pension and old age security 
start at 65. There is quite a bit of talk they may have to be rolled 
back to maybe 66 or 67, as they cannot be sustained. Here we 
have another double standard. At 55 years of age an MP can start 
collecting a pension. It is going in the opposite direction from 
where the public is going. As I said before, it is still twice as 
generous as any other plan out there.
<P>
	Why is the opt out provision only available to current 
members? That seems like a little sleight of hand, a little smoke 
and mirrors. Yes, it is just for us, and I am happy to take it, 
because I simply could not live with my conscience and I could 
not sell it in my constituency. I would suggest that there are a lot 
of members on the other side who are going to find out in two 
years that they cannot sell it in their constituency either. I am 
happy to opt out.
<P>
	Our party surprised the President of the Treasury Board when 
he made his big announcement and tried to put us in a very 
difficult position by either taking this overly generous plan or 
using the opt out provision where we get nothing. At least the 
members on my side of the House and my party said that if that is 
what the government is offering, we simply will not take it. We 
are opting out of this plan. We look after ourselves. We do not 
want anything, rather than put up with something that is 
obscene.
<P>
	If there is going to be an opt out provision, and I think that is a 
good way to go, why is it not extended from here on in to future 
members? The door is being closed very quickly. It is a window 
of opportunity for us, but it is certainly not a window of 
opportunity for any future members. There again it is out of the 
old bag of dirty tricks.
<P>
	What is the real issue here? The real issue is salary. I have 
heard it from numerous members on the other side of the House 
or from the Liberal benches. When we started talking about this 
MP pension plan, they said that is part of their pay, that they are 
not getting paid very well and that is how they compensate. It is 
a very poor method. If we want to talk salary in this House, let us 
be upfront and open with the Canadian public and talk salary. I 
have enough faith in the Canadian people that  they will do what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14004"> 14004 </A></B>
<P>
is right in terms of salary. I heard that during the last election 
campaign.
<P>
	What we have is a group over on the other side that are not 
prepared to be open and forthright with Canadians, so they bring 
around through the back door what they are not prepared to do 
through the front door. They bring in an MP pension plan that 
supplements their salary. We have seen other provisions where 
they have special privileges, and those privileges are not going 
to be accepted by the Canadian public.
<P>
	If it is really an issue of salary, let us get to that debate at some 
point and set an independent commission that can travel across 
the country and ask Canadians to tell us what an MP should be 
paid. I am prepared to live with the recommendations they 
make. Some people suggest they would say we should just pay 
the MP a dollar a year. That is nonsense. I have faith in the 
common sense of the common people. They have enough sense 
to elect members to this House and they expect those members 
to operate on the same premise they have to operate on. If they 
have to tighten their belts, they expect members of Parliament to 
tighten their belts.
<P>
	We are getting a lot of chatter from the other side. I think it is 
one of the career politicians we have generated in this House. 
That is the danger we have when we have these kinds of MP 
pension plans: we get career politicians, exactly the opposite of 
what the Canadian public wants.
<P>
	I have found in travelling in my riding and other parts of the 
country that the way most Canadian people would like to see 
their MP come forward to the role of MP in this House is to 
succeed at something else they have tried first. Whether it is a 
farmer, as I am, a businessman, whatever, they should have 
some type of successful career first and bring those experiences 
to this House. Unfortunately, with that carrot dangling, we have 
had a lot of the other type who have tried to make this a career 
which is a dangerous thing in itself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Just because you memorize the Standing Orders, 
it is not necessarily a job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
submit it is a dangerous thing to try to be a career politician. 
That particular type of member will do whatever is necessary to 
stay here and vote exactly the right way so that at some point 
down the road they will become a parliamentary secretary 
perhaps, and maybe even a cabinet minister. I think the 
government is really misdirected in that approach.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	I think the Canadian public wants to see a fair pension plan. I 
know it does not rate up there with the pension plans of 
university professors, but we did make a choice to come here; 
we did make a choice to run. I made a conscious choice that I 
was going to try to do something about reforming this MP 
pension plan.
<P>
	In the face of what we see today in this poor legislation, I have 
decided to contribute by opting out. I invite the members on the 
other side to do the same thing, until a reasonable pension plan 
can come into force in this House with a one for one contribution 
that is on a level with business and the public sector. Then I think 
we will have acceptance from the Canadian public, and that is 
the only time it should happen.
<P>
	Who will be the judges in the end? I submit it is not going to 
be the people in the House today. We can debate this for a long 
time. The ultimate judges are going to be the Canadian people in 
the next election. This is going to be an issue which is why I say 
this government is misdirected. I hope it will reconsider, but 
obviously it will not. It is trying to ram it through with time 
allocation. We will have to wait for the will of the Canadian 
people on the MP pension plan. I think we are going to see it 
expressed very loudly in 1997 or before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak in the dying moments of the 
debate on Bill C-85.
<P>
	I would consider this MP pension plan a political barometer. 
In the bill we have before us this government has an opportunity 
to establish its credibility, its sincerity. The message conveyed 
by the changes to be made to this pension plan is actually more 
important than the money involved. The message to the 
Canadian voters is: ``Are you listening? Do you understand the 
problem? And will you lead by example in doing something 
about this gold plated pension plan?'' Bill C-85 misses those 
marks by a country mile. It does not even come close.
<P>
	First we will talk about listening, listening to the Canadian 
voters, listening to the people who are paying our salaries. It was 
mentioned earlier that no single issue had a higher profile when I 
was campaigning. It continues to enjoy a high profile at my town 
hall meetings and as I speak around the province of Ontario. It is 
a flash point with the voters in Ontario and certainly right across 
Canada.
<P>
	This gold plated pension plan sends a message to the 
Canadian voters that we in this place do not understand what is 
going on in the real world. If the government has missed the 
message regarding Bill C-85, then what did it hear? Was there 
anything its members heard when they were campaigning and 
supposedly listening to the Canadian people?
<P>
	I suggest that Bill C-85 reinforces the fact that the 
government was tuned out; it was not listening but only paying 
lip service to the voters and giving them the changes they have 
been looking for. We have the problems of ever-increasing taxes 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14005"> 14005 </A></B>
<P>
lower levels of service. That is the situation the Canadian people 
want to have addressed. We have high levels of unemployed and 
underemployed people. I know many of us hear about the young 
people who find jobs they are overqualified for but they are 
taking whatever they can get because of the desperate situation 
they are in.
<P>
	Our people are concerned about unsafe streets and unsafe 
communities and they are worried about the deficit and the debt 
and our children's and grandchildren's future. They want a 
government that will do something to bring that overspending 
under control. This revision of the gold plated pension plan 
would indeed be leading by example in showing they understand 
the problem and they are prepared to deal with it.
<P>
	The other message is the voters wanted to have a voice in 
Ottawa. I think with 205 new members in the House we had a 
great opportunity to respond to some fresh thinking, a new 
vision.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Let us examine the old ways. They have not been working, and 
that is obvious when we look at the level of debt. It is obvious 
when we look at the state of our country as far as being united.
<P>
	I read the report of the Citizen's Forum on Canada's Future, 
better known as the Spicer commission. The commission went 
across Canada. It performed open soul surgery on 26 million 
Canadians to find out what the mood of the Canadian people 
was. The commission spoke to 400,000 Canadians, plus about 
another 300,000 elementary and secondary school children. 
Those are impressive numbers.
<P>
	Chapter 9 of the Spicer commission report deals with 
responsible leadership in participatory democracy. That was one 
of the strongest messages the commission received when 
travelling across Canada. The message was Canadians have lost 
faith in the political process and in their political leaders. The 
report was issued in June 1991 and that mood was there in 1993 
when we knocked on the doors seeking election to this place. At 
door after door the response I received was that I was another 
politician telling the people what they want to hear at the door, 
and then I would go to Ottawa and do exactly what I was told.
<P>
	We had a terrible example of that very thing on Wednesday in 
this place. Government members were being told not to vote. 
They were in the House but were not to register, not express 
opinion. It was unbelievable. That is democracy. That is elected 
officials doing their job, representing the people who sent them 
here to Ottawa. Whether they were to vote yea or nay, to be 
denied that opportunity was unbelievable. I was shocked as I am 
sure Canadians from coast to coast were shocked at what took 
place. I see the government is laughing at that comment. That is 
the arrogance it displays for the voters. It could care less.
<P>
	Pension reform was a critical message the government missed 
in getting to the Canadian people that it understands and wants 
to give the Canadian people a voice in Ottawa. We hear that the 
pension plan is all part of compensation, part of our pay 
package. It is the old trick of mixing apples with oranges; 
salaries and pension, gun control, law-abiding and criminals. 
We seem to have difficulty with the government in getting 
focused on what the real problem is.
<P>
	All Canadians want and all we should expect is a fair salary 
and a fair pension. This idea of trying to justify a gold plated 
pension plan because we have a lead salary does not wash. We 
have to deal with one issue at a time, making sure everything we 
are paid is above board and visible to all Canadians. If it is fair 
there will not be any problem with that. The Canadian people 
will accept it. That is not what is happening in this bill.
<P>
	The Ontario election was another strong message. MPP 
pensions were a big part of the common sense revolution 
platform. The common sense revolution identified that voters 
were fed up with pension plans far more generous than what is 
available in the private sector. The Tories responded to that and 
are eliminating their gold plated pension plan and introducing 
RRSPs, similar to what is available to Canadians from coast to 
coast.
<P>
	It is a flash point with the voters. Ontario responded to it. 
Prince Edward Island has responded to it. Alberta has responded 
to it and Manitoba has responded it. I cannot believe this 
message still has not been understood in Ottawa.
<P>
	Unbelievably this week few members in the House on the 
government side stood up and represented the people who sent 
them here, their constituents, the people who voted them into 
office.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	I was so dismayed when I read the Prime Minister praised 
those members who hewed the party line and scorned those 
members who stood up and represented the people who sent 
them to this place; an unbelievable display for the democratic 
process to scorn those members who stood up and did what they 
were voted into office to do. Whether you agree with what they 
did or not, they had every right to do that. Instead of that they 
were criticized, threatened, taken off committees. They will not 
have their papers signed next time: ``Buck your voters but do not 
buck me or you are gone''.
<P>
	We already know what happened. Three members were 
booted off their committees for doing what they were voted into 
office to do. We know what the message is. It was loud and clear 
right from the beginning and all Canadians were appalled at 
what happened here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14006"> 14006 </A></B>
<P>
	We should not have been surprised because we are dealing 
with a government and a Prime Minister who appointed 14 
candidates. Do members know why those 14 candidates were 
appointed? I quote the Prime Minister when he was in my riding: 
``You cannot always trust the Canadian voter to appoint the best 
candidate''. That says it all. That mistrust is still here and it was 
displayed this week.
<P>
	A cabinet minister had a dollars for contracts dinner. It flies in 
the face of restoring integrity, honesty and open government and 
nothing is done to that minister. People who represent their 
ridings are scorned. A minister is accepting dollars for 
contracts, and that is all right. It is unbelievable the double 
standard that exists here. Canadians are watching what is 
happening here and they are appalled. There is a price to be paid 
and it is coming.
<P>
	I wonder who the government is listening to. It is obviously 
not listening to the voters, to the polls. The polls are all showing 
this gold plated pension plan has to be changed. I do not think I 
have read anywhere in the media where there is any support for 
this plan.
<P>
	Let me quote from these polls because I think they are very 
indicative. A poll done by Environics showed 86 per cent of 
Canadians, 86 per cent of Liberals, say the plan is too generous; 
93 per cent of Canadians and 93 per cent of Liberals say 
fundamental MP pension reform must happen before social 
programs are touched; 88 per cent of Canadians and 85 per cent 
of Liberals say make the plan equal to the private plans; 93 per 
cent of Canadians and 91 per cent of Liberals say the MP plan 
should have the same limit on growth as the private sector plans; 
91 per cent of Canadians and 89 per cent of Liberals say 
collection should start at 65.
<P>
	Very clearly Liberals who were part of this poll were almost 
the same as Canadians from coast to coast. The government is 
not listening. I cannot recall an editorial supporting Bill C-85. 
The beauty was the Toronto <I>Star</I> and we all know where the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> is. It is quoted quite often. An editorial of February 
13 with the headline ``Pension puffery'' stated ``Our politicians 
get some of the best pensions in the world. They only have to 
work six years to qualify and the generous payments adjusted 
for inflation can last a lifetime. That is why Prime Minister Jean 
Chrétien's impassioned defence of underpaid MPs in the House 
of Commons last week offends-in both substance and timing''.
<P>
	We know where the Toronto <I>Star</I> is relative to the 
government. Even its paper is not supporting it. If it is not 
listening to the voters, not listening to the polls and not paying 
attention to the Toronto <I>Star</I>, to whom is it listening? Who is 
driving this agenda? I cannot believe this. There is something 
missing here.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired. The hon. 
government whip on a point of order.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe you would find 
unanimous consent that the vote to occur on private members' 
hour in the name of the hon. member for Red Deer on Monday, 
for second reading of Bill C-309, if a recorded division is 
requested on that item, be deferred until 11.30 p.m., at which 
time we will be taking other votes in the House and we would do 
that vote at the same time.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to participate in this debate 
because we need to straighten the record on some remarks made.
<P>
	We said in our red book, ``Creating Opportunity'', the Liberal 
plan for Canada, that the pension regime of members of 
Parliament has been the focus of considerable controversy. We 
said we wanted to ensure reform took place. We also said we 
would use an independent review and that a Liberal government 
would reform the pension plan of members of Parliament to end 
double dipping, MPs should not be able to leave office and 
receive a pension from the federal government if they accept a 
new full time paying job from the federal government, and we 
would review the question of the minimum age at which MP 
pensions will begin to be paid.
<P>
	The commitment of the government and the Liberal caucus to 
reform pensions has been unwavering. We have brought this to 
the House. These were promises we made and these are promises 
we have kept. As promised, the Liberal plan will do what we said 
it was to do, eliminate the practice of double dipping, introduce 
a new minimum age requirement for receipt of the pension, 55, 
reduce the government's contribution to the pension plan by 
one-third, saving taxpayers $3.3 million in the first year.
<P>
	Those reforms are significant. Reforms members across the 
way should keep in mind. Pension benefits earned by all MPs 
will be reduced by 20 per cent. All MPs earning pension benefits 
will be affected by the accrual rate of benefit reduction.
<P>
	Several statements made in the House are erroneous and the 
discussion has gone beyond the pension plan to a whole series of 
issues which do not have specific significance to this debate.
<P>
	The Prime Minister stated over and over after the review that 
we knew in comparison to other occupations, MPs are not paid 
for the job they do, the work they commit to and the assignments 
they take on. The Prime Minister also pointed to the comparison 
between what we do as members of Parliament and other people 
who are public office holders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14007"> 14007 </A></B>
<P>
	In looking at the topic of integrity the Liberal Party has 
nothing to worry about and we should not be taking lessons from 
the Reform Party. It is often hypocrisy to listen to the mouthings 
on the way procedures are laid out in Bill C-85 and what we are 
attempting to do in this pension reform. It is also important for 
the opposition to note the changes we have made and to stand 
with the government in support of these changes.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The bill went further than the red book commitment to reduce 
government spending on MPs' pensions. It has gone to 33 per 
cent. I do not hear any talk across the way about that reduction 
and that saving to the Canadian public. I do not hear discussion 
across the way about the lowering of the age. I do not hear any 
discussion across the way about significant measures that are 
savings to the Canadian public.
<P>
	I do not hear discussion across the way about the fact that we 
have done away with double dipping. I do not hear any 
discussion across the way that speaks to some very positive 
elements. I do not hear discussion across the way that would 
take us back to the earlier pension plan of the 1950s, the 1960s, 
the 1970s or the changes that the government is making in order 
to meet our present fiscal needs and to ensure that our pensions 
are in line with other public pensions and other private plans.
<P>
	It is one thing to stand in the House and constantly berate the 
government and make grand statements of political and 
ideological positions. It is important for members to know what 
they are doing, what the government is attempting to do for the 
taxpayer to ensure we save tax dollars.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> We are keeping our promise.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> We are definitely keeping our promise 
because we said we would do this.
<P>
	What are the existing provisions and what are the provisions 
we are proposing? It is important for the party across to see 
where we are presently and where we hope to be with the bill. We 
are calling for their support because we feel that lowering the 
minimum age, taking out double dipping, ensuring the accrual 
rate, will make the pension plan a far better one than it is 
presently.
<P>
	We also spoke to the option of coverage. The members across 
the way have that option available to them and at the same time 
they are asking for a review of the remuneration on a yearly 
basis. They are talking about a time period in which they can opt 
out and they are not really taking the opportunity to use the 
60-day period.
<P>
	Members of the House of Commons will now pay 9 per cent of 
their salaries per year toward their pension plan, rather than the 
current rate of 11 per cent. This reduction reflects the reduction 
in the pension accrual rate.
<P>
	This is a good bill, a good way in which to proceed, to ensure 
we meet the needs of the public, to ensure we save taxpayer 
dollars, to ensure we reform the plan as we said in the red book. 
We call on all members to support the motions and to ensure the 
bill gets through the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I am sorry to rise again, but 
apparently there has been a change on the Order Paper. The bill 
to which I referred when I sought unanimous consent earlier is in 
fact a different one. The principle is identical.
<P>
	However, I now ask for unanimous consent:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That any recorded division requested on Bill C-295, if such a recorded 
division is sought, be held on Monday at 11.30 p.m.; rather than the normal time 
which would be approximately noon.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I stand to speak to Bill C-85, the great pension debate; 
with a little trepidation. I confess some varied emotions.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not think anyone in the House would say this debate 
necessarily brings out the best in people on both sides of the 
table. We are talking about something which is visceral and 
deeply personal. As members know, we are talking about how 
much money eventually winds up in our pockets. When people's 
pockets are threatened directly, it tends to bring out very 
visceral feelings. We have seen evidence of that over recent 
days.
<P>
	As colleagues know, as a member of the Reform Party and 
caucus, I have decided to opt out of the pension plan. Before 
anybody puts angel wings on me, it is important for people to 
know that it is not that big a deal for me because if I did not opt 
out, I could not get elected dog catcher in my constituency. This 
is a fairly important issue in the ridings.
<P>
	If I may, I would like to quote from an article in the Edmonton 
<I>Journal</I> written by Barbara Yaffe, June 3 of this year. She puts it 
very succinctly and very well:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Because beyond the cosy bounds of Parliament Hill there's quite a bit of 
pension passion. The consensus is that Bill C-85 stinks. If the bill passes, 
taxpayers, who might not mind a system of matching contributions, will pay 
$3.88 for every $1 an MP contributes. (Formerly taxpayers paid $5.75.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She goes on to say that the most cynical feature of the pension 
plan, and this is the feature of this bill which I personally find 
most offensive, is its mean spirited nature. I can understand the 
Liberal government's motivation in making this mean spirited 
because it wants to break the Reform ranks and have its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14008"> 14008 </A></B>
<P>
members not opt out of the pension. Then at the next election 
they would be able to go door to door and say, ``Wait a minute. 
We are not so bad. Look at those sanctimonious Reformers. 
Some of them stayed in the plan as well.''
<P>
	The fly in the ointment is that all Reformers have opted out or 
have indicated they will opt out of the pension. It is going to 
make it very difficult for our Liberal colleagues to be knocking 
on doors in the next election and explaining why they voted 
themselves a pension that was disproportionate to those held by 
anyone else and at the same time were so mean spirited in trying 
to get us to reverse our position.
<P>
	That is politics. I can understand that. Most Canadians are fair 
minded. Most Canadians would be very happy if members of 
Parliament had matching contributions. It would be so simple to 
say, just like in the private sector, that members of Parliament 
will pay this much of the pension and the government, the 
employer, will pay this much, put it into RRSPs and forget about 
it.
<P>
	This pension plan really strikes the note of dissonance 
between elected politicians and the people. One of the reasons I 
became involved in politics was to try to restore the bonds of 
trust between the elected and the electors. I thought that the 35th 
Parliament with 200 rookies would be a prime mover in this.
<P>
	The best way to do that is to provide leadership by example. 
Leadership starts at the top. We cannot have two sets of rules, 
one set for everybody else and one set for us. It is not just the 
pension thing. It is in the way we treat our salaries in general.
<P>
	Canadians do not mind that we be paid reasonably or even that 
we be paid well. What Canadians do not understand is why we 
should have tax free allowances, why we should have that bonus. 
Before I came to the House I ran my own business. I supplied 
receipts for everything I did. As members of Parliament why do 
we not provide receipts for everything that we do? Why is it that 
when government employees take a plane anywhere they get $25 
taxis on both ends of the trip without having to provide receipts?
<P>
	This pension issue really is a flashpoint for Canadians who, as 
reported by Statistics Canada, have not had an increase in real 
income for 10 years. Most Canadians feel like they are on a 
treadmill. No matter how hard they walk and no matter how fast 
they run, they do not get anywhere.
<P>
	The reason they do not get anywhere is because of the 
incredible burden of taxation required by the federal, provincial 
and municipal governments which have spent so much more 
than they have earned over recent years. Over 30 per cent of 
every dollar that comes in goes to pay the debt on money already 
spent.
<P>
	It is like buying groceries on a credit card, consuming them 
and then having to pay the bill. Canadians in general feel like 
they are on a treadmill and those who were elected in a role of 
leadership do not lead by example. That breaks the bond of trust 
between the elected and the electors.
<P>
	This is a sacred fiduciary duty which we have been given by 
the people who sent us here. I would ask my colleagues opposite 
to please reconsider.

	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today, I would like to congratulate the University of Ottawa for a 
remarkable fund-raising campaign. Through its Vision 
campaign, the university raised $38.6 million, which was much 
more than the university's objective.
<P>
	This campaign will allow the University of Ottawa to remain a 
leader in the area of teaching and research.
<P>
	In more concrete terms, it has enabled the university to begin 
construction of the first phase of a new building for the Arts 
Faculty, D'Iorio Hall, which will be devoted to research in the 
pure sciences and the neurosciences research institute.
<P>
	The campaign also raised close to $9 million that will be used 
to endow chairs, as well as for centres of excellence and 
institutes, and over $1.5 million for scholarships and student 
financial aid. In addition, this campaign was an excellent 
opportunity for the University of Ottawa to forge new 
partnerships with industry and the business world.
<P>
	Once again, congratulations to all who contributed to the 
success of this campaign and long life to the University of 
Ottawa.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the G-7 summit in Halifax gives us another 
example of Canadian federalism. Although French is, in fact, 
totally absent from the summit site, the Leader of the Govern-

ment in the House said yesterday that Canada projected ``the 
image of a bilingual country''.
<P>
	This image came into sharp focus during a press conference 
by a Japanese official. Faced with the reporters' stupefaction 
when he started his presentation in French, he continued in 
English, explaining that he thought Canada was a bilingual 
country. The people of Quebec have had enough of this veneer of 
bilingualism, which does not respect the Canadian reality and 
does not even keep up appearances any more.
<P>
	The person who said that the summit was not held in Quebec 
City because the separatist mayor of that city had not put a 
Canadian flag over city hall did not even notice that the mayor of 
Halifax had not done so either.
<P>
	Again, the Prime Minister is clearly showing his 
inconsistency and contempt for the French fact in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of the Environment has a bill before 
the House which would ban the octane enhancer MMT from 
Canadian gasoline. She says that since the United States EPA 
has banned it, Canada should follow suit.
<P>
	This week the United States District Court of Appeals issued a 
mandate ordering the EPA to grant a waiver to permit the use of 
MMT in unleaded gasoline in the United States. The court found 
that MMT does not cause or contribute to the failure of any 
emission control device or system.
<P>
	The industry minister has added that the key to banning MMT 
in Canada is to create a uniformity of standards between the U.S. 
and Canada. Now with the U.S. on the verge of reintroducing 
MMT, Canada again will be on the opposite side.
<P>
	The government is too stubborn to initiate third party tests 
which would show one way or another whether MMT is 
hazardous to our automobiles, our health and our environment. 
It works now to make things cleaner. The Minister of the 
Environment has shown that she is swayed by political lobbies 
rather than scientific evidence.

the Stratford Central Secondary School environmental club.
<P>
	Environment Canada and the Stratford Central Secondary 
School club have been working together as partners on an 
environmental education project. Through the environmental 
partners fund the federal government has invested $5,400 in this 
project.
<P>
	This partnership has resulted in the development of a 
Carolinian forest ecosystem, an area of rich biodiversity that 
represents Stratford's natural heritage. The forest will serve as 
an example of community action, a piece of natural heritage, 
and an educational tool for students.
<P>
	During the developmental stages of the project various 
stakeholders and community members worked together to plan 
and plant the ecosystem. These partners include the Stratford 
Parks Department, Lawson Killer Insurance Ltd., Canada Trust, 
Stratford Rotary Club, the city of Stratford, the Stratford civic 
beautification and environmental awareness committee and 
most important, the students of Stratford Central Secondary 
School. All of them were partners with Environment Canada in 
this outstanding project.

Speaker, I would like to give special recognition to the many 
volunteers in Etobicoke-Lakeshore who donate their time and 
energy for the benefit of our community.
<P>
	In particular, I would like to commend the efforts of Tamara 
Cooper, Jo Matson and R. J. Welsh, recipients of the 1995 
volunteer of the year award. These individuals are among over 
13 million Canadians who care for children, visit the sick, 
organize special events, serve on local boards or committees, or 
bring attention to important issues affecting Canadians.
<P>
	The value and importance of voluntarism cannot be 
underestimated. It factors into our gross domestic product 
contributing 191 hours per volunteer per year of non-paid work, 
the equivalent of an estimated $12 billion wage bill or 617,000 
full time positions. While the country gains tremendously from 
the charity of volunteers, voluntarism also enables individuals 
to acquire and sharpen skills in today's highly competitive job 
market.
<P>
	At this time I would like to welcome to Ottawa individuals 
from the Lakeshore Immigrant Aid Centre who play an 
important part in our community's volunteer sector.

their knowledge of Canada by working in the offices of members

opportunity to learn more about Canada's unique political 
structure and distinct cultural identity, while fostering

Programs such as these facilitate that development.

from the services of these outstanding interns, I would like to 
thank them for their hard work and dedication and wish them the 
best of luck in their futures.

Dial-A-Life Housing Corporation on the official opening today 
of its second housing project for people of native ancestry.
<P>
	These individuals are five times more likely to develop 
serious kidney problems than other Canadians. Due to a lack of 
health care services on reserves they have to travel to urban 
health centres for dialysis treatment. The Dial-A-Life project 
will meet their needs during treatment in Winnipeg.
<P>
	I salute the Dial-A-Life Housing Corporation under the 
leadership of Mrs. Winnie Giesbrecht for its hard work, 
voluntarism and dedication to seeing that its projects are 
initiated, developed and managed by persons of native ancestry. 
Their dedication is a source of pride for the Winnipeg North

top of this the government is now under pressure to provide $570 
million in the form of a subsidy to the international 
thermonuclear experimental project, otherwise called ITER, a 
nuclear fusion megaproject.
<P>
	I urge the government to turn down this subsidy request in 
keeping with the promise made in the last budget not to finance 
megaprojects. So far the nuclear industry has been subsidized by 
Ottawa to the tune of over $5 billion. Canadians can no longer 
afford to subsidize megaprojects.

particularly when compared to the about-face by the Minister of

of heart in the past.
<P>
	By calling this offer an unacceptable proposal, the new 
passionaria of the status quo, as she is rightly called today by 
Lise Bissonnette, is displaying intellectual dishonesty. Not only 
does the minister reject the offer contained in the Allaire report, 
which she supported, she also thinks Quebecers are stupid.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canadian government says it is concerned about the situation of 
the peacekeepers held hostage in Bosnia and about the 
confrontations between the Serbs and the Muslims. Canada's 
position remains unclear on the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia, particularly with regard to participation in the rapid 
reaction force.
<P>
	Would the Minister of National Defence bring us up to date on 
the situation of the 12 Canadians held hostage in Bosnia and the 
800 peacekeepers confined to their camp without any possibility 
of leaving, it appears, as fighting intensifies on the outskirts of 
Visoko?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I should 
point out that 699 soldiers remain on the base at Visoko. They 
are in good shape. Their safety is not at risk, but Muslim forces 
do block access to the camp.
<P>
	In addition, 115 members of our team are at Kiseljak with 
British and other forces. There is no problem, and movement is 
not restricted. Unfortunately, we also have 11 soldiers at Ilijas. 
We are very concerned about their safety, because of the 
concentration of Muslim forces. This is the reason I strongly 
registered our objection with the Bosnian Serb authorities in a 
meeting this week with the chargé d'affaires of the Yugoslav 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with the 
UN Security Council ratifying the establishment of a rapid 
reaction force of 12,500 this morning, could the Minister of 
National Defence now tell us once and for all whether Canada 
intends to participate in this force?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister raised this matter in Halifax and the final 
decision is up to him. We need assurances on the command and 
control of this force and on all the other factors related to 
deployment. The decision to take part or not should be made 
today or over the weekend, therefore soon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
we would agree that all Canadians are eager to find out what sort 
of commitment the government will end up making in this 
difficult matter.
<P>
	By continuing to fight in Bosnia, the Bosnian Serbs and the 
Muslims have clearly rejected the formal warning of the G-7 
last night. What new initiative does Canada plan to propose to 
its G-7 partners and to the Russian President, who are meeting 
in Halifax today, in order to resolve the continuing impasse in 
Bosnia?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
night the Prime Minister said on behalf of the G-7 leaders that 
the only way out of this very difficult situation is to reopen 
negotiations for the parties to come to some kind of an 
agreement.
<P>
	The international community has protested very strongly the 
actions that have gone on with the hostage taking and also with 
the build-up of the forces of the Bosnian federation. This matter 
is of grave concern and will be the subject of discussion 
throughout the day.
<P>
	With respect to what we can do at the moment, given the fact 
that our people are there not as belligerents but as peacekeepers, 
we are concerned that they take all precautions at the base in 
Visoko to minimize any damage should any artillery or any 
other type of shelling occur. It is to that end that extra 
fortifications have been erected and precautions have been taken 
by the commander, Colonel Redburn.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	I am pretty confident that the people in Visoko, although we 
do not accept the situation at all, will be fine and are not in any 
immediate danger. I continue to be preoccupied with the safety 
of the 11 people detained in Ilijas because of the growing 
conflict in and around that town and the fact that the Bosnian 
federation has said they want to liberate Sarajevo and that town 
is between the concentration of forces and Sarajevo.
<P>
	I also want to add that we remain concerned about Captain 
Rechner but we have had information over the last few days that 
he is okay and is near the Bosnian Serb capital of Pale.

possible to bring the conclusions of the inquiry to the attention

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one 
year ago today the Prime Minister rose in this House and gave a 
stern speech about earning public trust and restoring political 
integrity. He said that both were vital to democracy and were 
more than just nice words.
<P>
	Twelve months later this Prime Minister's speech rings 
hollow. We have seen a heritage minister defended, even 
applauded, for dishing out departmental contracts as a reward 
for political donations. We have seen $26 million diverted to a 
tourist highway in the public works minister's own riding. We 
have seen the revenue minister's campaign workers lining up for 
patronage appointments in B.C.
<P>
	Canadians expected as much from Brian Mulroney. They 
demanded more from this government.
<P>
	Why has the government turned its back on the Prime 
Minister's words of only one year ago, abused the public's trust, 
and abandoned political integrity?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in spite of the unfounded innuendo of my hon. friend, 
the facts of the matter are that this government treats matters of 
ethics and integrity very seriously and gives them a high degree 
of priority.
<P>
	We have great confidence in the way we are responding to 
what the Prime Minister said a year ago. Those words remain as 
valid today as they were a year ago.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me refer again to the Prime Minister's speech.
<P>
	He promised to give a meaningful voice to elected 
representatives in the House and end the politics of cronyism 
and secret back door deals. I am sure that is cold comfort to the 
one dozen Liberal dissidents soon to be punished, cold comfort 
to the police officers in B.C. who have to deal with incompetent 
Liberal appointments, and cold comfort to the people of 
Wentworth Valley who have to travel along the deadly highway 
104.
<P>
	What has happened to this government's promise of giving a 
meaningful voice to MPs, ending the politics of cronyism, and 
ending secret backroom deals? They made the promise and 
broke it. Why?
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have kept that promise, as we have kept generally 
the promises on which we campaigned.
<P>
	Just to take the example of the role of MPs, we changed the 
rules of the House to enable measures to be sent to committees 
before second reading to enable members to play a bigger role in 
committees in the development of legislation.
<P>
	We changed the rules of the House so that committees could 
develop legislation. That was done for the first time in the 
history of the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	We are also treating Private Members' Business, measures 
presented by members individually, on a free vote basis in every 
case, something never before done in the history of Parliament.
<P>
	Instead of being blinded by her own innuendoes and 
prejudices, the hon. member should look at the facts and 
recognize the achievements of the government.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, they 
say they have generally kept them, but specifically 
backbenchers are being nailed one by one the minute they open 
their mouths.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that he sets the moral tone for the 
government, and he certainly has. He has ignored the federal 
code of ethics, sidelined the ethics counsellor and has broken 
red book promises, all in the name of party loyalty and political 
expediency.
<P>
	I guess we should not be surprised. In 1983 the current Prime 
Minister defended Alastair Gillespie, a former energy minister 
who had received financial favours from the Trudeau 
government. Twelve years later the Prime Minister dusted off 
<I>Hansard</I>, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14017"> 14017 </A></B>
<P>
spiced up the rhetoric and gave the same speeches in defence of 
the heritage minister about ethical behaviour.
<P>
	Will the government revive its promise to restore integrity in 
government and demand the resignation of the minister of 
heritage?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that promise remains valid. It is being carried out.
<P>
	There is one interesting thing about the hon. member's 
questions. They show that she on behalf of her party and her 
party are totally satisfied with the way we are handling the 
economy. They show that she and her party are totally satisfied 
with the way we are handling the reform of social programs. 
They show that they are totally satisfied with the way we are 
handling our relations with other countries.
<P>
	Because of the way she chose the priority of questions in the 
House on behalf of her party, she is doing nothing more than 
giving a general endorsement of the work of the government and 
we appreciate that endorsement.

	It seems Immigration Canada has retained the services of 
Philippe Rayntjens as an expert witness during the proceedings

The House will recall that Mr. Mugesera was a friend and 
adviser of the former president who was responsible for the 
genocide in Rwanda.
<P>

retained the services of Mr. Rayntjens who, like Mr. Mugesera,

Rwanda?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary

Unfortunately, since the case is now under investigation, we

<P>
	The heritage minister has broken these conflict of interest 
guidelines no less than four times: first when he intervened for a

DTH policy for friends in Power Corp; third when he lunched 
with the Bronfmans in L.A.; and again when he held a dollars for

allegations in the premise of the hon. member's question.
<P>
	Second, the Prime Minister has said that in a parliamentary 
system he has to take the ultimate responsibility for his cabinet 
and he cannot evade that responsibility. While he has carried out 
his promise to appoint an ethics counsellor, he still has to carry 
out the responsibility which is that of a Prime Minister in a

Speaker, last April, the Bloc Quebecois denounced the flagrant 
inequity to Quebec in the awarding of professional and special 
contracts by the Department of Justice. Let me remind you that 
the value of contracts awarded to Ontario entrepreneurs is 15 
times higher than that of contracts awarded to Quebec 
entrepreneurs. In his written response to Bloc members, the 
Minister of Justice confirmed our allegations.
<P>
	Given that only 5 per cent of the value of Department of 
Justice research contracts is awarded to Quebec entrepreneurs 
and that only 1 per cent of contracts are in French, does the 
minister acknowledge that this situation is totally unacceptable 
and should be rectified as soon as possible?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have furnished a 
written response to the hon. member's party answering 
questions put in the House during the past several months about 
the statistical breakdown of the awarding of contracts across the 
country.
<P>
	The evidence shows that those contracts are distributed to 
various provinces and the number is disclosed by the letters that 
I have delivered. The numbers suggested by the hon. member 
are more or less correct.
<P>
	As I have also said, there are many factors that determine to 
whom a contract is awarded. Sometimes these things are for 
specialized purposes or research to be done by individuals with 
particular knowledge.
<P>
	In any event, I have also made it clear in my letter that the 
awarding of contracts based on language is strictly in 
accordance with the principles of fairness. I will look again at 
the whole process to ensure that those principles are being 
complied with absolutely.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr.

figures. We say 5 per cent, while the minister says 6 per cent. As 
for the 1 per cent of contracts awarded to Quebec entrepreneurs, 
let us admit that it could hardly be any less.
<P>
	Given that most Department of Justice contracts are awarded 
directly without tender by department officials and taking into 
account, I imagine, the minister's obvious authority over the 
awarding of contracts, can the minister make a commitment to 
issue and make public clear directives designed to ensure that a

funding to highway 104 where it belongs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of Transport today I think this 
question demonstrates perhaps as well as any just exactly how 
ethically challenged the Reform Party is.
<P>
	The reality is that the issue raised by the hon. member is one 
in which a decision was made by the responsible level of 
government in an entirely transparent and open way. To try to 
suggest that this is an ethical question implies that somebody 
improperly benefited in a personal or pecuniary way from the 
awarding of a contract. That is not the case at all.
<P>
	There was a political issue. It was debated openly in the 
province of Nova Scotia. The decision was made close to the 
people affected by it and the political consequences will be 
faced. That is not an ethical question; that is a political one.
<P>
	By trying to move political questions into the realm of ethics 
we can see why the hon. member has a basic misunderstanding 
of what the process of government is all about. Ethics deal with 
the propriety, the transparency and the openness of a decision 
making process. What in fact the member complains about is the 
decision that was taken at the provincial level close to the 
people.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> We have listened to preambles almost three 
minutes long. Therefore it is appropriate to have a long 
response.
<P>
	The issue being debated in this question is one which lies at 
the provincial level. To try to turn it into an ethical question in 
the House shows the lack of understanding on the part of the 
member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we certainly 
would not want to have political questions impinging on the 
question of ethics, would we?
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that his government would serve all 
Canadians and not just the privileged few. Tonight, the mayor of 
Amherst, Cumberland-Colchester councillors, business people 
and ordinary citizens are pulling together to send a common 
message: Give the money back.
<P>
	Let us be very clear. Is the government telling these people 
that they are wrong and that there is nothing wrong with what the 
minister of public works has done?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the problem the member has is that he has to deal with 
the framework of law.
<P>
	There is the strategic highway improvement program 
agreement between the province of Nova Scotia and the 
Government of Canada. The determination of issues related to 
the allocation of resources under that agreement is very clearly 
provided for.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> So what do you say to the mayor?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> The mayor needs to address the proper level of 
government, the province of Nova Scotia, where the decision 
was made in a way that was very transparent and open. If there is 
disagreement in the province of Nova Scotia with the people 
responsible at that level then that is the proper place for the 
debate to occur.
<P>
	They are not only ethically challenged, but they seem to have 
difficulty listening as well. I do not understand why the Reform 
Party has such difficulty focusing on the division of powers 
between the federal and provincial governments in this matter.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr.

Consequently, we have to wait. There is a process, at the

That process is under way, and no decision has yet been made.

question of the rapid reaction force and Canada's participation 
in it. We certainly believe that force should have been set up. 
Canada supported it at the NATO meeting a few weeks ago.
<P>
	The Prime Minister will be reflecting on whether or not it is in 
not only the best interests of Canada but the best interests of the 
UN if we participate in that force, as to whether or not even a 
small contribution would make a difference. Also, we are 
concerned about further  implicating ourselves in that particular 
crisis with larger numbers of people. We have 2,100 people in 
the conflict.
<P>
	All of these things are being reflected upon. As for the peace 
process at the moment, it may be true that no formal 
negotiations are going on between the parties, but as was said 
last night on behalf of the G-7 leaders, and I think everyone in

	Yesterday, the Minister of Industry stated here in the House 
that he intended to review DIPP next year. For the first time, the 
minister appeared open to the opposition's arguments that the 
ability of Canadian and Quebec companies in the defence and 
aerospace industry to develop technology must not be eroded.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that we urgently need to re-establish 
DIPP budgets, in order to keep our aerospace industry as 
competitive as it currently is with foreign companies, which are 
heavily subsidized by their governments for the research and 
marketing of their products?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I believe that the hon. member is very aware of my 
reluctance to subsidize private enterprise. I believe that the best 
economic strategy is to avoid subsidies. This is not only 
advisable here in Canada, but also for all of the world's 
governments.
<P>
	I accept what he said, and I agree with him that indeed there 
are other countries which subsidize the aerospace industry. This 
is one of the issues that we have to take into consideration when 
reviewing DIPP. He will also understand that the government is 
obliged to take its fiscal framework into consideration. I am 
ready to work with him and the aerospace industry and other 
sectors which are developing new technologies to try to find a 
new way of making them competitive with other countries of the 
world.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my next question contains a solution for the minister, 
so I would ask him to give me his full attention.
<P>
	Since the Quebec Minister of Industry is planning to put a 
program similar to the federal government's DIPP in place, will 
the minister commit to entering into an agreement with the 
Government of Quebec to put in place an overall conversion 
plan for the defence industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, firstly, I believe that the hon. member is also  well 
aware that the federal government and the Government of 
Quebec already have an agreement on industrial projects and 
that we really work well together. Take Bell Helicopter for 
example. We found a way to stimulate the development of 
technology in high tech companies in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I would also note that today, despite the enthusiasm of my 
Quebec counterpart, Moody's has stated that it is aware of the 
problems the Government of Quebec is having with its budget. I 
think that it might be a good idea for Quebec to find a way to 
regain the international markets' confidence. To do this, they 
would have to do two things: one, concentrate on their budget 
problems, and two, finally reverse the loss of confidence caused 
by the separatist policy proposed by this party and the 
Government of Quebec.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INFLATION">INFLATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
advise the Liberal House leader that we are concerned about the 
Liberal budget. This morning we got the disturbing news that 
inflation has risen for the fifth consecutive month some 15-fold 
to 2.9 per cent. That is a concern.
<P>
	The only sure way to fight rising inflation is to raise the 
interest rates. However, unless interest rates are lowered, and 
fast, Canada will likely go into a recession.
<P>
	My question is for the minister of financial institutions. What 
is the government's priority at this time, to contain inflation and 
thereby risk a recession, or to stimulate the economy and 
thereby risk runaway inflation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, fortunately there 
are more than two choices.
<P>
	I think the hon. member should analyse the inflation numbers 
a little better. The 2.9 per cent is well within our target range of 
inflation. If he looks at the recent history of the Bank of Canada 
he will find that interest rates have fallen recently and that those 
numbers are well below budget projections.
<P>
	I would also like to remind the hon. member that if we are 
going to have continuing inflation in the country it has to be 
pressured by wages. The wage increases in the country have 
been very subdued, very low, which indicates that future 
inflation will not be out of hand but rather will be very low as 
well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister well knows that inflation is now hitting the top of the 
government's target. It is not within the range, it is hitting the 
top. It is time for the government to be concerned.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister for financial institutions this 
question. The Government of Ontario has decided to lower its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14022"> 14022 </A></B>
<P>
revenue projections by some $2 billion because of the slowdown 
in economic growth.  What is the government doing within the 
federal Liberal budget at this time to adjust to the slowdown in 
economic growth?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased 
to answer the hon. member's question.
<P>
	Our budget projections were based on very prudent economic 
assumptions. They were also based on the holding of some 
reserves. Our budget projections are well within reason.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	With interest rates being substantially lower than our budget 
projections it seems much more likely we will come in with a 
better budget deficit rather than a higher one.

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
the Environment.
<P>
	Last week was environment week and we asked Canadians as 
individuals and in business to focus on the environment and to 
assist with its clean up. Canadians expect us to lead by example.
<P>
	What is our minister doing to clean up the operations of our 
own government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government is moving in four key areas in response 
to red book commitments.
<P>
	It is creating the post of commissioner of the environment and 
sustainable development through Bill C-83, which is going 
through the House now, which will enable the commissioner to 
monitor sustainable development strategies on behalf of all the 
ministries.
<P>
	The government has proclaimed the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act, making all department projects subject to 
assessment. The ministers of finance and the environment 
created a task force on economic instruments whose 
recommendations will be looked at with regard to the 1996 
budget.
<P>
	All the various departments of government are now trying to 
green their operations. Through the building initiatives of 
Natural Resources Canada we are now retrofitting buildings for 
energy savings, giving huge savings in addition to benefiting the 
environment. In the inland centre in Burlington we are to save 
$590,000 a year in addition to protecting the environment.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Indian Affairs. The Voisey 
Bay deposit in Labrador, which promises to be one of the richest 
in Canada and more important for Newfoundland than the 
Hibernia Project, is located on lands claimed by the Innu. The 
federal government and the Government of Newfoundland 
suspended negotiations on land claims during the very month 
the deposit was discovered.
<P>
	Can the minister give the Innu guarantees that the federal 
government will do everything in its power to settle the land 
claims before the start of mining operations in Voisey Bay?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, about three weeks ago I met 
with Premier Wells in St. John's. This was the main topic of 
discussion. The premier wants to have the negotiations ongoing. 
What is being done there is important not only for the 
Government of Newfoundland but for Newfoundlanders as a 
whole, including aboriginal people.
<P>
	This is ongoing; it will be done. It is tremendous for both 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador that they have found such resources at Voisey Bay.

British Columbians should expect a long, hot summer of 
blockades, quoting Shuswap band leader Ken Dennis.
<P>
	Mr. Dennis says blockades will continue because they 
work-surprise, surprise. Now we have professional 
consultants, advisers and participants for roving native 
blockades.
<P>
	Can the minister assure British Columbians he will commit to 
consistently involving himself in these disputes rather than 
passing the buck to the province?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a rare thing has happened in 
the House which all members now see. Where do we get the 
blockades? In B.C. where there are so many Reform members.
<P>
	The hon. member today talked about trust and speaking for all 
Canadians, not just a privileged few. It is about time Reform 
takes some of its own advice.

	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	Senator Jessie Helms and others in the United States continue 
to attack Canadians for carrying on perfectly legitimate 
business activities in Cuba. They threaten actions that violate 
basic principles of international law, undermine trading rules 
they have argued for and act as if they have the right to dictate 
conduct to all countries in the western hemisphere.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	What is the government doing to tell the American 
government it does not decide where Canadians go, what we do 
and that our perfectly legitimate business activities are our 
concern and not its?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the 
statement of my colleague.
<P>
	The government is already on record as communicating with 
the American administration our opposition to the Helms bill. 
We will continue through the proper channels both through the 
World Trade Organization and through NAFTA to deal with this 
issue. It is our hope that whatever resolution will come out of it 
will be in the best interests of Canadian businesses.
<P>
	The American administration is already on record as having 
some concerns with reference to the Helms legislation. That is 
very encouraging. It is our hope this bill will go down the tubes.

	The House resumed from June 15 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-70, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Income 
Tax Application Rules and related acts, be read the third time 
and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we are in third reading of 
Bill C-70. As I outlined when I spoke previously, the intention 
of my speech is to encourage the House to accept the final 
reading of this in the House of Commons as quickly as possible 
and to outline in a very factual way what the act intends to to do. 
It is related to the budget of 1994. This is one of two bills that 
deal with the amendments to the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	In addition to what I outlined previously in the House, new 
rules are provided for debt securities that are not required to be 
marked to market. These rules deal with the measurement of 
income while the securities are held and the treatment of gains 
and losses on disposition.
<P>
	Bill C-70 also amends the rules for the taxation of resident 
shareholders of foreign affiliates. This action is being taken as a 
result of the government's ongoing monitoring of developments 
in this area. The changes expand the categories of income of 
foreign affiliates that must be reported as income of their 
Canadian affiliates. Another modification prevents the use of an 
affiliate's foreign active business losses to reduce Canadian 
shareholders' income. This change also protects the Canadian 
tax base. The amendments are generally effective for taxation 
years commencing after 1994.
<P>
	There are also a number of measures that were announced 
after the 1994 budget. These include six new tax measures that I 
would like to outline briefly.
<P>
D (1220) 
<P>
	First, this bill addresses the issue of eligible prepaid funeral 
and cemetery arrangements. Under this legislation individuals 
making such arrangements will not have to declare interest on 
their deposits up to a  $15,000 maximum contribution as 
income, provided the deposit is not withdrawn for other 
purposes. The provider of eligible funeral and cemetery 
arrangements is, however, required to include in income the 
total amount received from an eligible arrangement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14026"> 14026 </A></B>
<P>
	Turning to the next measure, the bill proposes that real estate 
trusts with publicly traded units be allowed to qualify as mutual 
fund trusts. This measure responds to representations from the 
real estate sector, which is interested in expanding the available 
methods of financing real estate. We believe the proposed 
change will facilitate the restructuring and refinancing of this 
sector.
<P>
	The third of these post-budget measures is a measure that will 
help mutual funds to reduce overhead costs and improve 
services to investors. These amendments will allow mutual fund 
corporations to convert to mutual fund trusts on a tax free basis 
and also allow tax free mergers of mutual fund trusts.
<P>
	This bill also proposes new rules to speed the resolution of 
objections and appeals, particularly by large corporations. 
Large corporations will now have to specify the issues under 
dispute, the amount of relief sought, and the facts and reasons 
for objecting. The rules also limit the ability of large 
corporations to raise new issues in a notice of objection where 
the objection relates to reconsideration of an assessment. 
However, new issues raised by Revenue Canada on such 
reconsiderations may still give rise to a notice of objection.
<P>
	In addition, the legislation will ensure that the new 
requirements relating to the notices of objection will not apply 
to assessments that have been appealed to courts before this 
legislation receives royal assent.
<P>
	The final measure I want to highlight deals with the tax 
treatment of dividend compensation payments and other 
amounts connected with securities lending.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act currently provides that the lender of 
securities not be treated as having disposed of the securities 
under these arrangements. As well, payments to the lender as 
compensation for dividends are treated as dividends in the 
lender's hands. While these dividend compensation payments 
are generally not tax deductible, a special rule established in 
1989 allows security dealers to deduct two-thirds of such 
payments. This legislation extends the use of the two-thirds 
rule, thus ensuring that our securities industry remains 
competitive. However, the deduction of these payments will be 
somewhat limited.
<P>
	I can assure hon. members that the government will continue 
monitoring these measures to make certain they can operate 
effectively.
<P>
	Other changes clarify the effect of certain dividend rental 
arrangements and the meaning of securities dealers registered or 
licensed to trade in securities for the purpose of the Income Tax 
Act.
<P>
	In closing, Bill C-70 amends the Income Tax Act effectively 
and equitably. It seeks to better target tax assistance delivered to 
certain business sectors while at the same time broadening the 
tax base and thus protecting government revenues. The 
legislation contained in this bill also clarifies a number of 
important issues related to the act.
<P>
	Given all this, I have no hesitation in encouraging all of my 
hon. colleagues to support this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to speak on Bill C-70. I am pleased because, first, 
I thought the government was going to talk about tax reform in 
Canada with this bill, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the 
Income Tax Application Rules and related Acts.
<P>
	Like many Canadians, I think Canada's tax system should be 
changed significantly, if not completely overhauled. So, I 
thought, perhaps very naively, that the Liberal government was 
going to do its homework. Why was I so hopeful? First, in part, 
because I had read the red book. The red book promised tax 
equity and that those who had taxes to pay in Canada would pay 
them.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	From what I can see, the book has faded. We hardly ever hear 
mention of it. At the start, last year, I remember seeing this book 
resplendent in all its redness on the desks of the members 
opposite. Now, from what I can see, the red is more likely on the 
faces of the members. Some members are looking embarrassed 
at the outcome of the Liberal's election promises.
<P>
	Let us look at what we were supposed to have in Canada. We 
were to have jobs; we were to have tax equity. There are no jobs; 
the jobs we lost were not even replaced. As far as tax equity is 
concerned, we may have it next year, or maybe in two, ten or 
twenty years, from what I can see.
<P>
	It is true that there is a very strong lobby on behalf of those 
who do not want reforms in Canada, those who are benefiting 
from the existing tax situation. I remember a debate on this a few 
weeks ago. One Liberal member naively said that change was 
slow. He himself had proposed a reform, but he knew that 
change was slow because of the strong lobby of the well heeled, 
who benefit from the weaknesses of our tax system.
<P>
	I am delighted to see that a Liberal member who has been in 
the House much longer than I can confirm what we in the Bloc 
already knew. However, Canadian taxpayers really want tax 
reform.
<P>
	If we look at the papers and talk with our constituents, we 
realize that people are not happy with the present tax system. 
Looking at the size of the bill before us, which contains perhaps 
200 pages, I naively thought that the measures proposed by the 
Minister of Finance would be quite substantial, at least as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14027"> 14027 </A></B>
<P>
substantial as the size of the document itself, but I realized-and 
will try to  demonstrate to you-that what the minister came up 
with falls far short of real tax reform.
<P>
	It is not only taxpayers but also experts who are demanding 
changes. Canada's tax system-which over the years has been 
modified by legal precedents and amendments, by new 
regulations, and by various interpretations of the legislation in 
effect-has led to the emergence in this country of various tax 
experts and consultants, who help large corporations and 
wealthy individuals get around the Canadian tax maze to avoid 
paying their fair share.
<P>
	The experts themselves tell us-I read a few newspaper 
articles-that Canada's current tax system is very confusing. A 
mother cat would lose her kittens in such a maze. There are 
various interpretations. There are people who manage to get 
around the system without paying their fair share, simply 
because the tax structure has become so complex that no one can 
find their way around it, except for experts who take advantage 
of this situation by directing work to their firms, which charge 
substantial fees and often engage in lobbying activities.
<P>
	The hope I had has been dashed. This hope, which was 
reflected in the red book, shared by the public and confirmed by 
the experts, has been thwarted once again.
<P>
	For the information of the people listening to us, or the 
colleagues who were perhaps not paying attention and who may 
not have noticed, the bill before us, Bill C-70, implements 
measures proposed by the Minister of Finance in his 1994 
budget. On this day of June 1995, we are here in this House to 
discuss tax measures that were proposed by the minister in 
February 1994. It is obvious that, if we wait for the minister to 
speed up tax reform, we will wait for a long time.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	If we take a look at the clauses now, we could say that the 
minister has made an effort and that at least there will be a few 
amendments to the Income Tax Act that will bring us closer to a 
comprehensive reform. All those who listened to the 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Finance speak before 
me will have realized that this was not the case.
<P>
	What, essentially, do we find in this document? We find a few 
rather trivial reforms which are just a drop in the bucket, when 
what the Minister of Finance should really be doing is delivering 
on the Liberal government's promise of a fairer tax system for 
Canada.
<P>
	So, when we look at these measures, those which, in my 
opinion, have the greatest impact are the provisions exempting 
from tax the interest earned on prepaid funeral arrangements. 
Some Canadians have been more prudent than the governments 
of recent years. Figuring that one day they will die, they are 
prepaying their funeral expenses. These amounts generate 
interest, with the result that the Minister of Finance has devoted 
a great deal of attention in this close to 200 page bill to this 
issue. It is one of the five or six measures in the bill. Funeral 
expenses are tax exempt.
<P>
	There are other proposals for exemptions, such as tax-free 
arrangements for mutual fund corporations. These are also very 
interesting, but we are still talking about people who will not be 
paying taxes. This is perhaps as it should be, but it does not 
augur well for tax credits, and I will come back to this a bit later. 
The bill deals with exemptions for those who invest in mutual 
funds, as well as foreign affiliates.
<P>
	When I saw these words, I said to myself: ``At last, the 
Minister of Finance is going to tackle tax havens''. I saw the 
word ``foreign'' and I said, ``Now we have it, the Minister of 
Finance is proposing a measure on tax havens''. I will come 
back to this shortly. But no, it was merely a question of what 
shareholders are required to report. These are trivialities.
<P>
	The bill also talks about debt forgiveness and objections on 
appeal. Large corporations who object to their assessments will 
have to be more specific. Is it really important for the 
Government of Canada to deal with this issue in the bill now 
before this House and provide for special measures ensuring that 
large corporations file their claims promptly concerning the 
taxes they owe? Certainly, I have no doubt about that.
<P>
	These large corporations include Seagram, Power 
Corporation and all those we keep hearing about during question 
period or bumping into at private dinners hosted by the heritage 
minister. The fact remains that, in view of the situation and the 
need to reform our tax system, it is rather pointless to put 
forward amendments such as these. It figures that the 
government would present them on a Friday, in the absence of 
the Minister of Finance, because we would see him turn redder 
than usual, with embarrassment no doubt, because he is calling 
on the Parliament of Canada to consider such pointless 
measures, when the Canadian tax system needs to be revamped.
<P>
	Tax reform is required in Canada and we will try and take a 
closer look at that. I would like to start by clarifying a point. I 
read in <I>La Presse</I> today the famous annual announcement issued 
by the Fraser Institute. It said that we will be starting to work for 
ourselves next Sunday.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	As you know, the Fraser Institute is a group of right wing, 
ultra-conservative economists funded by unknown sources. In 
fact, I think that we know and perhaps we should say that it is 
backed by large corporations, which stand to profit from 
measures like the ones before us today and certainly claim a tax 
exemption for their contributions to the Fraser Institute.
<P>
	The Fraser Institute calls itself an institute. It may look like an 
extreme right or conservative lobby, but it calls itself an 
institute. They are telling us that every one of us, in this House 
and throughout Canada, has been working for the government so 
far this year, but that we will now start earning money for 
ourselves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14028"> 14028 </A></B>
<P>
	They are telling us that we are overtaxed, that the government 
is rifling through our pockets. You see what I mean. They seem 
to want to have us believe that no one pays for the services 
available in Canada, be it health, education, national defence, 
infrastructure, highways or what not, and they benefit no one in 
Canada. These people come and try to peddle the idea that the 
money paid in taxes by Canadians is actually money being 
stolen from them.
<P>
	Before going any further, I would like to denounce such 
pronouncements. Taxation is a very serious subject that is tied to 
the very nature of democracy. We live in a democracy where the 
government provides services, and these services must be paid 
for by all taxpayers who, through their members of Parliament, 
vote on a budget that will allow the Minister of National 
Revenue to raise, in the form of taxes, the money required to pay 
for these services.
<P>
	I think no one in Canada, except the people at the Fraser 
Institute and their ilk, would criticize this system. We receive 
services, and the government has to pay for the services it 
provides. People are prepared to pay taxes. When they go to the 
hospital or send their children to school or university, they 
realize there are certain costs involved, and they are willing to 
pay their share.
<P>
	They are willing to pay their share, but they want their tax 
assessment to be fair and equitable. The first question is whether 
in Canada as a whole, we are being overtaxed. Should we repeat 
the Fraser Institute's mantra and say it does not make sense, we 
are overtaxed, the government should withdraw from everything 
and should pay no taxes at all? In the end, this would mean there 
would be no more government.
<P>
	When there is no more government, we no longer have a 
democracy but a feudal system. The Fraser Institute and people 
of their ilk want to take us back to the middle ages when 
someone would conquer a territory and be given the title of 
duke, count or prince. He would then raise taxes, not to provide 
services but more often to provide a rich dowry for his daughter 
who was supposed to marry his neighbour, who had also 
managed to impose his rule on part of the population. In the end, 
this is the law of the jungle, and that is not what we have in 
Canada.
<P>
	Are we overtaxed? I will not answer that question, but I will 
make a few comparisons. If we look at the figures and compare 
them with other OECD countries, in other words, the 25 richest 
countries in the world, in 1992, our tax rate was about 36 per 
cent of GDP. That sounds like a lot, but is it really when we 
compare it with the tax rate in other countries? It is easy to say 
we are paying too much, but we have to find out whether we are 
paying too much, compared with what other countries are 
paying. There are no absolutes in economics. Everything is 
relative.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I do not want to insult anyone here who is an economist by 
profession, but in economics, we often realize that everything is 
relative, even the results. We often see economists contradicting 
their colleagues, and in the end, we realize that some economists 
are more accurate in their predictions than others. There are 
certain basic principles that economists ignore at their peril.
<P>
	In the Scandinavian countries, the tax rate is not 35, 36 or 37 
per cent as in Canada, but 45 per cent. That is quite a bit. In 
Germany and Italy, between 40 and 44 per cent of GDP goes to 
taxes. Compared with other countries, Canada is about average. 
This is not the disaster described by extreme right wing parties 
that think government should get out of everything and stop 
providing services in the areas of health care and education and 
let the law of the jungle prevail.
<P>
	These people use a certain ideology based on certain 
principles to mislead the public so that people start to challenge 
the government's right to raise fair taxes.
<P>
	I say that we are about average among industrialized countries 
and that taxation is not the main problem. We have to see where 
the problem is. I think the real problem is that the tax burden is 
poorly distributed in Canada. Some people do not pay enough 
taxes and some people pay too much.
<P>
	This is why I was asking earlier and expecting tax reform. I 
hope my children will perhaps see tax reform in Canada. When 
Quebec becomes independent, we will have an eye on the world. 
We will be reading papers like the <I>Toronto Star</I> and the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I>, and I hope to read that Canada has finally started its 
tax reform.
<P>
	How is the tax base distributed in Canada? With a brief look at 
history, we will discover that taxation is a matter of choice. It is 
a political choice. Someone somewhere decides a tax will be 
levied in one area and not in another. A choice is made.
<P>
	I have consulted a number of books on individual and 
corporate taxes. In passing, I noted that, among the countries in 
the G-7, Canada has one of the lowest tax rates. The members of 
the G-7 are meeting in Halifax. It is a beautiful city that I had 
occasion to visit a few years ago. I reached the same conclusion 
as the Quebec journalists: it is an English city.
<P>
	In 1950, personal and corporate taxes in Canada were 
comparable. The rate was 28 per cent for individuals and 27 per 
cent for corporations. These were the federal tax revenues. Now, 
individuals are taxed at the rate of 48 per cent, corporations at 7 
per cent.
<P>
	As you can see, personal income tax has increased, while 
corporate taxes have decreased, and I am not counting here the 
effect of the GST and the QST. We can see that we have moved 
from a situation in the 1950s where there was a certain balance 
between personal and corporate taxes to today's imbalance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14029"> 14029 </A></B>
<P>
	Our first reaction is to say: ``Tax the corporations''. We will 
talk about this in a few minutes, but, before we look at what is 
going on with corporations, let us look at the situation of 
individuals. There are things worth considering.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I am not necessarily making any proposals; I am trying to 
channel our thoughts to avenues which could be of use to the 
Minister of Finance or the finance committee or the next Liberal 
Party committee in line to issue a red book or a red and green 
book, because I have no idea how to define the colour of the 
Reform members. However, I do feel that, at some point in the 
future, the colour red and the colour of the Reform Party will be 
mixed together. What will be the new colour?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Drab.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> According to one colleague, it will be drab. I have 
the feeling that the next book will be the Liberal Party's drab 
book.
<P>
	There are, I must say, some avenues which are worth 
exploring. Individuals. They are always telling us that we have 
to be careful with personal income taxes because, if we tax the 
rich, they will have less money, less money to invest. We have to 
be very careful. But I think that we still have to look into these 
possibilities. A dollar is a dollar. But, we have noticed that a 
dollar earned through employment is taxed more heavily than a 
dollar earned through capital gains. In Canada, people with 
money and who invest it, pay less tax on the money they earn on 
their investments than people who are salaried and on fixed 
incomes. Go figure. Is a dollar worth a dollar or are some dollars 
worth less than others under the current tax system?
<P>
	Canadians have the impression that the tax scale is 
progressive, that everyone pays taxes. That if you earn $50,000, 
you pay a certain amount and if you earn $100,000, you pay 
twice that. This is not how it works. In 1992, based on figures I 
have seen, 2,000 Canadian taxpayers who had earned over 
$100,000 did not pay any income tax. How can these people not 
have paid tax? It could not be that they hid income from the tax 
people. I am sure that all citizens in that tax bracket are honest 
citizens who would promptly pay any amount owed to Revenue 
Canada. The fact remains that they did not pay any tax. This was 
made possible by all the tax credits, the many credits they could 
take advantage of. There were people investing in real estate, 
and others investing in movies or research. Anyone who had 
money started investing, with the result that a number of them 
ended up not paying any tax.
<P>
	We could say good for them, if they were clever enough not to 
pay tax and were not doing anything illegal, all the better for 
them. I guess we could say that. However, there is a downside to 
that. I had noticed it in my region and I have friends who have 
looked into this whole thing. They are middle class people, 
earning between $40,000 and $50,000 a year, and they were 
wondering why the system was benefiting the rich and not them. 
Lawyers and accountants set up all kinds of limited partnerships 
from which people could borrow in order to invest, get a tax 
deduction on part of this investment and then repay their loans. 
In the end, they managed to divert money from taxation like the 
rich.
<P>
	The downside of this is that, in many cases, the investors 
found that the properties selected by the limited partnership 
were not worth as much as they had been told. So, they lost 
money. They lost money in order to save on income tax. In fact, 
they took money owed the government to pay for services, and 
the only ones who benefited from all this seem to be those who 
set up some limited partnerships or made certain arrangements 
allowing some people to divert money from the taxman.
<P>
	Finally, here in this House, the opposition questioned the 
Minister of Finance about people who had invested in research 
and development for that purpose. In Canada, the motto in tax 
matters is ``save on taxes''. These people, who usually came 
from the middle class, borrowed money to receive tax credits.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	With these tax credits, it is always the same system. People 
take money from the government and manage to get tax credits, 
but the ultimate winner is the initiator of the financial scheme, 
the company that put forward phoney research projects. The 
bottom line is that these people end up with nothing.
<P>
	The Department of Finance straightened some of this out. It 
realized that some of these companies were not seriously into 
research, and the credit was denied. You may say, ``People knew 
that the government could go back three years for all these 
things'', but the fact remains that these people got hooked 
because there is a belief among Canadian people that those with 
money can save on taxes.
<P>
	I think that this is a prime example of a tainted system in 
which people who cannot afford to invest in sectors eligible for 
tax credits are urged to do so through all kinds of scams and end 
up being taken for a ride. I think that the Minister of Finance 
should look at tax shelters and tax credits for an explanation of 
why so many people in Canada do not pay taxes.
<P>
	If this is legitimate and normal, the minister should tell us so 
and, if not, he should take the measures needed to correct the 
situation. I have some figures here. From 1984 to 1992, taxes 
paid in Canada by middle income households increased 6.7 per 
cent, compared to only 3 per cent for households with incomes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14030"> 14030 </A></B>
<P>
of $150,000 and over. Again, it is the middle class which is 
really paying  the tax increases, while those with a higher 
income are taxed less. Some might say: But listen, 6 per cent of 
$50,000 is $3,000, while 3 per cent of $150,000 is $4,500; 
consequently, the rich are paying more. However, this is not the 
way things work.
<P>
	With this system, the rich get richer, while middle class 
people see their taxes go up every year. This is not normal, and I 
think that the Minister of Finance, or a Liberal caucus 
committee, should take a close look at these issues.
<P>
	And now, on to another topic. Recently, during the French 
presidential campaign, I read something about taxes on personal 
wealth. Candidates in France and elsewhere, and this may 
become the case here some day, have to make a statement of 
their financial position. In France, there is a tax on personal 
wealth.
<P>
	It seems that such a tax existed in Canada in 1972, but it is no 
longer the case. We are apparently the only OECD country 
which does not tax personal wealth. Consequently, very wealthy 
families and individuals continue to get richer; yet, the 
Canadian government is not even considering taxing such 
wealth.
<P>
	There are other things too. I will not go back to the issue of 
family trusts. We talked about it during the election campaign, 
and we raised it many times here, during question period. The 
Minister of Finance finally did something about it in this year's 
budget, not last year's budget, which is currently in effect.
<P>
	So, this year's budget includes a provision on family trusts in 
which the minister made some changes to the rules. However, 
these changes will only come into effect in three or four years, 
thus giving time to the tax experts to find another way to exempt 
rich families, not to mention the possibility that a successor to 
the current finance minister could provide another tax shelter so 
that these rich people would avoid having to pay taxes.
<P>
	Consequently, you see rich taxpayers who do not seem to be 
paying taxes when they should. There are people with large 
personal fortunes who never pay taxes on that wealth.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Some people can set up family trusts for the benefit of their 
descendants, maybe not for ten generations but just the same, 
this raises questions.
<P>
	So something can be done in Canada about personal income 
tax. I disagree with what the former president of the United 
States, Mr. Reagan, used to say, that if they stopped taxing the 
rich, the rich would invest. Mr. Reagan tried it, but the rich did 
not invest. The rich went on accumulating their wealth, because 
that is what they do. They do not necessarily invest. And when 
they do, they usually invest with borrowed money, with other 
people's money.
<P>
	As far as corporations are concerned, I think it is obvious that 
the corporate tax system in Canada must be changed, because 
corporations receive extremely preferential treatment. They 
will tell us-and I heard it said this morning by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance-that you 
have to be careful, that corporations must remain competitive. 
So their taxes should not be too high. Their tax burden should 
not be too heavy.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do you know which G-7 country has the highest 
tax rate? Japan, apparently. Would anyone in this House claim 
Japan is not competitive? Competitiveness is not just a matter of 
taxation, it is something else. And people who use being 
competitive as an excuse not to pay taxes are definitely 
misleading the public.
<P>
	We saw a very obvious example of this recently in Quebec, 
where the Quebec government wanted, in fact it still wants, to 
introduce a 1 per cent payroll tax for businesses with a certain 
number of employees, to oblige them to provide vocational 
training. Ghislain Dufour, the Quebec equivalent of the Fraser 
Institute, perhaps not the equivalent because Mr. Dufour does 
not qualify as an institute, and I do not think he is eligible for a 
tax credit, Mr. Dufour said: ``Quebec corporations will be less 
competitive. It will be harder to compete. It does not make 
sense''. A corporation with a payroll of let us say $500,000 
would pay 1 per cent, which works out to $5,000. So the 
corporation is supposed to go bankrupt because it has to pay an 
additional $5,000 for vocational training for its employees?
<P>
	In Canada, corporate taxes are too low. In 1987, 90,000 
corporations did not pay income tax in Canada. Not bad. In 
1991, it was 77,000. Incredible. Granted, some corporations 
may not be doing that well and so they do not pay income tax, 
but I would say that one-third of corporate profits in Canada are 
made by corporations that did not pay taxes. So these are not 
companies with two or three employees that are leading a 
hand-to-mouth existence, these are companies that made a 
profit and thanks to certain measures in the Income Tax Act, 
manage to avoid paying income tax. So this raises a lot of 
questions.
<P>
	It raises a lot of questions for people who have no access to tax 
shelters and who pay income tax on their weekly pay cheques. 
How disgusting. There is also the whole issue of deferred taxes. 
Businesses, billion dollar multinationals established in Canada, 
are able to put off paying taxes from one year to the next through 
tax deferral. There will always be a point where their profits are 
lower, therefore, they will be able to pay less tax, etc. These are 
all things that make us wonder, and that give us the right to 
question the Minister of Finance regarding the legitimacy of this 
system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14031"> 14031 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bloc has also talked about tax havens. The Bloc finance 
critic has raised this issue with the Minister of Finance many 
times. He has asked him questions as Minister of Finance and 
perhaps as a first-hand tax haven expert. It is well known that 
Canada's Minister of Finance stopped managing his own affairs 
when he came to office, got in to politics.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Finance used to be notorious for letting his 
financial affairs be conducted under a different flag than the 
maple leaf. Some companies open up in reputable countries, 
often very old countries, like Cyprus, Malta, Barbados, or even 
in countries quite far south, close to Australia, like Papua New 
Guinea, Panama. There are even Canadian companies which 
have set up shop in these areas. They have offshore subsidiaries 
in places like Cyprus, Malta, etc.
<P>
	There are certainly people in these areas who can afford to buy 
the goods produced by the Canadian factories with subsidiaries 
there. However, I cannot believe, for instance, that all the 
20,000 or 30,000 companies registered in Panama are there for 
the climate, for the location half way between the Atlantic and 
Pacific Oceans, and because this is good for business.
<P>
	We have only to think back to the scandal following the death 
of Mr. Irving, so well known in New Brunswick, who moved 
most of his businesses and who specified in his will that his 
children in Canada would be cut off if they did not set up in tax 
havens.
<P>
	When you are the Minister of Finance and you see Canadian 
companies setting up ghost subsidiaries abroad and you know all 
about tax havens and you do nothing, I think you are shirking in 
your duty.
<P>
	This proves that it is time for a good clean-up, a thorough 
tidying-up of the Canadian tax system. I think we have to review 
the agreements we have with 16 countries on tax rates and other 
tax matters. The official opposition has often called for such a 
review. The minister's reply is that the matter is under 
consideration and, given Canada's competitiveness and the 
current situation, we are in the best of all tax worlds. I do not 
think this is the case.
<P>
	The Bloc will obviously vote against this bill, not because the 
measures are so awful in themselves, they are Canadian 
measures for the Canadian tax system, that is to say they cloud 
the situation a little more, and the system will be muddier and 
muddier.
<P>
	Finally, I think the Income Tax Act is a little like the country. I 
do not want to get into a demagogic diatribe on how Canada's 
situation compares with the Income Tax Act. What is the Income 
Tax Act. It is a heap of tax measures with more measures piled 
on every year. No one has gone through it; no has organized it.
<P>
	People have called for change, and the answer has always 
been no. So now we have a jungle of an Income Tax Act where 
the strongest manage to inch their way through and impose their 
rule and where, often, the people who earn their living and do 
their best are unfairly taxed. I think the government has to 
propose a tax reform. Canadian taxpayers deserve it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly 
the Reform Party will not be supporting Bill C-70 at third 
reading for a number of reasons.
<P>
	With regard to the comments of the member for Jonquière and 
the presentation we heard for the last 40 minutes, I can 
understand completely why the economy in Quebec is in 
trouble. I can understand completely why the credit rating of 
Quebec was downgraded last week.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	We hear the left wing, socialist diatribe about more spending 
by government and about punishing those who have achieved in 
society to the point where they have accumulated some kind of 
wealth to reinvest, have created jobs and have paid a major 
portion of the taxes that often goes to support people who want 
to work on the public purse in universities or at other public 
jobs. Who creates the revenue to pay for those jobs and to 
improve quality of life? Who creates it? Who takes the risk? 
When people take the risk, does the government have a 
responsibility to punish them more, to raise taxes, or to take it 
away from them? Are they bad people in society?
<P>
	The Canadian economy was built on people using their 
initiative, having freedom, having the right to take risks and to 
lose their funds and lose respect in a community within the 
market system.
<P>
	Those members want more legislation. They want to take 
money away from someone else. They want to depress the 
economy. The obvious result is what we see in Quebec. We also 
see the results in Canada.
<P>
	We have had 20 years of governments thinking it could 
improve the economy of Canada by spending more, by 
increasing the level of expenditure. What has happened? It has 
increased the level of debt. Every year we are in a deficit 
position. Today it is out of control. We have inflation that is out 
of control, an issue that I raised in question period today. I have 
not received an answer to that question. We have a dilemma with 
the Bank of Canada. It is going to be very difficult.
<P>
	The Reform Party has an answer which I will talk about today. 
It is time somebody said something. It is unfair that members of 
the Bloc Quebecois hide behind their separatist cloak. The 
people of Canada do not know they have a second characteristic. 
They think they are most likely free enterprisers. Not only do 
they bring to the House separation and the breakup of Canada, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14032"> 14032 </A></B>
<P>
but they bring socialist diatribe into the House that has  ruined 
the country in the last 20 years. We do not need any more of that.
<P>
	I am very disappointed in the words that were spoken. We 
have a free society. The House is a place for everybody to 
present their views. I will always support that. When I do not 
agree with something I have the right to stand and say so.
<P>
	Bill C-70 brings in changes to the 1994 budget, which was a 
disastrous budget for the government. It came here ill prepared 
and presented it to Canadians. We are living with the ill effects 
of its poor planning, its partisan politics when in opposition, and 
its lack of action in the 1994 budget. Unfortunately Canadians 
will feel the ill effects.
<P>
	The legislation is a perfect example of why we need to 
simplify the Income Tax Act and have a flat tax as my hon. 
colleague from Calgary Centre is calling for. We in the Reform 
Party support him.
<P>
	I guarantee that even accountants will find it difficult to 
understand the contents of Bill C-70. Fortunately my colleague 
from St. Albert is an accountant. The other day he addressed the 
specifics in second reading of the bill. I want to spend my time 
talking about the budget from which the bill flows. It was the 
first Liberal budget that unfortunately announced the 
government's plan to add $100 billion more to the federal debt 
over a period of three years.
<P>
	More important, I want to talk about the outcome of the 1994 
budget and its implications for us today. The Prime Minister and 
the government keep insisting things are fine, the economy is 
growing and there is nothing to worry about. If this is the case 
why did Moody's downgrade our credit rating this year?
<P>
	Moody's decided that Canada was a greater risk than when the 
government took office. After 18 months it has not convinced 
any investors in the country that it is serious about putting its 
fiscal house in order. It has presented two budgets in which it 
had the opportunity to announce a medium and a long term 
strategy to bring about deficit elimination and debt reduction. 
The government has failed to do that and has caused all kinds of 
serious implications for the economy.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	It has had almost two years to come up with a plan to balance 
the budget by a specific date, but it has refused to do so after 
many questions by the Reform Party. The only commitment we 
have is that the Liberal government will bring the deficit to 3 per 
cent of GDP. That is an easy one, but it may change. With 
inflation changing and with interest rates doubling, it could 
make it very difficult.
<P>
	What has the government's fiscal plan as announced in its 
first budget achieved to date? Members of government will say 
that it has resulted in economic growth and job creation. 
However the growth has occurred in spite of the government's 
plan, not because  of it, and for the past six months there has 
been no growth at all. Employment levels have not moved in 
months and the economy actually shrank in both March and 
April.
<P>
	The government's soft fiscal policy has had three important 
impacts on the economy. First, it has led to a rapid depreciation 
of the value of our currency. Second, it has forced the Bank of 
Canada to keep interest rates dangerously high. Third, it has 
allowed inflation, which was all but dead when the Liberals 
arrived in office, to pull itself up off the canvas. Once again it 
has become a major concern to investors and Canadians.
<P>
	Let us look at what happened to the currency. When the 
Liberals came to office the dollar was traded at 76 cents U.S. By 
January of this year it had fallen to 70 cents. It has only managed 
to struggle back to the 72 or 73 cent range due to the support 
provided to it by Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen. It 
was not the action of the government. It was the Governor of the 
Bank of Canada who took action to make it happen.
<P>
	However this is not the whole story. While declining only 
modestly versus the American dollar, our currency has done 
much worse versus other major world currencies. Since the 
release of the government's first budget our dollar is worth 23 
per cent less in terms of the mark and 25 per cent less in terms of 
the yen.
<P>
	Why is that bad for Canadians? There are two very key 
reasons. The first is that imports become more expensive. To 
show just how big a difference it makes, our fall versus the yen 
means that a Sony camcorder which cost $3,900 last year will 
cost $4,800 or an extra $900 in one year. The second is that it 
leads to inflation. As we saw in the camcorder example the 
prices of imported goods are jumping rapidly, which places 
upward pressure on the consumer price index. We learned today 
that inflation in Canada is now running at 2.9 per cent.
<P>
	Let us talk about high interest rates. The impact of the budget 
on interest rates has been no better. When the Liberal 
government released its first budget in February 1994 short term 
interest rates were under 4 per cent. It is only in the last six 
weeks that they have fallen below 8 per cent. In other words 
interest rates have doubled in the space of one year. That is a 
record. I would say to the hon. House leader of the Liberal Party 
who spoke today that should be a concern with regard to the 
budget.
<P>
	This is having a significant impact on our economy, 
particularly those sectors which are highly sensitive to interest 
rates. For example, first quarter housing starts fell 18 per cent 
reaching their lowest level since 1982, while housing resales fell 
by over 40 per cent. Automobile sales are also off significantly, 
down 10 per cent from last year's pace. Not only are these high 
rates hurting the private sector, the federal government has been 
the biggest loser having to pay an additional $1.8 billion in 
interest for every 1 per cent of interest increase.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14033"> 14033 </A></B>
<P>
	The consequences were brought home in the government's 
second budget, which showed that debt servicing costs or 
interest payments will rise by $8 billion in the next year to a total 
of $50 billion.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	That $8 billion as an increase almost completely wipes out the 
effect of all of the spending cuts that came from the 
government's program review and carried out by the hon. 
minister who is here with us. That was a good idea but the 
government has not controlled the interest rates and we are in 
trouble.
<P>
	The finance department's Fiscal Monitor that came out this 
week notes that the public debt charges for March were up 27 per 
cent and were $4 billion higher than the year before. This is a 27 
per cent increase, which is very significant.
<P>
	I would like to talk about inflation. That is the newest problem 
facing the economy here today. It results directly from the soft 
fiscal policy announced in the government's first budget. That is 
where the problem is. It is a resurrection of these inflationary 
pressures.
<P>
	In the last year, inflation rose from .2 per cent to the present 
level of 2.9 per cent and it is clearly threatening to escape the 3 
per cent target band set by the Bank of Canada. This means that 
the Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen is facing a very 
difficult decision. If he chooses to support the value of the dollar 
and contain inflation within its 1 to 3 per cent target band, he 
will be forced to raise interest rates. As I mentioned earlier, any 
further increases will hit both the government and the economy 
very hard.
<P>
	On the other hand if his concerns for the economy prompt the 
governor to lower interest rates, then the dollar will continue to 
fall and the inflation genie will escape from the bottle. This in 
turn will lead to higher, longer term interest rates as 
expectations of future inflation are priced into the bond market 
in a vicious cycle in which there can be no winner.
<P>
	I would like to remind members of what happened the last 
time we entered the vicious cycle. It was in the late 1980s and 
early 1990s when the Liberals were in opposition. All through 
this period, the Liberals used the former Bank of Canada 
Governor John Crow as their whipping boy due to his tough 
stand on inflation.
<P>
	As we know, they released him after they came into 
government. They demanded that he lower interest rates to 
prevent the economy from slipping into a recession seems fairly 
straightforward in terms of economic policy. What happened is 
that it eventually did.
<P>
	Whether they realize it or not, the Liberals criticized the 
wrong man. It was not the tight money policy of John Crow that 
caused this recession, it was the chronic deficit spending of the 
former Conservative government.
<P>
	The point the Liberals missed in opposition and are missing 
again now that they are in power is the government has two 
instruments with which to influence the interest rates, inflation 
and the dollar.
<P>
	First, monetary policy as carried out by the Bank of Canada 
plays a very important role but it is not the only player. The 
government must also shoulder some of the burden through its 
choice of fiscal policy. That is the primary instrument which 
must be used to deal with the problems in the country.
<P>
	What happened in Canada under the Conservatives is that a 
fiscally irresponsible government ignored its own 
responsibilities, effectively forcing the Bank of Canada to carry 
the ball single handedly.
<P>
	I am warning the government today to not make the same 
mistake as the Tories. We cannot afford to let that happen. I hope 
the Finance Minister and his colleagues will have enough sense 
to provide the new governor with support in order to keep the lid 
on inflation and to bring down interest rates.
<P>
	If the government does not reverse course and adopt a 
stronger fiscal policy, then we in the Reform Party will not be 
pointing our finger at the Bank of Canada. We will place the 
blame squarely at the feet of the government, which has not 
honoured its fiscal responsibility. My responsibility and my 
colleague's responsibility is to do just that. For the sake of this 
country, I hope this does not become the legacy of the 
government's first budget, the last piece of which is Bill C-70, a 
bill that we will not support.
<P>
	There is still time to change the course. The government's 
second budget began to do this but the job is left to be done. It is 
incumbent on the government to bring about a budget for 
1996-97 which puts in place a plan of deficit elimination and a 
plan toward reducing the debt of the country. If the government 
does that possibly we will have a stable economy, an economy in 
which jobs are created, in which Canadians will be able to risk, 
to invest and to live with their families in a very proper way.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-70. The purpose of 
the bill is to amend the Income Tax Act because of certain 
budgetary measures which were taken.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party vehemently opposed that 
budget. We opposed the budget because we felt it did not go far 
enough. It did not address the situations in the country which 
threaten every Canadian from coast to coast. Canadian jobs are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14034"> 14034 </A></B>
<P>
threatened, their homes are threatened and their social programs 
are threatened.
<P>
	The reason the budget threatened each and every Canadian 
was due to the economic and fiscal irresponsibility of the 
government in not addressing the debt and the deficit which 
increased every year. Furthermore, the budget sought to 
compromise those in our society who are most vulnerable, those 
who cannot take care of themselves and those who are most 
dependent on government largesse.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party proposed the zero in three plan. We 
gave the first half of that plan to the government. We said to the 
government: ``Here is a how to plan''. It was not something 
esoteric, it was a how to plan to bring the economic situation 
under control. We told the government how much to cut and 
where to cut. Did the government heed that? No.
<P>
	We gave the second part of the plan to the government and 
said: ``Here is the product of hard work. Here is the product of 
something which is followed by a great many Canadians. It is a 
plan which is fiscally responsible and sound. It is a plan which 
will address the debt and deficit problem''. Did the government 
listen to us? No.
<P>
	As a result we have the problems of today. Figures came out 
this week that showed the real income of Canadians has dropped 
significantly over the last two years. The Canadian dollar has 
dropped and inflation is rising. As well, the investors of the 
world have downgraded our bonds. Moody's has downgraded 
our bonds for the first time ever. If this is not a harbinger of 
things to come, I do not know what is.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the wool has been pulled over 
Canadians' eyes by a budget which is an illusion. The 
government told us that it is the first government to cut. That is 
true. This is the first government to actually make cuts. Let us 
analyse those cuts.
<P>
	A third of the cuts which were made truly were cuts and the 
government deserves credit for that. However, two-thirds of the 
cuts were made to provincial transfer payments. Whose 
shoulders did they fall on? The provinces. The provinces also 
tax the same taxpayers and at the end of the day it is the 
taxpayers who have to pay.
<P>
	Whether it is the federal government, the provincial 
government, or the municipal government people who work 
hard have a huge amount of their money taken away from them 
to go to the governments which are in difficult financial 
situations. Governments have not recognised the situation they 
are in and continue to spend taxpayers' dollars in an 
irresponsible fashion.
<P>
	I plead on behalf of all Canadians that the government take 
heed and work with us on the problem to develop a sound, 
fiscally responsible solution which is going to help all 
Canadians from coast to coast. That is what everybody in the 
House wants to have. We need a strong, aggressive, forward 
thinking economy that is going to help all Canadians while 
preserving the core of our social programs to ensure that all 
those in Canada who need it will be taken care of.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They owe it to the young people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Yes, that is right, 
they owe it to the young people. This government and previous 
governments have mortgaged the future of Canadians to pay for 
what we have today. That is the height of irresponsibility. The 
young people of today and those who are not yet born are the 
ones who are going to bear the brunt of this most tragic situation.
<P>
	The current tax situation is an unwieldy, ineffective system 
that is bogged down in bureaucratic largesse. All of us here pay 
taxes. All of us see the tax plans. All of us see the forms that 
have to be filled out. How can we see these every year and not 
ask: If we are having a problem with it, is not the rest of Canada?
<P>
	Why does the government not simplify the tax system to 
ensure that it is fair and equitable across the whole spectrum of 
individuals earning money? We must ensure that everybody 
pays their fair share without going through loopholes and 
favouritism within the system.
<P>
	To that end, my colleague from Calgary who is our finance 
critic has just mentioned the flat tax system that we in the 
Reform Party have been speaking about since we were elected. It 
was one of the pillars of our economic and fiscal plan.
<P>
	Essentially the flat tax system would simplify the tax to 
ensure that all Canadians pay their fair share. That is extremely 
important. As we speak to businesses and individuals alike they 
shake their heads and ask: ``How can we deal with this tax 
system, a system that is so unwieldy, so unforgiving and so 
complicated?'' There are many simpler ways of doing it.
<P>
	The GST is another aspect of the tax system that was supposed 
to be revisited. The Deputy Prime Minister stated that if the GST 
was not gone a year after she was elected, she would be gone. 
Unfortunately she is still here. I think she should live up to her 
promises.
<P>
	That is another aspect of the tax system which needs to be 
revisited. I ask and implore members on the government side to 
please listen to business leaders in their communities, not 
leaders of the business community leaders who come to us. Go 
out and walk among the business community/leaders and ask 
them what it is that absolutely frustrates and prevents them from 
maximizing their potential as a business person. They will say, 
nine times out of ten, it is the GST.
<P>
	The second thing they will mention nine times out of ten is the 
unbelievable red tape they have to go through to operate within 
this country. It eludes me why, in a country as rich and as 
potentially powerful as ours, we have to hamstring the business 
community with bureaucratic entanglements.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14035"> 14035 </A></B>
<P>
	I implore the government to look at ways of simplifying the 
taxation system, the bureaucratic red tape and internal trade 
barriers which hamper Canada.
<P>
	The trade barriers in our country hamstring and prevent 
businesses from being the best that they can become. We 
aggressively pursue, and rightly so, international free trade 
agreements like the WTO and previous to that the GATT. It is 
done to help our business communities. That is done on the 
international scene. However it eludes me why on our domestic 
scene we turn around and say: ``No, you cannot do business here. 
We are going to put tariffs there. We are going to oblige you to 
follow these rules and engage in the same type of bureaucratic 
entanglements and anti-free trade rules that we do not follow in 
our export and international endeavours''. It is hurting our 
businesses and people wonder why we are not doing better. In 
part it is because of these internal trade barriers which are 
hamstringing the ability of businesses to do that.
<P>
	When it was elected the government said it was going to 
aggressively pursue the elimination of these interprovincial 
trade barriers. It has only nibbled around the edges and Bill 
C-88 will prove it to the Canadian public.
<P>
	In closing, there are good parts to Bill C-70 and many bad 
parts. We must simplify the tax system. Let us look at the flat tax 
system we want to apply. Let us ensure that we simplify 
expenditures. Let us attack the deficit and bring it down to zero. 
Listen to the zero in three plan of the Reform Party and move 
forward to a strong economy for all Canadians.

	The House resumed from June 9 consideration of Bill S-7, an 
act to accelerate the use of alternative fuels for motor vehicles, 
as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and of 
Motions Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 6.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today in support of Bill S-7, an 
act to accelerate the use of alternative fuels for internal 
combustion engines. With the passage of this forward looking 
legislation, the federal government will assume a leadership 
role in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by requiring 
by the year 2004 the conversion of 75 per cent of its fleet 
vehicles to cleaner burning fuel.
<P>
	The federal fleet consists of 39,000 vehicles that release 
150,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide and over 4,000 tonnes of other 
pollutants into the environment each year. These pollutants 
collect in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. As a 
result of Bill S-7 we will reduce CO2 emissions by 20,000 
tonnes annually and will take positive steps to address the 
greenhouse effect. We will lead by example.
<P>
	It is anticipated that the conversion of government vehicles 
will encourage automobile companies to market vehicles that 
burn renewable fuels and will also increase the number of 
service stations providing alternative fuels. Not that many years 
ago gas stations offering ethanol were few and far between. Now 
they are everywhere. This too will happen with other cleaner 
burning fuels.
<P>
	We have all contributed to the environmental problems we 
now face and it is time to be part of the solution. Bill S-7 will 
allow us as parliamentarians to take positive action to ensure 
that our children and our children's children enjoy cleaner air 
and a healthier environment. We owe this to them.
<P>
	By requiring government vehicles to be converted to cleaner 
burning fuels, Canada will be making a significant step toward 
fulfilling our international commitments to reduce greenhouse 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14036"> 14036 </A></B>
<P>
gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The Liberal 
government is committed to ensuring that these obligations are 
met for the good of Canada and for the good of the world.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	In addition to greening our country, this legislation will result 
in long term savings to Canadian taxpayers. During the five 
years it will take to convert 75 per cent of our government fleet 
vehicles, we will save $7 million. Once conversion is complete 
we will save $7 million every year. This represents direct 
savings to government and direct savings to taxpayers.
<P>
	Bill S-7 is fuel neutral. It promotes the use of ethanol, 
methanol, propane gas, natural gas, hydrogen or electricity. The 
choice of fuels to an extent will be regionally determined based 
on economic factors and availability.
<P>
	The expansion of the use of ethanol is of particular 
importance to me given the benefit it is for the environment and 
as a growing market for prairie grain. Not only is prairie grain 
feeding the world, it is getting the world where it wants to go and 
in a more environmentally friendly way than traditional fossil 
fuel.
<P>
	Ethanol provides an excellent opportunity for economic 
growth and diversification. It greatly expands the market for 
agricultural products thereby increasing farmers' incomes. It 
also provides opportunities for value added development and 
jobs in rural Canada.
<P>
	The people in my Dauphin-Swan River riding are excited 
about the prospects of ethanol production. Groups from the 
towns of Russell and Swan River have approached me about 
possibilities of establishing ethanol plants in their communities. 
They are excited about contributing to the greening of our 
environment and the economic spinoffs for their communities. 
The construction of ethanol plants in rural communities will not 
only boost our self-sufficiency in ethanol supply but will also 
diversify our communities, provide needed jobs and greatly 
contribute to the long term viability of rural Canada.
<P>
	To help our rural communities build innovative economies, 
the minister of agriculture and the environment minister 
announced the biomass ethanol program which will encourage 
investment in the ethanol industry, thereby expanding domestic 
demands for corn, wheat and barley produced on the prairies. 
The biomass ethanol program shows this government's 
commitment to encourage the production and use of renewable 
fuels where it is environmentally sound and economically 
viable.
<P>
	I am pleased with the support that companies like Centra Gas 
in Winnipeg and Ford Canada have given to this initiative. 
Propane and natural gas suppliers have indicated that they are 
prepared to convert suitable vehicles in the government fleet at 
their own expense. These are the types of partnerships we need 
to encourage to work toward environmental sustainability.
<P>
	I am very pleased to offer my wholehearted support to this 
forward looking initiative. It is not often that an idea comes 
about that is good for the environment, good for agriculture and 
good for the taxpayers. In short, this is a win-win proposal.
<P>
	I commend Senator Colin Kenny for his foresight and his 
commitment to the environment. I urge all members of this 
House to support this important legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address 
my amendments to Bill S-7. There are four in number but all 
deal with one subject which is mainly to remove crown 
corporations from the effects of this bill.
<P>
	It is a well known and well developed tradition in this country 
that crown corporations at the basic managerial level should be 
able to operate at arm's length from the political sector. This 
type of interference is totally unwarranted. The companies are 
inefficient enough as it is. If the managers are going to have to 
be constantly looking over their shoulders to see what the 
politicians want them to do, they are going to be even more 
inefficient.
<P>
	There is a basic thrust to this bill which is expressed very well 
in a briefing note I received from I know not where. It says that 
legislation is preferable to government guidelines. That is 
fundamental Liberal policy in just about every sphere of 
activity. This will be about the fifth time in this House I have 
drawn attention to what I consider to be the very basic 
philosophy of the Liberal Party of Canada, that everything that 
is not prohibited shall be compulsory.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	My colleagues are going to address the environmental 
concerns. I will leave that to them, except I would like to state 
that as somewhat of an engineer and scientist, I find there is a lot 
of voodoo science involved in some of the lobby documents I 
have received backing this bill.
<P>
	This is not a black and white situation. Certainly propane and 
natural gas do have some environmental advantages over 
gasoline and diesel, but they also have disadvantages. On 
balance perhaps they are better. Over all, ethanol is undoubtedly 
deleterious to the environment if we consider all of the aspects.
<P>
	I see an hon. member grinning over there. He wants to have an 
ethanol plant in his riding. If we study the scientific literature, 
from a basic, scientific point of view the evidence on ethanol 
does not add up.
<P>
	I have noticed there has been an incredible amount of 
corporate lobbying on this bill. As a matter of fact the corporate 
lobbying on behalf of this bill has been more intense than 
anything which has taken place on the Hill since the halcyon 
days of Dome Petroleum. It is incredible. I have a huge stack of 
papers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14037"> 14037 </A></B>
<P>
If this is such a good idea, if the producers of the conversion 
systems and the people who want to sell propane and natural gas 
have such good products and they are so sure of their position 
here, why should government have to interfere in the 
marketplace to mandate markets for them? This is not the 
business of government; this is the business of business.
<P>
	If they cannot break into this market, albeit a small market, I 
do not know why they are fighting so hard to get it. It is a small 
market. Let them prove themselves, flex their muscles, talk to 
the people who do the purchasing, put on some demonstration 
projects and win the market fair and square in the marketplace 
instead of getting the politicians to do their marketing for them 
and shove it down the throats of the bureaucrats. This is not the 
way government should be run. This is not the way the civil 
service should be operated.
<P>
	I most emphatically oppose the bill. However, if we must have 
it, as it has very clearly become a government bill now, then let 
us at least have my amendments which will permit the people 
who operate our crown corporations to continue the unfettered 
management of these companies on our behalf.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
having listened to the argument just made by the member for 
Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia, I have to deal with 
the point he makes in relation to crown corporations. He says he 
does not want to interfere with the operations of crown 
corporations in implementing this measure.
<P>
	I have to remind the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia that crown corporations are created by acts 
of Parliament. They express the will of the elected 
representatives and of the elected government.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Budgets of the crown corporations are scrutinized every year 
by committees of Parliament. They undergo therefore very close 
examination on the part of the political arm. Therefore there is 
nothing wrong in also asking crown corporations to adopt a 
measure that is economically and environmentally sound.
<P>
	I begin to wonder whether the Reform Party is interested in 
economy and environmentally sound measures. I know for sure 
the member for Comox-Alberni is a very good 
environmentalist. I know also his colleague, the member for 
New Westminster-Burnaby, is a very fine environmentalist 
and has proven that on a number of occasions.
<P>
	Now the moment of truth has come for the Reform Party to 
show its true colours and to demonstrate where it really stands. 
As has been underlined on several occasions in this debate, the 
measure proposed in Bill S-7 to switch the use of fuels from 
fossil to alternative fuels just emerging in the marketplace 
would save the government $7 million in consumption and in 
maintenance terms.
<P>
	That is not a minor feature considering the interest expressed 
by the Reform Party on reducing government expenditures. 
Here is a golden opportunity for the hon. member to demonstrate 
to his constituents and to the House that he means what he says. I 
hope he is not using crown corporations as an excuse for not 
supporting the bill because that would be a very sad matter.
<P>
	The member for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia 
also made a plea for the marketplace to take care of this matter. 
We all know new technologies, new usages and new fuels when 
they appear on the market need some help. That is the intent of 
the bill before us.
<P>
	Why is the bill before us? This is an important consideration. 
It relates to economic savings and we have gone over that a 
moment ago. We have a responsibility in relation to the trend in 
climate change. I am glad to learn the member for Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia is a scientist. He must 
know the scientific community warned about the serious trends 
in climate change and climate warming. These are caused 
mostly because of our dependence on fossil fuels.
<P>
	It would seem only logical, in the public interest and desirable 
that the government seek fuels less damaging in terms of climate 
change.
<P>
	In the case of the fuels proposed in this bill we have an 
alternative approach that will cut in half the so-called 
greenhouse gases, helping the momentum in climate change 
which has attracted the attention of a number of international 
bodies and of a number of leading scientists in Canada .
<P>
	Therefore it seems to me the Reform Party is at crossroads. I 
am sure it will want to demonstrate to Parliament and to the 
public that it means what it says, that it is really concerned as it 
claims at times with economic measures and environmental 
objectives.
<P>
	The bill is well known because of interventions made by 
previous speakers. It demonstrates the time has come for us as a 
society, as consumers, to move away wherever possible and as 
rapidly as we can from our dependence on fossil fuels.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	We are internationally committed to the stabilization of 
carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000, taking the year 1990 
as a base. At the rate we are at now we will reach the year 2000 
with a minus 13 deficit; in other words, we are badly behind 
schedule.
<P>
	In addition to that, in ``Creating Opportunity'' in 1993 we 
made a pledge to Canadian electors that we would reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions by the year 2005 by 20 per cent. This measure 
is helping to move us in that direction and it seems every 
member of Parliament has a great opportunity to demonstrate 
we are taking to heart the public interest and that we want to take 
every opportunity to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on this bill.
<P>
	I cannot agree with the overall need for the bill in the first 
place. However, the amendment would certainly enhance it. I 
will direct my remarks specifically to the bill and whether we 
need it.
<P>
	I believe the bill is an excellent example of how we as 
parliamentarians can get caught up in believing that enacting 
new or revised legislation is the answer to problems we may 
encounter. Making the bill law is an example of how we have 
allowed too much government into our daily lives.
<P>
	The bill's objective is to accelerate the use of alternate fuels 
for motor vehicles, and specifically targets the government 
motor vehicle fleet of approximately 30,000 vehicles. The bill 
then devotes its text to the mechanics of the process deemed 
necessary to achieve a 75 per cent success rate by the year 2004.
<P>
	I shall address my remarks to the main objective, as the 
semantics of the process are irrelevant at this point if one 
disagrees with the main objective and the overall concept.
<P>
	The bill is asking us to make a law based on a verb, to 
accelerate or not to accelerate. The concept of converting 
gasoline motor vehicles to alternate fuels is already in place. 
Activity in the government department toward achieving this 
end is already underway. Therefore to accelerate this activity is 
not a legislative concern but a management concern in the 
government departments and corporations, et cetera, this bill 
includes.
<P>
	We do not need more laws in our lives. We need to improve the 
existing ones in their appropriate jurisdictions to resolve 
problems; if it is a management problem, put the problem there. 
In this case senior management should have a plan for 
converting to alternate fuels and the plan should include the 
number of vehicles by certain dates, be it 2004 or otherwise.
<P>
	Our colleague, the Minister of Natural Resources, has also 
indicated the legislation should empower management or 
bureaucrats to make changes rather than telling them what to do. 
That was in the <I>Hill Times</I> on April 20. In other words, delegate 
the authority to carry out the action to management and then 
expect it to get on with it to achieve the policy as stated by the 
standards.
<P>
	The basic principle of delegation when used effectively 
reduces the number of rules and regulations, laws, et cetera, 
required and creates the necessary direction at the level of the 
department or corporation as a policy and procedure versus 
national law to actually implement the act. By effectively using 
the principle of delegation we succeed in reducing the amount of 
law and government in our daily lives.
<P>
	I am not suggesting this proposal is not an effective action 
toward reducing the greenhouse effect in our environment. I 
agree with the comments made by the Minister of the 
Environment, a member of the Bloc Quebecois and my 
colleague from Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia for 
publicly supporting the concept of converting gasoline motors 
to alternate fuels.
<P>
	I agree legislating this type of action, the converting of 
gasoline motors, et cetera, is in our jurisdiction as legislators, as 
it provides direction for the people of Canada in this regard. 
How it is done or the process to achieve this is a managerial 
concept.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	A law of this nature tells all Canadians Canada is working 
toward this conversion. It provides a sense of direction. The 
marketplace would be aware of this overall objective and we can 
pass this as legislation. How fast it goes should be a 
management situation.
<P>
	It is not our role to legislate the process to be used by 
individuals or groups and in this case government departments 
or corporations. Individuals and groups should be managing 
their own resources, finances and otherwise and developing a 
plan conducive to their own situation to achieve this goal.
<P>
	Bill S-7 is in the realm of management, as I stated earlier, not 
law. Why is it deemed necessary to be concerned about the speed 
at which this is occurring? Obviously there are barriers present 
and the nature of today's marketplace may well be one, as 
resources for alternate fuels are few and far between.
<P>
	By legislating that 30,000 plus government vehicles be 
converted within an eight or nine year period will create much 
more demand on the marketplace and force the issue on it for 
change in existing trends. We are not only legislating 
management techniques for government organizations, we are 
also becoming involved in the marketplace in that we are 
suggesting it change its management practices within the next 
eight or nine years to accommodate the demands this bill will 
put on it.
<P>
	Another concern is the cost factor involved and the effects of 
the time limitations we will have on the budgeting process of an 
organization, not only the actual conversion costs but the 
operating costs. The rationale now is alternate fuels are cheaper. 
If we use the supply and demand principle once we get into the 
process of conversion at some point the cost of that fuel will also 
go up.
<P>
	Bill S-7 will have an effect on several principles or concepts 
considered important in society. The environment is one. Some 
of those concepts are government interference in the 
management process, that is, lack of delegation, government 
interference in the marketplace which relates directly to the 
principle of too much government in our daily lives and 
government entering into the field of free enterprise.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14039"> 14039 </A></B>
<P>
	I agree this accelerating process for conversion would 
definitely contribute toward improving our environment. 
However, I do not see the need for a national law to achieve this 
objective. The appropriate position in senior management 
should send a memo to the appropriate position in purchasing to 
recommend a conversion program within the budgetary 
parameters and considerations, et cetera, of the existing 
vehicles and get on with this conversion through a management 
process versus a national law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, every 
now and again, and not often enough, a nation has an 
opportunity to provide leadership to not only its people but to 
people in other countries.
<P>
	Every now and again its elected political people in the 
democratic process have a golden opportunity to participate in 
that leadership. Every now and again those elected people who 
want to participate in that leadership have to drag along other 
elected people who want to keep the country in the dark ages.
<P>
	We are on the threshold of beginning the energy transition 
from a hydrocarbon energy economy to a carbohydrate energy 
economy. Petroleum resources are finite. Their reserves are 
declining.
<P>
<B>(1400 ) </B>
<P>
	As exploration reaches farther out into more difficult areas, 
the product becomes more and more expensive. At the same 
time, the consumption of these products is increasing, 
particularly when we witness the explosion of industrial growth 
in nations that were considered third world less than a 
generation ago. I refer specifically to China and India with a 
combined population of approximately two billion souls.
<P>
	Therefore, it is essential that we as an industrialized nation 
begin to look seriously at bringing alternative energy forms on 
line. Hence the creation of Bill S-7 to the credit of Sen. Colin 
Kenny who had the vision and has exploited the vision. I am 
proud to stand here today hoping to bring this bill to fruition so 
that we can begin the transition of 75 per cent of the national 
fleet to alternate fuels by the year 2004.
<P>
	That transition will not be limited to just those fuels that are 
named in Bill S-7. Since that bill was written, two more fuels 
have emerged with great potential, not only for the economy of 
western Canada, but also to enlarge the options available to 
individuals.
<P>
	The question was raised why is legislation preferable to 
guidelines. The guidelines have been in place since 1976 and 
nothing has happened. The neanderthals remain in place and 
nothing moves. Obviously it is necessary to legislate.
<P>
	There is one more reason for legislating. Bringing something 
new on stream is a chicken and egg situation. If one does not 
have enough demand for the fuel then the distributors of the fuel 
cannot afford to set up to supply the fuel. The manufacturers of 
the vehicles really cannot afford to retool to supply vehicles that 
will burn alternative fuels. This is the chicken and the egg. 
Therefore, it is necessary to develop a critical mass of 
alternative fuel burning vehicles so the distribution system will 
follow.
<P>
	Because the country is beginning to move in that direction, 
two of our major automobile manufacturers, General Motors 
and the Ford Motor Company, are now in a position to supply 
vehicles to the market which will burn up to 85 per cent ethanol 
or any combination from straight gasoline on up at no additional 
cost. We have an obligation to get the stream started and get 
things rolling.
<P>
	My hon. friend in the Reform Party talked about the 
undesirability of having crown corporations included in the 
conversion process. One crown corporation, Canada Post, has a 
major competitor that advertised it used alternate cleaner 
burning fuels. If I were the manager of the Canada Post 
Corporation I would be clamouring to convert my fleet of 
delivery trucks, vans and whatever to alternate fuels and 
advertise it in order to get the public relations value. Crown 
corporations need to be included.
<P>
	I remember a comment being made when we were in 
committee by someone regarding the conversion of some 
vehicles of the RCMP and how undesirable that would be 
because they needed pursuit vehicles. I had to remind that 
gentleman the Indy 500 which had run two weeks earlier was not 
run on gasoline but on methanol. The idea that some conversions 
produce a little less is just not plausible.
<P>
	I also had the opportunity to tour the Pratt and Whitney plant 
in my riding last Monday. It has already completed all the work 
on burning ethanol in jet engines for the Brazilian government. 
The technology is already in place and all ready to go.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	I know my friend in the Reform Party does not like the word 
ethanol. Somehow it does not have a nice ring to it. He comes 
from western Canada and I would think he would be an 
enthusiastic supporter of ethanol as one of the options which is 
available to us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> We cannot afford it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> My friend says that we cannot afford it. I always 
said that if we had a surplus of it we could drink it.
<P>
	The fact is that all of these fuels, while they may be a little 
more expensive at the present time, will find a niche market as 
times goes by. As production increases in efficiency, the cost per 
unit will decline. When the transition occurs, when the demand 
for petroleum resources puts the prices through the roof, Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14040"> 14040 </A></B>
<P>
will be in the driver's seat and will be able to lead the world  in 
the supply of alternate fuels. It is a natural that will happen and 
we have this glorious opportunity to help it along.
<P>
	We are on the cusp of the future. No longer can Canada be 
looked at as a country we can put a fence around. We have to 
think of our resources as being marketable to the world. We have 
to think of where the demand is going to go as the population 
accelerates, as it will in the next 25 or 30 years, and we will have 
to be ready for that. This is one bill which will get us ready for it 
and put us in a position of leadership.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill S-7, an act to 
accelerate the use of alternative fuels for motor vehicles.
<P>
	Bill S-7 proposes that by the year 2004, following a 
scheduled phase in period of over seven years, 75 per cent of the 
39,000 federal government fleet of vehicles will be fueled by 
alternative transportation fuels.
<P>
	I agree with the environmental intent of the bill and I agree 
that we need to take action against priority air quality concerns. 
Our party supports the efforts to reduce pollution, but these must 
balance economic with environmental considerations. I believe 
that there are other more economical and effective solutions 
available than those proposed in Bill S-7.
<P>
	As my colleague before me has said, there has been an 
unprecedented effort to ram this private member's bill through 
the House. I have to ask: Why is that so?
<P>
	If the government supports the legislation, then why is it not 
putting it through itself? Why does it take a Liberal senator to 
initiate the bill? When approached by the sponsor of the bill no 
minister in the government was prepared to sponsor the 
legislation. Again, I have to ask why.
<P>
	There appears to be a controversy between the Minister of the 
Environment who appears to support the concept of the bill, and 
the Minister of Natural Resources who does not come out in 
support at all. The Minister of Natural Resources has expressed 
concerns about the government not incurring unnecessary and 
unreasonable short term costs which push up the deficit and that 
government still needs to understand the economic as well as the 
environmental implications of fuel conversion.
<P>
	Obviously the bill does not have the full support of the Liberal 
caucus. That is why it is coming in through the back door. I have 
to ask myself: Why is it not receiving the support of the 
government? There have to be a lot of reasons and they need to 
be answered before we support the bill.
<P>
	The Reform Party strongly supports the principle of market 
forces. I do not support the principle used in the bill of pushing 
the market as Bill S-7 would have us do. We are talking about a 
considerable number of vehicles, 30,000 in fact. The precedent 
of government interference in market decisions is unwarranted 
and unwanted and  the bill is a direct attempt to manipulate the 
marketplace by mandating government vehicle conversion to 
natural gas.
<P>
	Government purchasing agents are hired to make the right and 
the best decisions possible for government purchases. 
Environmental and economic considerations are supposed to be 
taken into account when decisions such as fleet purchases are 
made. If the legislation is as good as the Senator claims and if 
the environmental and economic benefits are so obvious and 
certain, then why must it be legislated? Are these managers not 
paid to make the decisions themselves? Why is it necessary to go 
over the mangers' heads and mandate these purchases and 
conversions? Something is not right here.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	Alternative fuel vehicles can be purchased openly on the 
market today. There is no need for the heavy hand of government 
to attempt to manipulate the market in any particular direction.
<P>
	Canadian energy policy is best served through the open and 
fair operation of market forces to manage energy development, 
production and consumption in an efficient manner which 
should be subject to standards established to protect against 
risks to human health and the environment.
<P>
	Mandating the use of alternative transportation fuels and 
vehicles is inappropriate as it restricts the consumer from 
routine economic choices which are fundamental to a successful 
market economy.
<P>
	The Reform Party is fundamentally opposed to subsidization 
within the marketplace and alternative fuels require major 
subsidies in order to be competitive in the transportation sector.
<P>
	All alternative fuels are exempt from the 10 cents a litre 
federal excise tax. Provincial road taxes are also reduced or even 
not applied to alternative fuels in most provinces. Alternative 
fuels could not survive in the marketplace today without these 
government subsidies.
<P>
	I am also concerned about the bill because I do not believe 
that mandating fuel choices will achieve its proposed economic 
and environmental objectives. Mandated or subsidized use of 
alternative transportation fuels comes at a high cost to Canada's 
economy and is contrary to the government's stated goal of 
reduced government expenditure and deficit reduction. 
Government and taxpayers are penalized twice in the bill, first 
through subsidies and second, in forgone tax revenues.
<P>
	If the principles of Bill S-7 were applied to Canadians at large 
with mandated use of alternative transportation fuels with 
current subsidies, it would be at a high cost to Canada's 
economic base because of loss of government revenue. If the bill 
were applied to 10 per cent of Canadian vehicles it would cost 
taxpayers over $730 million in lost revenues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14041"> 14041 </A></B>
<P>
	If the policy does not make sense in the private sector, then 
why should it be applied to the government? I am sure there are 
other policy options available to the government that will help it 
achieve the environmental intent of the bill in a manner that can 
demonstrate that the government is using best practices to 
achieve its policy goals.
<P>
	An examination of the bill shows that there will be 
significantly higher costs and marginal benefits achieved by 
mandating alternative fuels. For example, the relative time 
required to get a payback on a vehicle converted to alternative 
fuels needs to be looked at much more closely. Bill S-7 defines 
alternative fuels as fuel that is less damaging to the environment 
than conventional fuels, including ethanol, methanol, propane, 
natural gas, hydrogen or electricity.
<P>
	When we are speaking of alternative fuels we are referring to 
several different formulations and vastly different 
environmental effects. Some alternative fuels such as 
compressed natural gas and propane offer advantages in air 
quality over conventional fuels. However, the advantages of 
compressed natural gas are minimized when used as a 
transportation fuel. Compressed natural gas is less convenient 
than gasoline because of its limited range and the fact that it has 
to be stored in heavy, bulky storage tanks. Compressed natural 
gas vehicles are also more expensive to own and operate than 
gasoline vehicles.
<P>
	Liquefied petroleum gas is also a cleaner burning fuel but it 
does not contribute to reduced emissions in any significant way 
because it has a limited overall supply and like compressed 
natural gas it requires bulky storage tanks.
<P>
	When we think of alternative fuels, many confuse it with 
environmentally friendly forms but this is not always the case. 
Some alternative fuels are actually more environmentally 
damaging than conventional or reformulated fuels.
<P>
	For example, the production of ethanol which uses corn or 
other grains is more environmentally damaging in its production 
than gasoline. Electric vehicle technology may be 
non-polluting itself, but the environmental effects of the energy 
source for production of electricity, whether it is nuclear, hydro 
or fossil fuel, has to also be brought into the equation.
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	Environmental impacts associated with after market vehicle 
conversions which currently dominate alternative 
transportation fuel applications have not been favourable in 
comparison with ordinary gasoline. The environmental 
attributes of alternative fuels must be assessed on a lifestyle 
basis of both the vehicle and the fuels.
<P>
	Significant emissions can occur in the extraction, processing 
manufacturing and distribution of alternative fuels. This bill 
attempts to force the hand of the market to make alternative 
fuels more competitive in the transportation sector rather than 
allowing purchasers to drive the market through need and 
demand.
<P>
	I am concerned by some of the claims associated with the bill 
that it will save taxpayers money. These claims are false. On the 
one hand the bill claims to save upwards of $43 million in fuel 
over five years and $15 million the year after. This sounds pretty 
good. If it were true I would wonder why the government had not 
implemented this many years ago.
<P>
	The bill is being rammed through using the guise that it will 
be good for the environment when really it is the gas companies 
that stand to make billions of dollars.
<P>
	I cannot support the bill because of the attempt to manipulate 
the market and the fuzzy economics that do not add up to the 
program that will benefit Canadian taxpayers.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure, as official opposition critic for parliamentary 
reform, to speak on Motion No. 24 regarding the appointment of 
a special joint committee of the Senate and the House of 
Commons to develop a  code of conduct for parliamentarians. I 
will address three points.
<P>
	I will start with the issue of committee membership, as it 
seems very important to me. Second, I will give the whole 
historical background to this effort on the part of governments to 
try to introduce a code of conduct for parliamentarians, an effort 
going back over almost 20 years. Finally, I will touch on the 
present context in terms of ethics, which obviously leads us to 
believe that all this is nothing but window dressing.
<P>
	In fact, the motion put forward by the government House 
leader regarding a Canadian parliamentarian code of conduct is 
nothing new in the history of parliamentary government and 
even democracy in the western world.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	The fact that this government wants to appoint a special joint 
committee of the Senate and the House of Commons to develop 
a code of conduct is another manifestation of the Liberal 
tradition of giving the appearance of having a clear conscience 
publicly, while continuing to scheme behind the scene.
<P>
	Before getting into what this Liberal code of conduct is really 
about, I would like to call the attention of the House to a specific 
point. The fact that eight senators and 14 members of Parliament 
would be appointed to this committee is sheer nonsense to me.
<P>
	How can the government have the nerve, the gall to table in 
this House of elected representatives of the people, a motion to 
appoint a joint committee, which would include senators, to 
develop a code of conduct for parliamentarians of this Canadian 
democratic institution?
<P>
	The Liberal government's attitude is revolting. To appoint a 
committee on parliamentary ethics which would include 
non-elected senators violates the most elementary principle of 
western democracy. The public knows that the Senate is an 
archaic and useless institution whose sole purpose is to reward 
friends of the regime, whether Liberal or Conservative, so that 
they will do some partisan work for the government or for the 
interests which they represent.
<P>
	I will simply say that senators can continue to work and 
practise their profession or calling. As you know, a senator 
recently joined a prestigious law firm.
<P>
	We deplore the fact that the Bloc amendments, which oppose 
the presence of senators on the committee, are bluntly rejected 
by the government. Again, senators are not elected 
representatives. The government's attitude shows once again 
that its motion is just a joke and that the Liberal Party of Canada 
is antidemocratic and does not care about the public.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14043"> 14043 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bloc has always been opposed to the existence of the 
Senate, a position which is supported by a large number of 
Canadians. Given the extremely hard economic context, a debt 
exceeding $550 billion, as well as the current unemployment 
and poverty problems in Quebec and in Canada, the amount of 
$42.6 million allocated to that committee could be used to 
stimulate the economy and create jobs.
<P>
	The Fathers of Canadian Confederation defended the 
appointment of senators on the ground that members of the 
Upper House had to be independent. Indeed, considering that 
they do not have to be elected by the public, that they are 
appointed until the age of 75, which is no small job security 
given how precarious jobs are these days, and given that 
unemployment is so high in Quebec and in Canada, one would 
think that senators deal more or less at arm's length with the 
government. On the contrary, the members of the upper 
Chamber have always been more interested in playing party 
politics than in fulfilling their more proper role as impartial 
legislators.
<P>
	It bears repeating that senators are appointed on a strictly 
partisan basis and that the party in power is itself trying to take 
over control of the Senate by appointing a greater number of 
senators. A large number, close to 50 per cent, of the senators 
recruited by the Prime Minister have political experience, and 
most of the rest have performed valuable services for the party 
in power. Everyone knows that it is a snug retirement haven for 
politicians and others who have always supported the interests 
of the Liberals and Conservatives in the House of Commons and 
who were always there to serve Canadian big business.
<P>
	And the Liberal Party of Canada talks about parliamentary 
ethics; it is a disgrace to democracy and the Parliament of 
Canada.
<P>
	Having said that, I would like to look at another aspect of the 
question of a parliamentary code of conduct, and that is conflict 
of interest. There is no obligation to divulge the pecuniary 
interests of a member of the House of Commons. However, 
section 21 of the Standing Orders of this democratic institution 
provides that no member is entitled to vote upon any question in 
which he or she has a pecuniary interest, and the vote of any 
member so interested will be disallowed.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	If I am reminding this House of this basic rule of conduct 
governing the conduct of Canadian parliamentarians, it is 
because the events of the past few years, in particular those 
involving the conduct of this government, have raised serious 
doubts about the Liberal government's political will to establish 
a code of conduct which would really bring total transparency to 
the management of public affairs.
<P>
	This is a very important issue. The waffling done over the past 
30 years by the two parties in power regarding the 
implementation of a law really governing the conduct of elected 
representatives would indicate that there is no real political will 
to change things. For example, in 1973, the federal government 
published a green paper, ``Members of Parliament and Conflict 
of Interest'', in which it proposed to group and extend the scope 
of the rules which existed at the time. This green paper was 
studied by a committee of the House of Commons and by a 
committee of the Senate and both made many recommendations.
<P>
	Two years later, on June 10, 1975, the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections tabled its 
report on the green paper. In general, it approved the provisions 
and recommended a few amendments. Two years later, on June 
26, 1978, Bill C-62, the Independence of Parliament Act, was 
tabled in the House of Commons complete with new regulations 
for the House of Commons and the Senate. It died on the Order 
Paper when Parliament was dissolved on October 10, 1978.
<P>
	However, there was a new beginning. On October 16, 1978, a 
slightly changed Independence of Parliament Act was 
reintroduced as Bill C-6. The accompanying Rules of the House 
and of the Senate were tabled in the House on October 30, 1978. 
The bill was referred to committee on March 8, 1979, but there 
was no ensuing action and the bill died on the Order Paper when 
Parliament was dissolved on March 26, 1979.
<P>
	At the end of the Liberals' term of office, on July 7, 1983, a 
federal study group was set up to examine the principles and 
rules governing conflict of interest and their evolution and to 
decide whether the issue should be dealt with differently.
<P>
	The report did not appear until May 1984. These people are 
unbelievable Mr. Speaker; they are constantly carrying out the 
same studies over and over! That report was entitled: ``Ethical 
Conduct in the Public Sector'', and was known as the 
Starr-Sharp report.
<P>
	Another government, other political practices. On November 
25, 1985, the Conservative government asked the Standing 
Committee on Management and Members' Services to consider 
the appropriateness of setting up a register of members' 
interests. As part of its work, the committee was to decide 
whether it was appropriate to disclose the remuneration 
members received for sitting on the board of directors of a 
public or private firm or for performing other duties or 
occupying other positions in various organizations. After 
consulting the members of all parties, the Liberals, the Tories 
and the NDP-the committee concluded that there was no need 
to set up such a register and that existing legislation on 
members' conflicts of interest was sufficient.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14044"> 14044 </A></B>
<P>
	And the saga continues. In February 1988, Bill C-114, 
Members of the Senate and the House of Commons Conflict of 
Interest Act, was given first reading.
<P>
	In September 1988, the legislative committee on Bill C-114 
met three times, but was unable to finish considering the bill 
before Parliament was dissolved, on October 1, 1988.
<P>
	In November 1989, the scenario was repeated with the first 
reading of Bill C-46, Members of the Senate and House of 
Commons Conflict of Interest Act. This bill was essentially the 
same as Bill C-114, with a few minor changes. This bill died on 
the Order Paper when Parliament was prorogued on May 12, 
1991.
<P>
	November 1991 marked the first reading of Bill C-43, 
Members of the Senate and the House of Commons Conflict of 
Interest Act. This bill was almost identical to the bills I have 
already mentioned: Bill C-114 and Bill C-46. And then, the 
same old story, the bill was immediately referred to a Special 
Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	In March 1993, first reading of Bill C-116, the Conflict of 
Interests of Public Office Holders Act, which included 
amendments to the Parliament of Canada Act. Finally, in June 
1993, a report from the Special Joint Committee of the House of 
Commons and the Senate recommended that Bill C-116 be set 
aside. You can hardly take this process seriously! The same day, 
a similar report was tabled in the Senate. Bills C-43 and C-116 
died on the Order Paper, upon dissolution of the 34th Parliament 
on September 8, 1993.
<P>
	The process is a political masquerade and shows the 
controversy that exists around a code of ethics for Canadian 
parliamentarians. All this is necessary to make the Liberals feel 
good about themselves and as a sop to democracy in the 
Canadian federal system.
<P>
	Now what? We start over. Throughout the 1993 electoral 
campaign, the Liberal Party of Canada was saying that ethics 
should figure strongly in its mandate. It also said that in 1973. In 
the January 1994 speech from the throne, the government said it 
attached the greatest importance to integrity and wanted the 
people's trust. What a dream.
<P>
	However, as regards conflicts of interest, the most important 
element in a code of conduct and ethics, the ethics counsellor, 
appointed by the Liberal government, still reports to the Privy 
Council, has no independent investigative powers and continues 
to report to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Liberal Party's red book provided that, and I quote: ``The 
integrity of the government is put into question when there is a 
perception that the public agenda is set by lobbyists exercising 
undue influence away from public view''. Recent events have 
shown that the entire Liberal strategy on a parliamentary code of  
ethics, confirmed by the government motion before us, is simply 
window dressing.
<P>
	Thus, the Broadcasting Act, which comes under the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, carries no weight in the face of the 
powerful lobby of Power DirecTv, headed by André Desmarais, 
son-in-law of the Prime Minister. The Liberal government has 
even reached the point of defending ideas dear to the hearts of 
Brian Mulroney's Conservatives and is becoming the advocate 
of North America wide competition. In reading the releases 
from the Minister of Canadian Heritage one can only bow to the 
strength of the Power lobby and kiss federal democracy 
goodbye, because money is king.
<P>
	We should be concerned by the pettiness of our institutions 
and some of our political representatives. Not only does the 
government mock its own legislation and renounce the CRTC, 
which is responsible for implementing it, but it takes measures 
retroactively, preventing Expressvu from starting up its service 
in September. All this in the name of competition. Meanwhile, 
the ethics counsellor of red book fame is sleeping in the Prime 
Minister's waiting room. After only 17 months in power, this 
government already has a long track record attesting to its lack 
of openness.
<P>
	In addition to the previous examples and the government's 
mediocre record for introducing legislation establishing a code 
of ethics for parliamentarians, you will recall that, on 
September 26, 1994, Canadian Press reported that, according to 
documents obtained under the Access to Information Act, 
lobbyists arranged more meetings in the months prior to the 
tabling of Bill C-43, which was passed on May 8, while others 
vowed to go to court should the law force them to disclose their 
public and political relations.
<P>
	In this case as in many others, the lack of transparency 
prevented the public from learning the extent and nature of 
lobbyists' representations with regard to Bill C-43. Ironically 
enough, lobbyists managed to influence the law aimed at 
limiting their influence. That takes some doing.
<P>
	Worse yet, according to Mitchell Sharp himself, the Prime 
Minister's senior consultant on ethics matters, even if Bill C-43 
had already become law at the time talks were held on 
privatizing Terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson airport, the public 
would have been none the wiser.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	The majority report on Bill C-43 tabled by the Liberals 
reflects a faint willingness to oversee lobbying activities and 
ensure that the management of government is as open as 
possible. The government's attitude in that regard shows that, 
once again, the Liberals are using double talk on the issue of 
ethics. They are only trying to make themselves feel good and to 
score points with the electorate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14045"> 14045 </A></B>
<P>
	While the Government House Leader is tabling a motion 
calling for the establishment of a special committee responsible 
for developing a code of conduct for parliamentarians, behind 
the scene, this very government is flouting the most basic rules 
of democracy by favouring friends of the Liberal party and 
governing on behalf of the financial establishment and big 
business in Canada. How could we not want to leave this place of 
political scheming?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, as the official opposition, feels that, to 
restore the integrity of our democratic institutions, we must first 
do away with the futile commitments of the past 20 years, which 
mislead voters. We must also ensure that the management of 
government is as open as possible, in order to eliminate grey 
areas and assure the people that public policy decisions are 
consistent with their general interests and not those of the 
lobbyist friends of this Liberal federal government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the rules 
governing the conduct of members of Parliament are as outdated 
as they are widespread.
<P>
	The Parliament of Canada Act, the conflict of interest code, 
Beauchesne's, the standing orders and House procedures all 
contain guidelines for the appropriate conduct of MPs. For years 
governments have talked about consolidating all these different 
rules into one code of conduct while at the same time bringing 
them up to speed with the realities of governing in the nineties, 
realities that could not have been imagined at the time when 
these rules were written.
<P>
	Since 1973 consecutive governments have championed the 
issue of a code of conduct, yet not one significant piece of 
legislation has ever been passed. From Trudeau to Mulroney 
task forces were set up, special committees were struck, and 
reports and bills were written, all in the name of establishing 
ethics guidelines for MPs.
<P>
	While in opposition members of the Liberal government were 
highly critical of the Tories for their legislative inaction. The 
following question by the Liberal whip in 1993 is clearly a case 
in point:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister and it concerns the 
government's so-called commitment to ethics in government. In February 1988 
the Tory government introduced a conflict of interest bill and has allowed it to 
die twice on the Order Paper. Given that nearly five years has past since then, is 
the government, in its dying days in office, ready to commit itself again to 
conflict of interest legislation?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Liberal whip was criticizing the Mulroney government 
for its failure to pass legislation regarding its 1985 throne 
speech promise to create a parliamentary ethics package.
<P>
	Today, 10 years after this Mulroney promise, members of the 
House are again addressing the issue of parliamentary ethics, 
this time in the name of a Liberal motion; not a bill, not a 
discussion paper, not a white paper, but a motion that calls on 
members of the House of Commons to appoint a special joint 
committee of the Senate and the House to study and develop a 
code of conduct for politicians. The committee composed of 
seven members of the Senate and fourteen members of the 
House of Commons will travel across Canada and once again 
hear how the government should hold its representatives 
accountable.
<P>
	The 22-year history of the development of ethics guidelines 
for members of Parliament is as long as it is uneventful. In 1973 
the President of the Treasury Board, Allan MacEachen, a 
Liberal, tabled a green paper entitled ``Members of Parliament 
and Conflict of Interest''. Among the issues addressed in the 
69-page report were problems associated with conflicts of 
interest, corrupt practices and government contracts. Potential 
solutions and sanctions for these problems were also proposed. 
The document was studied in the committee of the House of 
Commons as well as in a Senate committee but was never 
debated in the House.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	In 1978 legislation relating to the green paper, Bill C-6, was 
tabled but was left to die on the Order Paper. Five years later, in 
1983, Prime Minister Trudeau set up a task force to study 
conflicts of interest for MPs as well as public sector ethics. A 
comprehensive report was produced but like so many reports 
commissioned by the House nothing became of it.
<P>
	In 1987 the Ontario Supreme Court found that former cabinet 
minister Sinclair Stevens had breached the Canadian conflict of 
interest rules on 14 different occasions prior to his resignation in 
1986. As a direct result the Mulroney government introduced 
conflict of interest Bill C-46 for MPs, which unfortunately once 
again died on the Order Paper at the end of the parliamentary 
session. A similar conflict of interest Bill C-112 was introduced 
in the next session. It too died on the Order Paper. Again the 
Tories introduced legislation, this time Bill C-43 which was 
along the same lines as its predecessor. It too died on the Order 
Paper.
<P>
	The pattern which has developed is incredible. A code of 
conduct is studied, legislation is drafted, introduced in the 
House, and after months of sitting idle it is finally dropped. 
Study, introduce, drop; study, introduce, drop.
<P>
	None of the bills was ever really debated. They went from 
first reading to the Order Paper and that was it. It was as though 
the Tories kept the bills around to point at in case one of their 
MPs got caught with their hands in the public cookie jar.
<P>
	As a result of their failed attempts, and I use the word 
attempts loosely, the Mulroney government created a special 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14046"> 14046 </A></B>
<P>
joint committee of the House of Commons and the Senate to 
study the issue of conflict of interest. Does  it sound familiar? It 
should. That is exactly what the Liberal government now wants 
to do.
<P>
	A lengthy study of ethical issues confronting politicians was 
conducted by the committee. Witnesses were heard, testimony 
was given, and a 60-page report was submitted to the House and 
Senate. The report made 14 principal recommendations for a 
code of conduct and among them listed compliance obligations 
for politicians, post employment restrictions, criteria for 
negotiating government contracts, the need to create an 
independent jurisconsult or ethics counsellor, disclosure 
obligations for politicians, conduct for inquiries and possible 
sanctions, and Criminal Code provisions in relation to bribery, 
influence peddling and breach of trust.
<P>
	These are just some of the 60 pages of recommendations made 
by the special joint committee to Mulroney's government in 
1992. At the time the Liberal whip was a member of the 
committee. His official title was government operations critic 
but in commenting on the special joint committee report he 
wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The challenge for Canadian legislators-is to ensure that such reports as this 
are not allowed merely to gather dust on a bookshelf.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Needless to say, like all previous ethics initiatives and despite 
what the Liberal whip said the report gathered more than just 
dust as it was completely buried. At the time the Liberal whip 
was obviously frustrated by that fact and on February 17, 1993 
he moved a lengthy supply day motion which read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemns the government for its continued failure to 
establish and to adhere to a clear and high standard of public sector ethics, for its 
incessant inability to function within the framework of existing legislation, 
guidelines and standards, and for its reluctance to bring forward strict new 
codes and legislation with regard to conflicts and other public ethic matters.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That motion applies today to the government.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you have sat in the chair and you have heard our 
questions over the last month or two. The government was 
self-righteous when it was on this side of the House. Now look 
at what is happening. Look at the Minister for Canadian 
Heritage: dollars for contracts dinner and personal intervention 
on radio licence renewal. Look at the minister of public works 
and the highway 104 diversion of funds. Look at the Minister of 
National Revenue in cahoots with the Minister of Justice who 
helped fire a law firm with years of drug prosecution experience 
in favour of an inexperienced firm that contributed heavily to 
his campaign. Those matters are all well documented and were 
brought out during the last three weeks in question period.
<P>
	What about the ethics counsellor, the Maytag repairman? He 
reports directly to the Prime Minister rather than to Parliament 
as promised in the red book.
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	If a code of conduct said that you make an election promise in 
writing, signed by everybody and everybody campaigns to get 
here to do that, what would happen if they broke their promises? 
I just wonder how they would handle that in this joint 
committee. This ethics counsellor is never asked to look into 
anything, from the Perez affair to the Liberal family compact.
<P>
	The appearance of conflict of interest is overwhelming, and 
there are definitely sufficient grounds for actions on what I have 
pointed out. If the Liberals do not apply the rules that we have 
now, then why in heaven's name create more rules under the 
guise of a special joint committee? They will not follow them 
anyway. It is a sham on the Canadian public.
<P>
	In his usual verbosity, the Liberal whip criticized the 
Mulroney government for its failure to establish an ethics code 
during its mandate. During debate he chastised members of the 
government because ``six years of waiting for conflict of 
interest rules is long enough, and that shows a complete lack of 
interest in the ethics on the part of the Tory government''. He has 
been in the government now for two years and we do not even 
have anything on the floor except a motion to form a joint 
committee once again, doing the same old thing as the previous 
governments.
<P>
	On that day, the Liberals did more than just criticize the 
government. They offered some ideas and solutions that they 
felt could be implemented right away. This government, when it 
was in opposition, had some good ideas, some concrete 
suggestions. One of these ideas was the establishment of 
non-partisan nomination and confirmation procedures for order 
in council appointments such as the officers of the House, 
deputy ministers, heads of crown corporations, citizenship court 
judges. Have they done this? No.
<P>
	A second idea was the establishment of a central registry of 
awarded government contracts under which the details of any 
government contract awarded should be open to public scrutiny. 
Have they done this? No.
<P>
	A third idea was the elimination of registration fees for tier 
one and tier two lobbyists and that they should be required to 
disclose in a public register major expenses and fees with 
description of the lobbying activity and most importantly what 
political body they are lobbying for. Have they done this? No. 
Could they do it? Yes. They could do this, but no, let us set up 
another expensive, exciting, expletive joint committee.
<P>
	These are just a few of the recommendations the Liberal 
members made for an improved code of conduct for MPs. It is 
quite clear that these were not off the cuff ideas but well thought 
out initiatives made by a party that had witnessed eight years of 
Tory corruption. I hope we do not have to sit here for eight years 
of Liberal corruption.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14047"> 14047 </A></B>
<P>
	With this special joint committee, the Liberals are now saying 
that everything that was said in the past, all the ideas and 
initiatives that were to be followed through on, if only they had 
the chance, are all history. Kaput. They say one thing on this side 
of the House and once they get over there they do the other.
<P>
	Why is it that we cannot just sit down in this House and write 
out a code of conduct that is acceptable to all parties? Why must 
we spend thousands of dollars for another series of committee 
meetings and setting up the overhead to send senators and MPs 
all over to listen to witnesses, only to find out what we already 
know? We already have it done.
<P>
	We have two previous Liberal ethics initiatives-they are 
now government-four Tory bills, countless discussion papers, 
and a 60-page report on the conduct for MPs. Why do we not just 
dust some of these off, and look in the book, find out what they 
said and pass something?
<P>
	Again I quote the Liberal whip from 1993, when he attacked 
the Tory government for its failure to pass an ethics bill: ``Does 
the member actually think that it is reasonable after five and a 
half years of delay to have had nothing happen yet? It has been 
six months since the unanimous report of the committee, and 
nothing has happened yet.''
<P>
	If this joint committee ever does file a report, how many years 
will the government let it sit on the shelf collecting dust? Does 
the Liberal whip think it is reasonable for the Government of 
Canada to examine the issue of political ethics for 23 years with 
no results and then ask the taxpayers to fork out for yet another 
group to study the issue?
<P>
	Heck, he can write the bill himself for all the work he has 
done. But do you know what, Mr. Speaker? The Prime Minister 
is no longer listening to him. Give us a break. Ring the bell and 
ask everyone to bring a pen and a paper and we can have this 
thing written in a day.
<P>
	If the Liberals want to talk about reasonable, then I suggest 
they acknowledge the fact that this House has more than enough 
information to establish a code of conduct without any road 
show.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, it is apparent from today's debate that the 
Liberal government, like the Tories, does not have the intestinal 
fortitude to enact major reforms to the code of conduct for MPs. 
Like the Tories, it is in their best interests to bury the issue in 
committee, and I will tell the House why. When political parties 
are in opposition in Canada one of their primary objectives is to 
try to limit the power and authority of the government, hold the 
government accountable, point out incompetence and always 
question the integrity of the government. That is when you are 
on this side of the House.
<P>
	On the other hand, the government always tries to perpetuate 
its own power by denying and/or ignoring opposition scrutiny, 
as is the case in this Parliament. Any increase in scrutiny of 
governmental affairs means a decrease in its authority in that 
particular area: health, revenue and taxation, public works. 
What is good for the goose is not always good for the gander, as 
the Liberal whip likes to say. And what is good for the Liberals 
in opposition is no longer in their best interests in power. It is 
sort of a power paradox.
<P>
	All members have to do is look at the facts. They speak for 
themselves. In opposition the Liberals harped on the Tories for 
their failure to establish an effective code of conduct for MPs. 
They made some constructive suggestions in debate, in reports, 
in articles and endorsed the last report of the special joint 
committee. Did they invoke it? Did they bring a bill forward? 
No. They wanted to ignore it and do the work all over again.
<P>
	As the Liberal member for Edmonton Southeast stated, ``I 
would like to see the recommendations of the special joint 
committee enacted''. The fact is, the recommendations were 
never enacted and the Tories were booted out of office. All of a 
sudden the Liberals, the party of integrity, became the 
government. And what has happened? They have lowered the 
definition of integrity.
<P>
	What happened to the ethics report they endorsed? What 
about all the proposals they made to increase the scrutiny on 
members of the House? What about all the criticism they gave 
the Tories for not acting immediately? Why are they not doing 
what they said they would do in opposition? At least when Prime 
Minister Mulroney was on that side and a minister got into 
trouble or gave the appearance of a conflict of interest, the 
minister stepped aside. Now we have that case and the minister 
is not stepping aside, nor has the Prime Minister asked him to 
step aside.
<P>
	Like all previous governments, the Liberals realize they 
cannot possibly give away the kind of power that was suggested 
in opposition. Instead they give out small tokens and establish 
needless committees like the one we are debating today, which 
will not accomplish a darn thing.
<P>
	The Liberals have done nothing to increase scrutiny over 
order in council appointments, an issue they were adamant about 
in opposition. As a matter of fact, they used an order in council 
to create another possible conflict of interest over the direct to 
home satellite TV business.
<P>
	To quote the Liberal whip in 1993, my favourite witness on 
the topic, ``The only thing we have had is an order in council 
review process that gives no power to a committee, not even the 
power to make a recommendation to the House of Commons''. 
What has changed since then? The problem still exists. Why do 
they not just fix it? They have been in office for two years, and 
what have they done? Nothing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14048"> 14048 </A></B>
<P>
	The same can be said about Liberal inaction to introduce 
legislation that would open up the government contract process. 
In fact, on Wednesday, May 31, we heard that the president and 
vice-president of the riding association of the Minister of 
National Revenue were awarded contracts. Now the Liberals are 
going to bury all this in a special joint committee, which I 
guarantee will not report back anything new to the House in the 
area of political ethics or code of conduct initiatives. The Prime 
Minister will point out how great this committee is when it is 
nothing more than a dog and pony show and a waste of time, 
effort, and money.
<P>
	This government is no better than the Tories when it comes to 
legislating a code of conduct for politicians. The creation of this 
committee is a déjà vu of how Mulroney kept ethics on the back 
burner.
<P>
	The Liberal whip has been sitting there devouring each and 
every word I am saying here today. He wrote down his ideas in a 
1991 discussion paper entitled ``Public Sector Ethics and 
Morals''. In this paper many questions are raised on the issues of 
government advertising, government contracts, order in council 
appointments, lobbyists and whistleblowing.
<P>
	The Liberal whip then went on to write an article in 1992 
entitled ``Members' Interests-New Conflict of Interest Rules 
for Canadian Parliamentarians''. How much more study does 
the Liberal whip have to do on this issue? How much more? This 
is getting ridiculous.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	We have here the people, the skills and the information to 
write out a code of conduct right now. The member opposite has 
the ability to make a tremendous contribution to this. He has 
studied it to death. He has read it to death. Why in heaven's 
name would the Liberal whip then want to have a joint 
committee to do all this work all over again when he has spent 
years on it already? Does he want to spend another year on 
another joint committee to come up with the same conclusions, 
the same recommendations he has already made? I challenge the 
federal government to just do it.
<P>
	This motion is going to pass. Since the government wants to 
do another review, this time the Reform Party will be there to 
hold it accountable to actually bring a bill to the House and pass 
a code of conduct. Reformers object to this joint committee 
because of the senators, but we will work toward giving 
Canadians what they should have-politicians with integrity 
and a new code of conduct bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am trying to digest Motion No. 24 and my 
thoughts range from somewhat confused about the purpose of 
this motion to anger.
<P>
	Let me talk about the confusion first, because I am a little 
confused about what the Liberals believe. What does this 
Liberal government believe? What kind of rocket science do 
they really think is needed to do things that  are good, right, and 
honest? Those are fundamental characteristics of integrity. Yet 
this government, despite the numerous studies, commissions, 
inquiries, investigative bodies that have tried to determine what 
is the right thing to do when one becomes an MP or a 
government, is missing some basic points: good, right and 
honest. That is not rocket science. That is what we are taught by 
our parents when we are kids, when they are trying to groom us 
into becoming responsible adults: do things that are good, right, 
and honest.
<P>
	It is unbelievable that after over a hundred years of this 
Parliament being in operation we have a government that wants 
to find out how to restore and keep the trust of the Canadian 
voters. Let me save the government a whole lot of time. I want to 
give it five very simple suggestions. It will save the committee 
time. It will save a lot of MPs and senators time. Here they are, 
and they are free. I will repeat these after and I will send each of 
the Liberal members a memo on this. The first one is do not lie. 
The second one is do not cheat. The third one is do not steal. The 
fourth one is do not reward your friends with taxpayers' money. 
The fifth one is if any member of Parliament does this, that 
member them out.
<P>
	Therein you have a code of conduct in the first four points and 
the last one is a deterrent. That is not rocket science. I did not 
need a committee to come up with those points. This 
government does not need a committee to come up with ideas on 
how to be a good, honest member of Parliament. This 
government does not need a committee to know how the 
Canadian voters regard politicians at a slightly lower level than 
used car salesmen or lawyers-with all due respect, some used 
car salesmen and some lawyers.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	In the last 15 years the level of respect for politicians and the 
level of trust that was felt by the Canadian voter have severely 
deteriorated. In this 35th Parliament we not only have a job to 
run the country to make sure the economy, the social programs 
and everything else are going to run smoothly, we also have a 
profound obligation to begin to restore the trust of the electorate 
which is missing.
<P>
	I have heard it said time and time again that the only reason 
our current Prime Minister looks so good is that he followed the 
Mulroney Tories who were so bad. In my opinion our current 
Prime Minister has a lot of latitude but because of the way this 
government is running things and because of some of the things 
which have happened since this 35th Parliament convened, 
people are starting to wonder if this government is just another 
wolf in sheep's clothing. Some hon. members have already 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14049"> 14049 </A></B>
<P>
talked about them but it is worth going over some of the very 
disparaging things which have happened.
<P>
	There is the Minister of Canadian Heritage's now infamous 
$2,000 a plate dinner and the subsequent perception of his 
rewarding his friends with government contracts paid for with 
taxpayers' money of course. We have talked about the monopoly 
status awarded to Expressvu and the ties between Power Corp. 
and the Prime Minister. The list goes on and on.
<P>
	Most recently there has been the appointment of a legal firm 
in Vancouver. Lawyers were engaged by the government to 
prosecute drug cases but they had no previous experience in 
dealing with the prosecution of drug cases, a very serious crime. 
In prosecuting a drug case in particular, a lot of factors are 
involved, including the gathering of evidence by the police and 
putting it together by the crown which is most important in order 
to win the case. The evidence is clear that the lawyers from the 
legal firms recently appointed by the Minister of Justice had no 
experience in this area. However they did qualify for the 
appointment because one happened to be the president of a 
Liberal riding and the other was a fundraiser for the Liberals.
<P>
	The Canadian public was fresh from a Tory regime in which it 
completely lost trust in the leader of our country and they 
elected the Liberal government whose red book was trumpeted 
at every occasion. It promised to restore integrity, trust and 
honesty to government.
<P>
	When Canadians think about those promises, about the way 
the red book was flashed around for everyone to see and then 
they see those things happening, they ask: ``Who can we 
believe?'' They get pretty discouraged. Even some people who 
did not vote for me come into my riding office and say they 
thought the Prime Minister was going to change things. They 
thought the Liberal government was going to bring back some 
form of honesty to government. They are very disappointed.
<P>
	Now a joint committee of MPs and senators is going to be 
formed to try to rediscover life in so far as honesty and integrity 
goes.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am not going to speak as long as my hon. friend 
who just spoke. I do not have the sense of humour he has about 
this. It is a very serious subject.
<P>
	At the end of the day and most recently when walking home at 
11 or 11.30 at night we might ask ourselves: ``What on earth am I 
doing here?'' We hear about some new revelation of conflict of 
interest the government has and we remember why we are here. I 
am here because I was so disgusted with the way politics were 
run in this country that I wanted to come here to do something 
about it. I am going to try, but at the end of the day if nothing 
changes in this House at least I can say that I tried.
<P>
	I want to go back just for a moment and review those points I 
made at the beginning. This government does not need a 
committee to understand the things that are good, right and 
honest. We do not need a committee because those things are 
fundamental in how we develop character. Any member of 
Parliament who does not possess those characteristics does not 
belong in this place.
<P>
	Free of charge for the Liberal government, let me go through 
it again. Do not lie. Do not cheat. Do not steal. Do not reward 
friends with taxpayers' money. Those are the four very 
condensed codes. The deterrent is that if any of those are broken, 
they should be thrown out of this place. That is free for the 
Liberal government and free for every member of this House.
<P>
	We do not need a joint committee of senators and members of 
Parliament to try to discover some nirvana being dreamed up by 
the government, some field of operation that is so clouded no 
one can understand it. Do not lie. Do not cheat. Do not steal. Do 
not reward friends with taxpayers' money. That is all that is 
needed and honesty and integrity will return to this House once 
that is accomplished.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the points I was going to make on this motion have 
been admirably expressed by my colleagues before me.
<P>
	We are talking about Motion No. 24 which is part of the 
process in carrying out Bill C-43. This motion deals with the 
creation of another committee to study the parameters for a code 
of ethics for MPs. When we consider the historical activity this 
topic has been subjected to over the years, we cannot really 
commend it surfacing again even though the need is very 
predominant. However, we cannot say it is a step in the right 
direction or give congratulations that we are actually addressing 
this. It has been around too long. The matter has been put 
forward so many times with no action resulting from the process 
in the past. The reputation of this topic is such that one wonders 
if we mean business or if it is a filler that is just going to be 
brought in again, discussed for a bit and then allowed to die.
<P>
	Considering that we come from all walks of life, ethics is a 
moral topic that we are dealing with. We all have different value 
systems. The existing rules from the various sources we receive 
direction from are very general so that they are subject to all 
kinds of interpretations depending upon one's value system. The 
consequences over the years of all those sorts of variables have 
resulted in the general public not trusting or believing in the 
integrity of members of Parliament and senators and it is time 
that we address this.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14050"> 14050 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	I really question whether we need to set up another joint 
committee. Certainly all the guidelines and actions that have 
happened in the past which have set precedents should be 
correlated. We should study the present code of ethics or 
conflict of interest situations to see what we have and try to 
tighten them up so that we have less interpretations of what the 
actual situation is. Then we can see if we need to take this further 
or at least get back to the public for input.
<P>
	This has gone through a number of studies. Possibly all that is 
needed is to gather together what we have and with the members 
of the House and the other place get on with setting a code of 
ethics versus travelling the country spending many dollars to get 
input from people who have been here in the past.
<P>
	We have had an example which should be considered. If this 
motion is passed and the committee is put together we could use 
the 35th Parliament as an example from the point of view that we 
have 204 rookies. We are all learning. When it comes to what is 
ethical and what is not ethical the first thing we discovered was 
that we were never off duty. Everything we do is viewed by the 
public. One is always an MP. When does our personal life begin 
or even come into being here? One always seems to be an MP.
<P>
	When talking to learned people who have followed this 
through the years, it absolutely boggles the mind the kind of 
things that can get you into trouble. They can seem very 
innocent. These sorts of things should be defined. It would be 
very nice if we could go somewhere, look at the ethics and come 
up with an interpretation that would at least provide a standard 
or average for what MPs and senators believe. Right now it is all 
over the ballpark.
<P>
	We work hard. We spend a lot of time working. We are very 
concerned about the country. Yet we get ourselves into positions 
of trouble and there are no guidelines to help us. We should be 
providing some sort of rules with tighter interpretations. If it 
means another committee, then that is the way to go. I certainly 
do not want to see it die. The reputation of this topic is poor. Let 
us try to do something about it.
<P>
	We do not have to go out and be subjected to bringing more 
people in. We have the data here. Let us put it together and come 
up with something.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am almost honoured to be one of the last speakers of 
the week. It is interesting to address Motion No. 24 which arises 
out of the provision contained in Bill C-43, the Lobbyist 
Registration Act.
<P>
	This motion is for the creation of a joint House and Senate 
committee to establish a code of conduct for MPs, senators and 
lobbyists and I have to say that an ethics code is a worthwhile 
effort which must be pursued.
<P>
	Let us look at the pursuit of that. I have a very interesting pile, 
not a prop, of parliamentary documents on my desk which show 
that there has been interest in this subject for years and years and 
where is it getting us? I have here ``New Conflict of Interest 
Rules for Canadian Parliamentarians'', by the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. Good show.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	I have here Bill C-116, which was first read in the House of 
Commons in March 1993.
<P>
	I have here Bill C-43, conflict of interest guidelines for 
parliamentarians, dated June 1992, the Hon. Senator Stanbury 
and Don Blenkarn joint chairmen.
<P>
	Here is another one from the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell entitled ``Public Sector Ethics 
and Morals: A Discussion Paper'' dated October 1991.
<P>
	Then there is Bill C-43, dated November 1991, an act to 
provide for greater certainty in the reconciliation of the personal 
interests and duties of members of the Senate and the House of 
Commons, to establish a conflict of interest commission and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts.
<P>
	These show real interest on the part of the House over the 
years to say let us do something about the ethics around here.
<P>
	There was Bill C-46 in 1989, Bill C-114 in 1988, and 
``Ethical Conduct in the Public Sector'' by the Hon. Michael 
Starr and Hon. Mitchell Sharp, a book written in May 1984.
<P>
	Then there was Bill C-6 in 1978. How far back do we need to 
go to show that there has been real bona fide interest by both 
Houses on the subject matter of ethics?
<P>
	There is the little green book by the Hon. Allan J. MacEachen, 
which was written in July 1973.
<P>
	There it is. Years of evidence saying that something must be 
done. Here we are in 1995 and again we are hearing declarations 
of great intent. We really must get at it now. This is the time to 
get at it.
<P>
	I will compliment the government for the initiative which 
says: ``Let us do something about ethics''. However, my note of 
caution concerns the recent actions of the government. The 
words are fine. What are its actions? I do not think the actions of 
the government meet the lofty rhetoric.
<P>
	Since the government came into power, which is now 
approaching two years, we have had many examples of what I 
would call less than ethical behaviour. We had the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage interfering with the CRTC in the matter of a 
radio licence application for a constituent. We had the same 
minister lunching with movie moguls in Hollywood at the same 
time the Seagram takeover of MCA was being negotiated. Now 
we have that same minister engaged in a dinner for dollars affair, 
which has clearly placed him in an apparent conflict of interest.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14051"> 14051 </A></B>
<P>
	If these ethical breaches were confined to just this one 
minister one could conclude that he was simply misguided, 
ill-informed or just plain incompetent. However, the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage is not alone in this fall from the ethics 
bandwagon.
<P>
	We are all aware that currently the auditor general is 
investigating a situation involving the diverting of $26 million 
in highway funds. In this instance the Minister of Public Works 
and Government Services has benefited politically, not 
financially I am sure, by seeing the money go from a busy and 
deadly stretch of the Trans-Canada highway to a seldom used 
tourist trail in his Nova Scotia riding.
<P>
	We have also seen the justice minister awarding contracts for 
crown prosecutors to highly placed Liberals, some of whom 
have connections to the revenue minister. While it is commonly 
accepted that the awarding of such legal contracts is based on 
partisan politics or downright patronage. The government 
promised it would do business differently. It promised to break 
with politics as usual in favour of a more open and honest 
process. Has that promise been kept?
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	These are a few examples of some of the less than ethical 
behaviour of government ministers. I could go on at length but 
time is limited and it might be of more use at this time to review 
exactly what the government had to say on the issue of ethics 
during the election campaign and look at the promises it made.
<P>
	The now infamous red book, dead book, states: ``The most 
important asset of government is the confidence it enjoys of the 
citizens to whom it is accountable. If government is to play a 
positive role in society, as it must, honesty and integrity in our 
political institutions must be restored''. These are wonderful 
words.
<P>
	Similarly, the red book promised to appoint an independent 
ethics counsellor who will report directly to Parliament. Has the 
government met this promise or its overall commitment to 
restore honesty and integrity? On the issue of the promise of an 
independent ethics counsellor reporting to Parliament, the 
answer is very clearly no. The counsellor is not truly 
independent, as he is beholden to the Prime Minister and he is 
certainly not free to report directly to Parliament.
<P>
	On the general issue of restoring honesty and integrity, I also 
submit the government has failed. A quick look at the 
newspapers these days will provide evidence of this fact. The 
Ottawa <I>Sun</I> on June 13 in an editorial entitled ``arrogance'' 
slams the Prime Minister over his handling of the latest debacle 
involving the heritage minister: ``For a party that campaigned 
on the premise of restoring ethics and integrity-the Grits sure 
have a funny way of going about it''.
<P>
	Ottawa Citizen columnist Greg Weston summarized the 
government's code of conduct on June 11 in the following 
manner: ``Thou shalt do nothing that lands thee in jail. Other 
than that, boys and girls, have fun at the trough''.
<P>
	Columnist Sean Durkin has also questioned the integrity of 
the government: ``Day by day, the Liberal government is acting 
and sounding more like the Mulroney government of old''. 
Hardly a ringing endorsement of the red book pledge to restore 
honesty in government.
<P>
	From today's Ottawa <I>Sun</I>, Robert Fife, page 12, talking about 
the ethics councillor:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Wilson has been silenced and the role of the ethics counsellor has turned into a 
farce. The sole reason that Chretien has stubbornly refused to fire Dupuy is to 
show that he is different from Mulroney. He wants to be able to boast that he hasn't 
had to fire a single minister to scandal unlike the dastardly Tories.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Instead, what he is doing by defending Dupuy is demonstrating that he is every 
bit as bad as Mulroney when it comes to ethics.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In fact, he is worse.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At least Mulroney would do the right thing and remove ministers who did 
wrong from the cabinet table, albeit only after concerted pressure from the 
opposition benches.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clearly these examples show the government has neither the 
will nor the intestinal fortitude to truly divert from its politics as 
usual policy. This is one of my big concerns about this motion. It 
may look good on paper but it is obvious the government is not 
serious about the issue of ethics.
<P>
	Maybe I should be fair and clarify the statement. It is obvious 
the Prime Minister is not serious about the issue of ethics. I add 
this clarification because the member for York South-Weston 
has publicly urged the Prime Minister to ban the type of 
fundraisers that have landed the heritage minister in hot water.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member says this would be an important move to 
restore integrity to politics. He is quoted in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I>, June 
12, as making the following comments about such practices: 
``They are buying access. There are always IOUs attached. You 
have to be pretty naive and deaf, dumb and blind to think 
otherwise''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's top personal adviser is quoted in the 
same paper: ``Cabinet ministers must separate business from 
fundraisers. Some cabinet ministers are not following conflict 
of interest rules''.
<P>
	I stated at the start of my address that I believe this motion has 
some merit. As I have illustrated, allowing the government to 
control this process is like allowing the fox to guard the 
henhouse. Surely it is not in the best interests of restoring public 
faith in the integrity of politicians to appoint politicians and 
lobbyists to draft a serious code of conduct. To me such a 
process would be an immediate conflict of interest.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14052"> 14052 </A></B>
<P>
	I also question the value of involving unelected, politically 
appointed patronage hacks in the process. Appointed senators 
have little if any legitimacy in the democratic process and 
therefore should not participate in what we are trying to do here. 
The public must have full access to and involvement in this 
process. This is the only way to restore integrity and ethics in 
government.
<P>
	To accept this motion is to accept the Prime Minister's ethical 
code of hear no evil, see no evil. Surely no one in the House can 
find that acceptable.
<P>
	The overall intent of the motion is good. I support the intent 
but I have lots of reservations with the process. We must find a 
way to include the public. We must severely limit or eliminate 
the role of politicians and lobbyists in the process and we must 
insist that the ethics counsellor be free to report directly to 
Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been listening to the debate unfold this 
afternoon and have seen five or six inches of various reports the 
House has done on ethics over the last few years.
<P>
	I have been very blessed in my life to have more than one 
mother. One of my mothers is my Jewish mother. She comes up 
with little pearls of wisdom we refer to as chicken soup for the 
mind.
<P>
	Once when we were talking about ethics specifically in 
business she said ethics is simply doing the right thing even 
when you know no one is looking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has 
been really interesting this afternoon as we have listened to this 
debate in talking about the whole issue of ethics, particularly the 
number of reports.
<P>
	There has been report after report starting as far back as the 
report of Senator MacEachen dated July 1973. There is all of 
this information. As has been pointed out by my colleagues, why 
are we having another committee? Why are we doing this?
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Why do we not simply assimilate all of the information, put it 
together if we need to and come forward with a plan in the next 
couple of weeks, instead of months or years?
<P>
	Surely with all of the work put into this process thus far we do 
not need to have more input. Particularly instructive to me is the 
amount of involvement reported that the government whip has 
had in this process. The member has had input and input. Is he 
really so short of things to do as the government whip that he 
needs to have a make work project to have more input into this 
process?
<P>
	This is a joint committee. I will refer with respect to the other 
place. I will not play games. We are talking about the other place 
being a place where people are appointed fundamentally on the 
whole basis of patronage. What has it done for the existing 
Prime Minister? What has it done for the party currently in 
power?
<P>
	We have a very interesting situation at this moment as we all 
know. Because the Conservatives had power for a period of nine 
years, the Liberal government is having some difficulty getting 
certain pieces of legislation through the House, not the least of 
which is Bill C-69, and certainly when we get to the gun control 
bill, Bill C-41 and hopefully Bill C-85, they will be slowed 
down over there so Canadians can really see what the 
government is up to.
<P>
	Nonetheless, the point is the people in the other place have 
been appointed on the basis of patronage and we are having a 
joint committee with them to figure out what is wrong with the 
whole parliamentary system based on patronage. It seems to me 
things are slightly out of order.
<P>
	We came to the House with 52 members of Parliament in 
October 1993 whose electors at that time thought they were the 
best people to represent them. I think of the member for 
Ottawa-Vanier who used to sit across from me. What does the 
government do? It has a place it needs to fill. Why did it put him 
there? Why did David Berger suddenly resign his seat to work 
for the Prime Minister? It was to get the labour minister here.
<P>
	There is the whole issue of manipulation of the political 
system by the existing party. It talks about transparency. It is 
very transparent. The government has absolutely no concern for 
the dollars of the ordinary Canadian taxpayer when it will force 
a byelection in order to fill the place of patronage to accomplish 
certain political objectives.
<P>
	Furthermore, there is no direct accountability by the people in 
the other place to the people of Canada. Let us assume every 
member in the other place is honourable. Let us create that as a 
basic assumption. The point is still not one person in that place 
has direct accountability to the people of Canada. We have 
accountability to the people of Canada by coming here on the 
basis of an election. Why in the world will the government not 
get serious, including this whole debate? Why will it not get 
serious and start to do something about making the other place 
accountable on the basis of getting the people over there 
elected?
<P>
	There is no question that could be done. Reform Senator Stan 
Waters was the first and only elected member of the other place. 
It can be done. The existing premier of Alberta and the 
Government of Alberta brought forward legislation that created 
a situation in which there could be an election for the Senate. 
Again, the Liberals could have done exactly the same thing 
when they got their own bag person to be appointed to the  other 
place on the basis of patronage. Just as easily as not, they could 
have gone through a legitimate election process and started to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14053"> 14053 </A></B>
<P>
legitimize the other place rather than just having people there on 
the basis of sheer patronage.
<P>
	I am in support of this motion on the basis of the fact that we 
will perhaps get some movement forward on the issue of ethics 
within the government, although there is some question about 
the existing government on that basis, nonetheless we can 
always hope. The point I am driving at is that when we ask 
people who are in a place of patronage to be involved in a 
process of talking about ethics and patronage, it just does not 
make any sense. If a commission has to be formed, I would see it 
as being the responsibility of those of us who are elected to this 
Chamber who have the confidence of our constituents.
